They told me they would get back to me prior to the weekend and now it's Saturday evening and I haven't heard from them.

I'm getting a little anxious now but I don't want to sound too desperate. Should I send them an e-mail? The position is supposed to start on June 3rd and it's getting pretty close."
26zxwu,4,2014-05-31,PowerPoint Tips for Consulting Interns Looking to Succeed On the Job,TaiCroon,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/26zxwu/powerpoint_tips_for_consulting_interns_looking_to/,"First off, remember that your KEY function as a new hire or intern, is to make your boss look good! Why? Because the better your boss looks, the more experience they are going to pass along to you, and the more likely they are to staff you on better projects (which looks good on your resume).

If you're working in consulting, you are going to be creating large PPT decks to pitch business and create client deliverables (these are not Steve Jobs decks).

Here are three tips that will help you stand out from day one (I've included YouTube links to videos which include specific examples if you're interested):

#1: Never settle for the default formatting: that is what most people do...and exactly what consultants do not...always aspire beyond the default formatting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrxQUNmmYhg

#2: Break up your bullet points and make them visually engaging: content heavy decks require large amounts of information synthesized into bullet driven information…that's just life. If you want your project to fly, don't settle for boring lists of bullets. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qrhLaFv6_Y

#3: Highlight your point Visually: nothing is worse than a content heavy slide without a clear point. Make sure you make your specific point in the title AND highlight that point visually within your layout. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHf1AYqrk1Q

There is obviously a lot of other things to learn, but these three guidlines will get you started on the right foot.

Good luck!"

But I think I encountered a new problem.

On Thursday, I'm using my computer as normal. No problems. My monitor is connected through HDMI from the graphics card, and that was the way I would play audio.

On Friday, I traveled by car for a few hours with the computer. I have an internship at a college that I'm working at over the summer and they housing me in a dorm.

When I set up my computer, I notice something odd. In the ""Playback devices"" under sound, my monitor doesn't show up as connected. The video is fine, just its not detecting audio. 

I did some basic troubleshooting. I used a different cable, same result. 

I hooked up my laptop to my monitor to see if it was a monitor problem. Nope, played audio just fine.

So I think it's pretty safe to say that its the graphics card. Any suggestions on where to go from here?

I recently took an internship in another country for 5 months, so we were long distance. I just got back 3 weeks ago and he's being incredibly overprotective. He's always had jealousy/insecurity problems, so I'm surprised we made it long distance.

Since I've been back he's been freaking out about everything. I saw him the first 2 days I got back. After that, I wanted to see my friends and family who I missed too. He said I didn't care about the relationship and is getting mad if I don't text back for a few hours. I'm moving into a new apartment and starting summer classes, so things have been hectic. I've explained this to him but he continues to get angry.

We went out with his friends and he completely embarrassed me. I found out he had been lying about smoking, so I brought it up with him. (He's had other problems in the past with other substances). I don't mind if he smokes, but I'd like to know. He told me (voluntarily) that he didn't. Anyway, I brought it up and he said it was no big deal and he just lied so I wouldn't be disappointed in him. I left his side for an hour last night and he made a scene in front of his friends. He called me from the location we were at and said how I was ignoring him. He made a scene in front of everyone saying how I was the worst girlfriend ever. Advice?? I'm at my last end.

Ken Jennings looked up from his coffee towards his Secret Service detail. ""Yes?""

""Sir, I need to immediately escort you to Horsepower.""

Fuck. Horsepower was the Secret Service's code name for the nuclear-hardened bunker that lay 300 meters beneath the White House. This could only mean that the proverbial shit had hit the fan.

""What's this all about Jim?""

""Codes only from now on Sir. Please."" 

""Ok fine, what's this all about *Blowtorch*?"" The agent was visibly distraught, despite training, and the President didn't like the codename bullshit.

""You'll be advised once you are secure Sir. Time to move.""

Like speaking in a foreign language, the agent proceeded to rapidly speak into the microphone hidden in his sleeve. ""Citadel is secure. Leaving Cloverleaf. Have Patroller prepped and ready to go wheels up, ETA eleven minutes. Trail Breaker en route to Acrobat. Blowtorch, secure Pavillion and Pacemaker and move to Buckeye via Playground, Dog Pound being method. Kneecap on standby. Out.

""Ji... Blowtorch, please explain all that to me.""

""Need to know basis Sir, move now.""

And with that Jennings was rushed out the door of his home into the waiting motorcade. Seated inside was another Secret Service agent, his Press Secretary Ron Ziegler, and his Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird. Both looked disheveled.

""Ok guy's, what the hell is going on??"" Jennings practically yelled.

Melvin coughed, ""Sir, Potus is incapacitated.""

""What the hell do you mean??""

""I mean as of a few minutes from now, you will be the acting President of the United States.""

Just like that sound inside the limousine seemed to be sucked out, and all Jennings heard was ringing.

""Sir? Sir, are you alright?""

Ken could vaguely see Ron's hand waving in front of his face.

""Wha? Yes, I'm fine."" He had to catch his breath though. ""What happened?""

""Potus has been kidnapped. They were en route to Companion when they were hit. Bamboo was wiped out.""

Ken could hardly breathe. ""Is Barack ok?""

""We don't know. One group is claiming responsibility though and so far Cartwheel confirms.""

""Who.""

""According to intelligence, a sect of religious nut jobs out of Kansas. The Westboro Baptist Church. It appears they've been stockpiling munitions and arms for quite some time now.""

""Dear God... what do they want?""

""We aren't sure. We need to have you sworn in right away though.""

Jennings let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding. ""What about the President? What are we doing to secure him?""

The two men in front of him glanced sideways at each other uncomfortably. ""We lost track of their vehicle when they turned into the Virginia Ave. tunnel.""

""What?!? Do you mean to tell me that despite all of our intelligence capabilities, a bunch of hillbillies managed to kidnap the President of the United States and then we LOSE him?? What happened to the tracker?""

Ron cringed. ""I'm sorry, we think Potus removed the tracker. Or his captors did.""

""In any case sir,"" Melvin spoke up, ""your designation is changed. You are now Eagle.""

""Get me to the White House.""

""Yes Sir. We're headed there now.""

______________

As he walked into the secondary Situation Room within Horsepower, the men seated around the table stood as one.

""At ease, gentlemen. Give me the latest."" Jennings had just been sworn in and the weight was already burdening his shoulders.

""Sir, if I may?"" The now-Vice President, formerly Speaker of the House, Carl Albert, raised his hand.

""Go ahead Carl.""

""Mr. President, as of four minutes ago we received this message from the terrorist cell leaders."" 

God, these people loved to label anyone and everything a terrorist Ken thought to himself.

""Now... these are their words, not mine. I quote: 'We have the negro Hussein Obama in custody. Citizens arrest is what it is. God demanded it. To have him returned our demands are as follows. One, ban gay marriage, and have the punishment be death. Two, nuke North Korea. You have 12 hours to comply.' End quote.""

""..."" The President sat in stunned silence for a minute. ""Wut."" He could barely even utter that.

""Mr. President, I'm sorry, that's all there is.""

""What the hell am I supposed to do with that??""

""Sir, I think the best course of action is non-action. We as a rule don't negotiate with terrorists.""

""Dammit Ford I don't need to be talked down to. I know the standard response.""

""I'm sorry Mr. President, I didn't mea-""

""Shut the hell up.""

""Yes Mr. President.""

Ken rubbed his temples. That damn ringing wouldn't stop. ""Alright. What are the options?""

""We can send in a Seal Team to try to extract Potus, a-

""Who we don't know the location of.""

""-nd.. Yes sir. Or we can nuke North Korea. Or allow Potus to die.""

""We're running out of time. I need intelligence on Obama's location. Come back to me in 3 hours with something concrete.""

""Yes Sir.""

""Dismissed.""

______________

""What have you got?"" Ken asked sourly.

""Mr. President, we've had no luck locating Potus. All available satellites have been re-positioned, and we've dispatc-""

""I don't want to hear any more excuses!"" Ken spat at the CIA director. ""Get me some God damned answers! These aren't options I can work with!""

""I.. I know Sir. I think we need to discuss them though. We're getting close to the time limit.""

Ken sighed. ""Are you suggestion I seriously just let Barack die? Really?""

""No Sir. However North Korea..""

""Under no circumstances will I even consider dropping a nuclear weapon on North Korea, no matter how disliked they are.""

All of a sudden an upset looking intern approached. What now, Ken thought.

""SIR. The Press has gotten a hold of the story and are threatening to release it! What do I tell them??""

""Dammit! Tell them to hold on, we've got this.""

""Sir, they're on the line right now.""

""Well put me on!""

______________

""Mr. President."" The voice sounded a lot like Frank Sinatra, but Ken knew it was George Stephanopoulos.

""George, don't do this. That's a direct order from your Commander in Chief.""

""I'm sorry Mr. President, but the world needs to know. I won't sit on this.""

""George! Don't you da-"" but the line went dead. 

Fuck. 

""Lenny! Redirect one of those teams to detain Stephanopoulos."" Freedom of the Press can go fuck itself, for all Ken cared.

""Yes Sir.""

______________

One hour to go. This was getting ridiculous. I'm the most powerful man in the world and I've got my hands tied.

""Mr. President, your ratings are through the roof since that Jeopardy episode. Use that good will here now. The public will side with you.""

""Sure, but what's the right course of action?""

""That's for history to decide... and we will be the victors here.""

""I'm not so sure.""

______________

Ken's hand trembled over the Football. ""How do we even know that they will return Obama?"" he asked shakily.

""We don't Mr. President.""

All of a sudden Ken got his wits about him. No way was one man's life worth more then a whole country's worth. With a sense of finality, he closed the Football.

On the adjacent screen, he saw the group of figures that threatened the world's way of life scream. They raised a pistol to the back of a hooded man's head, and pulled the trigger. 

While the rest of the world cried out in anguish, Ken smirked.

""Hope my ass."""

Looking for advice/experiences.,Vnuke,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2705zi/im_a_canadian_wanting_to_do_an_internship_in_the/,"Hi there, I am a third year Canadian computer science student and I have decided I want to relocate to the states upon graduation. I've looked around a bit and it seems quite feasible for a Canadian to move to US and work in tech. I'm interested in how feasible it would be for me to get an internship (co-op as they're called here) in the US before I graduate. 

I go to university good for CS but it's not Waterloo or anything. I have a co-op this summer at a federal research institution which I figure will be a decent resume point. My grades are not speculator; I think they'd be around 3.0 on a 4 point scale. I have a some decent side projects and I hope to have some significant projects and open source contributions when I begin applying. Overall my resume/experience are pretty comparable to what is considered good on this sub. 

I would like to work for a larger company thats name will recognizable on my resume, and I think thats the environment I will most enjoy. I'm not set on any particular companies and I think it may be a good idea to target companies that less glamorous than the big 4 (still applying though). I'm willing to go any location, but I think it would be an exciting experience to move to the Bay area.

Thanks for reading my post. Any advice is appreciated. Sorry if this is a repost, I couldn't find any threads about Canadians doing US internships specifically."

1) Increased confidence

I don't know if it's because I realized that literally I have nothing to lose, or if it's because of my increased testosterone but as of lately, I've had the balls to approach any attractive girl and most of the time get her number. It's great practise learning how to socialize with girls that you may think are out of your league but guess what? Since most guys are too afraid to talk to them they will be flattered to have an alpha male such as yourself approach them and compliment them. Before nofap, I'd objectify women and only see their parts but now I feel like I get the bigger picture. I see both their beauty if body but more of face and personality and social vibe. There's this sense of connection that you feel when your with them. 


2) Girls will appear 

What happens is, when you get out and start focusing on working out or increasing your intelligence by going to the library or coffee shop to read, you will begin to have more women around you in your life. You know why??? When I used to pmo my mind would be distracted from the countless opportunity a around me. Now, I realize since my eyes are beginning to open that there is so much opportunity to go approach a woman and talk to them. I've spoken to multiple girls who I used to consider out of my league who are now texting me and interested hopefully!


3) Self disciple increases

When you can control your emotions and behaviour, you can call yourself a genuine man. The key to success in almost anything in life is disciple. Use that frustration and energy not to hurt others or seek revenge on what you can not have, but channel it into improving yourself!! Increase your knowledge and physical abilities!! Increase your social skills by talking to new people and breaking out of your comfort zone! We live one fucking life and you are the creator of your destiny! Knowledge is power, once you see how the media fucks so many men up from achieving their highest potential you will reject the system and this movement is a great eye opener for most of us. To keep us in control they feed us whatever we desire which leads to addiction and slack of desire to love forward. Read a shit load of books, talk to women and get their numbers( you have nothing to lose! Good tip), get fit and help society! As men we need to set an example and bring back the way things used to be interns of how society defined a true man. Suffer with your desires with the love of being good, successful, and proud of who you are and what you can achieve. THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO GREATNESS"
2707md,1,2014-05-31,"In college, made some money at an internship. What to do with it?",letsgrillsteak,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2707md/in_college_made_some_money_at_an_internship_what/,"I am currently doing a paid internship in place of the spring semester of college this year. I plan on graduating next December, meaning I have 3 semesters left. 

I've saved most of the money I've made this year, and I should end up with about 12 grand at my disposal when it's time to back to school this fall. I could pay for the semester outright if I wanted to... But I'm also approaching 20 grand in student loans at the moment. (Sidenote: my parents legally have to pay for 2/3 of all of my college expenses because of a divorce agreement. I'll probably end up being 30 ish grand in debt by graduation, so I'll have to pay 10.) Also, I plan on finding an internship for next summer, so there's another potential 3~4 grand.

I have debt, but I'd also like to buy a car, because my current car is a piece of shit and I'm not sure how much time it has left. I can't live without a car. If I do go this route, I love cars a lot- I will likely want to buy something that I will enjoy driving, so I'll want to spend most of it. Probably not the wisest choice, but it's a preference of mine.

Of course there are plenty of other options, but I think I know what would be wisest- pay my third of the debt that I am in now (~7 grand), and hold on to the rest until my car takes a shit on me and get something less expensive. If my car survives until I graduate, I could avoid taking out more unsubsidized loans and graduate with little to no debt on my part- which would be awesome.

That's what I think is the best choice, what do you guys think?

27096m,1,2014-05-31,Serious quarter-life? (I'm 29) crises. Looking for advice. Kind words are fine too.,throwAway84544,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/27096m/serious_quarterlife_im_29_crises_looking_for/,"I am questioning most major life decisions I've made in the previous 3 years.  I am in quite a bit of emotional pain and have been for days but I'll try to explain my situation as clearly as I can.  

How I got here.
I'm smart academically but I have tended to make idiotic life decisions.  Valedictorian of my high school.  Was a national merit scholar.  Graduated from an elite university here in the US.  However, I decided to major in psychology with no real plan for what I would do after graduation (big mistake) and after graduation, I quit my lab job to play a poker online which I did for 3 years.  With poker, the money was really good, especially for the first year and a half - I paid off about 30k worth of student loans with it and the money was my reason for doing it but it was a terrible decision because it has subsequently left a huge ass gap that is very difficult to get around in job interviews. 

So, since moving back to the states and trying to re-enter society (establish myself, start a career), I discovered quickly that I have very little value in the working world.  I worked in a call center for about a year (hated every fucking day of that).  Decided that the answer to my employment problems was that I needed a more practical degree, so I decided to go to grad school.  Got accepted to a very respectable masters program here in New England in corporate finance.  I am to graduate in December.  I started looking for a job about a month ago (I worked low paying jobs when things have gotten slow here - was a shift-lead at WalGreens last Summer, worked 2 temp gigs that sucked pretty hard).  I am currently 0/15 for internships.  I basically need an internship to get a job in corporate finance but I'm getting nervous as hell that I won't be able to an internship.  I know that 15 applications is nothing, that a lot of people apply to 100's of jobs before even getting a solid interview.  But I'm getting nervous and that sick feeling is coming back to me.  I'm not doing low paying / degrading work again.  I'm just not doing it.
I am strong considering joining the military.  In hindsight, I probably should have done that from the start.  I never had much direction.  I took the ASVAB in high school and got a 99%, the recruiter was saying I could do anything I want.  I like what the military does to people like me and I wanted that.  But when I was in high school, we were like a year into Iraq, and I really didn't want to snap get shipped out to Iraq to face IEDs and shit.  I know that sounds selfish (it is).  But I didn't want a guaranteed ticket to a fucking shithole war zone where I probably stood like almost a 1% chance of dying.  
Alright so I'm thinking about giving myself an ultimatum, like August, for finding a paid internship or entry level job.  And if not, joining the military.  

Obv I will do the research but I was wondering, am I too old to join the US military?   What branch would I be most suited for?  Does anyone know if any branch of the military offers a job involving something even remotely close to software engineering.  I've taken several CS classes along the way - java, C++, data structures, some higher maths.  I never tried to major in CS because it was hard as fuck and I did poorly in the classes but if I could do it over, I would just have gone to my state school and done it the best I could. 

Before you question my motives about joining the military, I want you to understand that my ultimate motive is survival - I literally cannot continue to rent a 400 sqft shit apartment with my $12/hr, completely respectable jobs.  I continue like this another year.  My family is not rich, I have never been able to fall back on them, and I wouldn't even if I could because of pride.  I don't think it is at all irrational.  I looking for advice on what branch is the best for me and what job I can take that I could dovetail into something akin to software development and there is nothing like that, what jobs might suit me.  Ty for any serious responses."
2709sv,7,2014-06-01,Very depressed due to harm/existential thoughts. Any advice is appreciated.,Douchemuffin,OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/2709sv/very_depressed_due_to_harmexistential_thoughts/,"Hi everyone. Firstly, just wanted to thank everyone for posting their stories, this subreddit (I also posted this at http://stuckinadoorway.org/forums/index.php - great site for OCD sufferers) has been one of the main things getting me through my latest bout of OCD. I know I shouldn't be reassurance-seeking, but I'm feeling so terribly low tonight that I just need to vent and see if anyone else can relate. 

I'm a twenty-one-year-old female. I've had obsessive and compulsives tendencies (mainly checking and slight hoarding) since childhood but wasn't diagnosed until I was seventeen after I had my first intrusive harm thought about my little sister (who I love more than anything and would willingly die for). I got on Zoloft and started therapy. It did help and the thoughts and mental and physical compulsions decreased. I then moved a thousand miles away from home for college and my harm thoughts completely went away and I only held onto a few checking obsessions. This lasted two and a half years. Yet, this past March I was on spring break with my sister and the harm thoughts came back. Worse, the harm thoughts were about EVERYONE I encountered. I started crying on the plane back to school because I kept thinking about strangling the lady sitting next to me. This continued. I hated being in my dorm, worried I would kill someone in the showers or even break into their room. I got back on Zoloft right away and made an appointment with a therapist. Unfortunately, our schedules did not align for further appointments, but she did assure me it was OCD just manifesting itself in a new form because I had ""beaten"" my previous kind. The Zoloft helped, but not as much as it once did.

 I'm a social work student and for my field placement I was assigned to an elementary school. It was absolute hell going to my internship because I had thoughts about harming the kids and my co-workers. For a (thankfully) short period of time, I had fears I was a pedophile and wanted to molest the students I worked with. I was and continue to be full of disgust at myself. I feel I haven't breathed easily since March. The thoughts just get more vicious. I'm worried I'm destined to be a killer. I'm scared I secretly enjoy torture and want to torture others- that I even want to be a cannibal! My thoughts are so vivid and gory. Even my dreams have become filled with gore. Does anyone else dream about harm? I'm never the harmer in these dreams but see other people get very hurt. Last night I dreamed about Don Draper's legs being torn apart by a taxi cab- WTF? I know I never would hurt anyone (I can only kill bugs when they are already injured to put them out of their misery) because I decided long ago I would kill myself before I could hurt anyone else. That's the only thought that comforts me lately, but even that ""comfort"" is diminishing. I know my suicide would crush my family and is a selfish route and I don't want to die. Yet, I've never been so depressed and dejected. 

It isn't just from the harm thoughts. Now I am having some sort of existential crisis. I can't see the point in anything. I look forward to nothing when I used to be so excited for my future. I wonder things like, ""What does it matter if I killed someone? We all die anyway."" I feel humans work so hard, but for what? I was never religious but I did believe in a higher power of some kind, or at least something bigger than even the Universe. Now I don't think, or at least I worry, that nothing happens when we die and that all our actions are pointless. OCD tries to tell me I don't love my family and that humankind has no redeemable qualities. The OCD (or at least what I hope to God [the one I'm currently on the fence about, lol] is OCD) is even ""telling"" me right now that I'm lying to all of you and myself. That I like this ""new"" me and that I've always been a sadistic, heartless being. I'm sorry for all the rambling, I'm just so messed up mentally. I take my pills each day and journal and go running every other but I just hate myself. I used to love myself, probably too much and was overconfident internally but always tried to be as kind as could be to anyone I interacted with. I wanted to do so much for the world but now see no point. I'm back home for the summer and being in my sister's presence is driving my OCD crazy. Now I'm even having harm thoughts about my mother (who I never did before). I don't know what I'm trying to get from this post but I feel a bit better writing it out. 

Does anyone else feel like me? I'm especially worried about the torture and cannibal intrusive thoughts. Before, I was the type of person who hated horror movies and if I saw or read about an odd or particularly horrific death, fictional or real, I'd ruminate about it for weeks. I will admit I would often research serial killers, first I did out of a morbid fascination and now I do it to compare myself to them to make sure I wasn't like them. Now I'm worried that my interest in them is something more sinister. I JUST WANT MY LIFE BACK! I'm so sorry for my jumbled thoughts. Are you still actually reading this? I wish everyone all the happiness in the world (but of course now my mind is telling me that I hate everyone and wish them all pain. Christ, what a crazy thing OCD is LOL)"
270a9z,4,2014-06-01,You bailed on me when I needed a friend,thisisausername5,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/270a9z/you_bailed_on_me_when_i_needed_a_friend/,"I had a friend who I grew up with all through high school. We were good friends and always went around the area trying new food together. Every summer, when we got back from college we would hang out and find shit to do.

This summer, my other good friends did not return home due to internships. I've been extremely lonely this whole summer (which began a month ago for me). We had made plans to drive out to a baseball game in the neighboring state (about an hour drive) to watch a game like we had done every other summer. We both took the night off of work 3 weeks in advance and I was excited as hell to catch up with him. 

It was my last summer in town before moving across the country to begin my career so I wanted to make it count and here I was, lonely and bored. So I invite him over to hang out several times and each time he doesn't respond. We are both busy with work so I just assume he was working and didn't see the message until it was too late. 

Tuesday is game day and I go out and buy a shirt and baseball hat to replace my old and worn-out ones from years past. I come home and just as I'm about to order the tickets, I get a call with him asking if I had bought tickets yet or if it was alright if he took a shift at work instead of going.

I don't have many friends left in town and I hadn't done anything except work since I've gotten home. I am extremely lonely and bored and I was looking forward to this for weeks. With the ignored texts and sudden bail on the game, I am starting to think we weren't as good of friends as I'd thought. 

Fuck, I'm in for a long and lonely summer and then moving across the country to start my life where I won't know anyone for awhile. I'm not sure if I should be angry or sad.

270cl0,1,2014-06-01,Dark Cafe,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/270cl0/dark_cafe/,"In early March this year, I started interning at a social business near my school. My reason for picking this company was because of its interesting business model. 

The company runs a cafe, but it was not your average kind of gourmet eatery. The cafe allows its customers to feast on a wide variety of food, in complete darkness. By doing so, customers will get a feel of what it's like to be blind and gain an empathy for the disadvantaged in our society. To top it off, the servers in the cafe are all visually impaired people (we call them VIs for short), who are trained and well familiarized with the cafe's layout. 

In the beginning, the job was really fun. As many of the other interns were my classmates, we had a great time goofing off at work; when our boss wasn't around, that is. We were also tasked with memorizing the cafe's layout so that we could navigate our way through, with or without light. 

However, work soon got boring. I was mostly in charged of administrative work. Occasionally, I would escort a late customer into the cafe to his table or interact with the customers after the meal (they usually have a lot of questions about how we run the cafe and serve food in complete darkness). But that was really it. 

Thus, us interns always filled our time by entertaining ourselves with useless chit-chat. Sometimes the conversations can be quite abstract, from religion to alien abductions. However, this was when things got weird. One time, when we were talking about ghosts, one of my colleagues asked a supervisor if our cafe was haunted since that place was completely dark most of the time. My supervisor, Sue, gave us a weird look and changed the subject. This made me suspicious, as Sue was always ready to share information about everything with us. 

Then, even stranger thing started to happen. A few days later, Adam, another intern, came in the room, face as pale as can be. He claimed that he heard footsteps beside him, quick and frantic. He called out but no one replied. Then something brushed passed him and hissed. I repeat, HISSED. Needless to say, we got really freaked out and no one wanted to go in the cafe afterwards. Sue, who's a terribly bad liar, assured us that it was just Adam's imagination. 

Anyways, a few weeks past and nothing else happened. I gradually got back my courage and even offered to escort a few customers into the cafe when everyone else was busy. Then yesterday, I escorted a young lady, probably in her twenties into the cafe. She was extremely scared and took much coaxing before she agreed to step into the cafe. I assured her that I would be by her side the whole way through. She gave me a kind smile and said, ""Me, too.""

I gave her a bewildering look but ushered her inside anyways. As we walked, she held on to me for dear life. When we finally reached her table, I seated her and heard her grateful voice as she thanked me. I left her there and headed in the direction of my office.

I was almost near the exit when I heard frantic footsteps. And then soft hissing. I got scared and ran towards to what I thought was the exit. But it wasn't, which was really strange as I've never gotten lost in the cafe before. I know the place like it was my second home. I tried to retrace my steps but it just led to another dead end. At this point of time, I started to really panic. It didn't help that the hissing is getting louder.

Suddenly, someone grabbed hold of my right arm. I screamed and tried to pull away. It was no use. I thought that I was a goner. But then whoever who was holding on to me spoke, ""Follow me, quick! I'll get you out of here!"" Relief soaked me from the head to the toe as I muttered a word of thanks. But then a second person grabbed my left arm, ""No, follow ME, I'll get you out of here.""

By then, I was honestly in hysteria. I must have been hyperventilating until I heard the first voice say, ""Be by your side the whole way through, remember?"" Following whatever instinct I have left, I broke my left arm free and followed the first voice. As I speed walked away, I heard a soft cackle behind me. 

After making it to the exit, I stumbled back into the light. Adam ran up to me and asked what happened. As I explained what happened, the door behind me opened up again and out walked all our customers. Apparently, lunch had finished! I had been lost in the cafe for almost an hour!

In the sea of faces, I tried looking around for the lady I brought in just now but she was nowhere to be seen. "
270d78,6,2014-06-01,"Planning on interning next summer, would appreciate any help.",FlameDra,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/270d78/planning_on_interning_next_summer_would/,"I went through the FAQ and caught up on all the threads related to internships. I could not find the weekly internship thread, so I'm sorry for making a new post about this. 

I'll start off with a little background about myself. I'm a college sophomore going to the University of South Florida in Tampa, FL, for my Bachelors in Computer Science. I'm a pretty decent student and have around a 3.6 GPA right now. I've been programming on and off since my teenage years and most of what I worked on was web based. I started off with HTML and CSS when I was pretty young, and through the years got to work with PHP, Javascript and SQL. Most of my major projects (which I worked on during high school), focused primarily on developing and administrating websites for gaming organizations,  and the projects themselves relied heavily on some form of a CMS (I'm most familiar with Joomla! and PHPBB). As such, there wasn't a lot of heavy programming involved, just some minor scripting here and there. Other than my web based projects, I learned C# with XNA to learn some basic game development techniques. I'm currently taking my Introduction to Programming class this summer which uses Java, and it is pretty easy for me considering that I did many online intro and OOP courses during middle school.

Next summer, I will be done with my sophomore year of college, and want to do an internship for experience. However, I'm not sure how to approach this especially since I’m not sure if companies are even looking for sphomores. I'm listing down some of my concerns for visibility's sake:

* 1) When is a good time to look and apply for internships for Summer 2015? When do the applications open up? From what I read, October/November of this year seems to be the answer but I’m not sure. Also should I first make a list of every company I want to apply to and then custom tailor my resume/cover letter for each or what? Not sure how to approach this.

* 2) Where should I look for internships? I'm already looking into my University's career services but would like to know some external sources too. LinkedIn, Monster, etc. What do you guys recommend? I would like something in my area as I don't think companies pay interns to relocate. Also, I would very much like to intern in something web related as that's where most of my interest (and experience) lies.
 
* 3) What do I need to have on my resume for them to call me for an interview? I feel like I don't have the most presentable resume. I've worked on a few projects but they were a good couple of years ago. And most of them did not include heavy programming (didn't have to apply complex Data Structs and what not). What should I be focusing on doing the next few semesters to make my resume look better? Personal projects like an Android app, looking for a research opportunity in the university, what?

Most of all, I really want to have some internship experience before I graduate. I feel like not having one will seriously end up with me being unemployed upon graduation. Sorry for the long post, but this is something I’m really concerned about and will appreciate any help I can get. Thanks for taking the time to read.

270j8o,2,2014-06-01,"Lonely, isolated, and depressed since starting college 2 years ago.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/270j8o/lonely_isolated_and_depressed_since_starting/,"Hey everyone!    
So I started college 2 years ago (I will be a rising junior next fall)...and long story short, college wasn't what I expected it to be. I mean, I guess when you're young people tell you that college is supposed to be the best time of your life, right?! Or at least, they make it sound like a fun time! I guess I was super pumped and just really glad to move away from home to a new city, learn new things, and meet new people and friends.            
Well, my experience has been bad, horrible even. Really far from happiness actually :/            
Upon entering freshmen year I lived in the dorms and the first 2 weeks were you know, the ""love your floor"" phase. Then after that I started feeling really isolated. My floor was mostly the party floor, and if you weren't super social and the party type of person, you kind of got ignored...which was what happened to me. When I went in the lounge, I could tell that my floormates didn't really acknowledge me even though I tried hard to be open and welcoming, never judging of anything, but they seemed to shut me out of the circle. The other part of my floor were really antisocial. I tried talking to them but they never wanted to talk I guess. My closest friend that year was my roommate who moved away after that year due to academic stress.            
I did make a few friends from class. However, one of them got really controlling and verbally abused me so I stopped hanging with her. The others are more of acquaintances...whenever I hit them up, they don't really want to hang out. I mean, we talk, and I guess we're cool, but they never seem to want to hang out otherwise. It's been like this for the last 2 years. I have a few acquaintances, but when I try to make plans or something, they're either busy or ignore my texts. Until they NEED something that is. Homework help? Their other friends all went home for the weekend (yes, one of them told me this: ""all my apartment mates are gone and I'm bored, wanna go eat?"")? Need cash for dinner? Oh, let's text banhbeotom, she's always up for it. And the pathetic thing is, I know I'm being used out of convenience most of the time, but I'm so damn lonely that I don't even care.            
I feel like no one at this school really cares about me. No one really contacts me first unless I contact them. I've been told I can be really social and friendly--though I do get shy in big groups. However, I'm failing at this. I seriously don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've joined a few clubs, but didn't really find much success out of them. I talk to people during lecture, but then I never see them again or they seem closed off. My major is HUGE so it's really hard seeing the same people over and over. I feel like most people made their friends in the dorms freshman year and stick with them, yet I couldn't find that...so here I am floating around, feeling isolated with no real social support system here.            
I didn't even have any friends to room with 2nd year of college. None of my ""friends"" were interested in letting me join their housing group. So I had a random roommate, a 4th year college student who didn't want to talk to me at ALL during the school year. She basically left her door closed the whole time, and I guess that was fine since she probably jsut wanted to do her own thing. And this year, I'm faced with the same dilemma. I don't have anyone to room with. It's just so...depressing I guess.            
So this past year has been horrible. Words cannot describe the isolation I felt...I tried burying myself in homework and the gym, but it only helps for a little while and the feelings of loneliness come back. I think these past 2 years have also messed with my ""self"". I don't feel like I'm worth anything anymore. Like, I'm so confused about what I'm doing wrong that I'm blaming it on myself. Am I too weird? Ugly? Fat? I don't know. I feel inferior now. It's been a tiring and confusing process.            
Yes, I know people may recommend to focus on myself and doing the things that I like, and I try. But then, at the end of the day, I still feel alone. Is there something wrong with me?    
            
This is embarrassing to admit, but last semester I cried almost every single day. It was just...so lonely! I need human interaction and it sucked not really having it. I mean, yes, I did talk to people during class sometimes, but I didn't have real friends to hang out with on the weekends or anything like that. I'd often wake up feeling heavy and numb.            
Right now it's summer and I'm back at my parent's house for the break, but I'm still feeling depressed and anxious and sad. I guess it's because I'm really fearful that I'm going to feel the same way next school year. I'm also not doing anything at home either. I feel so unproductive and worthless just sitting here doing nothing. My internship search failed, so my only other choice is sitting here doing nothing (which is making me over thinking and feel extremely depressed) or go back to college and take summer classes, which gives me horrible anxiety to think about. I just don't want to feel this way ever again...it's driving me insane. Please help me reddit."
270jtu,2,2014-06-01,McGill Nursing,2005kjoo,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/270jtu/mcgill_nursing/,"Hello, I will be attending a nursing program this up-coming fall. 

I have been admitted to McGill, McMaster, Western (the main site) universities and am in the process of deciding which one to enter.

Personally, I would like to atten McGill university as it is renown and in a favourable city. But I know that I won't be able to work their due to their French Language Exam.

However, I have come to realize some problems that I may encounter after I graduate from their program. 

1) after I graduate and pass their nursing exam, I know that I may be able to register as College of Ontario Nurses. However, would this still be valid as the CRNE exam is replace by NCLEX exam?

2) also, do hospitals prefer students that have graduated from universites of their own province (e.g. Ontario?)

3) would it be hard for me to get a job in Ontario without doing the internship in that province?

4) would it be hard to get licensure in other provinces other than Ontario and Quebec? I would really like work in B.C or Ontario.

5) why are the nursing wage so low in Quebec?

If I cannot get a job after I graduate from McGill University, I would rather go to other universities. Which university will enable me to get a job right away? (I've seen in some posts that some people cannot get a job right now)

Any help/comments on these questions will be greatly appreciated! "

Hope this helps you!",raphaMBN,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/2719ki/i_was_22fusa_europe_here_is_exactly_how_i_did_the/,"It is incredible the amount of passion in this subreddit. There is in particular a brand of IWantOut dream that keeps popping up here and seems the most desired but most impossible. But it's that dream I followed and achieved. Thus far I haven't seen anyone else who has done it and posted how. On the back of a great recent post about ignoring naysayers, I think it's time to share my story. 

I was "" 22F//USA//IBUS/Marketing -&gt; EU "" ...  

...and I did the ""impossible"": got hired straight from university to my first job ever, in Marketing, in Paris, France. English is my mother tongue. The job was all in French. Bachelor's degree only. No intercompany transfer from the US, no special skills not found elsewhere in the EU and no visa hassles except for normal French bureaucracy. I spoke French well but had never lived in France/worked in it (big difference). A year later I moved to Denmark. Seven years later I'm still in Denmark, and only just a few months ago became an EU citizen...of Latvia, incidentally.

To be clear, I'm not a robot sent from the future to find work in Europe. Haha. It was hard, but you know that. 

I'm going to detail exactly how I did this, including the actual job board I found my way out on. I even looked through all the emails from that period, saw 22 year old me's CV I sent out etc. (Cringe worthy stuff!!) 

See what you can get out of my journey to help you on yours. I'm rooting for you!

Here is the director's cut, with commentary, of the keys things I did:

**I made my own international experience** 

By the time I was applying for jobs in Europe at 22, I had studied abroad in four countries, spoke Portuguese fluently, four more euro languages at B1 or above level (took the tests), had two short internships, one of those in Portugal, and two ""misc"" int'l work experiences (bartender and songwriter/vocalist). 

None of this happened by accident. 

Starting from age 15 I would barter trips abroad instead of Christmas presents, save up money waitressing to hang out in Brazil with family friends for the summer, found a Brazilian lady to private tutor me Portuguese after school. You're not even supposed to study abroad more than two semesters at my university. But I convinced my advisor to make it happen. Those two internships and ""misc"" experience? Self made opportunities. For example, in Portugal on a student visa still I convinced an owner of a consultancy to let me do some free work for him for  two months. The other US internship was the same story really, helping some rogue entrepreneur do things. 

I got as much on the ground experience as possible - and when I wasn't on the ground I was talking to people who were. Stayed current with current affairs, music, life, people I met abroad even when not physically present. 

Building my own brand of int'l experience helped me in many ways. I showed I would not be a ""fresh off the boat"" hire. That I knew to some extent how things were done there and could handle working cross-culturally. My CV, cover letters etc were in local format and language which also signaled this. You might not have this background or be as much as a language nerd as myself - and that's OK. But think about your ultimate goal and if creating your own opportunities would help get you there. I didn't rely on anyone to give me euro experience. You can cultivate some euro savy with just an internet connection.  


**I reached out to contacts that could hire me - or get me to someone who could** 

Behind every work visa is Your Future Boss in Europe, who really wants to hire you. I focused on securing that part, because I should be so lucky to be dealing with visa issues! I spent the majority of my time trying to get in front of, get information from, and impress people who could help get me hired. From both first and second hand experience: if Future Boss really wants you, he tells HR to deal with the visa issues, and they can succeed. Even in seemingly impossible places. I went to notoriously tough France for an entry-level marketing job, remember? But first you need someone willing to fight for you, or go through some extra motions, if necessary.


**I paid for access to a European job board** 

Europeans are also interested in moving around in Europe, and there are a few pan European job boards in English with more internationally focused postings. Which one led me to my life in Europe? www.iagora.com. Just checked, it still exists and for 0€ you can browse recruiter-sponsored jobs, and for 24€ (33 ish dollars) you get premium access for a whole year. Wow. Easily the best 24€ I have ever spent. 


**I applied for and got REJECTED from LOTS of jobs on said board - but learned and kept going**

I never did get a response like ""we are obligated to hire an EU citizen"". In my desperation, I was applying for jobs that I was not a good fit for, but freshly graduated you think you can do anything if given the chance. Looking back it is so crystal clear the weaknesses both in my CV and approach. Ugh! 

See what I mean from this rejection email I got from a manager in Germany:

""Your cv is absolutely impressive and so are your language skills. However, the position offered does not focus primarily on marketing issues, but rather on product and sales issues.  I understand your skills and interests are mainly in marketing, and judging from your application you certainly are a great fit to any international organisation for a marketing position. 

For that reason I regret that at this point in time we cannot consider your application. However, should you be in Europe again, I will be happy to get your call to see if we can meet somewhere. There may well be other opportunities within (company name) for you in the future and it would be nice to have met you...""

Don't forget...Future Boss in Europe is not going to summon you from across the ocean if you cannot help him achieve his sales targets. If you wouldn't get the job even as a native of that country don't be too shocked you get rejected. Don't get too caught up in the romance or mystique of working in Europe that you lose sight of this. 


**I learned what to look for - and applied to a major corp's ""Graduate Programme""**  

This is where things really start to get interesting. In their early twenties Americans are looking for an ""entry level job"". But in Europe there are a few other terminologies for this concept, which I believe makes these types of jobs harder to find. It varies, but you could be called for example a ""trainee"" like ""management/marketing/sales trainee"", or a ""graduate"". Major companies might even only take on employees with less than 2 years experience through what's called either a :  ""Graduate Scheme"", ""Graduate Program"" (or ""Programme"" the UK spelling), ""Graduate Development Progamme"", ""Training Programme"", ""Trainee Program"", ""Traineeship"" or some variation. Some of these are local, some of these require you work in 2+ different locations/countries in two years. I saw a major corporation's European programme and applied. 


**I prepared my ass off for the interviews to demonstrate to Future Boss in Europe I was the best hire**

I sent my CV into that black hole of doom online application, but to my surprise whilst late and having to walk clear across campus I got a phone call from the UK. It was the company! We had a chat while I was walking which I later realized was a proper phone interview. It apparently went well because they flew me over to a two day ""assessment center"" in the European HQ near London a few weeks later. I totally shut everything else off and studied how to ace difficult consulting interviews, reviewed business problem solving, practiced my interview stories etc etc. International experience and languages got me in the door, but it would now come down to showing how I would help the business more so than the others.


**I GOT THE JOB.**

A few weeks later I got the call. I got in the Graduate Programme as one of fourteen, from about 2000, at 22 the youngest of the bunch, and only American. Ever. I distinctly remember taking a victory lap on my rollerblades. Paris for my first year in a Product Manager job because I could speak French and then I lobbied to go to Copenhagen, Denmark for my second year. Six years later still here and actually 1.5 years ago returned to the original company, where I now have a European Marketing Manager role.

We had a call about why we were accepted into the program. Besides demonstrating value for the business through the various tests/interviews, I absolutely stood out because I was an American who had closed an ocean-wide gap to have those language skills and experience.  A German who speaks German, English and has studied a semester in France? Not as awe-inspiring.


**A note about the language skills requirements for these programs**
The program I got in required English plus two foreign languages. Quick googling shows some programs just English. But a note on the foreign languages. My Euro program mates all were non native English speakers so they did have their mother tongue plus English right off the bat. However, that third language? Some of them were really stretching it. My German friend studied in the Netherlands and put Dutch. He spoke like three sentences. Another German put French and.. just no. French girl's Spanish? Not good enough to work in. Most of the job placements anyway were in the UK. Lots of companies have European roles and English as the business language. So don't count yourself out but keep training your languages you have more to prove as a native English speaker. 


To round it off, the process is supposed to be difficult, at any age, embrace that. Not only in an administrative and legal sense, but emotional as well, as you probably have so few supporting you. 

But I am one of them, so keep going! If you want to chat more feel free to PM me."
271d7f,29,2014-06-01,University hookups (m/f) - 1,usedtobeshyeur,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/271d7f/university_hookups_mf_1/,"Hello, let me start for apologizing for eventual errors or formatting, new here and i'm not a native English speaker.
About me: I'm a average height guy in my late 20's, I'm fit, brown eyes and hair (like the southern european that i am eheh)
I was in University for many years, getting 2 courses and a masters, so i've plenty of stories there, here's the first one. 
I was 18 and for the first time in my life I was away from home. I went with 2 friends, and we found a cheap apartment well located. A few days later we finally bumped into our neighbor, lets call her ""Mary"", her eyes glued on one of my friends, lets call him ""John"". She was on her 3rd year, 21, and just returned from summer break. She was cute, but was slightly overweight for all our tastes. Anyway, she was a very nice and quickly became a member of the ""group"", since the building was small, and only had 2 apartments in each floor, we could just close the stairs door and ""join"" both, making just a big one. She would join us for drinks all the time, but failed to mention she had a roommate.
To our surprise, like 2 weeks after classes started, this new girl appears at our door, i'll call her ""Sophie"", came later from vacations. She was short, had long curly dark hair with great tits, not too skinny, just the right weight. She was on her last year, and was 25. I liked what I saw, and we all introduced ourselves, but she didn't seem so nice.
Anyway, that night we all had dinner and we got to meet her a bit better, she was a bit nicer but it looked like something was bothering her. She left really early. I was tired and not on the mood of going out, so I just moved to the couch to watch some tv. The guys were leaving but Mary was still there and just came to lay on the couch next to me, and the guys winked at me like ""enjoy the privacy with her""… They left, and i was kinda confused and hoping she wouldn't try anything. Well, she didn't, she started asking stuff about John. My face of relief must have been hilarious. I told her some vague answers to her questions, and used the opportunity to ask about Sophie! First thing she said: ""She's a bitch! she has 2 boyfriends, one here and one on her home town"". (they seemed to be nice to each other, so this was surprisingly harsh) For some reason that made me even more interested in Sophie, dirty little slut? Hell yeah.

Weeks passed, Mary eventually started to give up on John, and Sophie was now much more fun to be around. Again in better weather night, we were having dinner and I went outside to our big balcony to enjoy my drink. Sophie grabbed a chair joined me, and it was noticeable she had too much to drink and started talking about lots of things, including how great Mary was looking since she started to lose weight. I noticed it also, but didn't really thought about it. (funny how they both talk about each other on the back, one fine, the other harsh) But I wasn't interested. I wanted to know about Sophie herself and she ended confirming the 2 boyfriends story. But it wasn't like i thought. The one from her hometown was a fake, they didn't like each other but seemed like a good deal for keeping up appearances with his and her parents (i just don't understand the point, but hey…). The other was a 2 year relationship that he ""didn't give her what she wanted"". It was a clear hint, but at that moment i thought she was just teasing. We talked a bit more and it became late and she left.

Next day, everyone had class or work all day, except me and Sophie. I was only busy in the morning, and as soon as i got home she rang. I opened the door and she came at me, with pajama pants and a tight t-shirt without a bra. Now this time i could really see how great those tits were, better then i expected, and those perky nipples… She was pissed that i didn't make a move on her the night before, knowing I really wanted since I was with a hard on every time i was with her. I asked how did she know and she told me she saw me getting dressed a few times before going out. (they were around the house all the time but never noticed her looking). She ""slapped"" my face softly teasing and went on her knees. Unbutton my pants and took my cock out, just staring and stroking it. Gave it a soft kiss on the head, left me there pants down, and went to my room. I followed as i could, and she was laying on the tip of the bed, belly down, telling me to just slide it in her mouth. (Note: by that time, i only had sex with my high school gf, and never did or received oral cause she refused) So it was the first time i felt a mouth around my cock, quick instant moan, and she really gripped it with those nice lips, then licked all its length. I was so excited but i didn't want to cum yet, i wanted everything. So after a couple of minutes i turned her around and took off her pants and panties and went for it. It looks like I didn't know what i was doing (off course) and she pulled me up, I took off her tshirt and sucked those amazing tits. Every bit of them. It seemed to be very effective making her even more wet. She was so eager she just grabbed my cock and slid it in, telling me she was on the pill. At this point she lifted her legs and placed them on my body/shoulders, it felt so tight, she started moaning a bit louder with each thrust until she asked me to fuck her from behind. She placed herself on all fours and told me to fuck her harder. We both enjoyed it but i wanted to see those tits bouncing, so i stopped and told her to come on top. Well it didn't take long till i couldn't hold it anymore, i pulled out and exploded. She licked it all.

For me it was amazing, but she warned me i had to cum in her mouth next time, and she had a few tips on my pussy eating skills. We did this 3-4 times a week for the next months, eventually I perfected my oral skills with her being the greatest teacher to this young boy.
Second semester she had to leave for internship and never saw her again until a few months ago. (more interesting stories from that)

This was the start of many years of experiences and encounters with university girls from a variety of ages (and also post-univ, women on their 30's really know what they are doing), a very fit Mary included.

For the past few months I have known about this subreddit, I have laughed at the thought of submitting something here. I have laughed, thinking that even though I would like to commit suicide I would not do it, and searching for help here would be just silly.  
I've had psychological and psychiatric 'help' since 4 months ago. I tried two anti-depressants (Sertralinum and something else), to both I had severe unwanted reactions (flyer attached to the medication said that I should seriously-look-for-medical-help-RIGHT-NOW! if something like this happened), now I'm not taking any pills. I had serious thoughts about suicide for about 7-8 months. I was at the brink of doing it, but far enough that I thought I would never do it. I had no strength to commit, and I still had *some* life that I valued, that I didn't want to lose. Today my girlfriend of 2 years suddenly dumped me, she didn't even want to talk about it...  
  
This is a long text, I totally get it if you don't want read it all, read the last 2 sections at least.  
  
*Please consider that I am not a native English speaker and it is hard for me to proofread at the moment, some parts can be hard to understand.*  
  
***  
  
(this is my 'back-story', feel free to skip it: )  
  
I've been struggling with social interactions my whole life. It started when I was 10-11, when I was ostracized by my colleagues in school and I had no friends outside of it. I live outside of town, there were no kids around me almost my whole life, my parents have also frequently moved, I had no way of building relationships even if I wanted. This trend continues even today and many times I have tried to 'fix it' by pretending that I am someone I am not.  
  
When I was 13 I tried to 'build' myself a new personality, a mask. I wore 'gangsta' clothes (even though I was a small skinny boy), listened to music that deep inside I hated, etc. I found myself a 'girlfriend' that liked the values that I faked but apparently she didn't know we were a couple (we acted like a teenage couple, I just haven't *asked* her to be my girlfriend). This problems caused my first 'breakdown' and I didn't want to leave house to go to school for almost half a year. I switched schools, dropped all my previous friendships. With good help from a school psychologist/pedagogue and daily meetings with her over the course of 5-6 months I have slowly built my self respect by a tiny bit, from a total lack of it. I had to switch schools again, because at this age people go to a 'secondary school' of sorts for three years. My parent chose a private school where there were only &lt;30 kids. I haven't improved or regressed there. I still had no friends, I still spent all my time either waiting for my parents to pick me up from school (there was no practical way for me to return by myself, and my parents worked relatively nearby) or playing video games at home. Three years passed like this, the only people my age I had contact with was my class of 4 people. I felt relatively good though.  
  
After 3 years I finished this 'secondary school' and had to switch to a 'college', I was 17 then. I had made a decision that I will try again to build myself a 'mask'. I tried to act self-confident, I tried to join the *popular group*, I tried to wear fashionable clothes. I failed again. I was not that person, I didn't fit there. I 'locked out' myself again, I skipped classes all the time, I talked to maybe 1 person at school. I failed one year and I had to repeat it. I was put in another class by the school head teacher. I found 3 friends there, they too were ostracized in the past, they were amazingly intelligent and had nerdish hobbies. Perfect. Slowly but surely, up until 2 years ago, I have built this small group of 'friends'. They liked me for who I was, this slightly awkward depressive guy who lacks self-confidence. I went to study computer graphics, my life *'started'*.  
  
There is Piotrek. My best friend. We met few times a week, we never ran out of conversation subjects. He moved to another town, 2-hour train ride away, we have contact, but we rarely talk anymore. He has his own life now that is totally separate from mine. He is my best friend and the best person I have ever known.  
There was Ewa. I had crush on her, it didn't work, we remained friends for few years, our friendship ended.  
There was Karolina. My first girlfriend. I was 2 years with her. Looking back, I can see that I was a total asshole to her. I treated her not as good as I should. She dumped me.  
There was Basia. She was my best friend too. I have met her right after Peter left town. I have fucked up and the contact ended, she probably doesn't want to talk to me again. I know that it hit her really hard when our friendship *ended*.  
There was Gosia. She also studied computer graphics, we were in parallel groups. There was something between us for a short time, I naively thought that it may become a relationship.  
After Gosia I had hard time, I had another 'breakdown'. The only friend I had was Basia then but we met rather rarely, and I had to drop out of the computer graphics studies. I tried to build a mask again, I wanted a relationship, I wanted to not worry about being alone again, I wanted to feel 'cool'. Each 1-2 weeks I went to a party and tried to pick up a girl there. I always got phone number of the girl I liked the most. It always ended after 1-2 dates. I tried it with ~6 girls. I still feel like an idiot.  
2-3 months after it I have found a dating profile of a girl that lives nearby, I've seen her in the bus a few times. We went for a date, It worked, we liked each-other, we wanted more, we started dating. It went on for 2 years.

I was with Weronika for 2 years. We had troubles, we somehow semi-fixed them all. I still had troubles with myself during that time, but I always had Weronika, she almost always made me feel good and forget about it all. A year ago I have found a job as a web developer. I was supposed to wrote HTML 'skins' based on graphic design done by co-worker which then were converted to Wordpress by another co-worker. It started fine, I liked it, I am good at it. Soon after I started my boss found me some various 'side' jobs (fix broken websites of former-clients, provide support for new clients who bought our 'skins', anything that no one else wanted to do). I hated these, it was a 'trash' job. No one else wanted to do it because it required no skill or expertise. I did it anyway, because I was still a 'newbie'. 2 months before I quit the business expanded and they had to hire 4 new people. 2 of them had no previous HTML knowledge but were meant to be trained and hired for the same position as mine, HTML development. I still had to do the no-skill-or-expertise tasks. I was good, I knew what I was doing, I could do something important. I was forced into these trash tasks. Meanwhile the interns were finishing their first HTML 'skins'. I made the same money as them (even though I was supposed to get a 1k raise after 6 months), and the business laptop that the company gave me had to be shared with an intern. I quit. I felt unneeded and unappreciated. It was 7 months ago, around then problems with my gf started. Around then I started to think about suicide.  
  
In the past 7 months our relationship was slowly destroying itself. You see, I have problems to get out of bed in the morning, I don't have energy to look for a job, to start freelancing, I don't have energy to live. Between hating myself for my previous friendships and acquaintances, hating myself for not being able to work, and dreading my health problems, the relationship I had with Weronika was everything that gave me some joy and will to live day-to-day. Any energy I had I put into this relationship, because I was able to regain that energy when we (rarely) met. I had just enough energy to sustain the relationship for 7 months but it wasn't enough, Weronika 'let me do all the work', she rarely gave something back, she counted on me to sustain it. We talked over the internet for few hours daily, met maybe 1 time a week, rarely had sex, we rarely shared our problems.  
My day looks like this: I wake up 12:00-15:00, I go to eat some junk-food for breakfast, sit in front of the computer, and watch movies, watch series, play games, read reddit; I'm doing anything to not think about my life, because every time I do I end up overwhelmed and crying. I fear going to bed, I have to exhaust myself to the point where I know I will fall asleep in a few minutes, otherwise I risk thinking (and being overwhelmed again), I fall asleep anywhere between 03:00-07:00.

(today)  
  
I was on brink of committing suicide in the past 7 months. I 'knew' I would not do it because I hoped that my relationship will work soon again, and with Weronika's help I will slowly build self-respect again (as I did a few times in the past).  
  
I had no money recently, but I've made some simple t-shirt graphics for my sister few days ago and she paid me a little, so today I had money. We went for a bike ride with Weronika, I ordered pizza, we watched a movie, hung out in my garden on a hammock, we talked that tomorrow we will meet again at my place and later this week we will go out on a date, for a coffee, maybe to the zoo (she really wanted to eat some candy-floss and this is the only place I know they sell it), we wanted to go visit my uncle's fabrics shop next week, he said that he will give her some fabrics, so she can start to sew clothes (she wants to have her own boutique someday). We were having good time. We then went to my room and laid on bed, we were snuggling and the mood was right so I tried to initiate, by kissing her neck and touching her. She said 'No.' pushed me away from under the blanket and out of bed. It was a good day, we were happy, she never did that, so I tried to talk. I had to pull her tongue an she finally said that she doesn't need the physical part, she doesn't need the relationship, she wants to be friends (she rarely wants to meet with me and we haven't really talked about anything important for some time... how is that friendship?), that she is tired. She also said that she is disappointed with how I live, and that she hates that I rarely have money. Her idea of fixing our relationship is this: we should find our own friends and spend time with them and not ourselves. While I agree that overly relying on another person is bad, I see no way of living else-way myself (all my friendships and acquaintances had ended long time ago). Also, committing this little time she had, that we spent together (1 day a week usually, often twice in a month, rarely it happens that we met 2-3 times in a week) to other people would mean we would not meet at all (am I wrong thinking that this would be counterproductive?). She said we should end this relationship. After she said that she said she needs to go because she has math private lessons later today so she needs to do some homework. She then open the door and left. I went after her to ask if we could talk some more, we **need** to talk, she reluctantly said that *maybe* she will come to my place tomorrow. She left without saying goodbye even.  
  
Maybe she will come back to me... Right?  
  
(/today)

**(my fears)**  
  
I felt unneeded and worthless for the past 7 months, today I feel worse than that. For the past 7 months I saw no bright future in front of me but a tiny spark of hope-that-maybe-everything-will-be-alright, today I see a black hole. For the past 7 months I was one step away of committing suicide, now I am certain that I will do it, I just don't have the energy at this moment, and have not planned yet on how to maximize the chances that I will die and not just maim myself.  
  
I'm jobless, welfare system earnestly wants to kick me out, I have no friends, girlfriend dumped me, family either despises me (I know I hate them) or just don't know how to help me, I don't have social skills, I have no money, I don't have energy, I have skills but I can't force myself to use them, I feel that I am getting dumber every day, I'm emaciated, my teeth are really bad, I have back problems, I have heart problems, I have an undiagnosed Marfan syndrome. I fear that I will not be able to live even as 'good' I did before, I fear that I will be locked in a mental ward. Psychiatric and psychological help here is a farce. My aunt had similar problems, they locked her in a mental ward when she was about my age, it only worsened her state. She is 70 now and still lives with my grandfather, she has no social skills either, she is scared of life and people. I don't want to end like her. Living where I live (2hrs bus ride from nearest town) and being who I am I won't be able to find help. I want to kill myself, and escape it all.  
  
It will **not** be OK."

Anybody familiar with my situation?
Any feedback would be valued &amp; appreciated.

- UCONN's program seems a little more difficult.
- I could get a BS in Comp Science from CCSU in 2 years. 
- The same degree would take 3 years from UCONN.

I would like to attend the program that will:
- Prepare me the best for a career as a Software Developer/Engineer
- Has the best internships
- has a decent starting salary / benefits

Thank you."

Our apartment management has taken it upon themselves to promote our complex as the ""cool summer party destination"" and has loud rap music blasting Friday-Sunday. The sound is to the level where I can't drown it out with white noise through my surround sound and to top it off most of the people that are now hanging out at the pool do not live here and do not seem to be in college at all. It seems through twitter that the hired DJ is inviting his friends (he has 2-3k followers) and they come to our pool, trash it, and then loiter around the parking lot for hours afterwards.

I'm at a loss for words at this point. I'm locked into a lease with this place and they only seem to be interested in providing a ""come do whatever you want"" atmosphere. Even now I'm trying to do tax accounting and I keep hearing that damn bass.

271s4c,3,2014-06-01,I [25F] caught my [24 M] boyfriend of 5 years lying to me again and there are other issues...,mar8925,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/271s4c/i_25f_caught_my_24_m_boyfriend_of_5_years_lying/,"I apologize for this long rant. I just truly need some advice about my relationship and I don't want to bother those that are close to me with all this...

My boyfriend worked a night shift last night. The restaurant he works at is just minutes away and he wasn't home by 11pm which is unusual. I gave him a call to see if he was getting out soon and he didn't pick up. No bigigie, I figured it was just really busy that night.

He texts me minutes later and says that he went over his friend ""Bob's"" house and he would be back shortly. Honestly, I was a bit annoyed by this because he could've picked up his phone and told me that rather than texting me. And given some of his previous behavior (I'll explain later) I found this suspicious. But whatever and I wait.

About 30 minutes later he texts and tells me that he went to a local Bdubs to drink with some work friends. Now I'm suspicious. I won't go into all of the details and how I found out...but long story short he never was at ""Bob's"". He was at Bdubs drinking with work friends and didn't want me to know and lied to me about it.

Now, if this was an isolated incident it would probably be ridiculous for me to be so upset. But he has lied to me before about stupid stuff like this. And I always have to CATCH him in a lie. We have had several conversations and arguments about his lying before and I've told him that I lose trust for him every single time he does it.  Yet, for some reason he can't seem to understand why I no longer trust him...How can I trust someone with serious matters when he lies about small stuff over and over again?

Further background.

We have been dating for almost 5 years and have been living together for almost 2 years. We both graduated from a top 25 university but  IMO don't have a whole lot to show for it...

I graduated 2 years ago. I spent 1 year after school trying to figure out what the hell I truly wanted to do with my life.  Once I got a little self-confidence and stopped smoking weed, I started applying to jobs but I wasn't getting any call-backs. Finally, I landed an internship at a university. Now, I am a GA there. This isn't exactly what I thought I'd be doing after graduation but at least it's something and I'm trying.

My boyfriend graduated a year ago and has made no efforts to even start a resume. I have offered several times to help him with it because I know he lacks self-confidence but he keeps putting it off. He won't stop smoking weed. He has pretended to stop by not smoking in the apartment but he will come home after spending time elsewhere but I can tell from his eyes... He waits tables at the same restaurant that I do and he keeps hanging out with people from work. The majority of them are alcoholics, they pop pills like it's nothing, smoke weed everyday...Now, I don't believe that we are better than them or anyone else. BUT if we are to make something of ourselves I don't think it's a good idea to be around these people on a regular basis...

He makes enough money serving and his Dad gives him 500 dollars a month. On top of that, his Dad pays his car payment...The only monthly bill he has is his car insurance and food. But just the other day, my boyfriend asked to borrow money from me for Comcast because it was about to be shut off. Where the heck is all the money going? 

I have to consistently ask him to pick up around the apartment like a child. And every time he completes a chore he wants praise...like a child. 

He can't keep promises. He will say that he will do this or that but nothing happens. I have to nag for him to do things and even then it won't happen for months.

I don't know why I'm babbling right now...I could go on forever. He isn't a terrible person and can often be the sweetest guy. And I am FAR from perfect. I'm just tired of being lied to about stuff like this and I wonder if he is lying about bigger things. And after 5 years I simply expect more. I just can't figure out if I'm being blind or if I'm just making mountains out of molehills. At 25 and 24, we are both young but should I expect more? Sometimes I feel so petty. Please help!

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend lied to me again, should I be worried about bigger issues?"
271svj,4,2014-06-01,I feel like I cannot trust anyone.,[deleted],introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/271svj/i_feel_like_i_cannot_trust_anyone/,"As an introvert, I feel am a good person to confide in, as I naturally am not the type to tell everyone what you just said.  Nor am I the type to care what people are talking about, I'm so stuck in my own head that I mind my own business.

However, I find that there is no one else who does the same - I can't complain, or confide in anyone without them telling someone else, especially the person I was talking about!!  This drives me crazy and it makes me feel like I can't complain/confide to anyone - even my closest friends and relatives.

The other day, my manager called me and said the guy in the cubicle next to me was listening in on my conversations with a new intern (I was just giving her the run down of when it's ok to use your cell phone, how my internship went, etc.).  He had his ear pressed against the wall and someone told my manager to warn me.  This disturbed me so much - I naturally assumed everyone else was like me - not giving any care to what other people were saying in their private conversations, thus not listening.

I am now afraid to talk in fear of someone constantly listening.  I also feel like I cannot complain or confide in anyone without them telling.

Does anyone else have this problem?  How do you deal with it?"
271w38,3,2014-06-01,Class Project?,tryingtofindaproject,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/271w38/class_project/,"Edit: btw sorry if this seemed like the wrong place to post. I don't know if engineering students would have been the correct place to put it, or CPUDesign or Chipdesign, they seemed more industry oriented. 

this is an extremely long post, so I apologize in advance and thank anyone who reads it. 

My classmate and I will be taking an independent study on Computer Architecture in the fall, essentially the graduate class. It is hardly offered so we talked to a professor who usually teaches that course if we could do a course under them. 

Well we finished our first computer architecure class a semester ago, with our final project being a pipelines processor using MIPS. We hadn't decided what kind of a project to work on over the summer and possibly into the fall. 

Over the summer we would cover all the foundation concepts of computer architecture, such as cache memory from a systems perspective or instruction and data level parallelism and the fall course talks about some more foundation material, such as more detail into threading, on chip networking, advancements in memory design and so on. The class project is more of a term paper, following IEEE guidelines on a recent advancement in computer architecture. 

Aside from our homework assignments and labs, which we've started, we don't have any project decided upon. Since we do have two semesesters we think it might be a good decision to do a large scale project. We  aren't part of a large university or well known, but we've looked into all the comp arch courses at other top level schools and seen that some do a large scale project, such as a superscalar processor. We thought maybe since we had two semesters that may not be a bad idea. 

We talked about this to a graduate student whos studying in VlSI design and he suggested that instead of just remaking our own cpu using an isa like MIPS or ARM, we could work on an open source project and actually contribute to the community and that might make our profile stand out more for applications. Neither of us have yet had internships and we are sophmores so we would like to do as many extracurricular projects to make us seem more applealing to companies. He said we should work on something like opensparc or openrisc, established projects that we can work on to improve microarchitecturally and see the results by actually testing out C code or making variations to the current design, more so with openrosc and learning about being engineers and the method of tradeoffs for power consumption, cpi and area used. The added benefit of opensparc is that there is a course Ive seen from UTexas that uses the sparc project to teach VLSI design. That's a bit too much for us obviously, but I have some experience in using Cadences design suite and Ive laid out a simple 8bit processor following a book before to learn about it, and I wouldn't mind spending an extra semester working on those skills before senior year myself. 

What do you guys think? Should we just make our own implementation of a set ISA or work on an open source project? 

Background: both he and I have taken one course in digital logic and one course in computer architecture. I've also taken a course on VLSI layout but that was more on using algorithms and just foundation things. I did use Cadence there to layout some other simple class projects. Both he and I have just over a year of experience with verilog, we've done three major projects using it and most of our class assignments. We've done one major verification project using SystemVerilog. 

Thanks for any help you guys can give. I know it's a tall order, but I wanted to make a sound decision before jumping in."

It hurt to think. Julia Edwards' head pounded, scattering her thoughts.

*Where am I?*

*What happened?*

She glanced around at the metallic chamber that surrounded her. It was spotless and there wasn't a single flaw or rivet in its curved surface. 

*Why does my head hurt?*

Sitting up, she glanced around the room's interior. Save for the President of the former United States, it was completely empty. Light seemed to come from every direction and no direction all at once.

Then it came back to her. Slowly at first, then in a flood of memories.

*Air Force One.*

She had been half asleep on the bed near the rear of the plane. Her husband had just promised to meet her. A space ship in South Dakota was the destination. *New Horizons*, built by a company called Ethereal Concepts. She had seen the advertisements. 

""Sign up today,"" the billboards had read, ""and take one giant leap for mankind!""

Hilary told her that the Secretary of Defense had left the White House to get to the complex and commandeer the craft by force. 

""Why wasn't I told?"" Julia demanded to know.

""Ma'am,"" her Chief of Staff replied, ""I proposed the idea to you myself several times today. You acted like you didn't even hear me.""

*I'm not sure I did.* Julia thought in agreement. *Today has been a long day.*

When she had been filled in on the rest of the plan, she agreed that while it wasn't much, it was something. The mission would go ahead to Mars as planned. From there, maybe they could continue to be in command of what few assets that remained at their posts. 

*Maybe.*

Who was she kidding? It was a horrible, desperate idea. It was also the only one anyone had left.

*Run and hide.*

That had all been before she had spoken to James and then laid down to sleep. As she felt herself sinking into unconsciousness, they attacked.

A flash so bright that she could see the blood vessels on the inside of her closed eyelids had been followed by a roar and turbulence that Julia was sure would shake Air Force One apart. She had bolted upright and made her way quickly to the window of her plane.

The alien vessel was so close that she couldn't see anything besides the curve of its metal hull, illuminated by the lights on the wings of Air Force One. A second later, one of the dozen escorting jets shot past the window in a blur of motion. A dozen alien craft in close pursuit. She heard explosions, muffled by the plane's reinforced hull.

The fighters, taken by surprise when the giant ship had jumped out of warp right on top of them, were no match for the enemy.

They fell rapidly in streaking fireballs toward the ground below. Air Force One was not engaged. 

The pilot tried to break off, but the alien craft matched the ship in speed and movement.

Julia ran to the door to her quarters. She heard shouting in the hall. 

When she opened the door, she saw Secret Service agents running this way and that, their guns drawn in anticipation. Hilary looked petrified, clutching a stack of papers as though they might offer her some salvation.

*Thud. Thud. Thud.*

The impacts rang out inside of the ship. 

""We're hit!"" cried one of the interns, a young blonde, in panic. 

Suddenly, blades sheared through the hull of the aircraft. Within seconds they had cut a hole out of the side of the plane. The decompression threw Julia forward into one of the seats in front of her. The suction pinned her against its frame. 

She saw Hilary lose her grip and begin sliding towards the gaping hole that had appeared in the side of Air Force One. Her screaming was audible, even over the roar of the wind outside. As the Chief of Staff neared the wailing abyss, a great arm reached down and grabbed her.

It was not human.

The armored figure lifted her up like a rag doll with one arm. Using its other arms it pulled itself in through the hole it had made. 

The thing held her at eye level for a few moments, seemingly regarding her behind the jet-black glass of its visor. She thrashed and kicked to no avail. Then, almost flippantly, it tossed her out the hole behind it. Her screams were lost in the roaring winds.

It was getting hard to breath. Julia tried to move, but her arms were not strong enough. Instead she watched in horror as two more of the aliens followed the first into the plane. 

Concussions rang out as the Secret Service agents, who having finally braced themselves against the suction, were emptying their pistol ammo at the enemy. 

The aliens shrugged off the bullets with ease. 

When they ran out of bullets, Julia watched as two of the agents gave each other a look. 

Even with all of the commotion, one look was all it took, she saw them steel themselves. Then, with a ferocious war cry, the pair of agents launched themselves at the alien closest to the hole. It turned to face them, sickeningly long blades extending out from its upper arms. 

They crashed into the alien, who struggled to hold its ground. The two men let out one last roar and with a final heave, all three toppled out of the hole and vanished into the night sky. Even Egixa armor was not made to withstand an impact at terminal velocity. 

If there was a Valhalla, Julia knew where she'd find her two agents.

One of the armored monstrosities charged the remaining agents,its blades flashing in the fluorescent light. Bright red blood splattered far and wide across the interior of the Presidential plane.

The remaining alien glanced around the craft. 

Then it  saw her. The thing stepped towards her. 

It paused just within arms reach of the redheaded woman, ""President Edwards?"" She heard a robotic voice ask over the howling winds.

She nodded, beginning to feel light-headed.

The last thing she remembered was it reaching towards her with its cruel talons.

Now she was here... wherever here was.

*What will they do with me?*

She wasn't sure she really wanted to know the answer.

2721kv,4,2014-06-01,The current situation in our 'family',throw_-_away12,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2721kv/the_current_situation_in_our_family/,"So, this is going to be a long story, and I would like to apologize in advance for any misspelled words or any incorrect grammar because English is not my native language.

Well, where to begin? Yes, I know. I was 7 when my parents got a divorce, at this time I was not really aware of the consequences that it might have on me or my (2) sisters lifes. But you know, it just happend. 

My parents made a deal that us, the children, would see both parents the same amount of time. This was done by living one week with my dad, and then moving our butts to my mom to live there a week. You might think that this deal is a lot of work, but in a few years time we were all used to it and it was just every day business. And also included in this deal was that my parents would have a 'meeting' every 3 months to talk about us, how we were doing etc. But after a few clashes and fights (verbal) those meetings were abolished and replaced by e-mails. 

These monthly e-mails were going on for about a year and then the big clash happend between my parents, my dad an my mom simultaneously accused eachother of withholding money from the other (they both split the money they received from the government for having kids). So it went to court, and to my knowledge this case is still undecided. So you do understand that there are some pretty fucking serious tensions in our 'family'.

At about this time my oldest sister is in the second class of high school and struggeling with her  homework and grades, so she decides to live with my mom to get some rest and to focus more on her homework. So now she does not have to move her butt weekly and she is finally able to get better grades, I think, good for her! But, I still believe that a child of divorced parents should see his of her parents the same amount of time, but at that momens it was not relevant because education is a more important matter. 

Now you can obviously understand that my dad was not really amused by this and he 'obviously' accused my mother of seducing my sister into living with her. And even more tensions arise. Lovely.

But fastforward 2 years, my older sister is in her graduation year and is still struggeling. But I can tell you, this is not because of divorced parents, but because of a abusive, selfish and manipulative boyfriend, let's call him **John**. So John and my sister met eachother a year ago, and in the beginning he seemed to be a nice guy and I liked him. But in time he grew into a monster that was (and still is) eating up my sister from the inside out. It was so bad eventually that my mother had to put a stop to the 'relationship'. Wich my sister did not like, she still loved him after all he did to her! So my sister was angry towards my mom and talked to my dad about it. 

Now here comes the shitstorm from the past couple of months. My sister went to my mother telling her that she still wanted a relationship with John and that she also wanted to see her dad more, so she wanted to go back to the weekly deal thing. My mom agreed to the latter but dit not like that she was back into a relationship with John. But whatever, if she wants to be a big girl she can act like one my mom said.

So not even a week goes by and my mom is called by my dad (wich NEVER happens). So my dad tells her that my sister has made a decision to live with him, and see her maybe twice a month. It's devastating to my mother. And then, a day after that my dad calls again to tell that my younger sister also decided the same. Wich is even more devastating, but she is okay with it, she says she sees the mistake she made by ending the relationship with John without consolting my sister about it. But both of my sisters don't react to it.

Fastforward 3 months and my oldest sister has been here (at my mom's place) twice since the 'situation'. And the youngest has been here once. So with me away on internship, my mother is only with her wife, and has not seen her children in about three months. Now I know there are aguments saying this is all my mothers fault because of the John relation thing, but even if it were her fault she is punished waaay to hard for it. 

And now, this very week when we should have had a family weekend, both of my sisters bail out, and also tell her that they will not be joining my mom on holidays anymore. Me neither because of work. So my mom is (as she calls it herself) un-motherd. And she is devastated.
I have always known my mom being happy, but the last two months it is all going down hill. I've never seen her like this before, never ever. And it hurts me, and my stepmom to see her like this. I can only watch and hope that the situation betters, and I can only hope that these two selfish teenage girls see what they are doing to the own god damn mother. 

I know this story is nothing compared to the other stuff I see on this subreddit but I still needed to get this off my chest. I want to thank everyone who read this and I want to remind you all that [this is one of the most important things in the world](http://imgur.com/h4kFnxH). I hope you all have a great day!

I graduated in 2012 with my BA in Biology from Rutgers. My gpa was a 3.0.
Did well in the upper level courses, fucked around too much as a sophomore. Suffered two sudden deaths as a junior. Impacted my grades for a semester. 

Plan was premed but with my grades and wih advice from a few doctor friends, was steered away from that. I had also completed an internship with Thomas Jefferson hospital in their emergency dept. excelled at it but not in love with it. More interested in regenerative medicine research. 

So I thought phd. Talked to my cousin who's a chem phd. Took gre. Perfect score English, not so great qApplied to programs. Apparently all the interesting ones are engineering programs, for which I didn't have the prerequisite math foundation required. By one school was told if I had applied to a bio program I most likely would have been accepted. That was kind of a bummer lol. 

So for two years I have been delivering pizzas and now I have moved into the city with my gf. I want to make more money to be more comfortable and to be able to support us more. I feel like I have wasted two years of my life. I feel like a failure sometimes. I compare myself to my younger, more successful brother even tho I shouldn't. 

I basically feel paralyzed. Every bio job I have ever applied for, which I'll admit wasn't a impressive amount, I never heard anything back. I had two internships, elected to student governemt, Amsa, lab work 1.5 years. Capable, confident (mostly). Independent. 

My mom found me some job listings for medical sales. I can post a link if anybody actually responds or is interested. I'm gonna try and apply for these. Any advice would be appreciated. 

I'm also slowly teaching myself unix. My dad is a sys administrator. He thinks if I teach myself unix I can get a job in it easy making good money. I'm eventually planning in learning python and some other programming languages. Maybe later try to crossover into regen medicine that way, on the it side. My dad thinks I would have a better shot that way. 

Anyway. I appreciated you guys reading and any advice you might have. Bottom line is I need to start making more money and I'm looking for more like a 9-5 with benefits 401k etc. I wanna start saving for retirement. I'm 25. Living hand to mouth basically lol. Help. "

I spent last summer at Cornell University for six weeks taking an intro to engineering, fundamental computer science(matlab), and a reading and writing course.

272j4b,0,2014-06-01,Is it feasible to work as both a geotechnical and structural engineer?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/272j4b/is_it_feasible_to_work_as_both_a_geotechnical_and/,"Hi /r/engineering, 


I’m a recent B.S. in Civil Engineering graduate, and will be finishing my thesis for a M.S. in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering in about another year. My M.S. degree will have a specialization in Geotechnical Engineering, although my coursework will be split about half geotechnical, and half structural by the time I graduate. To date, I have my EIT, and some experience which includes a single summer internship experience with a geotechnical consulting firm, and the rest being mostly research related internships and work. 


My dilemma as of late is that I’ve been uncertain of how to reconcile my desire to work in both the structural, and geotechnical profession. What drew me to pick geotechnical engineering for my technical specialization was initially the uncertainty and variability inherent with many problems and the rationalization required by the engineer to go about solving those problems. To the same extent, I find that I still have a lingering passion for doing structural analysis/design.  


Ideally, I would like my career to involve solving a combination of geotechnical and structural problems, but based on my limited experience, observations and preliminary investigation, I’m unaware of a plausible pathway for this to work. Whenever I speak with geotechnical and structural engineering professionals, it always seems like there is a very distinct delineation between the two disciplines, which leads me to believe there’s not some middle ground, and it’s either one or the other. 


I’m hoping to get some guidance and recommendations on what my potential options are for working in both areas, if such options exist, and perhaps what type of companies provide this opportunity. Has anyone experienced similar desires, and how did you go about attempting to address it, and how did it work out for you? Has anyone obtained licensure as both a G.E. and S.E., and what type of work do you mostly do?

I grew up in an extremely abusive situation (sexual, physical, emotional abuse, neglect) and have PTSD and some lingering issues. I'm in pretty intensive therapy which has been hard, and for a long time I wasn't dating anyone (about a year) after getting out of a super abusive relationship in which my ex raped me and would pretty emotionally batter me. Then my boyfriend (John) came along. He's smart and he's a genuine sweetheart. I actually came on to him, and we've been pretty happy together ever since. When we moved from the 'hooking up/cuddling/going on the occasional date' to 'officially in a relationship', I talked to him a lot about my fears and how I felt like I was being too clingy or like I was going to sabotage things.

He's been so good about all of this. He really has. He's helped me out when I'm crying, he's been calm and helpful and nothing but supportive, and i hope I've been supportive of him. I've called him terrified, telling him that I don't want to tell him what's wrong because I think he'll leave me, and he tells me he won't and talks to me and listens and tries to get me to see the bright side.

The other day he told me he loves me for the first time. And ever since (we are currently long distance as he has an internship at a state university and I'm working until August) I haven't been able to be calm. I keep having panic attacks and crying spells and being really irritated and frustrated. A big, rash part of me wants to break up with him, because I'm terrified of him loving me. I'm terrified that he's lying, I'm having trouble believing him (I have no reason not to), and I'm basically just a mess.

I don't know what's wrong. This should be happy. But I think that I'm so scared to love him, to be so vulnerable with someone. But I feel like if I'm going to be vulnerable with anyone, John is the one to do it with, because he has been nothing but supportive. 

What do I do?


---   
**tl;dr**: My very supportive boyfriend puts up with my crazy PTSD and abandonment issues with such grace, tells me he loves me, and now I'm freaking out because I'm convinced I'm not loveable and considering breaking up with him because I'm so scared. What do I do?"

That's not to say that I haven't lead a busy life — I've always had a packed schedule, and even today I'm juggling school, an internship, freelance work, and the production of a full-length documentary. I really love what I do, but I feel like my wariness towards dating in general has, impart, fostered my workaholic nature. 

Through the usual lineup of teenage silliness and heartbreaks, I feel as if I've come to associate dating with distraction and pain. At the same time, however, I'm terrified that I'll end up like so many people in my family, who either lost The Great Romance of their lives, or never experienced it at all, and are now really jaded. So, I feel like I'm in a sort of catch-22, where I want to be with someone, but am so fixated on the unknown of the end, that I throw myself into work and ""busyness"" so that I have a convenient excuse for not successfully dating. I also don't know how I'll be able to break this habit — my family and community view me as someone who has her shit together, and they're constantly saying things to me like ""MacHead, you're going to be fine. You're a successful woman in the making, and you'll have your pick of the men once you reach the top."" 

I don't know if anyone else does this, but I'm throwing this tangent out into the interwebs to see if anything sticks.

272za2,1,2014-06-01,Problems with an internship,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/272za2/problems_with_an_internship/,"So to give a bit of background, I'm a 21 year old male in a computer science major that is about to enter senior year this fall. I have been working in IT for about two years, primarily as server/end-user support in the university I attend. During the past two semesters I have also been running an organization based on the development of college students in the CS/IT world in order to get them ready for life in the working world.

Originally I pursued a degree in history, but after looking at job prospects I basically turned myself around and decided to enter the wonderful world of computers. While it has been a very hard path, mainly because of my inability to focus on math well, I have done very well in my classes. Finishing my last semester with a 3.8-something GPA and bringing myself to a 3.4-ish overall!

However after this past semester, which really did kick my ass despite the good grades, I ended up taking an offer for an internship for 10-weeks at a major corporation (which will go un-named for sake of privacy). I was placed in an IT sector of the company that was basically kept in the dark until about two weeks before the orientation job. I'll get to that in a second.

The first day went as expected for an internship. Learn about the company, finalize some paperwork, meet your team, tour facility and get an idea of what I'll be doing. People are all nice enough, environment is awesome in this one building, however I won't be working there. No biggie, they must do just carbon copies of these buildings, right? 

Day two comes along and it lands me in truthfully my worst nightmare and thing I desperately tried to avoid when going through interviews, which was a cubical farm. I'm given an idea of what I'll be doing for the next 12 weeks now and quickly find out over the course of the week a few things.

1. I don't enjoy anything about what I'll be working on. I've always been one to work on Windows environments, this work is all Unix/AIX/Red Hat.

2. The stuff I am working on isn't relevant to anything I expressed interest in during the interview. Instead of being placed in a security field or web app development, I have been kind of thrown in a compliance software management team.

3. I am not a person who can do cubical work. Some people can, I cannot. I've always been one to be walking around, working with my hands, helping people in some way or trying to figure out solutions to problems.

4. Basically I've been told that I'll be put in a sandbox environment for everything I do. While I know this is for security reasons, I had been told earlier that I'd be at least working on low impact projects, not a walled off project. 

5. I feel burned out. Partially from how the past two semesters have gone and also from the constant work I've been doing on the side during these semesters. I wake up and literally just do not feel like going to my internship knowing that for the next 8-ish hours I'll just be sitting around watching other people type on things while I take notes on subjects I hardly understand.

If anyone has any advice on what to do, I'm open to hearing it. Thank you for reading this, I know its a bit ranty and maybe a few of you will find it to be just a young college kid bitching about work. For some reason though every time I come home from this job I just feel nothing but hate for it and it's been really hard to pin down the main reason why I dislike this job so much. "
2734oa,59,2014-06-02,Ride Along,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2734oa/ride_along/,"5 summers ago, I interned with the local prosecutor's office. All of the intern's were taken on a tour of the jail and forensic lab, and the lab offered to let us all do a ride along. Almost everyone jumped at the chance, so we signed up. 

Week after week interns rode along, and week after week they came back disappointed. Nothing interesting happened, and most never left the lab. My ride along was schedule for a Friday night, 3pm to 11pm. 

The day of my ride along, I was listening to jail calls at work when I got an email from one of the big wigs. The CLE (continuing legal education) she was supposed to teach that day was cancelled. She had to attend an infant homicide investigation. It was 2:30pm.

&gt;Oh God, I thought. 

I didn't want to sit in the lab all night, but I didn't want to go to an infant homicide scene either. One of my bosses came to my office, 

&gt;Did you see Big Wig's email?

&gt;Yeah.....

&gt;Good luck.

At 2:45pm, I walked over to the forensics lab. When I arrived, the secretary told me I'd have to wait. 

&gt;Everyone is in a meeting. There was an incident. You might be the first ride along to see any action in weeks.

Lucky me, I thought. 

I waited about 20 minutes before the head CSI guy came out. He took me down to the lab. I signed  a waiver. He introduced me to Sarah. I'd do my first ride along with her, because everyone else was headed to the infant homicide. Sarah was headed to the north-side where the police had just served a search warrant.

I was relieved. I was going to get to go on a real ride along, but I wouldn't be at the infant homicide.

&gt;Sarah: You ready?

&gt;Me: Yeah.

&gt;Sarah: It'll be pretty straightforward. We just have to go collect some bedding, take some pics, and sketch the scene.

&gt;Me: Collect bedding?

&gt;Sarah: Yeah, the cops just busted a child sex ring. At this home, a 13 year-old mentally handicap girl was forced to have sex with men and women for money. We have to go collect the bedding so we can test for DNA.

My relief quickly vanished.

I could describe the scene in detail, but there isn't much to say. It was filthy. The worst part was the children's toys mixed with very adult garbage. Three children lived in this house....well existed. I don't know if i'd call it living. 

Some of the cops were wearing ski-mask type covers on their face and gloves. Not an inch of skin exposed. Apparently, they were undercover and part of the reason the ring had been discovered. They had to protect their identity, but it just made the scene creepier. 

The grandmother was there waiting for the kids to come home from school. The mom had taken her handicap daughter to the hospital. Apparently, it was the girls father and his girlfriend that forced the  her to have sex with strangers when mom and grandma were at work/gone. When the kids arrived they were so excited to see real cops. The cops showed the kids their badges, their tool belt, they let them talk to another cop on the walkie. The cops kept everyone from going upstairs, but they also did their best to keep the kids from wondering what exactly Sarah and I were doing.

We left. Sarah explained to me just how deep some of the undercover cops could get. It was intense and terrifying. When we got back to the lab, Sarah put me in a side room with a TV.  She needed to check in all the evidence, order labs, and write up a report. I watched Friends for all of 10 minutes before, 

&gt;Hey kid. You want to do another ride along?

I was 22 at the time, so I wasn't a kid. But Greg was at least 40. 

&gt;Sure. Where are we going?

&gt;Some asshole beat a baby to death. 

My heart skipped a beat. The infant homicide. I thought they had already left for that!

&gt;Oh.....

&gt;Come on. The coroner and a detective are going to meet us at the scene.

Turns out they only had an arrest warrant earlier. Now they had a search warrant, and it was for the whole house. The house was small. It was also hell. 

When we got to the scene the detective was waiting for us. He debriefed us. The baby's mom had dropped the child off for a week with her father. Mom was going on vacation. Mom had wanted her mom to watch the girl, but Dad insisted on watching her. Dad lived with his current girlfriend and her 3 year old son. Dad did not work, so he watched his daughter and his girlfriend's son why the girlfriend went to work. After one day, the dad called his mom begging her to come take her granddaughter. He couldn't handle her. All she did was cry, he told his mom. The grandma told him to man up. The dad beat his daughter to death on day 3. He beat a baby to death b/c she cried. 

The coroner arrived. He said the baby had a weird bruise that he thinks was caused by a blunt object. The father hit her so hard her rectum prolapsed. Her insides literally exploded out of her. She also had bleeding in her brain, a ruptured eye, cracked ribs, and a collapsed lung. Then the coroner did something I was not prepared for, he pulled out an ipad and showed us pictures of this tiny innocent baby. 

He showed us the weird bruising. We needed to find something that could match it. 

We went inside. The floor was sticky. The house smelled like feces. We quickly discovered it was because the dad had just put his daughters (and girlfriend's sons) diapers in a corner on the floor in the kitchen. There were at least 20 diapers. We had to sort through them. Two were beyond bloody. 

We looked through the kitchen. We didn't find an item that matched the bruising. What we did find: A rat, dishes drowning in grease, dishes caked with dried food, cereal with rat droppings in it, formula with rat droppings, and a pile of dirty laundry. The washing machine was in the kitchen. We went through the dirty laundry. More blood, this time on a princess blanket. 

We went to the bathroom. There was hair and what appeared to be a piece of scalp in the garbage can next to the toilet. This was the only part of the house that did not smell like feces....that was b/c it reeked of bleach. Again, no item matching the bruising. 

The detective stepped out to make a phone call. Greg went to check a spare room. I went to the ""play room"". Although, I'm not sure how much playing the kids did in there. There were plenty of toys, but also a box cutter, rat poison, and what appeared to be weed. The box cutter was next to a doll house. The rat poison was just laying in the middle of the room. And the weed was sitting in the toy box. 

I decided to venture into the bedroom. No on had ventured in there yet. We knew this is where everyone slept, but we were putting it off. I looked at the pack-n-play. There was random bits of plastic inside. It looked like it may have been from a mobile, but now it was just random green plastic with jagged edges. I doubt this was safe for a baby to play with. 

I decided not to touch the bed. There were plates of food on it and on the night stand. A cockroach was enjoying the remains of the food. I opened the closet door, and I almost vomited. A mouse was caught in a trap, but it wasn't quite dead. It's legs tried to wiggle itself free. A cockroach was already sitting on top of it ready to eat it. I closed the closet door. 

I held my head in my hands and bent down into a squatted position. I was trying not to faint or breakdown. I looked at the floor. It was covered in wire hangers. Including one hanger that had been unwound. I called for Greg. He finally entered the bedroom. He looked pale. I pointed at the hangers, including the one that was unwound. Greg called for the detective and the coroner. We think he beat her with a wire hanger. 
 
I helped Greg bag up more things, and we did a backlight of the bed. It was filthy. Then Greg had to do a video of the entire house. On big crimes scenes, they don't just sketch it. They do a video walkthrough. The detective told me to come sit in his car. 

&gt;My boss is about to interrogate the dad. We can watch.

I listened as this dad explained in detail what he did. He admitted to beating the girl with a hanger when she wouldn't stop crying. Shockingly, the beating did not quiet her down. The captain brought out a prop, a baby doll. The dad picked up the baby doll and showed the captain how he shook the baby, how squeezed her so tight he was ""sure her eyes would pop out of her head"". He threw her into the pack-n-play and went to play xbox in the spare room. She didn't cry for hours. 

When he finally went to check on her, he couldn't get her to eat and her diaper was full of blood. She whimpered and ""made a wheezing sound."" He bathed her and her hair fell out. That is when he called 911. He didn't mean to kill her, but she just wouldn't stop crying. She died in the ambulance. 

She was alive after that beating for at least 4 hours. She laid in her pack-n-play barely able to breathe, rectal protruding, bleeding internally. She suffered alone, in pain, for 4 hours before he called 911. She might have lived had he called immediately, but instead she died slowly and in pain. All because she wouldn't stop crying, b/c she was hungry. The rats got into the formula and he hadn't ""had the chance to buy more"". He just gave her sugar water. But he didn't mean to kill her....

It has been nearly 5 years, and I can still walk through this house in my head. I can still see the pictures of that baby. I want to say it was the worst experience of my life, but that seems wrong. I only had to walk through this house for a few hours. That little baby had to live and die there. I still think about her from time to time, and I pray that there is an afterlife and that she is finally in a place where she feels safe and loved. I have to believe she is, because I can't stand to think of all the innocent babies, animals, children, etc. that live only to suffer at the hands of some of the world's worst monsters....the ones that are supposed to love them."

I'm looking to possibly work in Frankfurt for the summer as an intern (not expecting a paid internship). I have a place to live covered. I've been to Frankfurt before so I know I'll love it. Anyways, any suggestions? 

About me, I speak and write German decently and plan on being B2 by next summer. (I'm a2-b1) I lived in Vienna and Oberösterreich for a year and a half. And most importantly I'm studying computer science. I write in Python but by summer I'll have taken classes and worked with C++ and Java.


Oh, and I'm American! I'm not worried about getting a ""visum"" cause I'll only be there 1-3 months anywho.

Quite some struggles with university, personal ambitions and social life.

But I am remaining calm, I feel like I am finally letting go of my situational responses where I freak out. There is a slight nagging feeling of 'You are making a mess, quickly fix it!' but for a week now, I have been free of the extreme 'in the moment'-stress over every 'little' something that goes wrong.

Right now I have nothing going that would devastate my life. Which, in itself is sad. I am not doing/working on something that greatly enriches my life, but at the same time. I do not have to worry about losing it, I can start over. Yes I can lose my internship opportunities (two AMAZING companies). Yes I can lose this girl who would bang my brain out.
Yes I could receive some bad grades on these assignments, it could lead to me having to take another year to finish it. I do not feel pressured anymore, yes it is unfortunate, but it no longer feels fully in my control Or at the very least. Not enough for me to not cut myself some slack.

It is just how it is. I feel very calm, and I am not sure whether that is good or not, with that slight naggy feeling. It feels like progress though."

274dnc,2,2014-06-02,"Me [22 M] and my Girlfriend [22 F] together for 4 years, I'm not sure if I should be upset about her flirting with other men during her internship",MeizMahr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/274dnc/me_22_m_and_my_girlfriend_22_f_together_for_4/,"Two years ago, My girlfriend got an internship at a company which is a few states away. During this internship she met a guy, lets call him Bill. During the last week of her internship Her and Bill hit it off and became really good friends.

When she came back, I could tell something was off because it seemed like the only thing she talked about was Bill, and what Bill said, and what Bill was doing, and how much she enjoyed talking to him. Of course that made me a little uncomfortable and also a little suspicious.

One day, while my girlfriend and I were hanging out in the living room I glanced over and noticed a message from Bill saying, ""I wish I had kissed you that night."" I know it must sound petty, but I got pretty upset and confronted her about it. As it turns out, she had been actively flirting with this guy for 2 months. 

Fast forward to today. My girlfriend managed to get another internship at the same company, and sure enough, Bill is also working there. My girlfriend is really great, and knowing that it might make me uncomfortable, she asked me ahead of time if it would bother me if he was there. Of course, after a year I didnt think anything was going to happen.

This weekend, I got a call from my girlfriend and she told me that while she was at a bar on Friday she held hands with Bill the whole night and that Sunday she had had dinner with his parents and then later leaned up against him while watching Game of Thrones. 

I want to believe her when she says that her relationship with him is purely platonic, and part of me believes her because why else would she tell me. However, a combination of her having a past with this guy, and her telling me how much she misses human contact and how she is always feeling ""confused"" makes me worry that the hand holding and cuddling is going to escalate.

I guess I was wondering if I should be getting as worked up as I am about my girlfriend flirting with another guy when she is so far away. Should I be worried about their relationship even though she is being pretty up front to me about it? Am I just being petty?

My name is ITIssouldraining, I am 18 years old and confused as fuck.

I began college about a year ago and studied basic gen-eds at my local community college. When I started college, I wanted to be in IT. I finally decided around Christmas time I should get a job and start making money.

I got a seasonal job at Toys R Us and I was fortunate enough to be one of the few people they kept on. When I started going to college, I kind of didn't go to class and just slept in the library.  This phase of me not going to class kind of snowballed all the way until now. 

While working at TRU I decided to pick up another jobs at an ice cream parlor to keep making more money. I was kind of miserable. But I always have been so it wasn't really too big of a deal. 

About 2 months ago, an opportunity to get an IT job presented itself. My aunt works at a construction company who was serviced by these consultants for their computer needs. I was able to send my resume and get a phone interview with the guy in charge. 

The phone interview was about 2 hours long and it seemed like it went well.

I got an email from him the next day wanting to schedule an in person interview, I said yes and went.

The interview went great and was interviewed by him and a programmer. They seemed to like me and the interview was several hours long. The next day I got an email from the main guy offering me a position. 

Now, I was personally selected to be an IT intern back in high school. I did that for three years so I would like to believe I brought some experience but not a lot. 

They offered me full time 10 dollars an hour and after 90 days a review and raise which is coming up in July. 

I was estatic and accepted the job and began working. I soon found out what the life was like for an IT consultant in the construction industry, ridiculous hours. Previously I had only worked at max 9 or 10 hour shifts at Toys R Us. It seemed common place here to work 12+ hours a shift. I get paid a shit load of overtime. But after a 12 hour shift, I have to drive an hour to get back to my house. So in reality I am out for something like 14-15 hours sometimes. I would much rather just not make the OT pay and go home.

I am extremely stressed out and tired from waking up at 4:45 every morning and then leaving the house to commute to this place 30 miles each way. Sometimes I have to drive to clients who can be 200+ miles round trip. I get paid standard mileage rate and all but when I come home I just collapse and am emotionally exhausted having to deal with people all day.

So I am faced with this full time job that could potentially pay me a lot more once July rolls around but with that pay raise comes with more work and hours. I also have flunked all of my classes 2 semesters in a row. 

I believe I am royally fucked and don't know what to do. 

Just letting this out, no need to comment or anything. I feel better just typing this out."
274gzf,1,2014-06-02,33M4F - Lots of Suggestions for the Ladies,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/274gzf/33m4f_lots_of_suggestions_for_the_ladies/,"So, since I have to spend eight hours at the office today, tomorrow, and the day after that, for the rest of my natural days, I might as well enjoy at least some of that time, right?

No, this is not a prompt. Unless office play is your thing, and you want to explore the surface of this big antique desk in your short skirt, well... we'll get to that. The truth is, I'd like to just RP my way through the days, entertaining myself while I do my work, and I'm open to a lot of different scenarios. I'm sure you have some, but let's consider what you might like (in no particular order):

* Ageplay? I'm your older neighbor. One night you saw me having sex with my wife / girlfriend, and you can't help but be intrigued by all that we did...

* Teacher / student? Boss / employee? That summer internship is turning out to be a lot more than you bargained for...

* Romantic consensual? It's our wedding night, darling, or our first time... tell me how we spend it...

* Quick-and-dirty consensual? I do have this nice big desk here that could use a polishing...

* Soft non-consensual? I'm tending bar, and I can't help but notice your date didn't show up. A pretty girl like you shouldn't be all alone tonight. Let me mix you up a special cocktail...

* Hard non-consensual? I've been watching you for weeks, and I finally saw where you hid the spare key to your house / apartment. I'll be waiting when you get home...

* Dom / sub? I've got some serious control issues I need to explore...

The list, as they say, goes on, and I'm open to just about all of it. These are just a few starting points, and you can certainly mix-and-match scenarios, bring in elements that you enjoy so we can spice things up for both of us, or suggest something totally different. My only hard lines are the usuals (scat, watersports, blood, etc.), and celebrity stuff doesn't really turn me on. Incest is also off of the table (I have a partner for a soft daddy / daughter game already, but she's not available right now, hence the search for an additional partner in a new scenario). But there's a wide array of options available, otherwise.

My only firm request is that you be willing to get into a little detail. Describe yourself / your character, the clothes you're wearing, etc. Or send me a picture or pictures so I know what I'm looking at, what you're looking for, things like that. I'm not looking for another novelist in my life, but give me something to work with so I can give you something worthwhile back. 

I'll be here for the foreseeable future, plenty of hours every day, so send me a PM and we'll see what develops. We can chat a bit about what we both like, or just get started. Your call. Looking forward to hearing form you.

274vp2,1,2014-06-02,Me [21M] and my GF [19F]. Completely unexpected breakup after 3 weeks of long distance. Wondering if it's worth talking to her.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/274vp2/me_21m_and_my_gf_19f_completely_unexpected/,"Background: we go to school together, started dating in January. We had a very passionate relationship-- great sex life, get along incredibly well on an emotional level, etc. She regularly spent 3-5 nights per week at my place over the past 4 months.

Over the course of the relationship we had 2 rough patches. I was really busy with school and sports and wasn't communicating to her well how busy I was and she felt like I was avoiding her. I thought that she wanted to break up over it and I was sad but I realized that it must be incredibly difficult to deal with my schedule (6am wakeup 6 days a week, whether or not she's sleeping over, the workload of an engineering major, and frequent weekend trips for competition), so I was understanding. She decided that it was worth it and I promised to communicate my schedule with her better and she promised to communicate with me better if she was unhappy.

Other rough patch was brought on by my roommate's hookup/FWB who heard my GF and I having sex and then commented to other girls about how loud my GF was. She didn't tell me that this happened initially, just told me out of nowhere that she couldn't sleep over anymore. I was really caught off guard and confused and she didn't want to talk about it, and I told her it wasn't going to work if we couldn't talk. We cooled off and the next day she apologized and explained what happened.

Obviously fights aren't good but in both instances we communicated well to resolve them and I think came out stronger than before. Everything was going great leading up to the summer. We talked about staying together over the summer-- I told her that I wanted to but I'd understand if she didn't and would rather take a break. She said she wanted to stay together which was great.

Over the 3 weeks I noticed that her communication seemed pretty distant, as opposed to earlier when I'd be on trips and she'd call me every day or two to say hi. I was having to do 90% of the legwork on communication. She was stressing about the time apart I knew, and so at her encouragement and with her explicit approval I scheduled a flight to visit her for 3 nights.

She's spending the summer in the city near where she grew up living in a fraternity house at one of the colleges there (which has summer intern housing) while she takes classes. She was one of the first to move in last week and most of her roommates hadn't moved in by Thursday/Friday. I knew she was worried about it being okay with her roommates (who she didn't know) to have me spending a couple nights the first week there. In retrospect it might have been better to plan to visit later after she got to know them, but at the time I thought it might be my only opportunity with my summer schedule.

Thursday she texted me telling me to bring condoms because she hadn't been taking her BC (makes her gain weight so not a big deal for me whether she wants to take it or not, as long as I'm in the loop). Everything seems normal. Friday night she texts me saying she has tests and a lot of work in her summer class this week and she won't have much time to see me when I visit, and that maybe I shouldn't come during the week. I call her and she sounds stressed but asks if I can try to reschedule my flight. I told her that I couldn't reschedule or cancel without fees and since it was already booked I just wanted to see her and I understood if she'd be busy. I told her I could come another time over the weekend and then it started pouring out on her end.

She said she's overwhelmed with everything (living in the new house with a bunch of strangers-- she's not good in unfamiliar social situations), taking a hard class on an intensive summer class schedule plus working and volunteering, and doesn't know if she has time to do the long distance thing. I was pretty caught off guard by this. She says that she can't call and talk to me every day because she doesn't know when she'll have time in her schedule. I asked her if she could do just once a week and she wasn't sure about that either. Then she suggested we take a break. She still wants to see me in the fall and try again, but just can't do it over the summer.

I'm completely caught off guard by this and I'm at a hotel with my team for our national championships, so I'm very nervous and on-edge for other reasons. I told her that I didn't want that because I couldn't stand the thought of her being with other guys. She said it wasn't about that and she didn't want to be with anyone else, she was just too busy with her own stuff. I told her that I wasn't just going to put my life on hold for the summer while we didn't talk and then expect things to be back to normal in the fall, and so we broke up.

It's been eating away at me since then. I would have been okay with taking a break for the summer if we'd talked about it before she left, and I think I might have been okay with it too if I'd been in a different frame of mind when we had the conversation that led to our breakup.

I want so much to text her and try to talk to her again and say that I do want to see her in the fall, but I don't know if it'll make a difference at this point. A part of me thinks it's better for me if I take the time over the summer to be single and date around and then in the fall if I'm still interested in her I can try to meet up with her and see if there's a hope of rekindling things. But I'm pretty lost at this point.

I'd appreciate any advice or outside perspective. Right now I miss her a ton and I want to be back together with her in the fall, but as much as I want it I don't know if that's the best thing for me.

**TL;DR: GF needs a break after 3 weeks of long distance, I didn't agree to it and so we broke up completely. I was caught off guard and not in a good state of mind when we broke up, and now I'm regretting how I handled things.**

Edit: forgot tl;dr

274zrb,10,2014-06-02,Daycare troubles,Pepser,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/274zrb/daycare_troubles/,"Hi, thank you for reading this!

I'm rather stressed at the moment, my husband and I both have fulltime jobs and we have 2 kids &lt; 4. My husband just changed jobs and now has a long commute. I'm busy at work and have been doing a lot of overtime (at night when the kids are sleeping). All in all I feel like I'm hanging on by my fingernails. Also for the last couple of weeks I've been having some troubles with our daycare, specifically with one teacher, and I'm wondering if this is me being stressed obsessing over nothing or that I should act on my worries. So I was hoping someone could provide me with the voice of reason. 

So in the last two weeks three incidents happened with my kids while this specific teacher was supposed to watch them, but she wasn't present. After each time I asked her why, and she responded with things I should be doing differently in raising my kids to prevent these incidents and that she can't keep her eyes on them every second. 

The first was with my oldest (3.5), he fell while playing outside, and scraped the skin of a large part of his hand. The teacher was inside, doing paperwork while she had the kids playing outside (unsupervised). This she blamed on my son playing to rough, I should be teaching him to play more calm. 

The second incident was also with my son. He bit a girl. The teacher was outside doing some gardening chores. She left the kids inside, supervised by an intern (16) that isn't supposed to be watching the kids alone. This girl and him don't really get along, they've exchanged hits/scratches/bites in the past. The teacher told that girls mother that my kid is violent a lot causing that mom to be furious at me and told me that I needed to pay more attention to this. Now I've apologized to that mom, and of course my son and I had some heavy talks on the subject. I do however not recognize him being 'violent' at all. If he hits/hurts his little brother at home (witch happened I guess 3-4 times a week?) he has to spend a minute in time-out and then apologize. 

The third incident was today, when my youngest (1.5) fell outside, where he was playing unsupervised again, with the teacher being inside. He hurt his nose and had a nosebleed. She didn't cool it, it swoll and now he has a huge blue nose. I took him to the doctors but nothing serious seems to be going on. The teacher contributed this fall to my son being to tired from all the fun stuff we did this weekend (which we told her all about when I dropped them of this morning) and that we should not tire him so much on the weekend. He didn't seem especially tired to me. 

So am I overreacting when I'm getting irritated at this teacher? I don't expect her to keep her eyes on them every minute and I don't mind them getting hurt (to a certain degree) I mean if they don't get to fall, they don't learn. But I do expect one if the teacher's to be present in the room at all times, to prevent as much as they can. That is what they state in their 'educational vision'. Is that unrealistic? And those snarks at what I should be doing differently are really anoying me. These incidents didn't happen on my watch. Or should I be reconsidering my parenting tactics?"

**Title:**
Don't take the child onto your lap! 

**Subtitle:**
Many parents feel that male daycare teachers are potential pedophiles - and are thus inclined to forbid them  closeness with their children. About living with an outrageous, across-the-board suspicion.

Is the girl sitting too near? Is the male caregiver looking at the boy too directly? Every day in childcare centers, small gestures are enough to make parents mistrustful.

**Article:**

Example one: Daniel from Hamburg, Germany. He says that he himself had a great childhood, and he would like to pay it forward. He was 21 years old when he decided that a caregiver was the ideal career for him. He aimed for this despite the lengthy three-year certification, and the poorly paid job prospects. However, it didn't take more than four weeks for a mother to pull him aside and tell him that it didn't seem right for him to take her two year old daughter onto his lap. Her thoughts were troubled by the idea of him, as a man, working with her child. ""No hard feelings."" Today, two years later, Daniel says, ""That was a shock. It took me a long time to recover from that.""

Example two: Florian from Mannheim, Germany. A good-natured fellow, who just turned 28 years old, and a person whom children adore. It wasn't long ago, when he came in to work at the daycare center the morning after the scheduled parents' night; his female boss suddenly told him from that moment on he wouldn't be allowed to change the children's diapers. This was the wish of the parents - they said it brought him into too intimate a position with the children and their nakedness. Florian's female colleagues helplessly shrugged their shoulders. Florian smiles nervously and says: ""I accepted it. However, I immediately asked myself what I would be forbidden to do, next.""

Example three: Sascha from Potsdam - 31 years old, very gentle. He was the first male caregiver in his daycare center. ""When I spoke to the parents, I was ignored at first. They preferred to speak with my female colleagues,"" he relates, ""When a mother heard that 'Sascha had changed her child's clothes today,' I immediately received an icy stare from the mom. Meanwhile, his female colleagues were happy to have him - finally, someone with whom the boys could properly wrestle, and who himself had great fun with such romps. ""However, in the end, a mother told my boss: 'The man is coming too close to my children. That seems weird to me. It has to stop.' ""

None of these three men want to tell of their experiences under their full names - because even if no one in these examples explicitly said it, the matter in each and every case had to do with the most horrible conceivable accusation: the suspicion of child abuse. When parents say to the male caregivers, ""Keep your distance from my child,"" it is as much to say, ""In general, we're taking into our calculations that you men will assault our children.""

The problem is new... because male caregivers are new. Generally, they are still something a bit exotic.  This is the case even though, since the tumultuous 1970s, equal rights has been discussed in principle as if it should go in both directions. Indeed, just as women find their niches in male professions, men also try out traditionally female professions. 

In addition, whole bookshelves of pedagogical trade literature document how important it is that the upbringing of kids in their early childhood years is undertaken by men as well as by women (see the interview with Jesper Juul, at the end of the article).

Therefore, playschools and daycares are earnestly seeking male employees. Germany's federal Ministry for Family Affairs has launched programs over the years. They are called such things as ""New Ways for Guys"" (since 2005) or ""Boys' Day"" (since 2011) and according to the department are intended to ""widen the scope of career choices for young men."" In addition, four years ago the department founded the ""Coordination and Assistance of Men in Childcare Facilities Office"" at the Catholic College of Welfare in Berlin. This organization has been tasked with providing the informational lectures, brochures, and advertisements in all sixteen German states that we've seen which tout the theme: ""MORE Men in Childcare Centers.""

In Germany in 2013, altogether 19,055 male skilled employees, interns, volunteers, and job center program participants worked in childcare centers (not taking into account those centers formally attached to elementary schools). That is indeed far more than two years earlier, however the number represents just about four percent of childcare workers nationwide. It is not easy to win boys over to the job. It is a dramatically underpaid position. Childcare workers earn a gross pay of between €1500 and €2100 per month. The job offers hardly any advancement opportunities, except for the possibility of the directorship of the center. The Family Ministry admits that the job of caregiver must become more attractive for boys. A quote from a brochure published by the department: ""The three to five-year unpaid certification program for the career is anything but attractive. That is another reason why particularly men decide against this career. In view of the enormous value this training offers our society, things must change for the better, here.""

A person who seeks out this type of job must be an idealist. For men, the exotics, that is especially true. However, if a man dares to make the leap, the possibility is great that in a short time his work life will be made into a living hell. The concern of the parents is always the same: ""Could the young man, who is so friendly in caring for my child, have dark intentions?""  The Berlin coordination and assistance office commissioned a study which found that forty percent of parents are worried about the danger of possible child abuse by male childcare staff. When the question was expanded to include men as directors and on the board, more than fifty percent of parents were concerned.

One in two has concerns. That means men in German childcare professions are imperiled by an across-the-board suspicion. Every male who works with children, so it appears, could in principle be a sexual criminal. Every man who wrestles with children could touch them in an impure manner. Every young man who changes diapers comes suspiciously close to their genitals.  Jens Krabel, from the Berlin coordination and assistance office says, ""It can be enough if one sole mother harbors a suspicion about men as caregivers or about a specific man, for the subject of child abuse in the daycare center suddenly to take on enormous proportions, and for the employees and other parents to be put ill-at-ease.

However, it is not only about unsettled colleagues in the workplace. It is, of course, the whole society which has a problem. A society, where such innocuous situations allow thoughts of child abuse to emerge, simply cannot sidestep the issue. No other topic is so charged, or so molded by fears and prejudices.  Even when someone is suspected without reason, his life can be practically ruined. Two years ago the much-praised Danish film ""The Hunt"" by Thomas Vinterberg showed this. A girl made unfounded accusations, simply because of her capricious sulky nature, that the male teacher had shown his nakedness to her. Immediately, all chaos broke loose. No one asked the teacher what he had to say about the matter. Parents barred the door to the care center. As soon as the teacher turned up, he was threatened. Finally, he was brutally assaulted. A spiral of rage evolved, in which no further inquiries were taken, and in which no nuance was given a place.

Comparable to this was the case of Sebastian Edathy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Edathy]. Without question, it is abhorrent that the SPD parliamentarian purchased photos of small naked boys. And if the man had other even worse photos on his computer, then it is an earnest matter for German criminal law (Meanwhile, the federal office of investigation has brought forward corresponding evidence). Even so, for Edathy the assumption of innocence should have been held to, until the matter had been clarified. However, for that there was no time. The few cool-headed editorial pieces - including those in the Süddeutsche Zeitung -  could not change that. The public condemnation in the tabloid press and in the talk shows had decided his guilt and character long before the gathering of all the evidence. Edathy is a highly dubious figure, but it is nonetheless alarming when a society degenerates so quickly into hysteria.

And now, it is just those people who are supposed to be looking after our children who are imperiled by all of our latent suspicions about them.  How can such a person sensibly approach his job, given such an atmosphere? Jens Krabel from the Berlin coordination and assistance program says, ""Again and again male caregivers give up their career because of the mistrust. The constant trend of suspicion is not easy to hold out against."" He has, along with his colleagues, just written a set of guidelines with the title: ""Assuring safety. How childcare facilities can protect male professionals from blanket suspicion and at the same time protect children from sexual violence.""

To date, there are no statistics which document how many male childcare professionals have given up their career because of the suspicions against men. However, whoever speaks with male teachers anywhere in Germany realizes immediately: almost every one has had to weather the brunt of a skewed comment. Many have already reconsidered because of this, whether they ought to change careers, in order to not be looked at as ""almost-pedophiles.""

There are cases like a Berlin childcare intern, who was just in the middle of changing the diaper of a toddler when a group of parents came to visit the center. The intern closed the door of the adjoining room he was in, because the child lay before him naked, and he wanted to preserve discretion. This reaction stirred up so much mistrust in the parents that it led to days of discussions with the administration of the center, with the intern sitting from day to day outside the door.

There is also anticipatory obedience, such as in the Freising play school where the changing table which was previously in a quiet corner was moved around until finally it was set up in the middle of the biggest gathering room of the center. This was, according to the director, to ""show the parents that we all monitor each other here.""

Male childcare professionals, in the middle of the chaos, have difficulties not only with parents, but also with their female colleagues. Jens Krabel tells about female childcare workers, who have in recent years become fundamentally against the hiring of men. This is not because they are themselves mistrustful - but instead it is out of purely practical considerations. The teaching-team's day becomes simply too complicated if everybody must respect the special roles of the male colleagues. He is not allowed to change diapers, he is not allowed to take any children on his lap, he must constantly maintain physical distance - how is the guy supposed to act?

At the same time, experts warn that not only the men should be critically observed. Female childcare workers also make mistakes, they cross boundaries, too. That is only human. Cornelia Heider-Winter from the Equality Charity, which coordinates several child development centers in Hamburg, advises that we should occasionally change our perspective. It is not assumed that women can have any sexual intentions, because statistically, it seems as if it is as good as if it never happened. However, we must consider that if a female childcare worker gives a child a kiss on the cheek, even though the child doesn't want it, such a thing is naturally an overreach.

However, these are in the public perception at best nuances. With every case of child abuse that emerges in the news reports, the mistrust toward male childcare professionals grows, because the perpetrators are now almost always men. It is cases such as the one at Odenwaldschule, which make life hard for the idealists. At that very infamous Hessen school - in which it came to numerous cases of abuse in previous decades - just recently, again a teacher was convicted of the possession of child pornography. Now, angry parents are demanding the closure of the school.

Tobias, 23, a caregiver from Munich says, ""I experience this like waves. After every news report of this sort, the parents are nervous. Then they quiet down and everything is relaxed again... until the next news report."" Anyway, Tobias (he also does not wish his last name to appear here) has the courage to approach this topic forthrightly, ""I have taken up the task of going to the parents and explaining what my responsibilities are, and how much physical closeness there will be with their kid. It is a delicate matter - however, exactly because of that, I must broach the topic of my role as a man, here."" The problem is:  the profession attracts people with rather sensitive natures, and that very shyness is dangerous. ""If a male childcare worker meekly retreats to the corner, as soon as parents walk in,"" says Tobias, ""with that very action he is making himself look suspicious!""

Finally, Cornelia Heider-Winter used a phrasing in our conversation which caught my attention. It points to the crux of the whole problem - one could even say it embodies the lay of the land when it comes to the feelings of the entire nation. She says, despite all this, childcare centers are desperately on the search for men who know their way around kids. Then she hesitates for a moment.  One must let this phrase hang in the air for a moment to understand how difficult it all is: 

""Men, who know their way around kids""

Sounds uncomfortable, doesn't it?

////////

*Translator's note: I don't know of a way to reproduce in English the peculiarity of the phrasing which the author is pointing out, nor the way it feels to a native German when it is said. The phrase in the original language for: ""Men, who know their way around kids"" is ""Männer, die gut mit Kindern können.""*

275hdk,5,2014-06-02,"My J1 internship Visa is expiring in August, what are my options?",volar92,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/275hdk/my_j1_internship_visa_is_expiring_in_august_what/,"Hey all,

Last September I moved to San Francisco to work in tech under a J1 internship Visa. I'd like to stay in the States or come back as soon as possible, however I'm quite unsure what my best visa options are. Here is the most important information about my current status:

* I am currently on a J1 internship Visa (12 months max, so extension is not an option)
* My Visa expires on August 20th. I intend to use my grace period for job hunting if need be. So I'm leaving the US September 15th-16th to be safe.
* The 2 year rule does not apply to my J1 Visa.
* I have the equivalent of a US Bachelor's degree 


Here are my current options as far as I've gathered, It'd be great if someone could fill me in if I'm incorrect or missing some options and advise me on which option is most likely to get me back to the US after my J1 expires and preferably the one with the least waiting time.

* I'm currently working for a startup, my boss wants to keep me, so I could probably convince him to get me any visa (legally possible). So i could get an **H1B with my current company** if need be.However, I'd have to wait until April to apply and then until October 2015 to start working. Also, due to the Visa cap on H1B's there's no 100% certainty I will get an H1B which means I'd have to wait another year, is this correct?

* Instead of staying with my small startup company, I could **get a job at a bigger tech company and get an H1B** with them. Will applying for an H1B with a bigger company increase my chances of getting an H1B? Or does the size of the company not matter. It's probably safer to go with a bigger company since they have more experienced lawyers?

* **Studying in the US** is probably not an option (since it's already late to get into a school and It's ridiculously expensive to the point where I can't afford it). I could take a loan, but I think it's not worth it, I'm from Europe, I currently have no debt at all and I prefer to keep it like that.

* I could **get a job at a company with an office in my home country and get an L1 through them**. However I'd still have to work for their office in my home country to be able to qualify for an L1 Visa, is that correct? Is there any way to waive that requirement?

* I could **get a job at a University**, apparently they are exempt from the H1B cap, does that mean they can Apply and get the H1B for me at any time of the year? By the looks of it this is probably my best bet right now. Can I apply for an H1B while my J1 is still running? How long does it take to get an H1B?

* I'm still unsure about the other Visa options, would I qualify for **an H3 , or an O1 visum**?

It would be awesome if someone could tell me wether the information I gathered is correct and give me some advice on what options I have.

It's full time and the pay actually isn't that bad but I am not expected to get anything (knowledge-wise) out of it. 

I know for a fact that I will be able to learn A LOT more if I quit the job and study/work on things on my own/using the internet (I am studying CompSci so there are plenty of resources out there). Hell, I just messing around with a simple coding project that I was working with on the side and it was incredibly more enjoyable than this job.

Anyways, based on that alone, I think it would be a good idea to quit but it does suck since I likely won't have a job over the summer then, but what's more concerning is that I won't have an internship on resume, which is something the vast majority of people in my field (coming out of my college) will have so it does put me at a strong disadvantage.

It's also worth mentioning that it is an ""at-will"" employment so either party can terminate it without reason (on the hand the employee handbook still suggests two-weeks notice)"
275qq5,3,2014-06-02,"Having trouble connecting with girls, self conscious",kakster,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/275qq5/having_trouble_connecting_with_girls_self/,"Just to get an intro, I am a 21 year old 6 foot 2 Indian guy living in Texas. No accent, I dress well, but I am relatively skinny which is something I am working on. When I was younger, I wasn't attractive and didn't have too many friends or girlfriends. Recently I have been getting myself together and my body as well.

My problem is, that I think my past and my failures with women throughout my life has killed my confidence with not only girls, but people as well. I have no girls that I am friends and hang out with, mostly the only time I talk to girls is ones I go to school with or try to pick up at the clubs. I think overtime failures with women has caused me to become a quiet guy and am always in my head thinking ""she isn't attracted to me"", ""she's not interested I can tell"" and negative thoughts like that. This has caused even more problems because now I have noticed my body language start to slump and I get quiet around people I don't know. One thing I always notice, is the loudest guy in the room (not yelling just a loud voice) automatically attracts people towards him.

Today was my first day at my internship and I was trying to meet new people. Introduced myself to some guys and a couple cute girls (suprising for an engineering internship haha). When I talked to the girl I feel like I was just unable to get that connection and attraction. Also, when I talked to just the other guys I found myself way in to my head. I am so self conscious of what I do from previous times that I go quiet and just say nothing and just listen.

Funny thing is when I start to drink, I can become friends, and entertain anyone and most of the time be that loud, funny guy. I can talk to girls so comfortably and get them to like me even though I may not be the most attractive. 

I guess my question is what do y'all do to become less self-conscious from failing so many times and start to not believe in yourself when it comes to people and girls? And any tips on how I can speak louder and keep it consistent without thinking about it? And lastly how to take the ""drunk me"" and make it the ""sober me""?"

Hey /r/cycling, I'm relatively new to the sport of cycling.  Over the past year or so, I'd klunked around to and from classes on a 30 year old, 30lb steel-frame Raleigh.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great bike, but it's a little heavy for the hills where I go to Uni (and for my puny legs).

This summer, I took an internship in east TN, in a new town where I didn't know anybody.  So in my free time after work, I started riding my road bike around the neighborhood.  It was really nice to get out and about, but I found myself becoming dead tired pedaling the bike up and down roller-coaster hills for only 10 minutes, so I never got very far from home.  As I rode more and more after work, I decided I was ready to invest in an upgrade.

After trolling craigslist, I found a used, mid-range road bike in fantastic condition (and with a great price).  Needless to say, I jumped at the opportunity to add yet another bike to my crowded apartment.

Today, I took the initiative to pedal outside of my comfort zone, and was rewarded with a great workout and a wonderful evening that I just had to share.


So, /r/cycling, where has a new bike taken you?"

amidst all this excitement about CLG and Twitch, the cellucor announcement didnt get much attention. One cool thing i saw is that CLG is actually bringing in the CLG camp member brendan sadowski as a intern team chef + gym trainer, under the sponsorship of cellucor. apparently he is already a writer for CLG, so this really shuts down all the people who said that CLG camp was a waste! really cool of CLG and what a great opportunity for brendan too.. that $1K is really paying off.

plus, really happy about daily excersize becoming a regular training routine for EVERY member of clg. i really think it's a big factor in doublelift's rise back to the top in season 4 (after a bit of a plateau in season 3) and dexter has said multiple times that he feels he performs much better in scrims after returning from a morning workout. really happy to see cellucor helping to keep the team physically active as well, might really help with burning out issues maybe 

all in all, a great day to be a CLG fan"
275wz1,3,2014-06-02,Feeling worse and worse every day.,oblivion510,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/275wz1/feeling_worse_and_worse_every_day/,"I'm on break from college and about to become a senior. I'm scared as shit and don't want to live until graduation. I came to a top college burnt out from studying 24/7 with no social life in high school. I decided to care about my social life in college and things were great but after freshman year itself I flunked out. That was when my depression started - I couldn't tell my parents who pay 60k a year for me to go to school even though they themselves predicted I would fail out without any supervision. 

Long story short I got back into school my junior year after working hard but I took easy courses that were pretty useless to me. I wanted to pursue computer science but since I was so behind I had to stack up my courses, got extremely stressed out, and did horribly this past semester and won't be able to declare computer science. Right now I am a film major hoping to add math as a double but I got a D+ in one of the 5 prerequisites and had to retake a class for a third time but I finally passed that with a C-. Today I checked my transcipt to find that that C- was removed and there is now a blank spot for a grade. I  did some research and one thing I'm scared of is that I read that you may need to get instructor's permission to retake a class a second time. My advisor never told me this. I'm scared I won't be able to declare math and will be stuck graduating as a film major without any chance for a job. I feel like every time I try to succeed, the school pushes me back 10 steps.

My summer break started horribly a few weeks ago. I came back relieved that I was done with my semester but at the same time felt absolutely horrible that I pretty much got D's in all my computer science courses. Within the first few days of coming back my family made me feel like absolute crap - they told me I was screwing up, wasting my time pursuing film since it won't make any money (even though they think I'm doubling with CS), they're angry that I will be staying an extra semester in school, I haven't interned yet, and they made fun of how I looked constantly and annoyed me to cut my hair. I feel like absolute shit and after that day I came close to committing suicide. I got a haircut from their choice of barber who I hate, and it came out terribly even though I spent close to a year taking care of growing out my hair. I stopped talking to my family and they gave a half assed apology although denied doing anything wrong. They're good people, they're always happy that I come home but they always ruin my time by yelling at me and lecturing me. They're obsessed with money. If something doesn't involve money they think its a waste of time. They themselves never had any hobbies and think its stupid that I do. 

I felt better a few days ago but its usually only through part of the day. By the afternoon I feel like shit and want to go to sleep and never wake up. I feel like I'm digging a deeper hole for myself every day and that I'm bound for failure now. I'm trying to self study for my upcoming summer courses but I get too anxious and depressed that I eventually have to leave the material alone. I've been watching and analyzing lots of good movies and that's been like my escape - I love diving into a movie and forgetting about reality. I wholeheartedly enjoy film, but with one year left and no internships or connections, I feel like there's little I can do to get a job and I would disappoint my family since those jobs don't pay very well. I've had a tremendous amount of pressure to produce some big results since i'm going to a great university and should be pursing a great major. I will be going back to school in two weeks and already feel that I'll start feeling way better there. Here I'm stuck on my computer all day to avoid my family and try studying in advance or enjoying reddit. At least over there I can smoke some weed and go to the gym and get fit and feel good. I'll get a chacne to talk to the math advisor when I go back and some people have told me that since the dept is small they may listen to me and realize that I've only missed one requirement (with the D+) but now if the school doesn't recognize the C- I miss 2 requirements and wasted a ton of time htis past semester studying for that class. If they understand and let me declare itll be hte greatest day of my life in a while. If they don't, then I'm talking one last math prereq this summer that I don't even need and I'll need to drop that and graduate as a film major and take some CS courses on the side (upper divs since I'm almos done with prereqs). I feel like complete shit because knowing how little my school cares about its students I feel like I'll go back and find out I can't declare math and disapoint my family and myself meanwhile all my friends are graduating with great jobs and internships.

I woke up today feeling great but now feel like shit. I don't even care enough to edit the comments. Sorry. If I can hear anything from anyone hopefully it'll make me feel a bit better. Thanks and sorry for wasting everyone's time and making this so long."
27654z,114,2014-06-02,"Activities in the Litecoin world, addendum to ""Litecoin State of the Union""",TheRealMage,litecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/27654z/activities_in_the_litecoin_world_addendum_to/,"Dear Litecoin Community,

You may have seen recently I made a post titled [“Litecoin State of the Union”]( http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/26xs05/litecoin_state_of_the_union/), which was made in order to clarify what was going on in the world of Litecoin, and calm peoples fear about asics, price, as well as let folks know what the LA and other community members are working on in the LTC eco-system. With that said, I felt the response for the most part was very positive and really got some of the community members engaged and more knowledgeable of the activities and initiatives that are going on. So I wanted to elaborate a bit on a number of activities that the community is trying to put together as well as areas where we need some help in. 

**Safe network alliance pledge**
We are very aware of coinotrons recent issue with the %51 network hash rate. Because of this, we have formed a pledge to pools to take in order to state the will be %28 or below the network hash rate. This is important to prevent time warp attacks on the network (which can happen with any coin, and cause the hacker to fake data and issue fake coins to themselves). **Please spread the word to the pool you mine at, and request them to take the LA/LTC pledge for a safer network located here https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=20028.0.**

**Litecoin video**
After much back and forth, and starting a video, we decided to scrap the original and start again. One of our Litecoin Association members, [Saigoned](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=19243), stepped up as the project manager and will see this come to fruition. It was decided that we would assign bounties to this project in order to get this complete so we can show folks and merchants. Therefore, 65 LTC has been set aside to help pay for certain aspects of the video (50 of which was donated by the Litecoin Association). Please see https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=19799.0 for more details on the project and bounty. Also, special thanks to [Losh11](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=23319) that help start this initiative!

**New wallet splash screen**
With the up and coming release of the new Litecoin QT wallet (which will be called “Litecoin Core”) ver 0.9, there is an initiative to have a new splash screen made by the community for the developers to use. [Warren](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=12835), lead Litecoin Dev, proposed to get the community more involved and wanted to use new splash screens for both the main loading screen and the testnet screen. Please see https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=19989.0 for more details on this project along with deadlines. NOTE: Current deadline is June 4th, which I have requested an extension so that the reddit community can submit their work.

**Electrum Wallet**
Electrum wallet is still in beta testing to ensure everything is working properly. This is an important project for the Litecoin community as a whole. [Pooler](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=10682) is the developer working on this, and is still asking for beta testers as well as public servers to help with electrum. If you would like to help, please see this thread here https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=18608.0.

**LTC on Bloomberg**
[Coblee](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=20) has started an initiative to get Litecoin prices listed on Bloomberg feeds, much like how Bitcoin is already displayed. [Roscoe](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=23143), who is also another member of the Litecoin Association, has taken the lead on this project and is asking for help getting Litecoin displayed on Bloomberg. If you use or know someone who uses a Bloomberg Professional Terminal, please send a message to their online support desk asking for Litecoin price quotes and news to be added. Please show your support in helping him if you can, see https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=19258.0 for more details.

**Translators needed**
If you speak more than one language, your skills are in need for the Bitcoin/Litecoin development teams. Please see https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=19050.0 for more details. 

**Help with LA pages**
The Litecoin Association (http://litecoinassociation.org/) needs help in the form of ideas and volunteers to help “spruce up” the LA website. We need ideas for improvements, sections, content, and anything else you think is good to list. You don’t have to be a member of the LA in order to help out, anyone can help! [Crazik](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=13730) is the administrator for the website as well as on the LA board of directors. Please contact him if you want to help out (and we need some help with this too, I promised him I would get a few folks hehe).

**Merchant basket**
[TheMage](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=20983) (Yes me), started a project in order to create merchant baskets for folks to print out and take with them in order to get more merchants on board to accept LTC and crypto’s in general. This will be the next large project to be completed after the Litecoin video project. See https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=20157.0 for more details. SEE LITECOIN.COM WEBSITE ACTIVITY BELOW!

**Website and Client Documentation Dev**
We have a new intern working with Warren to help out with Litecoin.org as well as end user documentation, [seikochan](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=26728). Her goals for taking the position are 
* Improving the Litecoin website to be a more inclusive, collaborative project where the community helps by contributing improvements and expanding the content to be more informative.
* Improving the documentation for both Bitcoin and Litecoin client software to make it easier for everyone to understand the best practices in protecting themselves against theft and accidental losses that usually are the result of user error.
She can use your help with helping create this documentation for both the Litecoin and Bitcoin clients. In addition, she could also use your assistance in the form of translators. Please see https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=17395.0  for more details.

**LA meetings and Community Projects**
Litecoin Association meetings are on IRC every other Sunday and are a completely open forum (anyone can attend). The LA board members and Ambassadors conduct the meeting and go over important information with the community and where we need help from the community. After the board speaks, the floor opens for any topics not discussed. We implore everyone to attend! Here is the sticky for information on which channel to join, time zones for clarification, and past meeting notes https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=19434.0. 
The Community Projects section is where we create new initiatives for folks as well as try to coordinate marketing campaigns to get companies on board to accept LTC (the merchant basket and Litecoin video as well as previous charities were started in this section). Here is the link to the main boar https://litecointalk.org/index.php?board=89.0. 

**Final Thoughts**
I hope to continue to keep the reddit community abreast of activities that the Community, Litecoin Association, and Developers are working on in order to bring more information to the masses. I understand in the past that this information may not have been flowed properly, but I am looking to change that. I want everyone here to know that Litecointalk.org and reddit are one big community, and we need to work together to continue to keep Litecoin as a top tier currency in the crypto world! But we need YOUR help with this, the communities help. So what ever little bit you can do, PLEASE help us make this better! Thank you :)


EDIT
**Litecoin.com Website**

Coblee recently asked the community what to do with the domain name Litecoin.com. We are looking for open ideas from everyone. https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=20168.0

In addition, [treasure_finder](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=23489), has offered a 20 LTC bounty for Litecoin.com development. See here for details https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=20204.0

*I don't have the technical know how to make this happen but I know it is important for the future of our coin. Therefore, I'm offering a 20 LTC* *bounty to the person or persons who are able to make this site a reality. Even if you're not sure what the final site should look like, start the* *design, make the work-in-progress and let us all provide feedback and work on it together to make it a reality. I don't care if LTC reaches* *$100 between now and then, I will send you 20 LTC when the site is launched.*
*I invite any other members to add to this bounty, to get ourselves a top quality site that will reinforce LTC as the true silver crypto coin.*

Coblee has now donated 100 LTC to this activity, which puts the bounty up to 120 LTC. I am rolling the merchant basket activity into this as well. Stay tuned for details on how this will be distributed.

2766lu,5,2014-06-02,Programming doesn't click for me?,SuperSplashBrothas,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2766lu/programming_doesnt_click_for_me/,"I'm about to finish my second year as a Comp Sci major and have been struggling a lot. Pretty much, I built a poor foundation in my intro classes and have just had a lot of trouble since then. I've taken classes in Java, C, and currently in C++. My current class is the one I'm struggling the most in. I'm most likely about to fail this class unless I can somehow do amazing on the final. 

The main problem I have is that I can read through a code and understand it for the most part, but when I have to code something myself, I'm clueless. I don't know how to approach it. Something that can easily be done in one line of code becomes a struggle for me that I feel needs about 10 lines of code. I just feel lost when I try to code on my own. I have this same struggle even when I try to plan out what the program should be doing. This is the problem I've been having on the tests mainly this year. We're asked to program a simple function but I don't understand what to write. In C and Java, I had a simple understanding of it so I was able to get some points on the tests, but in C++, I have no idea what to do. I struggled trying to learn it. I've sat down and tried to learn it but it doesn't stick with me. I feel like, as the title says, programming doesn't click in my head. 

Am I approaching programming incorrectly? I've tried writing and reading through programs but to no luck. Is there a better way for me to learn the basics? Should I just go back and start from scratch again? I would devote my time over the summer, but I won't have as much time since I have a QA internship. I don't want to go back and take the same classes all over and fall behind in terms of graduation. Any tips that I can use? Any help is appreciated. "

276b49,4,2014-06-03,"Me [21 M] and my girlfriend [20 F] of 19 months are apart for the summer, and we're considering ""hall-pass"" situation. Does this work?",___Throwawayyy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/276b49/me_21_m_and_my_girlfriend_20_f_of_19_months_are/,"My girlfriend and I, both college juniors, have been together for a little over a year and a half. This our second summer together, and our second summer in different locations. She's on the opposite coast at an internship for the whole summer and I'm waiting to go abroad (South Asia) for 6 weeks of school starting next month.

Last summer we were apart as well (she went away, I had an internship at home), and it wasn't easy, but we made it. This time around we're a little wiser: we know a lot more about each other and the way we handle these types of situations.

This time around it's been going well. She's been really happy at her job (and I'm super-excited for her) and we get to Skype a lot.

**Here's where it gets a little bumpy:**

She has a crush on the guy she's living with. I'm not mad. I'm not even surprised. I understand how easily this can happen when you're suddenly in close quarters in a new place with someone you enjoy being around, especially with your SO a thousand miles away.

She's been really open with me about it. Naturally, I'm a little jealous, but not overly so. This has happened before, and since she's honest about everything I don't really feel threatened, especially once she gets to know the guy and the attraction fades. 

**So, the other night,** we were Skyping and she tells me that when I'm abroad, I'm gonna end up having a crush on a girl, and it's okay if I want to make out with her. As long as it's just making out and as long as it's just once.

Bam! Offer's on the table.

First of all, I should say that this stroke of confidence on my girlfriend's part was immediately attractive. *However* (and I know she might be reading this so I hope I don't get in too much trouble), she can be a little insecure at times and quickly I'm realizing how this could blow up.

So it starts a discussion. It becomes apparent that she wants the same deal (which is reasonable, but a *teeny* bit of an ulterior motive for her bringing it up in the first place). 

I found it a little weird but not unwelcome and she made some good points about how our relationship is strong and this could help the longevity by keeping these little crushes from feeling like missed opportunities. I know I've felt that way in past relationships (when going abroad, go figure), so it makes a little sense.

But I don't know about this experiment. My worries are two-fold: (1) Will one of us be overcome with jealousy or insecurity when it comes down to it? (2) Could this be the start of a slippery slope of semi-sanctioned infidelity?

**This is where I need your help:** I'm really not opposed to the idea. I can see how in the heat of a moment in some faraway place it might be nice to have that one-(to three-)time pass. I think it's really interesting, but I don't want to jump into something that could be a secret death sentence for our relationship. She's made it clear that she's really interested, but wouldn't be very upset if I decided against it. I really trust her, and I trust myself, but I want to make sure this thing is thought *all the way* through.


Edit: I'm aware that from the outside this sounds weird/bad. It's hard to get across the intricacies of the situation. **What I'm *really* asking for is shared experience.**
---   
**tl;dr**: Is a semi-open relationship for the summer a bad idea? Any success/horror stories to share?"
276bfd,0,2014-06-03,Biomedical engineering and poor job prospects,frozenmallet,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/276bfd/biomedical_engineering_and_poor_job_prospects/,"I was speaking to my schools biomedical engineering department and I noticed that many of the people in the BME department recommended that I do not major in BME. In fact, not a single professor in our BME department has a degree in BME. They are all EE, MechE, and ChemE. 

Also, one of the faculty advisers as well as my school's BME adviser told me that companies that work with biomechanics and other BME fields would much rather hire mechanical and chemical engineers than biomedical engineers. She even told me that more mechanical engineers from my school have gotten BME internships than BME majors.

I was curious, so I looked at my schools job fairs, and out of the 100+ companies that attend each quarter, not a single company was hiring BME majors. Not one.

Also, after doing some research online it looks like people with BME degrees can't find work after they graduate, and most end up having to go to grad school just to increase the likelihood that they can find work.

I was originally a BME major but I switched to Computer Engineering a year ago because I found that I enjoyed programming and computer hardware more than biology and mechanics. However, I am still very curious as to why the supposed fastest growing engineering field according to the BLS is horrible in terms of job prospects.

Anyone have any ideas?"
276e5o,6,2014-06-03,"I love consulting, but I'm losing hope that I won't be able to work in my dream field.",[deleted],consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/276e5o/i_love_consulting_but_im_losing_hope_that_i_wont/,"I don't mean for this to sound like a cry for help, I've just lost a lot of hope that I used to have about breaking into consulting recently and I was hoping that some of you may have a similar story and could offer me some guidance. In the past year I was exposed to what consulting was, and I fell in love with it pretty quickly. The problem solving aspect is what attracted me to it so much, I never really had thought about what I wanted to do after I graduated but now that I've learned what consulting is I know that this is it. Ever since then I've been trying to absorb as much information about it as I can, I'm reading books, listening to podcasts, researching companies, practicing cases, everything I could possibly do to learn more.

But here's my problem.

I'm currently a rising senior in college, and I do have some things on my side in that I'm at a target school that companies like Accenture and Deloitte recruit heavily for. I'm also majoring in bioengineering and our department is consistently ranked in the top 3 in the country and most of our graduates have found great success in consulting. Despite all of this, my GPA is nowhere near where it needs to be to get an interview. I messed up my freshman year and had some family problems the next two that hurt my grades but it's looking more and more likely that I'll add two A's to my transcript this summer and I am also looking to get a 4.0 next semester taking some classes very relevant to consulting and also retaking one that's an F on my transcript which would boost my GPA. It's currently ~2.7 with a potential to be ~ 3.0 by the end of the fall term.

Unfortunately, I was not able to land any internships in consulting this summer despite attending on-campus recruiting case competitions, coffee chats, etc. This is mostly why I've been down in the dumps lately as I'm not doing what I would kill to do this summer: intern at a consulting firm. To be fair to myself this was when I had just learned about consulting so I was not very well versed on how to network or work cases but I am much better now. But I know my GPA is a big red flag and I have been trying to fix it and gather skills I can use to get my dream job but I don't know what to do now.

In addition to spending the past few months learning about consulting, I have become a part of this program at my school where teams of undergrads work together to solve a global medical program. In the group I worked on this past year, I helped to develop a now patented medical device that I also presented at competitions where it won multiple awards. Additionally I will be working on another team this upcoming year to develop a new device related to vital sign monitoring in rural countries. I only bring this up because firms that recruit at my school seem to really favor students involved in this program (several of my team members are currently working at firms for the summer). 

Additionally, I recently (in the past few weeks) was elected as the only undergraduate executive member to our school's Business and Consulting Club. This means that starting in the fall I will be running many case review sessions among myself and graduate students and I will also be allowed to have my own undergraduate team in what is historically an all-graduate student attended Business Case Competition that the school puts on with many recruiters from MBB and many other consulting firms.

Aside from this I feel like my resume reads as it should, I have been involved with Varsity sports, a member of 6 different clubs where I have held leadership roles in all 6 and this summer I will be working what is essentially an IT consulting job where I am going to be responsible for advising our school on how to implement our new electron microscope network so that it can be automated and of efficient service to everyone, I will also help implement this solution myself (I have a background in computer science).

What I most need help with is how to get an interview. I believe I interview well as I have been practicing it a lot and I think I could relay my intense passion for the field and show the personal strides I've recently made to make myself a good candidate. The problem is though, that most companies filter based on GPA and I don't know that I'll be able to meet that requirement by the time applications are due. I do have my school and fraternity network that I can make use of (which I plan to) but I'm kind of lost as to what exactly I should do. I plan on meeting with people I know who work for these firms and with my department adviser but I was hoping you guys would be able to offer some words of wisdom on what I can do to make myself a better applicant and possible ways I might be able to get my foot in the door for an interview.

**TL;DR** Consulting has become my dream and passion, but I don't have the grades to land an interview. I will be a senior this year and need advice on what I could do to get companies to look past my GPA and/or land an interview with some."

They said if it feels like a good match they would want to keep me on board permanently as they plan on going for another round of funding in the Fall.

To me, this is exciting because my previous internship was working with dreadful internal applications that had huge ugly codebases. Mostly fixing crappy code that other people wrote. My old manager was very adverse to refactoring code and had little technical background, so a lot of the time it felt like busywork.

This is not a stable job in any sense and I won't be paid much compared to other people in the field, but I really like the product and can feel passionate about it already. However, as much as I like this company I don't want to do this if I end up job-hunting in September and it looks bad on my resume. 

So, will interviewers think that I am a poor candidate because I didn't get a full-time position straight out of school? Like I couldn't find a full-time position so I took an internship instead? The reality is I actually want to work for this company a lot, right now. I have a full-time offer from a financial company so I kind of feel silly for considering an internship. "

Or is this a bad idea?,bettyswolocks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2776e8/how_can_i_stay_competitive_for_both_research_and/,"I'm coming to the end of my third year as an undergraduate in the UK on a four year course resulting in a master's in computer science.

For my first year or so of my degree, I was planning on becoming a software developer. I worked on a load of programming side projects, taught myself languages that weren't on my course, and just did a lot of programming for fun and work.

Then in my second year, I started to get really into the more theoretical parts of my course (which were unrelated to software). I signed up for a third year project in a theoretical subject, and started spending my time going to research seminars (I was almost always the only undergrad there), writing to academics about their research, and talking to current PhD students. I decided that I wanted to go into research in some area of theoretical CS, and my own-time work and projects veered away from programming.

Last summer I did a ten week internship at a largeish company writing software in Java. I really enjoyed it, and I was good at it -- at the end of the internship, they offered me a job for after my third year, if I chose to graduate after three years (with a bachelor's rather than a master's). Although I had had a great time, I was leaning much more towards research at that point, so I declined them (but expressed a lot of gratitude and what a great time I'd had, and I am still friendly with several people there, so hopefully that might come in handy if I need it at any point).

This year, I did my research project (which I also loved; it's probably the thing I've enjoyed the most and am most proud of from my whole degree so far). I continued going to the seminars. And I didn't take any programming courses. I had to do a bit of programming for a couple of courses, but that was just implementing algorithms related to the theoretical courses I was taking. I also arranged for a research internship this summer at a great university (which I am really looking forward to), and I have signed up to do a fourth year project which is also very theoretical and probably won't involve writing a single line of code.

I have a website on which I post programming projects and also write a blog, which is 90% on my research-related interests.

To be honest, I feel like at the moment I am a pretty good candidate for a PhD and a research career. I have put a lot of work in with that aim, and I have a lot to show for it (good research projects, good relationships with academics and researchers, good internship, active and detailed relevant blog).

The problem is that... I've been doubting that this is the right path for me. Despite all my motivated... my grades actually aren't that great. I go through periods of depression, and I worry that a few months of depression could fuck up a PhD or a research career much more than it could a software job. I worry that I won't be able to handle the responsibility. I get emails from my lecturers at 10PM on Friday nights... I don't know if I want to be that guy; I don't *always* feel like going home and turning my brain off on a Friday night, but having the *option* to do so is important to me! And do I really want to spend 3+ more years as a broke student? Really? I dunno.

So I've been reconsidering software. But I'm currently a terrible candidate for a programming job... I haven't done any significant personal programming projects for a year and a half, and my skills/knowledge are rusty from lack of practice.

The obvious thing to do is to spend more time programming. But with everything else going on in my life at the moment, I don't feel like I have time to make myself a competitive PhD candidate and a competitive programmer, and I don't want to screw myself over for either option!

Any advice gratefully received."

The confusion is that I'm asking an old chemistry professor about an internship for computer science! It's not even like I'm asking an uninvolved professor, in the dream I believe that he is in charge of the admissions. On the exam there is some riddle involving a series which I vaguely remember. I specifically remember that there is some math homework I didn't do and it is a Wednesday, I'm pushing it off until later and I have that class at 4 later that day. Other than the internship and math hw that appeared in both dreams I don't remember much about the previous night but I do know that it is continuous. 

The only significance I see is that calculus ii and chem were two classes I was unsatisfied with my accomplishments in and that I want an internship. I don't think it should bug me enough for a nightmare, I took them the semester before the recent one and I haven't had any nightmares until now."

I have looked over internships.com, monster.com, internmatch.com and indeed.com but the amount of companies that require you to register with their site to apply is staggering.

I'm hoping you can help me solve this problem at my internship. I work for a biotech company and we want to graphically represent the data from one of our machines (Agilent Bravo). It's pretty much a machine with 96 heads (or 384) that picks up pipet tips and aspirates/disperses fluid. 

So each head/well has it's own value for quality control testing. I.E. the well in column 20, row E gives a value of 9.1 (ideal value is 9.9). We want to track the values for every well in the head (96 or 384) and put the info in a line graph. Once we see the linear line have a dip or depreciation, we can predict with some certainty that the well is going bad. 

Obviously if we go in excel and  create a graph with one well (i.e. Column 20, Row E) we can visually see a linear line (assuming its a good head) and then once a well goes bad, we'll see a dip/depreciation that will show perfectly a well going bad. But the question is how to reproduce this if there are 96 wells (or 384) we are trying to watch. 


How do you suggest we represent such a large amount of data? "

My hourly rate is great given the position, but it's still considered temporary and even my boss doesn't know if the university will let him keep me more than a few more months. I know I should be making lots of little games to build up a portfolio and look for other jobs, but I'm not confident in my programming skills because the university's degree program was shit with only one-two good teachers.

Recently my boyfriend and I finally moved out of my mom's home into our own apartment, and we just barely got approved for it. My boyfriend is currently paying off debts, and he's almost done and I'm so proud of him but in the mean time rent is more than just one of my paychecks, adding to that electric, internet, and food. He works for a cell-phone company, and is a great salesman so I'm not worried about his commission checks. I have money saved up, so I think we can make it until his debt is paid off, but I still feel anxious that something will go wrong.

My boyfriend, knowing that I like animals and taking care of things, decided to get us some hermit crabs. Only problem is, we were grossly unprepared and we're currently waiting for a shipment of shells/substrate/moss/etc. and are struggling to make sure they stay alive. I worry every other minute if they're already dead, as they pretty much haven't moved from their preferred spots.

I've had anxiety problems since elementary school, and I haven't felt this fragile since maybe high school. It's like one wrong move and everything will come crashing down. I've started having what I used to call ""midnight freakouts,"" where I wake up in a huge panic, sometimes even jumping out of bed or the room, because there are imaginary spiders or mites in the bed, or recently I thought the hermit crabs were somehow making the tank fly away. That last one was amusing at least, but I'm not getting enough sleep and it's happened at least 4 times in less than a week.

I'm not sure what to do or how to make things better. Sorry if I seem incoherent, I'm not very good at expressing my feelings."

Location: western ny


I have been working for ""Java company"" for 6 months and have been stressed out, working on a boring app that is outdated and isn't any more complex then school work I was doing. Large company, management sucks (manager doesn't even know my name). Really close to home. Stability. Making 55k/year.


""web company"" which now has new management that I've met and liked wants me to come back, they've made an offer of 60k/year with potential 10k/year bonus depending on if I hit goals or not. Small company, I know everyone on the dev team and enjoyed working there.  ~30 minute commute. 


My gut is telling me to take the offer and work for ""Web company"" since I will be happier and making maybe a little more money. Benefits are comparable. 

Questions:

How does only working for a company for 6 months look on a resume? 


Anyone have experience with goal based bonus?

27827s,1,2014-06-03,33M4F - Some starting suggestions for literate ladies,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/27827s/33m4f_some_starting_suggestions_for_literate/,"So, since I have to spend eight hours at the office today, tomorrow, and the day after that, for the rest of my natural days, I might as well enjoy at least some of that time, right?

No, this is not a prompt. Unless office play is your thing, and you want to explore the surface of this big antique desk in your short skirt, well... we'll get to that. The truth is, I'd like to just RP my way through the days, entertaining myself while I do my work, and I'm open to a lot of different scenarios. I'm sure you have some, but let's consider what you might like (in no particular order):

* Ageplay? I'm your older neighbor. One night you saw me having sex with my wife / girlfriend, and you can't help but be intrigued by all that we did...

* Teacher / student? Boss / employee? That summer internship is turning out to be a lot more than you bargained for...

* Romantic consensual? It's our wedding night, darling, or our first time... tell me how we spend it...

* Quick-and-dirty consensual? I do have this nice big desk here that could use a polishing...

* Soft non-consensual? I'm tending bar, and I can't help but notice your date didn't show up. A pretty girl like you shouldn't be all alone tonight. Let me mix you up a special cocktail...

* Hard non-consensual? I've been watching you for weeks, and I finally saw where you hid the spare key to your house / apartment. I'll be waiting when you get home...

* Dom / sub? I've got some serious control issues I need to explore...

The list, as they say, goes on, and I'm open to just about all of it. These are just a few starting points, and you can certainly mix-and-match scenarios, bring in elements that you enjoy so we can spice things up for both of us, or suggest something totally different. My only hard lines are the usuals (scat, watersports, blood, etc.), and celebrity stuff doesn't really turn me on. Incest is also off of the table (I have a partner for a soft daddy / daughter game already, but she's not available right now, hence the search for an additional partner in a new scenario). But there's a wide array of options available, otherwise.

My only firm request is that you be willing to get into a little detail. Describe yourself / your character, the clothes you're wearing, etc. Or send me a picture or pictures so I know what I'm looking at, what you're looking for, things like that. I'm not looking for another novelist in my life, but give me something to work with so I can give you something worthwhile back. 

I'll be here for the foreseeable future, plenty of hours every day, so send me a PM and we'll see what develops. We can chat a bit about what we both like, or just get started. Your call. Looking forward to hearing form you. 

**TL;DR** - I'm always in front of the computer, so let's play! "

Unpaid internship, Peace Corps, staying at home?",LScothrowaway,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2783n5/90k_in_fed_student_loans_ibr_right_nowwhats_the/,"Yes, throwaway, because I'm hitting dead ends everywhere, and I would appreciate any advice as this subreddit has been beyond helpful. I know this might be lengthy, so bare with me.

Recent law school grad (2013), with $90k in fed loans (some sub, some unsub). I applied for IBR when my payments kicked in 11/2013 as I had no employment, thus no income. I was then and still am on a staffing agency, but getting called into a project hasn't been consistent. I worked for a bit from November-January, but it stopped after that. I joined another staffing agency in February with no results.

At this point, I have placed my resume to over 400 places. Most law firms aren't hiring. My dream job is to work with public policy/humanitarian affairs, so I've looked around in that field as well. The same nonprofits and organizations that have told me to get more experience and a master's degree are rejecting me me this time again. In addition, I've looked for everything (Monster, Indeed, etc.) for basic entry-level positions, but I keep getting rejected for being overqualified. I even went to restaurants (Red Lobster, Pizza Hut) and retail stores in the mall (Abercrombie, Limited, NY &amp; Co, Macy's, you name it), and I never even received a call following up submitting my resume. Last week, I found a position, and I am currently working for a religious charity, as a part-time volunteer legal intern. I know there is no upward mobility, but it's something to put on the resume.

I've been battling what's good for now vs. what's good for the resume. I'm living with my parents, and besides the school loans, I have no debt. I seldomly use my credit cards unless for emergency and my car is paid off. My parents have been wonderful in letting me stay without rent, and I fully intend to pay them back when I have a steady stream of income. I also help them around the house (as any good kid would) and run errands for them.

Right now, my savings is around $4,000. I started to sell my old belongings, clothes, books, etc. for some immediate cash on Craigslist and flea markets, but I know it's not sustainable after I've sold everything. Also, I don't live in a particularly thriving area (I live in Western Maryland, near the WV/PA border).

I recently networked with someone who threw out the suggestion of interning at this organization, who often hires their interns as full time employees. Although it's not guaranteed, it's a big legal organization based in DC, and my colleague is currently working there (and can be a reference). Of course, this requires me moving to DC and being unpaid for duration. I know I can't afford it, but the whole getting experience vs. not digging the hole any further is putting me at a crossroads.

I've already been a year out of graduation, so I know there's more competition. I plan to still seek work, any of kind of work that will provide for immediate income. Here are my questions.

* Am I making a mistake applying for entry level jobs? In addition, should I take out my legal education on my resume so it doesn't seem like I'm overqualified?
* Should I take out a loan, make the move to DC, hoping for something? Ugh, that sounds horrible as I write that.
* I know I'm a grown ass person living in their parents (and grateful for it), but it this okay for the time being...however long that is?
* As for IBR loans, I'm daunted at what my taxed income would be after 25 years, but I'm grateful that I don't have to payment anything right now. But I do want to make payments. I'm afraid that if I get a job (seems like 30-35k have been my target area...much lower than law school grads, but I'm willing to take anything), I'm not sure how much to allocate towards savings and putting the rest towards loans (IBR payment + more). Do you advocate for always putting the bare minimum on IBR or should I double up on IBR payments (when I qualify for IBR)?
* I have several friends in Peace Corps who have landed jobs. I originally wanted to do Peace Corps, but I was silly and thought a job would land me with a JD. I'm more than willing to do Peace Corps for the experience and if possible, boost in employment. I know it's not easy, and if I want to go home early, I'd feel like a failure. I was hoping Peace Corps would change my ""law school will give you a job"" mentality and outlook altogether with my background in international affairs. I also wouldn't have to pay for loans during my service, either.

My goals basically are to be independent (and I can live frugally--I still have all my items that I lived when I was in grad school in storage, it's just getting a job and finding an apartment) and pay off my loans.

And for people who question my decision to enter law school, I honestly thought a JD would get me somewhere, especially when I get keeping rejections from jobs for needed a master's degree (I was an international studies/human rights major in undergrad). I had steady summer employment at the firms I was working at, but they aren't hiring (but very helpful with references). I've already felt bad that my degree seems useless, and I often think about what if I would have done something different. Which is why I want your suggestions and advice, knowing that I could do something different now that could help me.

I apologize again for being lengthy. But thank you in advance. I'm all ears (throw me your criticism), I just want to know what's the next step.

Edit: Thank you for all your kind words. They are definitely encouraging and will take each day as it comes. I'll continue applying and see where it comes from there. I haven't made any decisions, but I hope to look for Fall internships.

Also, I'm a female. Not that it matters, but I noticed some of the comments people thought I was a male. It's all good."

I'm currently on an internship that involves setting up a Labview interface that can control 2 motors. The purpose of this is to be able to control the movement of a dish apparatus that will eventually take images of the sun.

Currently, I'm using a cRIO and two NI 9501 Stepper Drives, I can fully control each of the 2 motors on the dish apparatus individually. This is done using an FPGA VI for each motor. However, now I need to try and integrate the two motors so that I can control both of them using one top-level FPGA VI. In simpler terms, I want to control each motor simultaneously rather than only one or the other. I am thinking that maybe I could just use 1 axis motion at a time, but I think it would be better to have synchronized motion with 2 axes.

I've been scouring the internet for how to do this and have gotten some hints, but nothing has seemed to work or I am not implementing it correctly (I'm also fairly new to FPGA). 

Is anyone familiar with NI Soft Motion and/or FPGA that may be able to point me in the right direction or know a solution to this? Thanks in advance."
278eii,8,2014-06-03,Seeking Advice for Summer,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/278eii/seeking_advice_for_summer/,"I didn't get an internship for the summer. One offer was rescinded with the claim that they've reached their intern capacity and another had changes in management that led to the internship being non-existent. I was going to take a summer job that was slightly related to my major (mostly holding professor's hands as we integrated tech into their curriculum), but the combination of financial constraints, lack of relocation assistance, and a death in the family has forced me to decline the offer. 

Suffice to say, I have some terrible luck.


With that said, I want to make myself a stronger candidate for when I apply to internships for the next summer. I already know I need to brush up on my understanding of data structures and algorithms, so there's that. I also plan on tackling on The Odin Project, but I don't know if and what else I can do to make this summer worthwhile. Do ya'll have any suggestions?"
278h3m,4,2014-06-03,Why does my ex [21M] resurface every once in awhile just to be very distant with me [20F]?,sp0ngebobsaget,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/278h3m/why_does_my_ex_21m_resurface_every_once_in_awhile/,"Alright, please be kind. I know how stupid it looks to be worrying about all of this when there are bigger things happening in the world, but I really just need an escape from my own head.

So, oldest story in the book- he and I were high school sweethearts. Background: No major complaints, he was a really good bf. Good family, good kid, just a stand up guy. The breakup before college was mutual because we wanted the other to have a good college experience, but very painful. I ended up going to a much smaller and less fun school, so it took awhile for me to fully go long periods of time without thinking about him, but I do now! I have lots of friends and have dated other guys, but none as seriously as with him.

3 years have passed, I just finished junior year. Over the last few years he has resurfaced randomly to check in with me. He asks me where I'll be for the summer, or if I'll be home for winter break, and friend request me or look at my linkedin. On the surface it seems nice of him, but he always fizzles out after a few texts and sometimes I end up carrying the conversation, and then for weeks after I just shit on myself for blowing it. I don't know what I want from these very short interactions, but for once I would love just to not feel like an idiot after. The one time he asked me to hang out a few weeks before winter break, he never actually ended up contacting me.

Recently, he requested me on instagram. I declined (yes!). I then ran into his family a few weeks later, and had a great conversation with them. A few days later, I get a Facebook request and a text from him. I respond, I try to be distant, I REALLY DO. I didn't ask questions, nor did I give him too much background. But I used too many exclamation points because I didn't want my distance to turn him off (I know, I want to slap myself too), and I end up accepting him on facebook. He tells me I look happy in my photos and also at one point gives me the dates for when he will be home this summer, since he asked me where I will be and I told him I got a job in the city near our hometown. Eventually he stops trying to add anything in the conversation and I end with ""Good! Nice talking to ya""…. Ugh, I make me want to scream. 

I'm angry because I know he just wants to keep tabs on me (to make sure I haven't gotten more attractive? because he feels bad that I had a hard time with the breakup?) and I'm always way too nice. I know he doesn't want to date me, but now that I know when he's going to be back in the area, I can't stop thinking about it and ripping myself apart. I know from past experiences that if I start obsessing over this and getting mad at myself I'm going to have a really shitty summer. I've worked so hard to be happy with myself and get an awesome internship and I'm worried my inability to stop obsessing over him is going to ruin a very important summer.

Can someone please help? I think he might either text me to catch up or even worse, I will run into him at a mutual friends' party when he's back. If anyone has any advice on how to help me feel empowered again or how to deal with him if he comes back, it would be much appreciated.

I'm also worried that my Facebook will allow him to get his check-in ""fix"" without actually putting in effort to talk to me. I don't know if Facebook serves as a positive or negative influence in this situation.

**tl;dr**: Ex bf from high school likes to randomly resurface to know what I'm doing (from a distance) and I'm always overly enthusiastic and feel shitty after. Why does he do this and what can I do as damage control?"
278m5u,13,2014-06-03,"What I Learned From 30-Year Old Self-Made Millionaire, Tyler Dikman (LoungeBuddy)",kNIVEK2,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/278m5u/what_i_learned_from_30year_old_selfmade/,"I'm in the process of interviewing young, successful entrepreneurs.  This interview is with Tyler Dikman, founder of CoolTronics &amp; LoungeBuddy.

After our interview, I wrote everything out and organized it together.  Here it is:

Tyler Dikman has been known as an entrepreneur his entire life.  He started off with lemonade stands at the age of 5.  These were not just your typical lemonade stands.  He went the extra mile to make them the best he could, including putting signage up and down the streets.  Tyler would even go to the grocery store to get free displays and essentially turn his lemonade stands into his personal enterprise.  Running these lemonade stands would yield him about $15-20 per hour, which was a lot for someone his age.

Several years later he found himself in other small ventures such as babysitting and lawn mowing.  At the age of 12-13, he took on the hat of a magician, performing magic tricks at birthday parties.
Tyler had always been extremely interested in the stock market.  At the age of 13, he landed an internship with Merrill Lynch.  This became possible through his babysitting job.  He was babysitting the kids of one of the Vice Presidents of Merrill Lynch.  The two would have conversations and he could tell Tyler was very passionate.  At the beginning of 9th grade, he was hired on part time, working after school.  Tyler learned a lot and this further drove his passion for entrepreneurship, business, and the stock market.

At the age of 15, he founded the company CoolTronics.  “CoolTronics helps individuals and small businesses with making the most of what computer technology offers.”  CoolTronics is a very intensive 1 on 1 service business.  This was very exciting for him as he was really starting to build a company for the first time.  He had no idea what he was doing and many mistakes were made, however these became his learning lessons.  Tyler built the company with a reputation of exceptional customer care.  CoolTronics was a great way for Tyler to make good money.  Throughout high school he continued to grow the business.  By the time he was graduating, CoolTronics had between 6-10 employees and was doing over a million in revenue a year.  Because of this CoolTronics gained some publicity.  Tyler continued to run CoolTronics in college, and today it is still well and thriving.

After high school, Tyler attended Santa Clara University located in Silicon Valley.  He wanted to surround himself with entrepreneurs who were far more successful.  Silicon Valley was the ideal place to do this in which Tyler was able to get great mentors.

Shortly after college, Tyler co-founded a company called Redux, which was based in Berkeley.  Redux makes discovering exceptional online video as enjoyable and effortless as watching cable television.  Redux delivers a lean-back TV experience programmed by curators and friends that share one’s taste.  Redux allows a person to see, share, and experience the best video moments from movies, shows, and videos they already know and love.  Tyler was in charge of working on big partnerships with major companies.  He was also in charge of growing a workforce quickly.  Redux was Tyler’s first time raising venture capital, as well as his first dot-com start up.  Tyler worked with Redux for three years before moving on.

After Redux, he became one of the first employees at Net Power &amp; Light.  Net Power &amp; Light “has numerous patented innovations that change the way people experience media, entertainment, and communications, heralding the onset of the Experience Age.”  They are “dedicated to delivering a new kind of powerful technology platform that gives people the freedom to have fun and connect more deeply.”  Tyler ran partnership management during his three years with the company.  He got to fly all over and worked with places like Harvard on their global education initiative and well-known groups such as TED Talks.

Slightly over a year ago, Tyler began his latest venture LoungeBuddy.  “LoungeBuddy is the only App that displays all airport lounges in over 400 of the busiest airports around the world.”  LoungeBuddy is focused on setting up structure to support millions of people around the world.  It was originally created to solve a problem Tyler was having.  His real passion is travel and he wanted to start a company doing what he loves.  This is the first company of its kind, which makes it very exciting for Tyler.

A day in the life of Tyler Dikman is quite sporadic.  Typically in the morning, he will start off making phone calls to check in with the people at CoolTronics, which is still thriving.  This will be followed with a phone call to a business partner, mentor, or advisor.  Tyler has many mentors and advisors, all of whom are incredibly helpful.  At about 10AM, he heads to the LoungeBuddy office and often works until 11PM.  He has no problem working long hours since he enjoys what he does, and time flies when you’re having fun!  

There are currently six people working within the company, each with many different jobs.  Working at LoungeBuddy oftentimes does not provide much of a routine.  There is some structure, but also opportunities to break away.  Since they are the first company of its kind, there are many trial and error testings, which also changes everyday.  

Besides his role as CEO, Tyler is also in charge of business development, oftentimes traveling all over the world to meet with current or potential partners.  He spends pitching to major airlines.  Other tasks include working on the marketing initiative or sitting down one of the interns and discussing how their week went and what was learned.  Tyler also takes on different media, publication, or live TV requests.  Because of all the differentiated things to do, it makes the day go by quick in a good way. 

One of the most difficult challenges Tyler faces is dealing with people internally and externally.  Aligning goals internally and externally can be very difficult.  Keeping employees happy as well as customers are two very different things.  Being able to find that delicate balance is incredibly tough and has been a challenge for Tyler.  A way he strives to keep employees happy is through surprise.  There will be surprise events or company outings.  These are always very exciting and employees really enjoy it.  On the other hand, there are times when Tyler encourages employees to stay in the office later in order to push out for customers or do a lot of beta testing.
   
To show that he is also part of the process he will participate in many roles, even though it is not his job.  As the leader, he must lead by example.  He must be working as hard, if not harder than anybody in the company.  He can’t expect them to do something and not live up to that himself, or else why should they?

Currently LoungeBuddy is pre-revenue.  They are generating revenue, however unprofitable yet.  They are still in negative cash flow.  Tyler has told all his employees that he will not pay himself anything more than his rent, until they either become profitable or raise a formal round of funding.  He currently pays himself the same as interns and will continue to do so until one of the two events happen.

Another challenge LoungeBuddy works through is not having many companies to compare with.  Because they are the first business of its kind, they are constantly creating the rules as they go.  There is a lot of beta testing and trial and error.  

Tyler gave sound advice for entrepreneurs.  He mentioned that many first time entrepreneurs think they need to come up with a completely original idea.  He went on to say that just because something has been done before doesn’t mean you couldn’t do it, or do it better.  Entrepreneurs should ask themselves how they could model different pieces of various companies and reform these concepts into a new bit of execution.  His advice was to essentially copy successful companies and do it with your own insight and special hook.  Doing something completely original will waste a lot of time.  Don’t reinvent the wheel.  Some of the best ideas are the most simple.  If you can’t explain to someone what you are doing in 30 seconds, you are either not explaining it right or probably won’t be very successful at it, especially first time entrepreneurs.

Tyler goes on to say how important it is to be a good public speaker.  If you are not, it is still fine, however you must get a business partner who is.  Best of all, you should learn the skill.  When it comes to public speaking it is very important to really speak your idea and give people that excitement about what you are doing, in a way that is understandable.  Again, simplicity is key.  There were many people that were smarter and more brilliant than Tyler.  Luckily for him at a young age, he sold lemonade and performed magic shows where he got the practice of constantly talking to people and adapting to the environment.  

He continued by saying that as an entrepreneur you are always pitching, whether talking to a friend, at a baseball game, or business mixer.  You must be as excited with each and every person.  You must assume they are the next employee, business partner, investor, or acquirer.  This rang true for Tyler as he hired employees and found investors this way.  If you can’t pitch your idea 100 times a day and still be excited about it, don’t do it.  If you don’t love it, you won’t give it your all.  You must love it so much that even if you repeat it in your sleep it is still enjoyable.  

Another piece of advice was to ask for help.  Don’t be afraid to say you don’t understand something.  Ask for clarification.  If you just nod and agree for everything, you won’t learn anything.  In Silicon Valley, Tyler was at the bottom 10% of intelligent people in the room.  The great thing about this was that he had everybody to learn from.  Situations beyond our comfort zone are where we learn the most.  Put yourself in situations that are well beyond what you are used to.

Love what you do.  As an entrepreneur, you are working your ass off.  If you are not having fun while doing it, you are wasting your time.  Some people believe that a successful entrepreneur is one who exited for whatever millions or billions.  However it is the journey that is most exciting.  Once you sell, then what?  If you can do what you love and support yourself along the way, and one day have a successful exit, great!  The key is to always love what you do and continue learning.  The money will eventually come.  You may fail 10 times, but keep at it!

Personally, Tyler has faced many small failures.  They key is to start as early as possible.  Take risks.  When you make a mistake when you are young, the outcome isn’t so bad.  Always learn.  Get a part time job.  Ask a neighbor to sit down and ask them about what they do in their job.  Learn to shadow people.  Shadow 10 people.  See if you can work with a different person a week for the whole summer.  Set aside some time to learn about business in general.  You’ll eventually find your way.  Do something you love and in that way you will keep picking yourself up every time you fail.  Just starting a business isn’t what an entrepreneur is all about.  It’s about being able to make those mistakes and doing it again and again.  It’s about doing it in a field you love, time and time again.  Being an entrepreneur is very stressful.  You will constantly hear people telling you, ‘No’ over and over.  

It is one thing to come up with a lot of great ideas, than to actually execute on it.  Far fewer people will execute on an idea.  It is about the way you execute and the energy you put into the concept.  Start with something you know.  If you don’t love it, you probably won’t be successful at it.

It is crucial to get a mentor or a group of advisors.  It is also crucial to get a group of people you can bounce ideas off of.  You want to learn from others mistakes, that way you don’t make as many of those mistakes.  Constantly ask for help and constantly make more mistakes.  This is the process of learning.  A lot of easy advice may be tempting to just throw off, however they are really the important things.  

Tyler found mentors in various ways.  Some mentors for LoungeBuddy have been CoolTronics customers.  Others were from professors.  Tyler would ask his parents if they knew anybody in a certain field.  He also attended networking events.  He mentioned other ways people could find mentors are through big name guest speakers.  These people can be found at colleges, business functions, or other events.  These guest speakers really enjoy helping people out.  The reason they are up there is because they want to provide advice.  After their speech is over, follow where they go and be the first person to ask a question during the Q&amp;A session.  If they have time a mentorship may sometimes work out.  Having a mentor doesn’t mean you have to talk to them everyday.  It could just be a 10-minute phone call.  The key is to get a lot of different insight and a variety of opinions.  

I will be interviewing more young, successful entrepreneurs.  If you would like me to specifically ask them a question, comment below!


Edit: I've been reading the comments and thanks for the feedback.  This is the very first draft I wrote, which was intended to get everything from the interview into words.  I will send Tyler an email for follow up questions to some of the comments I see.

On another note, I've created a website where I want to share a lot of value.  If you love reading great books and want to get through the main concepts more quickly, check out my website www.kevinhleung.com.
I read many books and underline what is important.  I then type these up as an entry on my website.  The books I have so far include Think And Grow Rich, Awaken The Giant Within, How To Win Friends &amp; Influence People, and Never Eat Alone.

278tyr,7,2014-06-03,How to cope with a bad boss?,lavahot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/278tyr/how_to_cope_with_a_bad_boss/,"So I'll try to be as purposefully vague as I possibly can here. I work as an intern for a startup that makes an embedded device. I've been working there for almost a year. During that whole year, we have only ever met a project goal once. We are still very heavy in development, but our boss is trying to get our product into the hands of investors. Recently, we missed another deadline for the new version of the product to be completed, and we were given very little time to complete and test it. In the last year we have lost over half of the team. My boss seems to be a smart guy, but his management skills are terrible and doesn't seem to know almost anything about managing a programming team, building an embedded device, or a web service to support it. We seem to have a severe planning deficit. Things are bleak and morale is low. Let me reiterate: he's not abusive or demeaning or petty, in fact he's a very nice guy that's trying to do something to help people, but he just seems to be very bad at his job. Have you ever been in this kind of a situation before? What did you do to remedy the situation? Is there some book or website or Jon Hamm instructional video or something I can give to my boss to improve his skills?"

Hi guys, as a little background I am a 19 year old looking to start going to college again to peruse a career in programming and development. In all honesty at the moment I am in a tight spot - I was a high school drop out with a GED and getting into a bigger named College most likely won't happen for me. 

Currently the University I am looking doesn't have a CS degree but does have a few other options in the technical field. I, in all honestly want to be a developer and want to figure out what degree path would be right for me. 

I have worked with a bit of web design (HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS) but don't really have the greatest creative eye for things (though I can improve that I am sure, I know a good website from a bad one). I have also taken an intro Java class and taught my self a bit on my own, and plan to the rest of this summer and really like the application side of programming.

All in all I just would like a suggestion for which of these degree choices I should peruse. I will link the ones I am considering below.


Also - there is a ""Video Game Design"" degree that I am skeptical about but seems interesting. If someone could provide a bit of insight on that, that would be great. That is a four-year too.

[**Web Information Systems**](http://www.wilmu.edu/technology/webinfosystems_curr.aspx): I am leading towards this the most, it has some business classes, a lot of programming classes, and has internship possibilities.

[**Information Systems Management**](http://www.wilmu.edu/technology/ism_curr.aspx)

[**Game Design and Development**](http://www.wilmu.edu/technology/gamedesign_curr.aspx)


Edit: My final choice is self teaching while getting certifications. Finding another school in my current situation is not possible. "

I have silver tie clip that I like a lot and wear it with my outfits. Although, I seem to be the only one wearing one, from what I can tell. Our dress code is shirt, tie, slacks and dress shoes so to me adding a tie clip doesn't seem too out of place. But I do feel that it might be a bit tacky/show-offy.

What do you guys think? Or do you have any opinions on them?"
2793tb,1,2014-06-03,Should I take this internship if I think there is a very real chance of me leaving it after a very short period?,LaserGuidedHerpes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2793tb/should_i_take_this_internship_if_i_think_there_is/,"I've been looking for a webdev job in NYC for a while now and have been getting mixed results (some don't hire me because I was taking part time classes and couldn't commit to a fulltime schedule, others don't hire me because I plan on  returning to school next fall and wouldn't want to let me go soon afterwards) but now that I've refocused my efforts on looking at internships I'm seeing better/more results. 

The situation I am in right now is this: I have been extended an offer for an internship but it is an unpaid internship (basically) and that doesn't really work for me at all, but so far that's the only firm offer I have received. Other places I have talked to are in limbo, [poorly organized; frequently missing scheduled phone interviews or forgetting to reply to emails until much later] but they are offering paying jobs/internships. The advice I am getting from my parents is that I should take this internship for the experience, continue to interview at other places and search for another job, and if I find something paying just immediately leave the non-paying one. 

Now I have frequently read that one of the worst things I can possibly do is  leave a position without giving adequate notice, and I  would be in a situation where I more or less have to do exactly that if I took this unpaid position. 

That is my situation, what should I do?
I can obviously elaborate on anything if needs be

279am8,2,2014-06-03,My girlfriend [24] doesn't think she loves me [22/M] anymore,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/279am8/my_girlfriend_24_doesnt_think_she_loves_me_22m/,"The story of our relationship is a bit long and complicated, so I'll try to make it as clear as possible.

I met, and started dating my girlfriend at an internship in Florida almost 2 years ago, her being 23 at the time and having just graduated college, and me being 19, and in my junior year.  She is originally from Michigan, and I'm from New York, where I also went to school.  After the internship ended, she stayed in Florida for a few months, and I went back to school while we continued to date long-distance.  

We saw each other a couple of times, and talked almost every day during that time, and a few months later, she moved back home, part because she wasn't happy with her job, and part because she wanted to be closer to me and her family.  At that point, we both definitely felt that we loved each other, and our relationship was going well, albeit from a distance.  We went into the relationship knowing that I would be in NY for the last 1.5 years of school, and then move on somewhere else for a year of grad school.

She never liked long-distance, and was ready to move on to the next part of her life, while I, being  in college, was in a different phase, and have always been more ""okay"" with distance.  We continued for the next few months, seeing each other once a month or so, not completely happy, but without any major problems. 

This past February, I had to make my decision for grad school, and narrowed down my choices to one in Michigan, about 45 minutes from her, and one in Indiana, about a 2.5-3 hour drive away.  They're both equally good schools, but the school in IN is the one I have always wanted to go to, and a bit cheaper.  As one could imagine, my girlfriend wanted  me to go to the school in MI, but my parents pulled me heavily towards the one in IN (my brother went there, and we've visited many times).  It was easily the hardest decision of my life, but in the end I felt that I should go where I personally would be happiest, the school in IN. 

Needless to say, my girlfriend took this very hard, but in the end we decided to try to stay together and work things out.  Obviously I'm not perfect, but this is the only somewhat major thing I've done ""wrong,"" as far as our relationship goes.  From that point on, it was always a tough subject, but she said that she would stay with me.  

Now, for the current issue.  A couple of months ago, I got an internship in her area that would allow me to be able to live with her for the summer.  I was a bit wary, just because I had never lived with an SO before, and because things had been a bit rocky, but she seemed really excited, so I took it and decided to move in with her for the summer.  Things were fine for the first week, but now she's told me that she doesn't think she loves me anymore, and that she doesn't see me in her future.  I'm crushed; breakups are always tough, but now I'm stuck living with her for the next 2.5 months in a place I've only ever been a handful of times, and where I don't know anyone else really.  She now says that ""I don't know if it was ever true love,"" but that she wants to remain friends.

I'm just completely lost at the moment.

279dyp,11,2014-06-03,Just found out I have gained 20 lbs over the past 6 months. I'm at a total loss and could use advice.,[deleted],xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/279dyp/just_found_out_i_have_gained_20_lbs_over_the_past/,"Some background: I used to weigh around 210 lbs. I lost 45 lbs last year by running 3x per week and lifting twice per week. I ate pretty clean too. As winter came, my diet went down the drain a little and I expected weight gain. In the spring I quit my retail job and got an office job. I felt myself gaining more weight so I started running a lot again. In March I turned 21 and ended up drinking on the weekends. This led to more bad food choices. The past few weeks I have been running daily for a.minimum of 2 miles and feeling good. But I still felt really fat compared to last summer. I decided to step on the scale and found out I gained 20 lbs. I'm really upset at myself for not monitoring my weight and letting this happen. I think a major cause of this weight gain is my office job. My retail job had me running around all day and now I sit in a desk for dive hours a day. Even with running, I don't think I'm burning enough calories. Even if I limit my alcohol and eat better, will I have to double my workouts to see results? I am so bummed and unsure of how to approach this. My job is an internship so I can't quit and I am not offered a lunch or anything where I could sneak in a workout."

I will just write a list of things that have happened recently (like in the last couple of weeks) that have made me think really negative things.

1. We were in Subway, and he was reading that mayonnaise and oil are added fat. I like to put both of those things on my Spicy Italian. I am also 5'1 and 105 lbs. I still put both of those on my sandwich. While we were in the car on the way home, he started saying that he would ""break up with me if I ever got fat"". When I tried telling him it's ok if I just put a little mayo on my sandwiches he just got pissed off at me, ignored me and ate his sandwich on the couch (we eat at the table). Later on he said he just got ""upset"" because he felt like I ""didn't support him"" because I still put mayo and oil on my sandwich even though he had just told me it was added fat
2. He went to the gym, and while he was gone I cleaned his entire apartment for him. I noticed his clothes that were in the dryer were still not dry, so I put them on timed dry for him. When he got home, he got pissed off that I put his clothes on high heat and then went into his room and started ignoring me again. He still never said anything about me cleaning his apartment for him… not like I expected it but it's just a common curtesy? He later on apologized, but said that he felt I didn't ""listen to him"" when he told me to only put his towels on high heat.
3. We went to New Orleans last week. I was really excited to try this place called Acme… we went there and he didn't want to wait in a 2 minute line and I was like come on let's just eat here. He said I ""got an attitude with him"" and got in a pissed mood. We ended up going inside, he obviously wasn't happy. He said we were leaving because I was being a ""spoiled bitch"" and ""I'm not always going to get my way"", he started walking to the car not talking to me. We got back to the hotel and he said we were leaving New Orleans for the way I was acting. Long story short, after a lot of apologizing on my part and staying the rest of the entire day in the beautiful hotel room crying my eyes out because I felt like I ruined our trip, he finally came around the next day and took me back there to eat since he knew I really wanted to try it.
4. I got him a card and candy for his job offer that he got out of his internship. I wrote something like ""I'm so proud of you on your first big kid job"". He told me that ""it wasn't just a big kid job"" and that ""it was a really serious thing"" basically like… saying my card sucked and made me feel like shit. He then left my house and didn't talk to me the rest of the night. He apologized the next day.
5. He says a lot of things that bother me or are rude and when I tell him that they hurt my feelings or try to tell him that what he said bothered me or upset me he says they are just ""jokes"" or that I'm just being ""dramatic"" and that he ""doesn't need to deal with this shit"".



Theres a lot of other stuff but like I said those are things that have literally just happened in the last two weeks… and I can't remember things because stuff happens to often.


I know I'm rambling but I don't know if this is a normal thing that happens in relationships? I mean I know couples argue sometimes but I feel like he always makes me feel so shitty and bad if I do something ""wrong"" and if he does something that upsets me I pretty much have to get over it.


I don't have the balls to ever fully express how I feel and I always have anxiety because I don't know the next thing I do or say that will piss him off and have him ""not talk to me"" for an entire day which leads to me just apologizing until he forgives me.


There are parts of me that knows something isn't right but I don't know if I'm just manipulated to the point to where I convince myself that I deserve to be treated this way because I am such a bitch or irritating or dramatic…

279jln,1,2014-06-04,I'm [22 F] having a rough time transitioning out of college back to living with my mom [49 F],schmelsey17,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/279jln/im_22_f_having_a_rough_time_transitioning_out_of/,"Hey Reddit,

I just graduated from college last month. I went to University that was out of state and spent 2 out of the 3 summers having internships or research opportunities in my college city (so I really haven't spent that much time at home).

My parents got divorced when I was a sophomore in college (2 years ago). It was an extremely fast divorce. They formally admitted they were having problems to me and my older brother in October and were legally divorced and my mom had moved out by December. Things have horrible between my parents ever since.

All this being said, my mom was the one to move out of my childhood house and into a townhouse about 40 minutes from my dad. I'm not on the best of terms with my dad due to a very long and complicated string of events involving a step family and verbal abuse and such so I chose to move back home into my mom's house until I find a permanent job. 

Before I moved back home we had a chat about boundaries and giving each other space as in the past we have tended to spend 24/7 with each other during christmas breaks and such and clearly that would be sustain in this type of situation. 

I was on board with this, but it seems the last week or so that every single thing I do gets on my mom's nerves. She hasn't come to me about being upset but she has told my older brother I need to ""Fix my fucking attitude"" and I know she is spending a lot more time running errands or at her boyfriends instead of at home. 

I have a part time job, I cook and clean for myself, do my own laundry, etc in order to have a minimal impact on her. I'm hurt that she doesn't feel comfortable coming to me about whatever is bothering her.

I understand she may feel pressure to balance work, her long term boyfriend, and me, but we've only had 2 or 3 dinners alone in the past month I've been home and a handful of lunches. 

I'm at a loss about how to make this transition easier for her when it's stressful for me as well. 

Very few of my friends came home after college and the ones that did live about an hour away. I'm lonely and I miss having my mom as a friend.

Does anyone have any insight or help?

279tdo,2,2014-06-04,Only had a job for three months. I need to quit because my grades are tanking. What do I do?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/279tdo/only_had_a_job_for_three_months_i_need_to_quit/,"I'm an engineering student. I wanted a little money on the side, so I got a part time job. I'm also heavily involved in a design team. Long story short, classes that should have been easy have become hell. My grades are tanking, and with finals in a week, I'm not sure what to do. I go to a school where you have to apply to upper division engineering majors, and all of a sudden, I've gone from a 3.6 student to a 2.5. It is terrible, and I have become so depressed as a result.


The job is fine. It's really boring, but it pays okay and the people are nice. However, when I got the job, there was no talk about required hours per week or length of employment expectations. I figured probably 10 hours a week, flexible. My classes are really hard, and this quarter I am working 14 hours/week. I asked to drop down to 10 midway through the quarter when my grades started getting a hit, and I was basically told no. Now I'm being asked to do 15 next quarter, when I am taking even harder classes than now. They said that if I don't work 15 hours they will have to hire another person. At this point, I want to just tell them to hire a new person entirely because I need to focus on school.


It's only been three months. I don't want to burn any bridges, but I literally have no time to study or enjoy my time in college. There are always people who say ""suck it up, you're getting paid"", but I have no time to enjoy the money anyways. I was lucky enough to get college paid for by a state program, so I don't *need* a job, I just wanted the money. Getting a job was one of the most ill advised decisions I have made during college, and I want to quit. However, I feel as though I can't. What do I do? I am leaving for the summer and doing an internship, but I am supposed to come back in the fall. I don't want to go back.


I'm not an assertive person. Do I talk to them now? Wait and see how I feel after the summer? I have no idea what to do."

I've also done a handful of personal projects for fun in python, Java, and C++.

Now that I'm trying to get a job (in software, I really took a liking to it around my junior year) what would be the best things to, I guess, train myself with while I'm working part-time during my 'real' job search? After looking at a lot of things that employers in my area (Los Angeles) are seeking, I thought I'd go for Javascript. I'm not sure what else I could set my sites on. I know it depends a lot on what I want to do, but I'm just trying to beef-up my resume. Does anyone have any suggestions on some heavy-hitting languages, packages, etc. that I should get on top of?

I am interested in applying for an IT internship position (April 1st - October 1st 2015) at the Bosch Corporation in Japan.

Currently I am studying Computer Science at the University of Konstanz, Germany, where I expect to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in 2016. During my studies, I have acquired knowledge in programming, theoretical foundations and mathematics. During the “Computer Systems and Networks” class I at my university, I learned about network layers, internet protocols and security in computer networks. In the “Database Systems” lecture, I learned about transaction models and storage methods for databases and used SQL to formulate database queries. In a team with fellow students, I am also currently co-developing a course submission system for university teachers to facilitate the evaluation of assignments handed in by students which uses a MySQL database.

I am skilled in Office Applications as Word, Office and Powerpoint and also have experience working with various operating systems, namely Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, setting up RAID systems as well as using virtual machines to virtualize client and server machines. Furthermore, I have a strong interest in real-time systems, especially avionics and automotives.

I speak English and German fluently. Furthermore, I am very interested in Japanese culture and language. After my visit to Japan in April 2014, I began taking Japanese lessons.

As I will be working in the field of databases, especially database administration and servers, your company would be a good opportunity for me to bring my skills to perfection. I am well-fitted for your program and this position would be ideal for me to apply my computer science skills. I will contact you later to discuss the position further. I look forward to speaking with you.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,

27a1n3,2,2014-06-04,Internship advice needed: A low-ish pay internship in SF or defense company? I'm really at a loss,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27a1n3/internship_advice_needed_a_lowish_pay_internship/,"I was offered $23.50 an hour for a Summer internship at a large tech company in San Francisco (I currently live in Portland so I will have to temporarily relocate) and it seems a bit below what glassdoor and this sub list as average salaries for the area. Is this reasonable for SF? The project seems really interesting and the people I've spoken with seem nice but I'm not sure I can afford the bay area at that rate. Unfortunately, there is no relocation assistance or intern housing provided.  
    
Additionally, I'm sort of having this moral issue with the idea of asking for more pay. Frankly, I don’t think I’m /worth/ the $30-$35+ some might expect from SF internships. I have pretty decent soft skills but my programming ability is lacking quite a bit (all my fault due to lack of practicing but recently have been actively trying to get better). I want to be paid what I am worth but I would like to have enough to afford the exorbitant housing costs, as well as food and possibly stash a little away to put to student loans.  
  
I have another option, a local major defense company is offering a position that could potentially extend in to the school year (I’m an rising senior working towards my BS in CS). If they like my work and I choose to stay on board with them, it is likely they would pay for a clearance of some sort. How valuable is a clearance? I do not have a formal offer yet (although they have verbally said they want to bring me on) as I was initially interviewing for a software engineering position, however, they thought I was a better fit with the R&amp;D department due to my math background. I have my last phone interview with them tomorrow.

I’ve been very fortunate to have the two above plus other offers this Summer but I am really at a loss on how to weigh everything."

27a9f3,5,2014-06-04,(Serious Discussion) Leaving the United States due to crippling student loan debts.,nataorc6851,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/27a9f3/serious_discussion_leaving_the_united_states_due/,"**Opening Statement:**
Hello, I am a 33 year old man with a law degree from a middle rate mid-western state university. I also have bachelors in philosophy and a minor in accounting from another university. I have over 220k in student loan debt (100k gov loans, 120k private. Interest rates between 8-13%.) Currently I work at one of the larger firms in the midwest for a decent amount (70k pre tax). This account is a throwaway for obvious reasons and I won't bother offering any personal details given the nature of the questions I'm asking. As for why I'm asking this question in personal finance as opposed to /r/StudentLoans or /r/Debt well to put it plainly, this discussion will be more effective with a larger audience to offer their views and to the point, could be very helpful to other desperate Americans who may stand to learn from this situation who might otherwise miss it in those smaller subs.


First off, this discussion should be technical only... meaning I don't want to hear about your indignation or cries of immorality at the prospect of leaving the country to avoid debts. To the point, I don't give a shit about your personal beliefs and you shouldn't care for my personal actions to cast a negative light on it...

**My Situation:**
To begin, my student loans reflect the stupidity of believing a law degree would quickly be able to pay itself off without too much hassle... oh how wrong I was. After graduating in the height of the economic meltdown (late starter to undergrad) I found myself in one of the most depressed job markets for my degree and after a year or unemployment at any reputable firms found myself applying for a hardship waver due to some familial circumstances. During this time I worked at a local best buy peddling (overpriced) electronics to unknowing consumers for slightly above minimum wage. A year later I finally found some work as an unpaid intern at a local courthouse trying to buy favor with any judge or attorney that would have me so as to get my name circulating. Finally a managed to land my current job and I've been stuck doing it for the last year and half. However it is now readily apparent to me that I will NEVER EVER be able to live comfortably with this debt cloud looming over my every foot-step... just keeping up on my interest rates alone take a work of herculean proportions on my end... It's ironic, I thought getting a law degree meant I'd live a good life and have a great family, a nice 4 door sedan, and a house by the time I was in my 30's. Yet I have none of that, I have a 2001 Toyota Camry, a 1 bedroom apartment, and a pantry full of rice &amp; beans. Every day I leave my house dreading (and sometimes starving) another collections call on a loan I cannot pay. I've seriously contemplated suicide because I can't even declare bankruptcy to discharge my debts, and thus it seems I'm lef to live a life of mediocrity as a indentured debt slave to a predatory system of student loans... 

**Meat &amp; Potatoes Starts Here**
Given the aforementioned circumstances, I wish to entertain a discussion on the technicalities of leaving the United States for the purposes of avoiding the debts accrued over the course of my education. I have done some minor research on it and I'm not sure if this would be a viable solution to this problem.

- Would leaving the US absolve me of my obligation of repayment on the remainder of my student loans?

- Would my US credit history being destroyed as a result of refusal of payment infringe on my employment prospects OUTSIDE of the US?

-  What sort of penalties, legally speaking would I be facing? Could the US seek to extradite me and force me to pay off my debts?


**Alternative Solution?**
- If I were to take out a bunch of unsecured credit cards to service the entirety of my debts and then leave for a period of time, say 10 years would I then in be able to return debt free? In this context, the student loans would be ""paid"" off but the credit cards wouldn't. After this period of time the collections agencies wouldn't have the means or will to track me down and after that period of time in theory would place me under the ""uncollectible"" thus writing me off their books.
- Alternatively, could I do the above process but rather then leave the country simply declare bankruptcy after the loans have been repaid?
- To clarify, I would use a number of small sum unsecured credit cards (in the mail daily it seems) over a period of years to service my debts and avoid falling into collections over my student loans. My credit card debts would slowly overtake the Student loan debts, but unlike my Student loans... can be forgiven through bankruptcy (oddly enough, so could student loans up until 2004.)

**Final Statement:** Listen, I understand the above discussion is highly questionable from a moral standpoint... it's ethically completely wrong but given my situation I wouldn't be considering it if there was a light at the end of the tunnel. As it stands though I'm peering into the abyss with the catcalls of collections agencies cackling along and draining the fucking life outta me. This post is me hoping that there might just be a rope somewhere in this deep tunnel I find myself in to pull me out. It's a crazy idea, an alternative one, a radical one, and a historical one... but it's the only one short of death (either a quick self inflicted one, or a long drawn out one barely surviving along the way having never properly lived.) that seems possible at this current rate. I mean short of hoping for some Fight club esque scenario where student loan debts are erased in a flash of humanity or an epiphany in Washington that over takes both aisles into realizing that student loans are turning an entire generation into futureless debt slaves there doesn't seem to be much hope or concern for the people of my plight.

If you've read this far, thank you for your time... if your young, don't pay out of state tuition, and don't think that a college degree means an easy way into middle class suburbia. Sadly that dream ended 20 years ago it would seem.

EDIT: Headed to work but here's a quick budget.

**Take IN**

- Yearly: $70000
- monthly:$5833
- bi week: $2916

**Take OUT**

- Rent+Utilities: $1485
- Food: $300
- Car Insurance + Gas: $350
- Savings: $800
- Misc: $500
- Debt Obligations: $2500

Misc is just a monthly emergency spending amount on whatever might come up during the month. From car repairs to toilet paper."

Here's my situation:

My tax withholding election somehow carried over from my internship (when I knew I would have no tax liability, so I withheld nothing--has been corrected now for 2014) into full time employment. I'm now on the hook for a ~$11,000 IRS payment due June 23. Here's my current breakdown of overall financial situation:

Monthly income after taxes: $3,000
Rent/Utilities: -$1400

No physical assets (renting apartment and company car lease)
$14,000 401(k)
($28,000) student loan debt--paying $200/mo
($2,000) credit card debt--paying $300/mo
($11,000) 2013 IRS tax liability

I've given up the bad habits (eating out, smoking, drinking) but am still in quite a bind. Would it be worth drawing from my IRA to pay the tax liability? I have no physical assets to seize, and they wouldn't get a very large amount by garnishing wages. Could the IRS withdraw from my 401(k) themselves without penalty because it never reached my hands?

Please help me out, folks--I could really use some advice."

27asvh,8,2014-06-04,Me [22M] with my girlfriend [24F] of three months; she came out on her own and told me that she cheated on me. Where do I go from here?,Throwizzlemynizzle,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27asvh/me_22m_with_my_girlfriend_24f_of_three_months_she/,"Throwaway. I'll try to keep this short.


We knew each other as acquaintances, but only started to hang out/get to know each other towards the end of last year. Early on in our relationship, she told me that she had cheated on her previous long-term living-together boyfriend multiple times when things weren't working out, that she felt terrible about it, and that she wants to change. Her honesty made me want to believe her.


Fast forward to this past weekend. I was out of town; it was her  birthday. She told me she was going out with some friends; I said go for it.


I had a big project to work on for a few days, so she didn't tell me right away because she didn't want to distract me. We hung out the night after I finished it, and she came clean and told me that she had sex with her former intern who I hadn't met but had heard about before. I was shocked. She had no excuses, only that ""she has trouble saying no when she's really drunk."" She told me that I was an incredible boyfriend, that I didn't deserve it, and she kept saying she was sorry. She was sobbing. She seemed genuinely remorseful, but I knew that I had to end things. I told her I didn't hate her. I told her that I'd be there for her as a friend if she needed me, but that we can't be together anymore because I can't trust her. How could I trust her the next time I'm out of town for a weekend? Or the next time? Or the next time? I told her that I wouldn't go around telling people (mutual friends included) that she cheated, and that I would tell them that things just weren't working out between us.


That night I couldn't stop thinking about it - about them. I talked with my mom and a really good friend over the phone, and that helped some. The next morning I sent her an email telling her how I felt so she could understand, since I didn't explain as much the night before because I was still processing. It wasn't a mean/vindictive email, but it was very blunt.


What do I do? How do I get over her cheating? I know we only dated three months, and in a lot of ways this is actually one of the better ways to get cheated on (if that even makes sense), but I feel lost. I've never been cheated on before. My life is pretty great in all other regards, and my self-esteem is normally a little too high, if anything. I have school/work in the summer, hobbies, friends, family, etc., but that still hasn't lessened the pain any just yet. I know it takes time to heal, but I want to know what I can/should do right now to help that process along. I appreciate any thoughts and advice, as well as ""you did that right"" or ""you fucked that up"" statements. I'm also happy to answer questions if that helps and if they aren't too specific.

**tl;dr**: She cheated on previous boyfriends. She tearfully told me that she cheated on me soon after it happened; we broke up. I've never been cheated on before. What do I do?"

One that stands out was at my first recruiting job. In that particular company, it was against policy to date others in the office, like you could lose your job over this. They found out my manager was dating the girl in HR (who was about 20 years younger than him, that baller) and they fired him. She quit 2 days later, but before she left she sent out a mass email to everyone in the company that basically said ""You are all terrible people and when your time comes, god will be the one who judges you. You all have a special place in hell for the terrible things you've done to us"". I had no idea she was nuts, but man that was some weird shit.
 |I also once worked with a guy who I hung out with outside of the office one time with my girlfriend at the time. Apparently he was a huge douche bag and I didn't know it. I went to the bathroom at the club we were at, and apparently while I was gone the guy asked my gf what she was doing with a guy like me, said she should be with a guy like him and asked her if she'd like to come back to his place. She told him to fuck off. We broke up a few months later and he heard about it. He asked me if he could have her number because she's available and my manager told me to take a couple days off because he saw me headed over to his cube to punch him in the face (which I was going to, I was too young to care). One of my friends at work grabbed me and directed me out of the door. In hindsight, I'm glad my coworker stopped me from hurting him. I had been training in MMA at the time and i could have really hurt the guy. The dude was rich and would have sued the shit out of me. To this day, I'd still like to drop him.

[I assume it's really bad to lie on your CV. Do you have a story about someone who made an outrageous claim on his CV and got caught out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|Yeah, don't lie on your resume. No one likes dishonest people, especially in the work place. No crazy stories, but I have seen it happen.
[Is there a tactic to play hard to get on an interview, saying you're not sure if you'd actually take the job? Or is that just plain stupid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|In an interview you can say something along the lines of ""I'm really interested in this position, but there are a couple others I'm looking at as well"". 
[Is it good to try to do some small talk with the interviewer before/after (because I will most likely be working with them\) or should I keep it professional?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|Yes, absolutely make friends with the interviewer. This is beyond important, especially if you're new in your field. A lot of managers will hire you based on personality. If they think you would be a great person to work with, they can train you on everything else. I always tell everyone, go in there and make friends with the person. If they really like you but you don't fit the job, they'll remember you when something comes along that you are a fit for. I've seen this happen more times than I can count. 
[Do people still ask the crazy questions like ""How many golfballs would you need to fill a bus?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxew3?context=5)|No I've never heard any crazy questions like that. I had one lady in an interview ask me when i'm sitting at a red light, do I look at the other light to see when it turns red so I can go as soon as the other one turns green. But that was a good question. She was trying to judge my level of patience.
[Please explain ""technical"" recruiter. What is a ""technical"" career field? I only ask because I'm finishing up 11 years active Army service in logistics, and looking for a new career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyx456?context=5)|I basically hire people in the information technology field. Software Engineers, Network Engineers, Data Admins, etc.
 |11 years in the military with your profession, I think you shouldn't have a problem finding a job. Companies seem to hire ex military over civilians.
[Audio engineers? Need one? It says engineer ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0pbg?context=5)|I don't need one, but there are a lot of positions out there for them.
[I'm relocating from the D.C area right now to head back to Michigan. Any tips, tricks or such. What should I be prepared for? If you don't mind me asking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyx8wg?context=5)|Get your resume out there ASAP and create profiles on websites like Monster and Careerbuilder. Also, try indeed.com. It's a great job board that pulls every job posted from every job board when you do your search. Also, make sure you have a detailed linkedin account. Believe it or not, people do check those things. Good luck!
 |Also, find local staffing companies to the area and reach out to at least one recruiter at each one and stay in touch with them. You never know when they'll have a job pop up that fits your background. It's good to establish a relationship with them. Most recruiters, good ones at least, genuinely want to help you find something. It gives us great pleasure when we make someone happy finding them a job.
[Wish it worked out that way for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4rve?context=5)|:( I'm sorry, man. Don't give up though, seriously. If you want something, don't stop going after it until you get it. Unless it's a girl who's not interested. That'll just get you a restraining order.
[By technical I usually think draftsmen, assemblers, builders, engineers etc. The more mechanical side of things. Having a degree in product design I see less demand for physical development as opposed to electronic development. The times are a changing I guess.  Is there demand for designers or engineers these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyzszd?context=5)|I'm really not sure. By technical I mean software engineers, data architects and things like that. When you hear IT (Information Technology) that's usually the type of positions they're referring to. I know physical development isn't in AS high of demand as electronic development, you're right about that.

[I currently work for one of the largest government contractors in the US as well! Is the system ""it's all about who you know"" the only way to get noticed?

What I would do is try to find the specific people hiring for the job you're interested in, try to find their email or linkedin account and email them directly. I would definitely make sure you have a very well written resume. If you're completely unsure how to write a resume, contact and pay someone to write it for you. It's definitely worth the investment. A resume is the strongest first impression you're going to make.
[What's the most common mistake you've seen job-seekers make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chywyd5?context=5)|Well one of the biggest ones is having a sloppy resume. You have to have a good looking resume to grab someones eye. It shows your attention to detail and willingness to do something the right way and take pride in your work.
 |Also, acting desperate in an interview. Never say ""I just need a job"" or anything to that affect. Some managers will understand, but most will take it as ""this person will say anything just to get a job and could be lying"". Be confident in your skills and work ethic. Act interested in the job, but don't act desperate. You should be there to interview the hiring manager just as much as they're interviewing you. A good manager will appreciate that.
[Thanks for the response. Are there any other red flags that you often see that most job-seekers don't really understand are negative? And just for kicks, what are some of the worst flubs you've ever seen people make as they look for work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxfwy?context=5)|Some people are just weird to be honest haha. That or they have a negative attitude. Go in with a positive attitude. No one wants to work with an asshole.
 |I haven't come across any major flubs, but I have been conducting a technical phone screen with someone and after a question they would say ""ummm, uuuh, uuum"" while I could hear them typing because they were trying to look up the answer. I call them out every time and usually get off the phone with them pretty quick.
[Can I show you my resume and have you look over it? I am having lots of trouble finding a job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0buz?context=5)|Because of the contract I work on, I honestly have to remain anonymous on here. However, I would definitely contact a recruiter and ask them for recommendations. There should be a ton of recruiters around. Also, you can pay someone to write your resume for you to make it look really good. Sorry I can't be of more help :(
[What's the job market really like for technical professionals, from your perspective?  Do you recruit engineers for remote work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chywufy?context=5)|It really depends on where you live. In the DC metro area, it's booming pretty well. I don't know about the rest of the country and I also don't see a lot of remote work for engineers. At least not on the contract I work on.
[Quantico is a hotbed right now, I just got an offer :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz00i8?context=5)|Quantico is always a hotbed. Congratulations! I've heard it's a good place to work.

[How has the job market changed over the last nine years? Were there more jobs available nine years ago? Are you getting more qualified applicants than you used to? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxhae?context=5)|It's actually kind of hard to tell. Because I'm in the DC metro area, there are always a lot of jobs on government contracts. I'm not sure what the difference is between the private sector then and now. However, 9 years ago, there were definitely a lot more government jobs coming out.
[I work for a smallish govt contractor in the DC area as well! I'm looking to explore positions outside of what I'm doing now (Air Force Sales/Contract Mgmt, etc.\) How hard is it to get in the door of larger Govt Contractors if you don't have a clearance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyz1vt?context=5)|Um, it kind of depends. If it's a lower level clearance, they'll usually sponsor you. If you already have a clearance, they'll usually sponsor you there as well to up the level of your clearance. However, if you don't have a clearance and are looking for a job with a secret or even top secret clearance, 9 times out of 10 the company will sponsor you and get you a clearance. It's ridiculous how easy it is to obtain a secret or TS clearance.
[How likely would someone be to get their secret bumped to ts if they have a DUI conviction in the past year?  (Otherwise good record and credit,etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0yzk?context=5)|Oh, I honestly don't know about that. I would do a google search on the requirements. I think you would be ok.
[What about recent a recent college grad (AS\) that lives on the other side of the country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyyw8b?context=5)|That's hard to say. I know it's harder and harder for recent grads to find a new job. All I can say is post your resume everywhere. Monster and careerbuilder are good sites, and indeed.com is a good site to search on. The best advice I can give, put a couple hours into searching each day and network as much as you can. Realistically, it could take a year or longer for you to find a job, just do not give up. Keep looking until you find something. The hardest thing is getting a foot in the door, but once you do, if you do well, you're set. Work something part time just to make some money and keep looking for a full time job and eventually you'll get one. Like my dad always said, just keep doing the foot work.
[During the application process, I've always been conflicted on the ""What's your current salary"" question. Is lying and saying you make more than you do to try to get a better offer frowned upon or expected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyz8nu?context=5)|I've always lied and never had a problem. There is no way for them to find out. If a company asks to see a copy of your W2 to prove it, get up and walk out. That's not a company you want to work for.
[I recently left an agency recruiting job...this was always a tough question to have to ask people...and we did work with companies that asked for it.  On the upside...my current job didn't ask for a W2 and I got double my previous base :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0ka8?context=5)|That's awesome. I did that when I left my last staffing job and transitioned to corporate. About a 40k raise. It's definitely a life changer and a jump I'm glad I made. Congrats to you!
[So I just sent my info to a company that wants to interview me and let them know what my current salary is and then what I want. Its a significant difference. Did I hurt myself? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4b0k?context=5)|No I doubt it. If they can't meet what you want, but they still want to hire  you, they'll make you an offer of what they can afford. I see that a lot. Someone making a certain amount and is like ""I want 30k more"". We kind of laugh like ""Jesus, the balls on this guy"", but if he's good we make him the best offer we can. It usually works out for everyone. 
[Ok, yeah they want to fly me out to Herndon for an interview, so I figure they at least want to meet me.  What are some good questions to ask at a post interview?  I know they can train me to the job, I already have the clearances and stuff needed so I am not to worried about it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4wdd?context=5)|Oh wow, congrats. Do you mind if I ask what company? I'm very familiar with Herndon. If they want to spend the money to fly you out, that's a great sign.  One question I ALWAYS ask, and I've never heard anyone ask it before, is ""how do you like working here?"". It seems to catch a manager off guard, but they always seem pleased to answer. It's kind of like an off the record/personal question. Almost every job I've interviewed for, I always try to shoot the shit with the manager. If I can't do that, then it'll be tough to work for them. When I got my job here, I started off with just small talk with the manager. 2 hours later, I realized it was an entire interview about small talk and she didn't ask me any questions about my recruiting background. She liked me so much she hired me an hour later. A lot of managers will hire people based a lot on if they get along with them or not, because you can always train the person.
[You've said you didn't go to college, so am I correct in assuming you don't have a background in the field you're recruiting in? Is that common? I mean, I don't get the impression that most recruiters calling me have a background in mechanical engineering. How does that play into evaluating people? Is there any sort of training about the field you're hiring in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz8ffl?context=5)|I've seen some IT people convert to recruiters but it's rare. I have just learned what technologies go with what skill sets over the years. You could show me java programming on a computer and I would have no idea what I'm looking at. Ask me to find a java developer with a certain set of skills, that I can do. 
[Do you get lot of contacts from outside of your country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chyxncd?context=5)|Not me personally, but there are a lot of contracts that need people willing to travel outside of the US.

I just want to go back to Afghanistan hah. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0fsx?context=5)|Yeah it's tough sometimes, man. I never went to college, I just got a lucky break and consider myself extremely lucky to have ended up where I did. Just keep working at it and you'll find something.
[Do they tend to be any easier to get? As a single guy, I would be more than happy to travel/live in other places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4vrr?context=5)|Ya know, I'm really not sure. You'd be surprised how many people are willing to travel and relocate.
[Why are so many recruiters so cagey about telling you who the job is for? It drives me nuts because it's always ""an exciting opportunity for someone with your skills that I'd love to discuss with you?"" And then it takes forever to drag out of them that it's a position I've already heard of and rejected, or with a company I wouldn't consider working for.  It seems like such a waste of everyone's time, but they're always so guarded about actually saying a name.  What gives? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz5o7j?context=5)|Because they don't want you to go to the company and apply directly. If you do, and they hire you, they don't get any commission. That's one thing I love about corporate recruiting. I can tell you right away who it's with. MEEE!

I've been offered a full time IT Helpdesk/Web position at my school for 3 months. There's a possibility that the position would extend throughout the school year if the department can get the funding. I would be responsible for: maintaining web applications, migrating static websites to Drupal, providing help desk support, and migrating 4-5 databases into a centralized database. The other option is that I take Java courses and a Mobile Development for Android course at my local community college. So my question is: What should I do? Money isn't an issue for me; I'm more interested in getting experience. Would this position be helpful for a CS student? Would having a job look better for recruiters than taking an Android development class? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chzi8uz?context=5)|Personally, I would go for the java and mobile development class.

The best thing I can say is just get your resume out there as much as possible. Contact recruiters at technical staffing companies and let them know your situation. Build relationships. That way when you have your certs, you'll be ready to go and they'll already know who you are. I see a lot of people in IT positions that don't have a degree related to IT.

Things like making 10 years of experience mandatory with a technology that's only been around for 5?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4mlv?context=5)|It's not common, but I've seen it happen. I've had managers request, lets say like you said, 10 years of experience with a technology that's only been around 5 years. I'm usually like ""I've never heard of this"", I look it up only to find out it hasn't been around that long and think ""is this manager an idiot"". If you're familiar with upper management in a lot of places, you'll find the answer is yes more times than not.
[The FBI is currently reconsidering its zero-tolerance policy on marijuana for some of their computer recruits. What is your opinion on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1otg?context=5)|Good. Marijuana should be completely legalized. It's absolutely ridiculous that it's still illegal to fire up a joint and enjoy a movie that would suck if you watched it sober. 
[Any chance you can stop sending me emails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4vh5?context=5)|I don't send mass emails through a system. I make every single one of them personal. My manager, on the other hand, will blast the shit out of people. Blame her haha.
[How should someone who is currently employed but looking for a better opportunity go about doing it? As in, how do you keep your job while dealing with the risk of a prospective employer contacting your current employer as a reference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz101v?context=5)|Well first, you have to give them permission to contact your current employer. If they contact them without getting permission, they could face a lawsuit. In all my years, I've found that it's pretty hard for your current company to find out you're looking. Unless you go change into a suit and walk out of the building at lunch. Then they might be suspicious. 
[How does one not already in a job needing one, get a security clearance that is needed to apply for many jobs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz12ks?context=5)|You can't, unless you pay for it yourself and it's really expensive. Most companies will sponsor you for a lower level clearance if you don't have one.
[On a scale of one to ten, how hard is it to get a federal job or a job with any government contractors if you have issues with student loans you've let lapse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz4udi?context=5)|Damn, I never thought of that and I honestly don't know. I wouldn't imagine too difficult. If you filed for bankruptcy, that's a different story.
[Has your inbox just been overloaded with people asking for your help in getting a job? I mentioned I once worked for an IT government contract firm in a single comment and had 20 messages asking for help getting a job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz3om2?context=5)|Yeah it has haha. And I can't give out my contact info. I wish I could help. 
[My husband works for a contractor for the government and we had to move to Arizona.  How can I get that contractor to relocate to Colorado, so we can move back and be happy again? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chze51n?context=5)|That breaks my heart :( I'm so sorry. I wish I had an answer for you. 
[Dumb question: I'm a student, and I've done internships for three years. Would that count as three years of experience?  I'm also in the DC metro area BTW. Falls Church! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz1pdb?context=5)|I definitely would, yeah. 
[Since you've done both staffing and corporate recruiting, what would you say are the main difference between the two? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27ad1g/iama_technical_recruiter_for_one_of_the_largest/chz0pat?context=5)|Someone asked this question already and here was my response.
 |In staffing it's a lot more cut throat and commission based jobs are always hard. We had set metrics we had to meet and it was definitely faster paced and a lot more work. I had to interview people before sending them off for an interview, etc. Now all I have to do is call them up, qualify them and find out their salary and then send them to the manager. I don't do any interviewing and I rarely have to negotiate salary. Also, if they get an offer and don't take it, I still make the same amount of money. Nothing pissed me off more than when someone accepted an offer then called the day before to say they took a better offer. It's like someone stealing $2000 out of your wallet. Basically, corporate recruiting is so much less stressful and generally corporate recruiters are more fun to work with.

I've decided it's too soon to maintain a friendship, but I miss him and am having a hard time cutting contact.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27awey/my_21_f_and_my_recently_exboyfriend_22_m_ive/,"We were together for a year, the last few months of which were temporarily long distance because I went on a semester exchange. Now we're both back in the same place. We had a month of hard times over Skype, and eventually broke up. He came to visit me 2 weeks later for a week. We were still broken up, but had a really good time together, had sex, told each other we love each other. It might have just been that we missed each other and had some lost time to make up for.

I got home a couple nights ago, and we had a short talk yesterday. The same issue that led to our breakup is still there, which is that he's just not sure that he wants a relationship and doesn't feel like it fits his personality or into his life right now. It's this whole ""Im not saying I don't want this, Im just not saying I do."" After about 2 months of this wishy-washy game, I decided to end whatever weird friendship/hookup/hangout thing we were doing. I figure I should be with somebody who knows they want to be with me and are excited about it.

I told him that I don't want to see him or talk to him this summer, just to give me some time to let the feelings fade away before possibly attempting a friendship. But Im just hurting a lot and after not seeing him for almost 4 months, it's hard to resist calling him or driving over to see him. 

He still wants a friendship right now and was really hurt when I had to walk away from it, and for the next few days I will have to see him here and there. (Im using his car and still need to pick up my things from his place, I move up to a different town in a couple days for a summer internship.)

I guess Im just looking for advice on how to keep no-contact and avoid falling back into the weird limbo stage. It's hard when you still love a person very much and want to be with them, and they want to see you, but you're not on the same page about those conditions.

**tl;dr**: Need advice on keeping no-contact and distance from somebody you still love and you both want to see each other, just under different conditions."
27awi0,3,2014-06-04,"First time using access at new internship, company database just stopped working",noobieQs,MSAccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSAccess/comments/27awi0/first_time_using_access_at_new_internship_company/,"So I've recently been assigned to update a database that a previous intern created. I have almost no experience with SQL or Access.

For the past week I've been attempting to learn by looking at the previous interns work. I've been copying the .mdb files off of the network drive and onto a separate drive, and changing the names by adding _EDIT. I only saved changes to one of these files, and all I did was change a table color. 

Today the database stopped working. No one has said anything to me but I'm afraid that it's somehow my fault.

Could I have effected the database files by poking through copies of them on a separate drive? I'm extremely new to this.

Help.

**Update:**

I discovered why the database was broken. Somehow the vba modules were all deleted off all of the forms. Any idea how this could have happened? Fortunately we had a backup. I overheard someone blaming me for it earlier. I do not have write access to the database files yet, so I've only been able to access copies of the files. I've deleted all of those copies now. I do not remember saving any edits to these copies, but I may have. 

Any advice to reduce risk in the future, while I learn my way around VBA and access?"
27ax9p,5,2014-06-04,I'm [21 M] thinking about breaking up with my fiancee [22 F] of 6 years,throwawaya1s2d3f4,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27ax9p/im_21_m_thinking_about_breaking_up_with_my/,"As the title says I'm thinking of breaking up with my fiancée of 6 years. We met in high school when I was a sophomore and she was a senior, we both took each other's virginity and we're both the only relationship we've ever been in.

Currently I'm several time zones away from her on an internship in my field of study that pays quite well. The town I'm from is quite small and there isn't much for jobs and she's living there with her mother while I finish college. 

In the last year or so I've become hyper aware of the fact that I've never been in a relationship with anyone else or had sex with anyone else and I'm curious about what else is out there. In the small town we're from there weren't many people and so not much to be curious about but after getting out into the wider world and seeing what's out there I feel like I could do better than my current fiancée. Don't mistake me, I love her and I could easily see myself spending the rest of my life with her but I'm afraid that I'll always be wondering what-if if I never try anything else. 

One of the big things that's bothering me is that, because of some new opportunities I have thanks to my internship, I've been feeling kind of stifled. I know I have a responsibility to spend time with her and be with her but there's so much stuff to do here and I finally have the ability to take advantage of it. On some level I resent the limitation on my freedom that being in a relationship imposes. It was never a problem before but that's because there wasn't anything I wanted to do or had the money to do.

I also kind of feel like I have an obligation to stay with her, just because we've been together so long and I promised to support her and help her with her student loans and things like that. Her job prospects are significantly worse than mine and we both agreed she would be a housewife (which I have no problems with). I'm concerned because I feel like if I leave her I'm condemning her to live on some shitty minimum wage job in a dead town for the rest of her life. I feel like I owe her some kind of future.

I've talked about this with her and it made her upset, obviously she would rather not break up with me, but she says it's the waiting that's killing her and she wants a decision (though this wasn't an ultimatum, and obviously she would prefer I decide to stay with her). I feel compelled to add that when I'm actually talking with her or around her all my reasons for wanting to leave her seem petty and ridiculous compared to how I feel typing this out right now. It's like around her is being on a drug.

I guess I'm looking for advice on what I should do. Anyone experience this before? How did you deal with it? Is this just some natural feeling I have to overcome?

Thanks for any help.

27bbmq,1,2014-06-04,Help me build a business casual wardrobe on the cheap,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/27bbmq/help_me_build_a_business_casual_wardrobe_on_the/,"I have a 12-week summer internship and the dress is business casual.

I don't fit into most of my clothes that could serve this purpose anymore, so I'm mostly starting from scratch.

Some considerations: 

I don't have a ton of money. I'll spend what I have to, but I really need to be saving. I could go up a little in quality since I'm done growing in height, but I'm also newish to lifting and I expect to be getting a good amount bigger in the coming couple years.

I have an athletic build, which makes it a huge pain in the ass to find things that fit. Wide shoulders, long arms for my height, narrow waist, big butt and thighs. Also, I have a longish torso and short legs for my height, so finding shirts that stay tucked in is a bitch.

Things I figure I need for sure:

brown dress shoes/brown belt to match.
I already have black dress shoes, but I think they're a little too dressy

2 pairs of dressy chinos, one kahki, one light grey

5+? button-down shirts, mostly solid colors, maybe a couple gingham or striped. Don't want to repeat outfits too much so I migh be looking at more like 7.

Ties are not necessary from what I understand. Also I think Fridays are casual, so that gives me some wiggle room.

Sooo, what are some brands/stores I should look at? And what aspects of the wardrobe have I gotten wrong or missed?



I figured you guys could help me out, and this thread could help others out with similar questions.


Thanks a ton

27bdqo,3,2014-06-04,"[M4F] Blackmail, Coercion, and Perversion",RavisherDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/27bdqo/m4f_blackmail_coercion_and_perversion/,"Good afternoon, DPP!

I'm looking for a female with time and literary prowess to walk down a dark fantasy road with me this afternoon; and thusly, I have a couple of scenes I find interesting, either to be played themselves or start a discussion between myself and such a lady.

--------------------------------------
1) She is a power-executive type, an iron-fisted boss, the undisputed leader of this company branch. She brooks no dissent, fires people who don't agree, and is climbing up that corporate ladder like a lightning bolt. Bowing to no man, putting her career first. She's also been embezzling small sums of money out of the branch for some time, building up a nice little nest egg in case the Good Old Boys Club stops her rise.

And that, of course, is where the mistake was made, and she has no way of knowing that the knock on her office door belongs to a young intern who followed a trail of discrepancies, has the evidence, and holds all the cards; but what he wants isn't money, but a more -personal- slice of revenge.

2) She's a good girl, college age, with bright prospects and high grades, planning to be a doctor, a teacher, the like. Attractive, but not a bimbo - just a pretty girl next door type. Unfortunately, she made a mistake recently in her choice of friends; hanging out with some classmates, who with her around became involved in some sort of crime; possession, theft, running from the police; that she was indirectly also considered to be an offender. Due to her record, she was given a probation sentence and an officer to report to. As long as she keeps her nose clean, they will remove the charge from her record at the end of the probationary period.

Unfortunately for her, the parole officer she's assigned with views corruption as a way of life, a perk of the job. With the power to send her to jail and taint her permanent record, and being in a jurisdiction known for harsh punishments for small crimes (it's a little miracle she got only probation), how much will she have to give away to keep her record clean?

-------------------------------------------------------------
These are just some of the ideas playing bumper cars in my head as of now.

My main limits are scat, fur, scenes with multiple main characters active at once (either aggressors or targets), poor spelling and grammar (nothing takes me out of a scene like 'txt spk'), and partners without imagination who expect their opposite to do all the work while they respond with robotic oohs and aaahs.

I find Reddit's PM system to be a little bit... unelegant, so if you are up for shifting to AIM or email or something similar (but not KIK please) I would be happy to once we've established we can build a great scene together.

If you've gotten this far and still have interest you should definitely drop me a line, but if you elect not to, I wish you good luck with your own kinky scenes. :)"

[Hi Eva - Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA! I’m vaguely obsessed with your Instagram, but it always leaves me wondering: When do you eat the apple?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3gu1?context=5)|I usually eat the apple either at 11 AMish before I get REALLY RAVENOUS FOR LUNCH or around 3 PM as an afternoon snack!
[It's just after 11 AM here on the west coast - I'm going to grab an apple to stave off hunger in your honour :\) thanks for answering!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3r51?context=5)|How do you like them apples? :) Enjoy! 
[Hi Eva- I think you're a great editor with amazing style (and a fantastic Instagram account\). How do you respond to criticism that working in fashion, particularly fashion magazines, is only for the children of the wealthy? Do you do anything to promote the hiring of lower-income prospective editors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3lgy?context=5)|I don't really look for people from a specific income bracket  when I hire. I am looking for articulate people with a palpable sense of drive/hunger/fashion knowledge/LUCKY excitement and capability more than anything else. I am a first-generation American, as are many other staffers here. It's more about what you can bring personality-wise versus what your last name is at LUCKY. 
[I recently graduated college with a degree in Neuroscience, but like you, decided to forgo the science route to pursue my passion in beauty.  I will begin working in product innovation at a large beauty company in a few days and could not be more excited.  However, four years of college has permanently engrained phrases like ""make a difference,"" ""help others,"" and ""make the world a better place"" into my head, and I sometimes worry that my career pursuits are not going to fulfill these lofty pleas.  I am wondering if you ever dealt with this type of crisis, and was hoping you could lend some advice on how to deal with this tug-of-war between wanting to follow dreams of my own and feeling like I need to do something more beneficial for the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3m24?context=5)|Congratulations and applause on your bravery. It's tough to make a change/pivot in that way, I know first-hand. I think there's a way to combine your two passions. There are amazing companies that combine the two—think of brands like Warby Parker, Tom's, Yoobi (a new one), Yes to Carrot, etc. And there are different ways to help people. Sure, fashion isn't curing cancer. But there are so many charities that the industry supports—think of the impact it's had on AIDS awareness, for instance. And think of the way the beauty industry has embraced charities like Dress for Success and Breast Cancer Awareness. I suppose what I'm saying is where there's a will, there's a way. And I know you can do it. 
[Hi from the Birchbox Team, Ms. Chen! We are dying to know—how do you keep up with all of your social media accounts (including talking to all of your fans!\) AND run an insanely successful style magazine? Give us your stamina secrets! xo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3mnx?context=5)|Oh, haiii! Nice to see you on reddit, ladies!  Well, honestly, I'm not sure how I do it all but I do? I suppose it helps that I genuinely love social media AND magazines so it doesn't ever really feel like work. And I find time to do both by just being structured about my hours... When I'm in a cab, for instance, that's prime tweeting/Instagram time. When I'm walking down the Lucky hallway, that's prime Instagram-stalking time. Did I say stalking? I meant... savoring :)
[Eva, THINK FAST! You have $100 to spend on a fashion-related object. What do you buy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3ku1?context=5)|On one object? Well, geez, that's a hard question. I'd rather go to ASOS or Topshop and buy many objects: a pouch (use as a wallet or clutch), statement earrings or a cat watch (Charming Charlie has a good one), and a crop-top from Topshop to wear with my high-waisted skirt. The latter is an item I have on this very moment and basically I bought them in every color when I was in London. It was $18!
[Hi Eva! Thanks for having this session! I just want to know, in the industry, is experience (i.e. internships\) or qualifications (Master's degree etc.\) more valued when looking for editorial or writing jobs? Also, thank you for being such a fashion inspiration to us all! &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3j7m?context=5)|Master's Degree: Not so much, although I have one. I got it when I was working at ELLE at the time and wanted to go ""as a hobby"" (that was ill-advised. Craziest 18 months of my life until I got this job at Lucky). It was a good experience though, in terms of learning to write quickly, identify the lede/kicker, etc. And I think if you are dying to go to graduate school, you should. There's something lovely about devoting yourself to learning. I wish I could go back to school still. Maybe for an MBA or Hogwarts.
 |In terms of the best preparation for working at a magazine, it's interning. It's a tough market for interning now as many companies are re-evaluating their programs. I'd advise starting local/small before coming to NYC for an internship.
 |And practice makes perfect. Write, write, write. Even if it's for yourself. You'll discover your voice and POV that way. 
[Hi Eva - who is your favourite up-and-coming designer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3mr5?context=5)|Ack, that is an impossible question because there are so many! I have been obsessed with the shoe designer Gianvito Rossi lately—his shoes are SO COMFORTABLE, I can basically jog in them. MSGM makes cool street wear that's in-between luxury-luxury and downtown-cool. Dion Lee I haven't had the pleasure of wearing yet, but I love how modern it is. Trademark is a brand everyone-everyone-everyone at Lucky LOVES and everything is under $500. 
[Hi Eva! I remember seeing the interview you did with Huff Post and reading that it's taken you 10 years to solidify your voice. Did you ever feel like your writing wasn't good enough and wanted to give up? If so, what kept you motivated? Any advice that your mentors passed on to you that helped you along the way? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3vw7?context=5)|I never was, like, ""Oh, I should give up"" but there have definitely been moments where I've been like ""Oh my gosh, I am only three steps above a third grader in terms of coherency."" I think what kept me going is just knowing that it would work out and knowing that the more I write, the better I'd get. That's the light at the end of the tunnel—remember that always. 
[Hi Eva never expected to see you on reddit but while you're here I'll ask away. I credit you for landing a job in the fashion industry. I currently work for a local designer in upstate ny and I'm also a photographer. my longtime boyfriend is encouraging me to move in with him right outside the city which we both think could be a great career move. I'm really nervous because I feel like I have nowhere near the amount if credentials as the people I would be competing with. Do you think there's room for me in the biggest fashion capital and if so what should my next step be??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz49pi?context=5)|Take that leap of faith. It might be tough in the beginning but NYC will likely open more doors for you because there are more opportunities and you'll build a network. It sounds scary but I think you'll find it worth it. 
[I work full-time in social media, but I absolutely love to write and I've written for a few places, it's basically a second job. But, I also need to have time for myself and to enjoy other things so that I don't burn out.  I was wondering, how do you manage to do everything and still have hobbies outside of the office? And, how do you avoid burning out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3wn4?context=5)|Burnout is a hazard for everyone in this day and age when we're connected 24-7-365. I think I stay sane by doing, um, very little on weekends that involve work. I try to save that time for friends and family on the weekends. Also, I try not to do too much at night. And I get—this is where people are going to like, WHAT?!—nine hours of sleep of night on average. Sleep = the secret.
[I am a fan of your Instagram, esp the travel skincare/beauty posts. What are your top travel skin/beauty favs that you can't leave NY without. Also how do you pack ALL of that?! Your toiletry bag is a must to Instagram next HA! Thank you :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3jv6?context=5)|My toiletry bag is pretty impressive, I have to admit. Basically I have several (huge) Ziploc baggies at home of travel products and they're organized by category at home. And when I travel I put what I need in the toiletry bag and when I get home I resort them. Yes, it's a crazy system. So when I travel, I always bring the following: 
 |Makeup wipes.
 |SPF.
 |Ridiculous amounts of body lotion since I have the driest skin in the world.
 |Multi-use products like Nars The Multiple or Benetint.
 |And I often pack products where I'm like 1 inch away from being done with them so that I can toss then while I travel. I don't know why, that makes me super happy. 
[Hi Eva!  Thanks for doing this, and I think you are a great example and leading light in the fashion industry.  However, I wonder how what your feelings are regarding editor gifting?  Do you think it taints the media and information the consumer receives? An example being if you got a new face wash with new Jimmy Choos does that mean that face wash will get into the magazine regardless of its quality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3v1b?context=5)|I think that the editors who cover a product solely based on gifting probably are not exercising their best judgement. At the end of the day, we have to remember the magazine is for the readers/readers' service, not for our own personal closet. Our editors are a smart/sensible/great bunch. I feel Lucky (there's that pun again, sorry) to work with them!
[Hi Eva, how did you get your start in the magazine business? Can you tell us more about your career development from starting in the industry to where you are now as editor in chief of Lucky? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3jl8?context=5)|Hi there! This link answers your question, I believe! Feel free to ask followup questions :) [Link to www.businessoffashion.com](http://www.businessoffashion.com/2013/08/the-creative-class-eva-chen-editor-in-chief.html)
[How did your roles at Teen Vogue, ELLE, and other various publications helped you revamp Lucky Magazine? What do you think is the secret to creating awesome content for the publication and coming up with fresh ideas each month? Thanks! xx.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3uez?context=5)|I think life in general is an aggregation of experiences and, of course, working at Teen Vogue and ELLE under great EICs like Amy Astley and Robbie Myers were great experiences. I even think my time as a pre-med student working for 9 embattled months at a law firm were good experiences. Everything teaches you something, if you know to look for the lesson.
 |I think the secret to creating content is listening to the ideas of staff. Lucky is a great collective of stylish minds and I trust them to have some great ideas! And they never disappoint! 
[Hi Eva, I hope you don't mind multiple questions. who are your favorite designers at the moment? And where do you typically get your style inspiration? What made you decide to get into fashion and running a magazine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3rdk?context=5)|Hi there! Part I of your question I tackled earlier but MSGM, Public School, Trademark, and Etre Cecile are a few more of my favorite new lines! I get my style inspiration from so many places: living in NYC and being lucky (excuse the pun) enough to travel, my coworkers at Lucky have next level style, and Instagram! I love seeing what people around the world—whether I know them or not—are inspired by.
 |In terms of what made me decide to run a magazine... That wasn't really something I actively sought out, actually. I always sort of just worked hard/my best at what I was doing, whether it was beauty director at Teen Vogue (where Amy Astley the EIC there was a huge mentor) or a freelance writer, and just sort of assumed that things would work out and I'd be happy. I suppose I'm an optimist that way. I never thought I'd be in this position and am so grateful every day to have it. 
[Any general advice for Asian-American women aspiring to be successful in industries such as fashion/entertainment/etc.? Thanks for doing this AMA! You're an inspiration. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3lod?context=5)|SPEAK UP, DON'T UPTALK, AND BE THE SQUEAKY WHEEL! 
[Hi eva! how does it feel to be not only one of the youngest, but also the first asian-american editor-in-chief of a well-known fashion magazine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3p68?context=5)|It was very surreal in the beginning, to be honest. There were moments at fashion shows when I'd ask myself (in my mind, not out loud... not to sound crazy:)) ""What am *I* doing here?"" But I've gotten a bit used to it by now and, TBH, it's still pretty amazing/surreal. I would love for there to be more Asian-Americans in media/magazines. I'm involved with the AAJA. And I'm not the only one—there's also Janice Min and Joyce Chang. But hopefully more more more to come.  And I know these are not fashion but every woman needs a great concealer (sigh). 
[Also, what are some classic pieces of clothing that every woman should have in her wardrobe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3p68?context=5)|And every woman should have these things in their closet:  *a ""gee-whiz-I-look-great"" dress that makes you feel like a million dollars. One that you can wear to the office and to a wedding, with the right accessories *a pair of high heels you can actually walk in that you can wear to the same events above. I'd suggest a classic pointy-toed pump or a minimalist sandal like Stuart Weitzman's Nudist.
[Eva, daaarling, (your name just lends itself to that phrasing\) whats your favorite thing about your new(ish\) role as EIC???  Happy editing!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3nmz?context=5)|Hello, darrrling (that is fun to type, you're right). Hmm, there are many, many things I love about my job but honestly nothing has been more satisfying than working with the stellar team at Lucky to make the changes to the magazine. Lucky is a magazine that I so loved when it launched and bringing a new perspective of street style and personal style to the magazine has been really gratifying. Every letter I get from a new reader basically is a testament to the team we work with—the photographers, stylists, models, editors... Go, Team Lucky!
[Hi Eva. What do you think makes a fantastic fashion writing? And who are your favorite fashion writers/critics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3hmm?context=5)|I love it when people have original voices and opinions and they're not just, like, reporting on what happened in a straight-forward newsticker way. My favorite fashion writers include Robin Givhan, Cathy Horyn, Leandra Medine, and Imran from Business of Fashion. And, honestly, I love following people on Twitter as well to get a sense of their personality! I've discovered some great potential talent that way. 
[I'd love to hear in your words, what do you think distinguishes Lucky from other magazines in this vertical? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3nqf?context=5)|Well, the new Lucky has a focus on street style and personal style. When Lucky launched, the great Kim France created a magazine like nothing else in the US. It basically had a great, crazy-comprehensive sweeping view of products. Say there was a story about the best shoes of the season. There would be 100 pairs of shoes on a page and—wow—I remember looking at it and being like ""yes, please."" The difference these days is that e-commerce exists and when you want to see eye candy of 100 pairs of shoes, you go to Shopbop or Amazon.com/fashion and type in ""shoes"". So what we are trying to do differently is: A) curate and be specific about what we love.  B) have a voice. Be down to earth. Editors have had an ivory-tower sort of feeling to them for decades. Lucky editors are NOT this way. We're the ones that you can talk to at a cocktail party and ask ""Hey, where's that top from? C) we have a sense of humor (I guess that's sort of similar to B) D) place a premium on personal style. You'll see that in the people we choose for covers, you'll see that on our pages.
 |I could go on and on on this topic but 100+ questions to answer... :)
[Hi eva! Huge fan of your instagram and twitter feed :\) always look forward to your fashion week posts too! Just wanted to ask.. what was the first luxury item you bought yourself and do you still use it? Also whats your favorite spot for bubble tea in NYC? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3yxy?context=5)|Kung Fu Tea is my favorite! And the first luxury item I ever bought for myself was a Gucci (it was the 2000) bucket hat. I actually ended up losing that hat when I was studying abroad in England and one of the signs that my husband was a keeper is that he literally retraced my steps to find the hat for me (and found it). He will probably be embarrassed that I told that story, but there you go. 
[I want to know what you think it takes to be the EIC of a top fashion magazine? What are qualities you see in yourself or your peers that you believe to be paramount to your role as editor in chief? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3xfn?context=5)|I think it takes an ability to listen, manage efficiently, and a great team. The last part is the most important. You are only as strong as your team and if you have a team you trust, you are able to work 1000% better. And I think having an open mind and curiosity are important too! 
[What do you look for when hiring interns? What can I do to stand apart when I am going to apply for my first internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3tm3?context=5)|When hiring interns (although Conde Nast is on an intern hiatus at the moment as they re-evaluate the program), I look for someone who clearly knows/loves Lucky and seems on top of things, professional (it's okay to be a fangirl for the magazine but try to stay calm and collected) and can multi-task. A good attitude is key as well!
[Can you talk about what you’re looking for in an editorial candidate (experience skills, etc.\) and how to ace the hiring process at Lucky?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3goo?context=5)|Well, it depends what department you're applying to. Of course, different departments require different skills (ie: art/graphic design, fashion/a knowledge and love of designers, beauty/a sense of experimentation, etc). But overall, I look for someone with a great passion for communication, efficiency, ability to multi-task, and a sense of humor.
[Hi Eva! Obsessed with Lucky and your fabulous Insta account.  What are some of your favorite jewelry brands under $100? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3mnu?context=5)|Oooh, so many! I love CatbirdNYC.com, I just discovered a new line called One Six Five jewelry—I got a great super thin band from them—and I have a chain necklace from Charming Charlie that is major. It looks like a giant ID bracelet. I haven't figured out when I'm wear that yet but I'm biding my time...
[How has the fashion magazine industry changed since the rise of blogging? do you think the two will eventually work together, or will one make the other obsolete? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3w4s?context=5)|I think that the best magazines are ones that react to the times—and I hope to keep Lucky that way. We try to work with bloggers and shoot them often—so far we've shot bloggers like Leandra Medine, Emily Weiss, Tamu McPherson, Nicole Warne, Alexandra Spencer, Hanneli Mustaparta, Phil Oh, Susie Bubble... the list goes on. I see it as a symbiotic relationship, 100%
[Nice to see you on Reddit, Eva! Which fashion trend would you say is the most underrated of 2014 thus far? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3no4?context=5)|CULOTTES. MULES. HOBO BAGS. The frumpy ones. And, of course, they're the ones that we love the most at Lucky.
[What are your absolute all-time favorite clothing pieces? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3p86?context=5)|I have a Topshop moto jacket I bought almost a decade ago that I still wear all the time. It was black when I bought it and at this point it's basically a blackish-grey hue from being worn so much. I've worn it to black tie galas, I wear it on the weekends, I've worn it in pouring rain... Everywhere! I think I'll have it forever and I'm sure one day, if I ever have a daughter, she will steal if from me. I also love all the Marc Jacobs in my closet. He is one of my favorite designers of all time... I feel like he perfectly captures the energy and spirit of NYC.
[Do you think spending more necessarily means better quality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3n1o?context=5)|There are things in my closet from Zara and Topshop that I love as much as Proenza Schouler and Marc Jacobs. I think it's about looking for things that you think will last and you'll be able to wear for ages. 
[Hi Eva! Page Six reported that Lucky was rumored to be on the chopping block at Conde Nast. Link to pagesix.com What is the long term viability for fashion magazines and is paid content the solution to diminishing circulation numbers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3quj?context=5)|That rumor was a rather silly one, if you ask me, because it came out the same day that a truly storied magazine—Ladies Home Journal—basically did fold. The magazine industry is going through an evolution right now, there's no doubt about that. The reality is that the way people consume media and are entertained is really fragmented these days. Lucky's readers also are on Instagram, reddit, Twitter, Netflix, HBO Go, etc etc... What we as magazine editors have to do is create content you can't get anywhere else. The good thing, though, is that fashion magazines have always provided that—and I think the longterm viability of fashion magazines in particular is great because we are doing exactly that: you won't see a shoot with Candice Swaenpoel and Patrick Demarchelier and Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele just on Instagram. That exists in a magazine in 8 delicious pages and it's something to savor and return to over and over.
 |In terms of paid content, well, magazines have done that in the form of advertorials for decades. It's always been a thing magazines have done. For me, I always just want to make sure it's done in the right way. Luckily, our publishing department/business side does a great job of it. 
[Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz4ie6?context=5)|One horse-sized duck. I'd distract it with stale bread and then capture it then with a lasso made out of adamantium 
[Hey Eva -- beauty PR lady popping in here :\) What's the best way to pitch you and your staff at Lucky, and what are some general tips for how publicists should work with beauty editors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3ojs?context=5)|I would be specific about your pitch, don't blanket the staff with question or email everyone... Know what makes Lucky different from other magazines and what we're looking for. And don't call—email is the best way! The beauty editors are rarely at their desk because they're out at events or desksides or out and about... so email email email! 
[Hi Eva, I love that you make time for reading on the weekends! What are the top 3 books you've read in the last few years? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3su3?context=5)|I love the Miss Peregrine series, Art of Fielding was really good (was not expecting to like a book about BASEBALL), and I keep trying to read the JJ Abrams book but, oh boy, it's complicated and bits keep falling out. I use the hashtag #Saturdaybookclub on Instagram so you can follow along there! 
[How would you describe your own personal sense of style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3mmp?context=5)|Evolving and eclectic and constantly inspired by the great city of NYC and Lucky editors!!

[Hi Eva! I know you're a skincare fiend, so have you tried any new items recently that have blown you away? Also, I'm on the hunt for a new clay mask and I'd love a recommendation! Thanks so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3twf?context=5)|I started using a new line called Aurelia Skincare, it's English/organic/lovely and I am obsessed! I think it's only sold on Net-A-Porter. In terms of masks... so many. I just used Jurlique's Herbal Recovery last night. I don't know why I like it so much—maybe it's the little bubbles that burst on the skin that remind me of bubble tea? But it's very refreshing. Just like bubble tea. Darn, now I'm craving bubble tea.

Well, I think most people think of magazine editors and picture, well, The Devil Wears Prada, Ugly Better, 13 Going on 30. Sigh, if only life were that glamorous! There are really fun/cool moments in my life but a lot of my job is sitting in front of my desk with my Warby Parker glasses on editing text, running meetings, making things go smoothly! 
[Hi Eva, I love the work you've done with Lucky so far and I always enjoy seeing you on GMA! Since you have such a big presence in the media/fashion, do you think being Asian American influences or impacts the work you do, if any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3xog?context=5)|Being a first-generation American is ingrained in my soul and is a key part of who I am and a big part of what drives me. My parents—immigrants from Taiwan/China—sacrificed so much to give me what I have and I think a lot of my work ethic comes from them. I hope that more Asian youth feel empowered to pursue their dreams—no matter what they are. I work with a group called APEX in NYC to help further that message. 
[My name is Richard Karcher and I am currently a recent graduate that is pursuing a career in the Fashion Industry.

Thank you so much for your insight! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz3w7b?context=5)|Research, research, research. Don't apply to jobs blindly, think about the places that you would truly be a good fit. Ask for informational interviews. Remember that for every 10 people you email, MAYBE one or two will write back. (Try to) Develop a thick skin. Be patient. And reach out to your school/alumni office to try to find people who might be able to give you an ""in"" into the industry. And if that doesn't work... make your own way. 
[Good afternoon, Eva! I'm curious, how tall are you? I'm guessing pretty tall since you never look short around models, not even when you're around Karlie Kloss.

[Hi Eva! Thank you for doing this AMA!  1- Before having a good interview, how does one GET the interview? I've found this is one of the hardest parts. I don't have the resources or time to intern for free but am dying for the chance to prove myself in an entry/mid level position.  2- What is the most important part of an outfit?  3- When you go to fashion events, who is one person you always look forward to seeing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz49xs?context=5)|1) One gets the interview by being persistent and really reaching out to every single person in your network. Your mom's sister's best friend's cousin's dogwalker's hairdressers exboyfriend's sister. That person could work in the industry and give you your big break. You never know. And fortune really favors the bold, so reach out to people out of the blue too. Make your own connections. 1.5) You will likely need to start form the entry level, it is very hard to get a midlevel job without having done the entry level one. 2) The most important part of an outfit is your attitude ;) 3) I always look forward to seeing my husband when I go home. But outside of that, I love seeing Leandra Medine, Karlie Kloss, Liu Wen, Tamu McPherson, and Wendy Nguyen.
[Good Afternoon Eva! I'm a student in D.C. and I was wondering do you ever think about moving to another city other than New York such as London, Tokyo or Los Angeles? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27b5z5/i_am_eva_chen_editor_in_chief_of_lucky_magazine/chz473w?context=5)|I lived in Los Angeles for a hot minute last year when my husband was working on a big project. We lived in Venice and it was glorious. As a student, I think NOW is the time for you to take a leap and to try something new. Once you settle into a career/city in your late 20s, it's harder to break out of your comfort zone. Go forth and explore now, it will never be something you regret. 
[Hi Eva, its great that you are so accessible...best way to link your magazine to your audience.

First, my boyfriend and I are working on moving in together and are each trying to make a budget and clear up any loose financial ends before we do so. He had worked for a couple of months at a commission-based job where no income taxes were taken out. He didn't work there long or make terribly much, but neither of us are sure what to do about the taxes. A co-worker of his told him that if he ""cashed-out"" each day (took his commission for the day in cash when leaving the office) he didn't have to pay taxes on it because you could write off up to some amount in cash as a gift. However, when he worked that job, I encouraged him to make them write him checks so that he had the stubs for record and so that if we needed proof of income for renting, he had it. He only ended up getting 3 checks from them, one for about $140, one for about $8, and one for about $4 and cashed out a few times, as well. I imagine we could look back on bank statements to get approximate total income from those couple of months if we need to since he's usually pretty good about depositing any money that comes in. What exactly do we need to do to get his taxes in order? Do we just wait for the end of the year? He was technically considered a independent contractor, so I don't know if they'll send a W-4 or anything similar regarding income... Any advice would be much appreciated!

Second, as I mentioned, we are moving out of our respective parents' houses and into a house together that we will be renting, along with two friends of ours, for $750/month. I'd really like to get a solid budget in place for my finances. I've done a variety of spreadsheet and handwritten budgets in the past and I can never seem to stick to them or make them work. To amend this, I've started looking into the methods behind YNAB and am 3 days into their 9-day email course. I'm still not sure about spending the $60 on the software and wanted to get your opinions on it, if you've used it, if you still use it, if you think it's worth the money, if you think it really helps, etc. 

Finally, I've never lived on my own and imagine I'm going to overlook a lot of expenses associated with being independent. I've got the obvious down, groceries, utilities, etc. but am wondering if there are any expenses that you could clue me in to that I may not be expecting so that I can work them into my budget as well.


Some basic financial info on me, if that helps with my budgeting questions:

Income: This one is tricky. I currently make about $1200/month net (working 40-hour weeks at $10/hour), but have just accepted an internship which will be 40-hour weeks during the summer and 20-hour weeks during the fall and spring semesters, at $12.71/hr. This transition right when we're about to move is making me pretty nervous about paying for everything.

Savings: Just over $2,000

Checking: ~$50

Expenses:

Rent: $750/4 = ~$188

Phone: $45

Internet: $70/4 = ~$18

Other Utilities: Really not sure what these sorts of things typically run. I imagine that splitting it four ways should make it fairly minimal, I've been guestimating ~$150/month combined.

Gas: Currently ~$80 in the summer months, ~$150 during school. Not sure what it will be, my internship is a farther drive than my current job and I'll have to be driving during traffic, not sure what impact this will have on my gas bill each month.

Groceries: The four of us will be splitting groceries for the most part, with the exception of snacks and stuff we buy just for ourselves. I'm estimating &lt;$70/week, but am not sure how accurate this is going to be yet.

Car: I owe just over $5,000 and pay $100/month with no interest. I pay $55/month for insurance.

Credit cards: I have 1 Chase Freedom MasterCard that I put school expenses on. Right now the balance is just over $5,500 and I pay $150/month. Minimum is $107, I think. 13% interest.

Student Loans: I owe about $8,000 total to SallieMae, but only about $1,200 of it is unsubsidized, so I pay on those two loans about $50 a month, just to keep the interest down and chip away at the principle some. Interest is 6.8% on them. 3.4% on the subsidized ones, but it's deferred until 6 months after I'm out of school.

I also have a Parent Plus loan through FedLoans with just a couple hundred dollars left; I plan to pay it off with my next paycheck.

I think that's everything... Please let me know if there's something obvious that I've overlooked, or if you have any recommendations for me. Any advice is much appreciated!

27bp44,10,2014-06-04,Question from a senior about in a unique position and what to do after graduation. Please help.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27bp44/question_from_a_senior_about_in_a_unique_position/,"I'm a current senior who switched from Computer Science the summer after my sophomore year from a BS Biochem. The one thing that concerns me is getting a job after graduation (which is in Spring 2015). In order for me to graduate on time, I've had to take summer classes every summer (including this one) which hasn't allowed me to get an internship during any of my summers since switching and I'm terrified that it's put me in a bad position. I'm trying to get started on making an android/ios app but I'm having a hard time balancing a 9 credits of summer classes with doing a personal project simultaneously. 

I'm wondering what the best course of action would be after I graduate.  Most of my experience is in healthcare and I also did bench research as a biochemistry major. On my resume I've included semester long projects i did for classes but I'm still worried. I was thinking of getting an internship after I graduate rather than a full time job so that I could get the experience I need but, I was afraid that I might be selling myself short if I did so.

My main language is Java but I know some C and MIPS assembly and after I have graduated I will have taken classes in Database systems, software engineering, internet programming, computational theory, algorithms and many other classes. If it helps my GPA is around a 3.3 right now and I attend Stony Brook U (but I still have 2 semesters left).

27btmq,3,2014-06-04,Stolen drives and a BSoD ghost,[deleted],computerforensics,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/27btmq/stolen_drives_and_a_bsod_ghost/,"I'm gonna try and keep this brief - though that usually means I'm going to write a novel anyways, so bear with me. I work as an IT intern, and when I'm not actually doing interesting work, they make me do support. Fortunately my user group isn't full of ID-10T folks. This morning I got a phone call from a user whose machine won't boot. Sure enough, it shows the blue screen of death then turns off. I do the normal set of operations - Windows startup repair, disk recovery, etc. - but none of these seem to have fixed the issue. The Windows startup repair - booted from the computer itself, mind you - claimed it tried chkdsk which didn't help. My boot-disc recovery utilities ""can't view the drive because it is full"". Built-in diagnostics even said the hard drive had no problems.

Now this is where it gets weird. So I go to remove the hard drive to do some more thorough recovery ... but it wasn't there. Someone had stolen the RAM (and missed the secondary modules) as well as the hard drive, and the hard drive was replaced with a metal retainer, complete with the correct screw holes. Now stuff getting stolen from our office sucks, but thats not the part that gets me. It's the fact I was still able to boot with MBR, see the BSoD, use Window's own startup repair with command prompt, and see the hard drive was still there - with correct maximum capacity and everything. Clearly something is still in this system, and it knows things. But I have no idea what, why, or how it exists.

From a security standpoint, this is very intriguing, as well as concerning. Disks hidden in my system, posing as other disks? Sounds like a beautiful way to design a rootkit, but good luck fitting all the Windows repair utilities and drivers in there.

I've no concrete answer yet, but lots of speculation. My best answer thus far is that the OEM included some sort of small recovery disk that includes the MBR and boot-critical files, but I've only ever seen this presented in a logical manner; ie. the recovery disk is a visible partition, and its purpose is clear. In addition, this doesn't show up in any documentation for the system. Another suggestion was some sort of UEFI-related thing, since I know all that fancy Windows SecureBoot stuff is supported on this laptop... but we use custom Windows 7 deployments, not the default OEM install.

So what do you guys think? Where is all this information coming from? Since it is relevant, the laptop in question was a Dell Precision M4800."
27byuf,3,2014-06-04,Would you kindly help turn an office PC into a High level gaming PC? $400-$500 for upgrades,notyourdadsusername,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/27byuf/would_you_kindly_help_turn_an_office_pc_into_a/,"Hey all! I've posted here before about building from scratch, but an opportunity has come up to possiby save some money. I'm an IT intern at an office and my boss asked me to wipe some Dell Precision T1500s and make them ready for surplus sale. Well after I finish preparing them, he said I could snag one for a cool $100 (not part of budget).

My question is this: would it be easy/economical/just as good as a scratch build to buy a complete unit and upgrade the parts inside?

If a T1500 can be upgraded to a High level performing PC, a build would be much appreciated!


* What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. 

* I plan to use it as my primary PC (Office, email, university work, etc.) but it takes a backseat to my primary focus being on gaming. I'd like to be able to run WoW, LoL, Wildstar, and also non-MMOs as well at high level graphics with no slow down or loss of performance.

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

* $500

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

* The beginning of July (+/- a week, time not really crucial)

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

* Obviously the 1500 is a working computer. I won't need tower, OS, or general computer devices. I need the best fitting video card, PSU, and other guts of the PC to upgrade.

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

* North Carolina, USA and Yes

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

* I will be resuing a Dell keyboard, Logitech mouse, and a monitor I have been using. 

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

* Nope! 

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

* Nothing specific, whatever works best!

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

* No preferences.

* Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?  

* No, I have the OS.

* Extra info if required:

Very new at this, so any critical comments are fine. I really have no idea if what I want is an easy possible! But thanks to anyone who read and helps out!"

I'm at an internship at a big tech company (as a returning intern... I'm supposed to know what I'm doing!), and I'm going super slowly on the first day and my manager already hates me.

I just got feedback back for the class I'm TA'ing, and I did so, so, so miserably. My students thought I was so unhelpful. I got very low ratings.

My grades this past semester were god awful. I'm going to be a junior next year so I feel like my time is just running out really quickly.

I have no friends at this internship yet because I'm always too sad to hang out with people... I'm always trying to fix things with my boyfriend.

I just can't. :-( This is so sad. I feel like I'm a disappointment to everyone I know.

27cens,14,2014-06-04,Ethan's 5/22 birth story and PP advice: wall of text,llmgold11,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/27cens/ethans_522_birth_story_and_pp_advice_wall_of_text/,"At our 38 week appointment the doctor was all the eager beaver to get Ethan out which worked just fine for my liking. 1 problem..the hospital we wanted to deliver at wouldn't induce unless you were past your due date and the 2nd choice wouldn't induce until 39 weeks BUT you had to have a valid medical excuse.  Thankfully ""large gestational age"" was a valid medical excuse and they booked us in for 9am on 5/21.  

Leading up to that night I was a huge ball of nerves.  My daughter and I kept a countdown to kind of remind ourselves (as if I needed reminding).  The morning of the induction I woke up at 330a and ate.  I couldn't sleep comfortably and I was a ball of nerves plus getting up at 330a for a 730a NST is logical right?  Oh yeah, I still had my weekly NST at 730.  After my NST I rushed home to recheck my bags and make sure that my daughter made it onto the bus okay then we were headed to the hospital for eviction!

The morning nurse was nice but she had a trainee with her (something we were trying to avoid).  I wasn't going to argue because I wanted him out.  The trainee was slow at entering my vitals and awful at doing my IV.  It was excruciating when she stuck me and uncomfortable for the entire labor.  On top of the trainee, I got stuck with all residents or interns.  Again, something we wanted to avoid by choosing our original hospital.  They all treated me like I had the plague because instead of going with a traditional OB office we went with a low cost clinic.  I started with the clinic because I couldn't find an OB office that would touch me until my insurance came through.  By the time my insurance came through it was the beginning of December and a month and a half after finding out I was pregnant.  Plus I liked the clinic OB since they got me in and out in 15 minutes. No waiting over an hour for my ""appointment"" time so I stayed there instead of changing, but I digress.  Needless to say I never actually saw an attending OB while at the hospital.  I only saw this squirrely resident or his bitchy counterpart.

Around 2pm the nurse came in and asked me if I was feeling contractions. I told her no because I wasn't, but apparently I was having them.  Around 4pm the bitchy counterpart came in to break my water (which felt disgusting because it soaked the pad my ass was on) and while doing so she got this really weird look on her face.  Here she is elbow deep in my vag and she's got this awful look on her face and then she says ""oh that's never happened before.""  The day nurse is looking at her all weird and then the resident says ""your son just grabbed my finger"" and she leaves the room. Apparently while breaking my water Ethan decided he either needed the extra support or he was trying to pimp on her from the inside.  As cute as that was it then brought up another issue...if he didn't move his hand in an hour they were going in after him.  Thankfully he moved his hand.

Once my water was broken, the contractions hit me like a freight train running down a petroleum truck on the tracks.  Full force, no stopping.  My pitocin was cranked up and we were really doing this.  I asked for my epidural pretty quickly.  Once the epidural was placed I was in heaven and managed to doze in between the night nurse having me change positions and take my vitals.  Around 10p my epidural started to wear off.  The magic man came in and pushed some super power meds into my cath and I was in heaven.  Too bad that it didn't last.

Yes. My epidural wore off.  I started to feel a crap ton of pressure and pain.  The nurse checked and I was 9.5 with a lip.  Talk about torture. The next hour was the worst hour of my life.  My pitocin was at 18.  The contractions were one right on top of the other. I was getting no relief and she kept sticking her fingers in my vag to try and get rid of the lip.  All I wanted was my son out and I didn't care how he came out.  I think at one point I begged my SO to cut him out of me.  It was awful.  The night resident showed up.  I think she was a resident I couldn't understand her accent and she was wearing a mask.  They prepped the room pretty quickly since he was crowning.  She gave me the ok for 1 small push and his head came out. I thought that that was my queue to stop so she could suction him or whatever, but nope she said I could keep going.  1 more good push and at 1:18am on 5/22 Ethan Rhys made his appearance.  He was 9lbs 3.8oz of pure perfection and totally worth peeing myself, having sciatica pain every day, heartburn constantly and all the pain I felt that last hour.

PP advice:

1. Take the pain meds if you feel you need them.  Screw what you think you're supposed to do.  Seriously. I was so glad I had them this time around.  The 2nd degree tear was NO joke.

2. If you have a pushy MIL like I do or a pushy friend, don't let them guilt you into invading your space.  Being a new mommy is HARD, even if you're a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 10th time mommy.

3. Make your SO or friends/family take care of you.  Don't try to be super woman.  You're going to be tired and you'll need the help.

4.  Don't be afraid to ask the nurse to take the babe to the nursery for a few hours while you sleep.  During one long night at the hospital with Ethan I hadn't slept more than a few hours and I was so tired I almost passed out with him in bed with me (which is a major no no at this hospital).  The nurse came in to check my vitals and snag him for the ped.  She said she would bring him back in an hour.  I asked her to keep him there for 2 hours so I could sleep.  They brought him back 3 hours later as I was finishing up breakfast.  It was heaven and I felt more like myself.

5.  Shower when you feel like you can.  Seriously.  Between the sweat and the gross filth going on down below it will make you feel like a million bucks.

6.  Speaking of gross filth down below.  It's ugly.  If your hospital supplies you with diaper pads and 1 size fits all undies, take that shit home with you!  My hospital gave me witch hazel, these really awesome ice pack pads, 1 size fits all undies for days and enough pads to line a padded cell. 

7.  Once you're home don't try to pump right away.  I made this mistake when I was engorged and it went horribly wrong.  I wasn't able to pump with my first so I had no idea what I was doing.  I got maybe an ounce out of both boobs.  I was defeated and started to question how I was going to feed my son.

8.  As your ped all the questions.  If you think LO has jaundice, ask about it. If the cord looks funny, ask about it.  If you aren't sure what came out of your LO's tail end because it is orange, ask about it. 

Ok that's enough. Now time for PICTURES!!!  [Ethan Rhys](http://imgur.com/a/ttboO#0)"

I've tried to look at various online charts but I'm never sure how accurate those actually are. My degree is in EE so I have experience with hardware but most of my work experience is on the software side of things. I enjoy working with DSPs and various controllers. I like both fields, but I feel one-sided because of my work experience. Still, I think I would be qualified for an entry level job on either side. I also prefer working for smaller companies as you get to do a little more (in my experience) if that makes a difference for job outlook. If you have experience on both sides and think one side has more advantages over another, let me know that too!

I'm going into my final year of college and I'm having an internal debate on whether or not I want to work in software or hardware when I graduate.

How to stay positive about the present?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27crup/my_boyfriend_19m_and_i_21f_seem_to_have_a/,"I am going to be a senior in college and my boyfriend will be a sophomore. I plan on going to grad school out of state after I graduate next spring and my boyfriend of 6 months will still have two more years of undergrad. We have talked about this and both agreed that even though it's scary it's worth it for the time we have together. I love him very much and I know that I am going to gain so much from this experience, whether we continue after I move or not.

However, it's been a few weeks since I left for my summer internship and I'm feeling very discouraged about the possibility of a real LDR. My boyfriend and I get along wonderfully in person and see eachother everyday normally but he says himself that he does not communicate well over text and skype. Much of his lovey-ness is through personal and physical interaction and even though we at least text every day it just doesn't feel the same for me. Long story short, it's been a rough few starting weeks since he's never done a LDR and didn't realize how much regular communication means to me and how necessary it is. We've talked it over a few days ago but I'm still feeling pretty uneasy. 

I'm already starting to feel a disconnect after just a couple weeks and, though we'll be reunited in two months, the thought of being apart for a minimum of 2 years just makes me start to have a panic attack. I always told myself that since we will likely inevitably break up I just have to focus on the present experience with him but the end date has never felt so real until now. It feels like we don't even have a chance. I really really love him and it just breaks my heart to think that we couldn't handle the distance. I don't know how to keep myself positive and I worry it will just sabotage the year we have left.

**TL:DR-** Just started a LDR and it's been tougher than expected. If a summer is hard I don't know how we will handle at least two years apart when I move next May. How do I stay positive even though I feel like it's doomed?"

The building I work inside is very old and small, the stairs are metal and the place doesn't look very clean. Half of the programmers are 40+, and the people I work with don't even have CS degrees. Instead they have ""degrees"" in game development from Digipen. I looked through the code base for the project I'm working on and it seems like half of the code is a mess with hardly any comments. 

I don't really receive any mentorship since it's a small company. No one has really trained me to do anything yet, they just expect me to write code on my own and that's it. I just feel like I chose the wrong place to intern at and it is bothering me.

Me and my girlfriend have been in an on/off(mostly on) long distance relationship for 3 years. We started dating in high school, and decided to break when we went to college to figure out who we were, but we always came back together because we are an incredible support system for each other.

She landed an internship in the City, she's been there for two weeks now working and adjusting. She interned in the same City last summer, but because she is a year ahead of me, I decided to stay in my Hometown last year, when she went up, because it would be the last summer I could have with my parents (she had her's the summer before).

I'm moving up to the same City in the next few days. We decided that we wouldn't live together, because it would be a too big of a step after only spending time together during University breaks.

She already has connections up there, I don't. And she is attempting to try and shape my experience while i'm up there into what her's was like. She doesn't want me to rely on anyone, and to figure everything out on my own, which I appreciate, but she isn't compromising at all...

She won't house me for any day when I arrive even though my apartment rental fell through yesterday on the apartment owner's side. She tried to help by offering a couch of a friend's house, but within this house (where she isn't staying) includes the one guy in Seattle that she dated last Summer for a short time. It might be petty, but I'm not going to rely on that guy for anything... 

The thing is, she has connections, she has lots of friends. But she only offers this guy's place...

She said she doesn't even want to see me the night I arrive.

Granted, we are going through a rough patch. She was recently accepted into my school (it's an upgrade from her school, so she's taking it and we're really excited to finally be able to go to school together). But the day she found out about this life-changing moment, I was on a sudden fishing trip with my dad with no cell service or wifi. No matter how much I apologize (even though I had no control) she hasn't talked to me the same since.

It seems like she's treating me like a child, and leaving me to dry when she could easily stick out a hand to the one person she's connected to most in the world.

I'm really confused, and worried about us. And it's heartbreaking to see her act this way towards me...

The situation is really complex, so I can clarify anything or add more if necessary.

Any advice would help.



---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend doesn't want to see me or help me out when I'm arriving to live in the same city as her, after not living in the same city for 2 years. I don't really know how to TLDR this situation...


___EDIT___

Thank you to everyone for providing advice. Redditors seem to be just as objective and more helpful than any counselor...

I arrived and she decided that she wanted to see me. I treated the encounter kind of like meeting with an old friend, trying to catch up and seem interested in what's been going on, but without overtly seeming like I needed to see her at that moment, because she obviously didn't feel like she needed to see me.

I made the mistake of putting my arm around her when we were walking as I was getting into the moment of being next to her again, she felt uncomfortable and that serious conversation which should have waited, occurred.

She broke up with me. Not just another off term of our relationship, but a full end. It breaks my heart, but now I truly am independent in a new city, which is what is probably best.

I was hoping that our relationship would ground me and ease my adjustment to the city, but now it's just made it more difficult. A big learning experience now."

27d5vq,22,2014-06-05,On game addiction and why it is bad for you.,KoenQQ,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/27d5vq/on_game_addiction_and_why_it_is_bad_for_you/,"
Hello, my name is KoenQQ, 

[I don’t know if this is the right sub to post it in, sorry if it isn’t.
Beware: wall of text incoming!] 

And I want to write you about game addiction, and why it is bad for you (hence the title).  I’ve been a World of Warcraft addict for about five years, from 2005 till 2010. The first year I played it like any other game, every now and then. But in the following years it kept becoming more and more and in the end I was playing that game for eight to ten hours a day. 3,5 years ago I had a realisation about game addiction that made me quit. Since I’ve quit my grades went up (from a 6 average to an 8 average), I lost 20kgs, got an awesome girlfriend, made a lot more friends, bought a motorcycle and last week I got offered an internship at NATO headquarters. The thing that convinced me to write this up is that three months ago my best friend in the world, who was still addicted to WoW, got sent to a rehab clinic by his parents. I want to tell you about the realisation I had, so that maybe it can help someone else who is struggling with this addiction. So, what was this realisation that I had? 

As all addictions, my addiction started innocent, just a new game which was cooler than any I played before. Over the years it became worse and worse though. The problem with WoW is that the longer you play it, the better you become. It starts of with the thought: ‘well, if I finish just one more quest, my character will be just a bit better.’ If in the beginning I played one hour a day, after four years it became eight hours a day. 

The beginning of the end came when I got a new roommate, who was also fat and also played a lot of WoW. After a night of playing WoW and eating too much kebab we decided that it was enough. We had to get in shape, and get more girls!! (we are such simple creatures haha). Together we started to work out again, and things went uphill form there. I still played wow though.

The thing that made me quit is when I saw my high school friends again (they all went to study in a different city, didn’t see them for years). When I met them again they were making it! A group started their own record label, were organising big techno parties, etc. And what was I doing? I was playing a damn game. 

You see, the problem with this game (and all game addiction) is that all the energy we have to improve ourselves and our place in the world (which is a lot of energy) gets put into improving your character in that stupid game. All my attention, thought, ambition, motivation and willpower went into getting that one sword or shield. That is why at 20, I was the exactly same person that I was two years before, when I saw those guys last (but my characters became much stronger). That is why at 25, my best friend is still the same person he was when he was 18. Those other guys didn’t play WoW, so they put their energy in doing things they liked and improved themselves. But with WoW, I had to start all over again with every patch or expansion. It’s an endless cycle of improvement and devaluation of that improvement which, in the end, amounts to nothing. 

For me this realisation was very powerful. Maybe some of you find it bullshit, and that’s ok. But maybe, hopefully, it will help someone get out of his or her addiction. 


Cheers

27dcrz,13,2014-06-05,"Clueless girl here. Why would a guy keep making plans with me, but then cancel at the last minute? Tried to describe the situation.",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/27dcrz/clueless_girl_here_why_would_a_guy_keep_making/,"Okay. So there's this guy I like. We both are 30 and went to high school together but never talked.  He is single and I am divorced.  About 3 months ago I received a facebook message from him asking how I was, what I had been up to since high school since we hadn't talked ever. He also admitted that he secretly liked me then, but me being awkward and shy then, I always blew him off.  We chatted about normal stuff for a few days and found out we had a lot in common. After a few days of chatting we finally to meet for a coffee. Because we both had to work it was only for 10 minutes but we had good conversation.

After that, we chatted through facebook and text and on the phone a couple of times. Our talks turned more serious then to eventually some playful sexting and exchanging pictures. He kept asking to get together.   So, We'd both teased back and fourth until finally we set up a breakfast date. We went to breakfast and we had good conversation, plus teased back and fourth about some things we had talked about in our texts. It was obvious we had chemistry.  After breakfast he invited me back to his place. I'm actually a really sexual person, but I don't give it up to anyone. I'm not in to casual sex, and don't want to feel used. Sex is emotional for me. I actually even told him that, and he was okay with it. He actually said he was the same way but gets attached to people he has sex with. He said, he liked me enough that he wanted to get attached to me though.  That kind of scared me a bit, but we were both honest.  As much as I wanted to, I didn't give in. He texted me about a half hour after saying he had fun, would love to hang out again, etc. For about a week we texted back and fourth all throughout the say. Finally we were able to get together for a coffee.  

 After coffee we were sitting in his car and talking turned into a major make out session.  This was the first time we kissed since we started talking a before. We ended up driving to a secluded area where we talked for a bit more, then things turned steamy.  He admitted he liked me more than he thought and never imagined his facebook hello would have turned into us chatting constantly, etc.  He said cared about me and he said because I didn't give him what he wanted and that made me different than other girls and it made him like me even more.  We didn't have sex but we were pretty darn close. I gave him a BJ and he pleasured me too. After that, he kissed me goodbye we talked for a bit more, made plans to hangout within the next few days.  When he was walking me to my car, he said he said, he'd send me a text in the morning. Which he did, saying he had a great time. He couldn’t stop thinking about me  and that I gave an amazing Bj lol and wanted to make sure he didn't pressure me, and hoped I enjoyed it.  I said I had fun and enjoyed doing it. We get along really well and seem to understand one another.

Well, almost a week went by before I heard from him again. He sent me a messages apologizing that we hadn't talked, that he had been busy.  He said he missed me and couldn't wait to see my face again. Not wanting to come off as desperate I waited a day to respond.  We chatted back and fourth through texting and facebook and made plans to grab breakfast. I had something to do the morning of, so he told me to call him when I was done. I did. He didn't answer so I sent a text saying 'we still on for coffee?' He said sure. Then a few minutes later he sent me back a message saying he was getting a haircut and we'd have to postpone our date until another time. Not a big deal. Later on in the afternoon he called me on the phone and we joked around and chatted for a bit. Then Later that night around 11 I received a text asking if I wanted to go grab coffee. I said sure but since I had to work the following morning I couldn't stay out too late. He said that was fine he just wanted to see me for a few minutes, he missed me and just wanted to see me and give me a goodnight kiss.  He said he was at someones house and was leaving soon, but would text me in 10 minutes when he left. Well I waited 45 minutes and I never got a text. I've never been good at this dating thing an game playing. I'm not even expecting a relationship with this guy but he is definitely someone I could fall for. Looks wise he's the type I go for and talking with him is easy and comfortable. It just flows. And we have chemistry too.

Considering our interactions and all the cancelled plans I am keeping my emotions out of it but it's hard. He makes it seem as though he likes me too, but always ends up canceling. The only reason I say that is because in almost every message/text/phone call, he tells me I'm pretty, sexy, different than other girls and he loves that. Since a lot of our conversations have been sexual, I've made comments that If he's just in it for sex to be upfront. I don't care if it is because I'd prepare myself for that. But he said it's not, if it was he said he would have stopped talking to me the first time I turned him down.   He said it's comforting to be around me, and he loves that I'm innocent on the outside but have naughty side. He said he loves that I'm caring and am genuine. He called me a rare gem, a catch.  He talked to me about a few personal things, that I gave him advice on.  He said I make him feel different than anyone he's ever been with, in a good way. It's not even just the compliments, but he sends me a good morning text, a good night text, always wishes me a good day at work. I had a few interviews recently, that I didn't think he'd remember but the morning of each of them, he send me a text, wishing me good luck and not to be nervous, etc.  I'm not an expert, but guys don't send texts like that to just anyone, right? 

I know he's had a string of bad relationships, and from what he's told me, he always tended to jump from one relationship to the next.  Maybe he's trying not to do that? He even said he doesn't want to be like that anymore, that he'd love to get married one day and find a relationship like his parents have.   I know before we started chatting he recently got out of a year long rocky relationship. I also know he has anxiety too and is on meds for that. I have anxiety too but it's not severe enough to be treated. So that is something else we have in common and have talked about.  From our interactions I get the vibe that he is a bit insecure and I've tried to make him comfortable and he's slowly opening up an revealing more personal things.  I know he's busy because he is going to law school at the moment, interns 2 days a week a firm and helps a friend with construction one day on the weekend. I just don't understand why always make plans with me then cancel at the last minute? I'm clueless.  Any insight? 

*Edit: this is jsut some of our interactions. He's cancelled a few times whenever we made plans*

I am currently merely a lesser Scottish notebook noble, no where near the glorious standing of your fancy shiny sli / cross fire rigs. A fairly good laptop in my eyes 660m, 2.6ghz dual i.5, 8gb RAM and a 320gb 7200rmp hard drive. (Custom build from pcspecialist.co.uk) But frankly i'm getting fed up of living at 30fps.

Although i will be getting the individual parts for my rig of the course of the next few months, just wanted some input if you would be so kind on what ideas i have so far. Planning on spending a fair bit as well. So far these are the components that i'm eyeing up - i'm also aware i'll be able to (and planning) on, find better prices for most of these elsewhere - this more a breakdown of the components than the pricing.

Also planning on adding a 250GB (vague ballpark) SSD for file launching.

Still undecided on the RAM - unsure as to 8gb or 16gb. For a general low down of what i'll be using it for beyond redditing and laughing at console peasants, it will be a cross of gaming - generally source and ESO, however i also play bits and pieces of BF4 (played the rest on PS3 *sorry*) DayZ standalone and CIV 5. Modding the shit of bethesda titles is also a life long dream. However will be getting more AAA graphics intensive games in the future. I also spend time doing light coding in VS - C# mainly as part of my apprenticeship (Kind of UK equivalent of an internship) web development and design work, so CSS, JS and JQuery alongside some fairly heavy photoshop use. Also enjoy using photoshop for image editing both purely graphic based and from my own photography. I also do bits and pieces of 3D modeling in 3DS Max and some video editing also. Planning on making this a dual monitor (1920x1080 most likely) build. Unsure on the MOBO as well, PSU will be dependent on the final build and the power usage. This rig will be developed on in the future as well, currently this is just the base point. Will be looking at possible RAM increases alongside CPU upgrades and GPU addition for SLI. And of course the extra cooling required to keep that set up running nicely. One thing i do want to do is to keep all cooling fan based and to not have to have liquid cooling - nothing particularly against it, just like the idea of managing a good airflow to keep it all regulated than having piping running through my rig. Dedicated CPU fan is going to be part of the base build as well so far.

Any input would be appreciated gents, i quite enjoy bouncing ideas of one another. Although i have a half decent grounding in Hardware fundamentals the majority of you will be far more knowledgeable than myself! 

Impressed if you managed to survive my cirngeworthy grammar and punctuation this far!

I landed an Internship a few months back (which is confusing because I'm full time now with benefits, but still labeled an intern) with a small CRO in their one man IT Dept and that one man being my direct supervisor who runs EVERYTHING. I would like to say I'm an Assistant/Junior Sys Admin (if that's even applicable). My title is IT Intern, but my duties consist of the following and I'm probably missing some things - 

* GPO creation
* Remote deployment to users machines
* Managing the AV (Trend Micro WFBS)
* Checking and performing backups on our Unitrends Unit
* Monitoring network activity
* Resolving Tickets for end users (pc support)
* Active Directory User Management
* Setup and provision all laptops/desktops to Users

With the Active Directory management I create and deactivate all users as well as add them to all of our services such as VPN, VoIP, external sites, etc. I'm from a Desktop/Laptop support and repair background and this is all new to be, but since I've secured a full time position I can only assume I'm doing a good job. Before the whole Desktop/Laptop support I was working in a Datacenter for my first job just dealing with server deployment and hands on support for the software guys, not anything too in depth.

I'm 26, I have no certs, barely any schooling (attended my 1st year last semester) and just wondering what path schooling and Cert wise I should go forward with. Eventually he wants to show me the VMWare side of things and how they work as of now I have a basic understanding. So far I like the position, what I do and the company is a night and day difference from retail pc repair...

Any feedback is appreciated! 

Thanks!"

I've been following this sub for awhile now with the hope of putting myself in the position of being able to move abroad at some point in my life.  I have moved a lot within my life, so I'm not afraid of that.  (Ohio/Georgia/Montana/Texas/Colorado/Texas)  

I'm 25, not married and a senior software developer at my company.  I started out with this particular company when I was 20 as an intern and now have a full software team who has revitalized our software.  Furthermore within my role I have been able to travel across the US and to our headquarters in England.

That opportunity may be coming much sooner than I ever anticipated.  Our company has other locations that I mentioned in the title, but no actual software development resources in Europe.  They are potentially looking to send someone overseas to be the starting point of building a software team in Europe.

My boss has approached me, knowing my affinity for travel, to see if I would be interested in the position.  I told him that I was absolutely 100% interested provided that the position would move me forward professionally and financially.  They are meeting within the week to decide if that is indeed an avenue that they want to pursue and if it is, then I will be the first pick.  He also asked what my location preference would be if I decided to do this.  I said Nuremberg-&gt;Dresden-&gt;Stockholm-&gt;Canterbury.

The reason I'm here is that I obviously have a lot of questions, and I need to speak to someone about it all.  I don't want to tell my family/friends until something actually becomes solid.  

So time for the questions.

1. Has anyone else done this?  What were their regrets/things they wished they knew before doing it?
2. What are some advantages/disadvantages about the various locations?
3. How hard was it meeting new people/friends in the new locations
4. I don't know Swedish or German, but I definitely plan on learning... how much of a hindrance will that be outside of work until I get semi fluent?
5. What are some concessions I should negotiate with my employer?  Extra vacation/flights back to US to see family/etc.
6. What are the tax implications?
7. How should this affect my salary?  I'm currently in the mid 50's with a raise to 65k coming within the month.  
8. I have a German Shepherd, will I have to find a new home for her?
9. What is the transportation situation like?  I am a country boy and have a truck, obviously I would sell it.  Would I need to buy something there?
10.  What are the questions I should be asking?

Any advice/anecdotes are more than welcome.  I understand that very few people might have the answers for all of the above however I am hoping to be able to piece the puzzle together with Reddits help.  :)"

I'm mainly looking for a position where I can round out my systems administration experience.  I'd like to manage DNS, DHCP, and server hardware.  I have a CCNA as well, and would like to get some hands on experience with switches and routers.  I also have a basic understanding of Linux.

I have no problem working overtime and weekends; as a matter of fact I am moving to Burlington to snowboard so working Saturdays and having a week day off would be preferable.

Resume and references available upon request.

I've heard that there is a program from Harvard or somewhere that will do the first 500 pages of a website, but 1) our website is much, much bigger than that 2) I don't know if I could manipulate it so that it would choose the section that I would like it to (I've been assigned a very specific and big part of the website, the News section) and 3) I can't seem to find it via Google.

I am a 18 year old who recently graduated highschool and I want to get a degree in accounting. The job stability is attractive to me, and several members of my family were successful accountants. I was kind of lazy in highscool and ended with a 3.5 GPA. Fortunately, my dad is still willing to pay for my college education.



As of now, I am going to SJU in Philly. And from what I have gathered, they are a school that is recruited by the big four. The school is somewhat prestigious, but very expensive too. I am now having remorse about picking this school because I'd hate to have my dad spend all this money and then have to pay for graduate school too. I was thinking I could transfer to a cheap state school then attend graduate for a MAcc.


SJU offers a program where you can get all 150 hours for CPA in 4 years, and they also have a post-baccalaureate which is 12-course, 36-credit option. I have found positives for staying at SJU though. It would be easy to get an internship since the school is right in philly. It is also near several colleges including uPenn and this could make for some great networking. 

Now if I end up staying at SJU, I'd like to major in accounting and get something in the IT field to complement it. Or maybe finance. My relatives were able to get jobs with the big four with only BA's, but from what I can tell times are changing. I plan to work my ass off in college, especially with my parents paying for it. So what's your advice /r/accounting?



Thanks"

This is a fairly well-known book by a fairly well-known author. My professor had recommended me for the internship and I had contacted the author and set it up myself, with no help from my parents. In fact, they tried to sabotage it.

I wrote my mom this angry rant in response:

""the idea that you or dad would be able to use the intern label in that book as something positive about me to tell people really upsets me.

Dad tried to convince me not to do that internship because he ""had a better one."" Then, when the one he suggested fell though, and I started the internship I had set up myself (contacted -author name-) he suddenly told me that I had to financially support myself OR ELSE. He wouldn't have insisted on this, if I had taken the internship he set up for me.

Meanwhile, on top of that internship (which required hours of research and writing) I was also taking an online course for college credit. -author name- was paying me, but apparently her payment wasn't enough. I tried explaining that I needed a lot of hours to work on the internship and that course, and if I got a job, it would leave me too exhausted to focus on the most important things: like doing well in my internship and getting a good grade for my transcript.

Both you and dad came together to tell me if I didn't get a job, I would continue to be threatened and harassed, I had to pay for myself, I was living in YOUR house and had to support myself accordingly. Finally, I got my old job at the -place- back. I ended up working a minimum wage job full-time instead of focusing on what was truly important for my future, because both of you decided that the job was more important.

Between making sure my GPA remained high and working on the internship, I picked making my GPA high. I focused my remaining energies on that course and performed very poorly with the last weeks of the internship. She told me that, whatever, she understood why I needed a job and basically rescinded her offer to write me a recommendation letter, which would have meant a lot to me.

So I offered to continue my internship for another couple months, THROUGH MY CALENDER SEMESTER, which impacted my actual school work, so that I could undo the damage the job had done.

When I brought this up later, it was continuously downplayed and ignored by both you and Dad. No apologies. Just demands from Dad to tell -author name- to give me a recommendation letter anyway. Disgusting behavior.

No thanks to either you or Dad, I salvaged that internship and did the best that I could in a crappy situation.

Literally, despite your best efforts to ruin that internship, I succeeded.

That makes me very angry. And thinking that either of you would brag publicly about it, is ridiculous. This is my success. I earned it.""

I am still VERY angry, and to make matters worse, I'm at work. I should know better than to open emails from her at work. Also, she tagged me in a post about it on facebook.

Things to keep in mind for context. My parents told me that, under no certain circumstances was I to get a job at college, since my first priority was school. Every time I suggested getting a job, they told me not to think about it. So them forcing me to get a job that summer was out of the ordinary.

When I say ""threatened and harassed"" I mean consistently yelled at, woken up early in the morning, asked every few hours, whether I had gotten a job yet. If I didn't get a job, financial help for my college would be cut off, and other vague threats.

I am furious with the thought that either one of them would take credit for this by bragging in my absence."

27ekez,2,2014-06-05,"Typing this out helped a bit, but how do you prevent yourself from getting so irritated that it eats you away?",anarchyrabbit,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/27ekez/typing_this_out_helped_a_bit_but_how_do_you/,"I’m not feeling as though I am in a good space right now. I’m feeling depressed and very stressed at the moment, even though I shouldn’t be. It all started on Monday evening, the night before Mom went in to hospital. After speaking to her that night emotions started running through me and I could barely focus on anything. I tried to watch an episode of House of Cards but could hardly keep up with the story due to my brain constantly over thinking things as I usually do – especially when it is something of this subject.
So the day she went into hospital I was still feeling extremely stressed and depressed, woke up and got ready for work and off I went. I tried best to get really focused on my work as I thought this would keep my brain off the fact that my mother was busy undergoing an 8 hour operation which involved a very delicate procedure. This was working to an extent except for myself being a bit edgy and getting very agitated by people in general. Before I carry on, this needs a bit of a back story.

I’m on a learnership program at the bank I work for – kind of between an internship and a graduate program. Let’s call the bank Best Bank. Now Best Bank recruited 28 graduates beginning of last year for this program and we were split into different areas. Now, me a 2 other guys were placed together. Let’s call these two guys Andy and Stewart. Now upon my judgment I would say that Andy is also an INTJ. At first we didn’t say much to each other but after getting to know him I realized that I liked Andy because we could talk about topics with substance, Andy shares many of the same views I do and I agree with his reasoning and logical thinking almost most of the time. Stewart on the other hand is more of an ESFP. In the beginning me and Stewart kinda got along and we would joke around and what not. There were some things that I didn’t like about Stewart from the beginning he would sometime talk about the most ridiculous theories and sometimes he would ask really stupid questions (in my eyes any case). It is as though Stewart sometimes has no filter and just says what pops into his mind. As time goes on Stewart asks me questions (let’s say most of these are work related) which he should REALLY know by now after being there for a year or so – e.g. “How do I upload a document to the central repository and who should I label as the Originator?” No this really grinds my gears – especially since it is maybe the second time he asks me. But as I am generally helpul to people I help him out but show that his question really irritates me and that I think he should know how to do it by now. Other things that irritated me about Stewart was that he liked to talk to a lot of people passing by his desk (I sit right next to him), to make things worse he talks pretty loud and to me some of the things that come out of his mouth is completely and utterly stupid. It is as though sometimes his head is like a void with bad ideas floating around and sometimes these bad ideas collide and he says something. So Stewart started to get on my nerves so much that I despised conversing with him. I think that by this point in time Stewart started to pick up on my drift that I didn’t like him. So for me personally I had to beat Stewart on this learnership program – which I did, I passed the certification and he didn’t and my manager wants to hire me and not him. Plus I know for a fact that my work out performs his by FAR. So there I beat Stewart. Should feel good right? It felt damn good for a while, beating this guy who is starting to irritate the living shit out of me.

Back to the present. That Tuesday while my mom was being operated on I was trying to focus my mind on my work. Here’s the thing though, Stewart is constantly talking to people – now I don’t know if this was because I was edgy but it honestly felt like he was recruiting people one after the other to come over to his desk to have a chat about the stupidest shit ever and I am just shaking my head as I hear a fuckton of nonsense come out of his mouth. After lunch Stewart locks himself out of his computer (which he has done before, which also irritates me because how thick does one have to be to forget your password that you literally use every week day at least 5 times?). If we lock ourselves out we can call the IT Support desk to reset our password, alternatively one can wait an hour and the system will accept your password again. Yep, you guessed it – he decided to wait the 60 mins, after he had just come back from a lunch break. Why the fuck would someone with more than two brain cells do this? So the one contractor, also a youngish dude walks past us and says to Stewart “I see you’re working hard, hey?”, so I find this fucking hilarious and I blow air hard through my nose just to let both of them know I find the comment funny. Now Stewart gets all defensive and says to this dude “Why are you disrespecting me… blah locked out of my computer blah…” But I am fucking loving this probably the highlight of my day because at this point in time with my and Stewarts relationship any downfall to him brings a bit of pleasure to myself. Evil right? I know but I can’t help it – I have all the hate in the world for him at this point in time. I want to chirp in and say something about calling the support desk but I contain myself and decide maybe it’s not a good idea because if things get heated up, I lose. After this Stewart puts his earphones in and starts to hum. Yes, I shit you not after all this he starts to fucking hum. Now this really get my blood boiling and I kind of facepalm to make sure he notices. He carries on humming. I look at him, but he doesn’t budge, he carries on humming. Now my back pretty much starts aching because he is getting me so worked up. I think for a sec and decide it is not worth it to snap, because if I snap I lose. So I pack my laptop and go and sit at an empty desk three desks away for the remaining 2 hours or so of the work day. At this point in time my body feels like it wants to explode because I am so worked up I can barely answer my colleague when he asks why I am moving. I am really not enjoying the rest of the day and the evening. The only good news was thatI heard my mom’s operation went well and there were no complications according to the doctors. She recovers in ICU and I will only see her once she is out of ICU.

Next day (Wednesday). Still have my mom and her operation on my mind. I don’t know why but even though I have heard from my dad that she is ok and recovering I still want to see her. I get into work and it’s kind of pleasant until Stewart gets there – he is always late which is another reason he doesn’t deserve my respect. He could try and buy my respect and I’d honestly tell him to fuck off. So after about 30 minutes or so, all I have said to Stewart throughout this time is “hi”, I say to him “Hope you’ve done all your humming this morning at your flat”. He responds with “No – I’m gonna hum again today” in that fucking stupid sounding monotone voice he has. Now once again my blood starts boiling and my back starts aching and all I manage to get out is “It’s a working environment I don’t think that humming is something you do here”. Now I am extremely vented up again, fuck knows why because why should I let him get to me. But here’s the funny thing – he does get to me. I am so vented up that I don’t want to confront him directly because I know that I will let my emotions get the best of me, I will explode and I will lose. I decide to send him an email. Here is a paraphrased version.

“Hi Stewart, I didn’t appreciate your loud behavior yesterday. You were constantly talking none stop throughout the day and this really distracted me from doing my work. Heaven knows how you managed to get any work done. Then you started humming which really annoyed me. When I asked you not to hum again, you said you would do it again today – this I did really not appreciate.
I am a reasonable man, and also enjoy the odd conversation. Blah blah… I ask you politely that you would please tone it down, as I don’t want to take this matter to our managers as I think you’d agree that it is unnecessary, but if I am forced to I will.

Kind regards,
Anarchyrabbit”

He replies almost immediately and say he is sorry and I should have just said something before. But he will tone it down he says.
After being away for a few hours in meetings I sit down back at my desk next to Stewart and he verbally jumps me – something I was definitely not prepared for because he responded to my email. He says that he doesn’t appreciate my email and that I was insulting him in the email. He doesn’t give me a chance to speak, so I ask him can I have a chance. I get a few words out while he takes a brief pause, I say “Where have I insulted you? Please show me” he doesn’t really respond, I say “Who the fuck hums in an open plan office”. Things are starting to get a bit steamy. He says that he won’t change his behavior and I should move desks if I want. I ask him if I can also have a proper chance at saying a few words. He doesn’t give it to me, finishes what he has to say and walks off. Now in my books he is literally a piece of dog shit. The last couple of hours was the same as the day before – all stressed out and irritated to work. That afternoon just before I leave I decide that I will move desks for the sake of my own sanity.

Today. Work was a bit better but I still feel very stressed and depressed. I don’t know why I feel like this. Is it my mom, is it Stewart? Fuck it! I can’t pin point what is making me feel this way and it suck balls. I have moved away from someone who I felt was sucking me into their hole they keep sliding down. My dad says my mom has recovered a lot and will be out of ICU tomorrow. Why should I feel like this? This whole week I haven’t been chatting to my friends on our group chat because I simply don’t feel like it. Now I feel as though I am missing out with my friends because I am not joking with them. Even though I don’t want to at the moment I still feel like I am missing out. I feel mentally and emotionally drained. Fucking miserable. Period. Why? I honestly don’t understand why it gets to me so much.

This kind of seemed somewhat therapeutic to write all of this down. I feel a bit better. I know it seems petty as shit but it’s eating me away at the moment and I don’t know what to do. I am hoping that time will fix me. How am I supposed to cope with this and not let it get to me? How do I prevent myself from getting overly irritated by what other people do?

TL;DR: How do you guys not let someone/something get to you so much and prevent it from eating you away?

I'm currently working on a ML project that involves record linkage optimized by ML. When I first started the project, I knew I would need a way to rapidly evaluate the accuracy of the classifier. I knew I would need a labeled data set, but unfortunately this data set did not exist yet. 

I'm not afraid of getting dirty with the data, so I dug in, and eventually found a way to consistently find the correct answer. Unfortunately, labeling this data takes quite a bit of time, since it involves a level of manual record linkage. Hence, I was only able to do a small set on my own. I trained on this data, and found it to generalize fairly well, so a plan was set in place to get a set of outsourced interns to do this labeling task so I could improve performance and generalization.

Unfortunately, I found early on, no one else had the accuracy or efficiency to do this task well. Even when the task was simplified to simply evaluating the accuracy of the output of the classifier, they struggle. They consistently can not see the patterns in the data and mark correct things as incorrect. When I go through their work, and make corrections, they agree that my corrections are accurate, however, they have never improved on the tasks provided to them. 

This is stressing me the hell out. They are the biggest source of error in my project, but I have no other resources to hire someone better. What can I do? The classifier is doing a hell of a job based on my evaluations, but I simply do not have the time to take a sample each time and evaluate it myself. I can't run the optimization system until I have at least a modestly sized set of data with the correct answers. But the team hired to evaluate has a 10% error rate

Have any of you dealt with this issue before? What do I do?"

I probably need therapy.


**My Mother.**

My mom has always been depressed, since she was a teen. She was always loving when I was a child, but she would be very critical of me. Micromanage. Due to this, I find myself questioning my decisions down to stupid little things, like where to put things. It is a constant voice in my head, following me around, telling me how, what and where to do stuff. 

When I was a teenager, she was unable to drive a car, so I would have to take the city bus everywhere, even to school. When I was 17, and a senior in HS, she met her boyfriend, and would stay with him all the time, so I lived at home, but it was just me in the house. I had a job, so I had some income for food and stuff. I graduated HS by the hair on my fanny. Since the bus stop was almost a mile from my house, I was late all the time to class. If I had been one minute later, I would have failed my senior year and not graduated. 

I went to the community college, she kept staying with her boyfriend and I kept being broke. I was so broke, it was 2009 and nobody was hiring. I got a job dancing. I had money, and things got easier, but she still stayed with her boyfriend. I saw her on occasion, but she would always harass me with questions about where I was working, and how I got money, and how I was doing in school. This might seem normal, but she never offered help with these questions. Not, do you have enough money, are you ok, how is the job hunt coming? When you dance, you can't just come off and be like ""I'm doing jolly fine mom, the stripping pays well now a days!"". Especially since my half sister (from my mom) used to strip, and is a drug addict and cant stay out of jail. She would have made me quit, and I didn't want to be broke again. I grew up broke, she was a waitress, and I never really had nice things. It was nice to have some makeup, clothes, and accessories, along with food, and finally buying a car, and being able to get it fixed. 

I moved out that may, got an apartment, kept trying to go to school, and kept dancing, until I ran out of classes and had to move cities. She helped me move and paid for an apartment for 6 months. She never came to visit me though. I would return to my hometown often, every other weekend, and see her sometimes, but she was always with her boyfriend. She would tell me i was coming down too much and I needed to stay in my college town. The bus fare was cheap and it kept my sanity. I knew nobody in this town. it was horrible, and I was depressed for months. I cried every night for the first few weeks, then sometimes when I though about how I had no friends. Then I stopped crying so much, but I still had no friends, and the only time I got to see people was when I went home. So I wouldn't tell her when I would come down, as it would be met with 20 degrees of questions that she doesn't need the answer to and then her telling me that I need to stop coming down.

I met my new boyfriend, and things got easier. I stopped going home so much, now only once a month if that. Now she calls me, and hounds me. ""you come to town and ever see me, you see all of your friends and never see me."" Yes, mom, I do come to town, but you are the one that told me to stop coming. Also, you never come to see me. I offered to buy your bus ticket, pick you up, house you, feed and entertain you, you still have not come. This is very one sided. When I call you, you harass me about my life, this makes me not want to talk to you on the phone. 

**Her Boyfriend. **

This guy is, and has never been a parent in my life, but is in my mothers life big time and is a problematic dude. 

He laughs at everything, my mom says it's because he is a jolly dude. Everyone looks at it as disrespect. Because it it. He constantly disrespects me. He thinks that I am a spoiled brat and that I disrespect my mom. He has told me how ""my generation"" is ruining everything. How someday that what I am going to school for will have no use and will be automated and I will have no job. I am going to school for a very disgusting, very sensitive, very medical related field that very few people want to do, and need real human interaction to achieve. It hurt, and even though he was wrong, he said it to hurt me. 

He said that he didnt call me when my mom was hospitalized because I dont see her enough. He said ""Now you know just how fragile life really is"". I know that it was not his place to try to teach me that lesson, and it was an inappropriate time, as she could die at any moment.

He loves FOX news, and has/had brain washed my mom with it, to the point that she started stockpiling for the second depression. He will derail any and every conversation to politics. 

When I was graduating college, I had a feeling that he would not bring her to come up and see me graduate. I was already very stressed out when I called my mom and my sister answered my moms phone. My sister refused to give my mom the phone and pretended to be my mom. I called her boyfriend to give him the date and time. I am already on the verge of a full blown panic attack and he just laughs and laughs, and promises that he is going to bring my mom up to see me graduate, as my other parents are unavailable to come. It is so full of sarcasm, it brings me to my knees. I go full panic attack mode after he hangs up.

When I bought my first scooter, out of need for a vehicle because I wrecked my car and did not want to go back to the city bus, a 150 cc chinese thing. He told my mom that ""no matter how much clothing I put on, that I would get killed on it, probably by decapitation.""

Due to all of these things, I do not like to be around him. his general attitude is that he is the superior being. Also he dresses like leisure suit larry. 


**My Step Father.**

He is your typical stoner dude. Very smart, but an underachiever. He married my mom when I was a toddler. I loved that dude, I was his best buddy. 

After my parents got divorced when i was 8-9 years old, he soon after found a new wife and was very busy with her, also my mom wouldn't let me see him. He grew distant and was less and less available. He had a nice new home, and a new family after all. I would see him some times though.

However, he can be a real dick. Before I started dancing, I got a job selling cutco knives. Don't judge, them mo-fo's are still sharp to this day. The way it worked, was even if I didnt sell anything, I made $16 per home visit, so all in all, I made a few hundred bucks hanging out with my friends and family, playing with sharp things. I asked if I could do a visit with them and make my $16, it would only take an hour. He said yes, and picked me up. When I got in the car, he said that I would not be giving my presentation, but instead we were to go eat somewhere. He also said ""That knife selling job isn't a real job, you need to get a real job."" 

When I bought my scooter, he said I needed to get a car. He has never offered to help or buy one for me. 

When I bought my first motorcycle, a 500 cruiser, out of need for a faster vehicle in a bigger city, he said that his little girl didnt need to be riding that big motorcycle. He suggested I buy a toyota yaris ($10k) or a smart car ($16k) if i like small vehicles. He knows that I cannot afford that.

He has never liked what I decided to go to school for. Every time I talk to him, it's always ""I dont want my little girl working in that field. I used to work in that field and it's so corrupt. You don't need to be around that much sadness and darkness. If you like the medical field so much, then why dont you become a nurse?"". he tells me this shit every time I talk to him, and it hurts so much. I love the field I am going into, I am good at it, I have a 3.8 GPA in it. I finally told him that I was sick of hearing his incorrect, opinionated, meanness over the phone. He said he never meant it to be mean, but he meant it as a joke. I know he was lying.

He has problems with money. He is now retired and spends most of spare cash on weed, and he smokes all day. He has told me to get my BF to buy a house for me. Told me that I -NEED- to buy a car. Tried to tell me and my BF that we need a bigger fridge than a 7.1 Cu.Ft. because we need room for TV dinners, yet his huge fridge is constantly so-jam-packed-full of spoiled food. He will buy a house, trash it, and move on to another house. He has bad credit card debt and personal load debt. He keeps giving me money advice and he yet he is so bad at it, it feels so hypocritical.  

Its hard to want to be around someone who keeps telling me that my dream job is wrong and that my one true and innocent love, my motorcycle, is wrong, and also gives me really bad money advice.


**My real Father.**

My real dad was left by my mom shortly before I was born, and he was not allowed to see me. Period. 

My mom saw him at an event and decided to get us to meet if I was interested, I said yes and we met when I was 18. He is pretty crazy, and has lived a crazy life. 

After a few years, I finally took financial help from him. I had avoided this in the past because of my moms warning and my skepticism. He offered to set up a bank account that money would go into every month as an emergency fund. I was getting paid so little at my intern job, that I used it to pay for regular things. He kept putting money in there, so I kept using it as I saw fit.

my name is Alex and I'm from Germany.
I have a friend, Josephine, who is currently in the process of becoming a vet and she is starting her practical year soon.

During that year she wants to do an internship at the Seaview Veterinary Clinic in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal. Since she is still a student, funds are pretty tight. The main issue right now is, that she is unable to find a place to live that she can actually afford. She already looked at hostels online but she could not even afford them. Currently she is e-mailing some of them to see if there is a way to make this happen anyway.

So this is where you guys come in. If you know any places she could stay at, hostels, guest families, you name it, or anyone that might know someone, etc, that would be extremely helpful! If she can't find a place to stay she would have to give up this amazing opportunity.

The exact time of her stay would be: 29th of September to the 30th of November.

I'm counting on you guys, please help!

Thanks and regards,

Alex"

Help, please?",thelittlestchick,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/27erg0/first_real_job_is_turning_out_to_be_a_bit_of_a/,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping you guys can help me out a bit with a new dilemma I'm having.  Almost five months ago, I asked for some advice on my first ""real job"" (see original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/1vkz5z/ive_got_a_lead_on_my_first_real_job_but_i_cant/) for more context), and I got the job.  It started out by me coming into the office (on the LES in Manhattan, I live on Long Island so I commute) to work for week and a half, and if things went well, I would be asked to freelance for longer, and maybe become full time.  Well, it's been almost five months, and I'm still freelancing.  I basically come into the office everyday at 9, and stay all day, leaving sometime between 5 and 6:30, depending on how much I have to do that day.  In the beginning, I typically had a lot of work to do (test fits, presentations, some 3D-modeling), but now I find that I have a lot less work to do, even though we seem to be getting a lot of projects coming in.  The office I work at is very tiny- it's just my boss (the principal), me, and one other intern who started about two months after I did.  My undergrad professor, who is my boss's friend and got me the interview, also shares office space with us, although her practice is completely separate from my boss's.  The other intern that works with my boss has more experience than I do, so she is typically given a lot of work to do for multiple projects at a time, while my work seems to be dwindling- I've been doing ""research"" for projects for the better part of about three weeks now, which isn't even what I was doing when I first started working.  I'm in a situation where I'm not sure what I should do anymore.  Part of me thinks that this situation is fine, and that I have to just accept that I'm at the bottom rung of the architectural job ladder and that as time passes, I'll get more interesting work.  The other part of me feels that because I have less work to do and I'm still only considered as a freelancer (money-wise, too), I should just try to find a job elsewhere.  I'm conflicted about what to do because I don't want to ruin the relationships I have with my boss and my professor.  I'm planning on applying to grad schools this year, and they are both people I know I want to ask for a recommendation letter. I don't want to seem ungrateful or impatient, because I do like my job and I have learned a lot, but it just hasn't turned into the full-time position my boss mentioned at the beginning.  It's also a little frustrating to see that the other intern gets so much ""real"" work for all these new projects while all I seem to do now is research.  What would you guys do in this situation?  Any advice would be helpful, thank you!"

In some applications I've come across, the employer asks for how many ""years of experience"" the applicant has in different skills and programming languages. How exactly does one tally up the years? How much rounding is okay?

Do years of college count? Are summer internships counted as just 3-months? If you only have said 3-month internship, do you round that up to a year? If you have 2 summer internships, is that still rounded up to only one year or is that now 2 years?"

I want to get as much input from others as possible so I know I am taking the right direction. 

To start off, I was a 2nd year engineering student, who had a desire to get into Business the entire time. So towards the end of my 2nd year, I decided to work towards transferring to the Business school, with the aim of majoring in Accounting. 

I feel like I am a little behind now, I will have to complete a couple prereqs and will begin taking some Business core classes starting this Fall. I will most likely start Accounting classes, after I get admitted into the Business School, Fall of 2015. 

I've read the FAQ but still feel like I am behind others in terms of knowing everything. In terms of employment (internships) I barely qualify for any of them. When should I be looking to apply for the B4? Should I look into book keeping/clerical part time jobs until I begin my accounting courses? 

I guess what I am trying to get at is, I wont be in the Business School until Fall 2015 earliest (I will apply in Spring 2015, too late to apply now). Should I act as if I am in the business school and attend recruiting events, or wait till I am formally in the school?

They have two programs that need additional volunteers for the summer, as many people go on vacation. 

The programs: Meals On Wheels and Phone Pals

Meals on Wheels delivers food to older adults in need

Phone Pals is a program where volunteers call older adults who are isolated and have no one to talk too

Any suggestions on how to reach out to the community to find volunteers? This is my first time attempting any volunteer coordination, so appreciate any input or thoughts you can point me in the right direction!

How They Currently Search For Volunteers:

The organization, posts flyers in schools, for college and high school students, and asks current volunteers to find friends and asks them to take on more work. 

It isn't always rewarding for the current volunteers as they just get more work if they do well and are reliable. I don't want to burn out any more people who can't say no as they realize they are needed. "
27f78s,2,2014-06-05,Using IRA to pay for Grad School (MBA)?,TopMBAAdmit,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/27f78s/using_ira_to_pay_for_grad_school_mba/,"Hello,  
This fall, I'll be attending one of the top MBA schools in the country (MIT). I'm estimating the total 2-year price tag as 200K. Anyway, it looks like I'll have about 175K in cash to pay for most of it.  

For the other 25K, I have two choices:  
1) Borrow (student loans)  
2) Withdraw from IRA  

My initial knee-jerk reaction was to scoff at the 2nd option, but the more I'm looking into it, the more I'm leaning towards withdrawing from my IRA. Here's why:  

1) Qualified education expenses are exempt from the 10% withdrawal penalty for the IRA.  
2) If I withdraw from my IRA next year (2015), it would be in the middle of my MBA program. The only other income I would have that year would be from a summer internship. Therefore, anything I withdraw would be taxed as income, yes, but at a much lower rate than if I withdrew it later on in life. I can use the income from a summer internship to pay the taxes on that.    
3) I really do not like the idea of having student loans, unsecured debt that cannot be discharged in the event of bankruptcy.  

I would be withdrawing from my traditional IRA (since it has been untaxed and I could take advantage of lower rates), which would have about 40K in it. I also have a ROTH IRA which has about 30K in it - I don't plan to touch that. I am 28 years old if that means anything.  

What are your thoughts?"
27f85s,107,2014-06-05,I'm a secret meth and benzo addict. What professional options are available to me that won't ruin my life? (long),catchthebus,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/27f85s/im_a_secret_meth_and_benzo_addict_what/,"Forgive me before I begin: I am on the drugs as I type this because I am unable to express myself without them.

I've been using both methamphetamine and benzodiazepines (mostly alprazolam, occasionally others) since I was about 21. A year or so before making this decision, I was pressured into seeing a psychologist by my parents for essentially being a lifelong loner and doing nothing (janitorial, solitary type work, etc) for the two years I was out of high school. My younger sibling has just entered a prestigious university and my parents, both stereotypical Germans, could not comprehend my apathy for life or fellowship. How could a younger sibling out shadow their first, their eldest so decisively? After some months of seeing various professionals I was told I was of a schizoid personality type. Since there was no wonder drug for this condition, my parents aggressively took matters into their own hands and micromanaged every minute of my life until I broke down psychologically, luckily briefly, but not without hospitalization. My mind splintered infinitely and I was reduced to panicked frenzy as I heard countless internal voices convincing me that I was everything: a kind of absurdist god who created all that surrounded me while also being one with it. A car wreck landed me in the hospital and I was given my first benzodiazepines to calm me down since I was ranting like a madman despite broken bones and bloodied flesh. I felt a wave of relief shortly after they injected me. Nothing really mattered at all. In short, these drugs made me realize something that I only knew then in the background: I'm am only a series of chemical reactions. These chemical reactions cause the behavior of the man. Change the reactions, change the man. After healing up, this lead me to talk with some of the shadier types in my group sessions until I came across a drug that allowed me to be what they wanted me to be: methamphetamine. 

Within days, I'd applied for university, and four or five years later, graduated. With only a brief abstinence leading up to my pre-employement drug test as an intern in which I was hired full-time upon graduation, I have continually been using both drugs. I'm now 28 years old and I don't like what I've become. I'm one person in front of others, but an angry, hate-filled, suicidal man at home dwelling on the meaningless of all my suffering. Crushed by the weight that that the entire universe was deterministically setup for no reason and so precisely for me to experience this senseless pain. In time I've become a workaholic to avoid looking at myself. Holidays and weekends are terrible plights. All the while, my parents have never been happier. They love this person I hate so much. 

I feel that I can start the long arduous journey of weening off beginning with the benzodiazpines. I'm in the process of switching over to the equivalent dosage of clonazepam and dropping the dose very slowly over a year or more until I no longer depend on them. However, with meth, even though I sometimes cold turkey on my off days to catch up on sleep and eat thousands of kcals to sustain myself, I cannot tolerate my job without it. That angry man I described above is who shows up to work and I don't want that pressure cooker to explode. If I take more benzos to compensate, I become forgetful, mistake prone, confused, and unproductive which sometimes redoubles my frustration and anger. Basically, I want to get off meth, but unlike benzos, they don't come in equipotent tablets that I can incrementally taper down from. I'm at the mercy of what is around me, I can't always find the best crystals, so I have to just play it by eye to get where I need to function. I want to go to a doctor and be frank with them, ""I'm a meth addict and I want to switch over the equivalent amphetamine dosage so I can taper like what they do for opiate users. Sure, I can cold turkey, but I lose my job and the secret comes out which I can imagine would devastate my family."" Unfortunately, I don't think this type of therapy is even available because from what I can tell functional users like me are a rarity, so abstinence and maybe anti-depressants are all I could hope for. I'm afraid also of being forcefully rehabilitated, having the doctor inform my workplace, or even turned over to the police.  

And lastly, I want to know who I was before all these troubles came to pass. Even if it will be just as terrible than I can at least be sure that whatever decisions I make thereafter are authentic.    

tl;dr I want off meth, but I want to do it slowly. In the US, are there any options that allow a functional meth addict to switch over to some legal equipotent amphetamine tablets and do a slow taper? I don't want to go to some rehab center for several months and get clean. I want this to be a private long-term battle that doesn't require me to sacrifice the very things I took these drugs to build up until I'm sober long enough to choose my next move authentically and true to myself."

I was lucky enough to receive a job in my field so soon after graduating. I obtained the second highest position in the establishment and I am the only ""higher up"" with a degree.


While in college, I had 3 internships. My first was in the probation department at a court house where I completed all tasks that the actual officer completed. After I was there for a month or so, he even took one day a week off and left me in charge of his office. I had my own cases. My second internship was counseling inmates and facilitating groups at a house of correction. My third internship was back at the probation office but this time I worked alongside the Chief and supervised the officers.



I now work in a manager's position at a shelter and get paid only a few dollars above minimum wage because I lack experience. They said they would've paid more if I had more experience. I took it because I was desperate for a job at the time.



I do pretty well with money but that is only because I'm supporting myself. But due to student loan payments, I cannot afford to purchase an older car because I can't afford car payments on top of student loans. I'm on a strict budget and sometimes can't afford to go food shopping.



I'm afraid to start out anywhere else because now I feel as if it'll be the same reasoning and I won't get paid enough. I understand that a car is a luxury due to there being public transportation in my area but it's frustrating that I can't afford things because my paychecks go directly to my student loans.

Riding on the train, I was so fearful I'd throw up that eventually I stopped taking the train. Eventually, I begun again, but only alone, because I didn't want my friends/whoever would ride with me to see me throw up. Living in a city, it was really debilitating. I also used to get invasive thoughts, thoughts of the absolutely worst, more immoral, unnatural, and disgusting things. Things that I felt I had to confess, but that were so grotesque that the act of confessing them was torture. It got really, really bad. I started taking klonopin, but ended up taking a lot, and it just lost its effect.Another thing I did a lot was say please, thank you, and sorry- so much so that my parents told me to stop. 

Over the last ten months or so, I've stopped taking klonopin as much, and my anxiety has been way less. Maybe once a week I'll get anxious, but only once every three weeks will I get seriously anxious. I have a big internship in the city, have a 3.5 GPA (which I've always had through my anxiety, but still).

As of like 3 weeks though, anxiety has been starting again. This week, taking the train to my internship was very hard. I felt like running out of the train, but I forced myself to sit and take it. I've been tking more klonopin (nothing crazy, but still) and my intrusive thoughts have been building up. I have guilt issues, so I don't want to give into my obsessive need to confess. I'm apologizing more, feeling more guilty and gross.

I've tried to look at various online charts but I'm never sure how accurate those actually are. My degree is in EE so I have experience with hardware but most of my work experience is on the software side of things. I enjoy working with DSPs and various controllers. I like both fields, but I feel one-sided because of my work experience. Still, I think I would be qualified for an entry level job on either side. I also prefer working for smaller companies as you get to do a little more (in my experience) if that makes a difference for job outlook. If you have experience on both sides and think one side has more advantages over another, let me know that too!

Some background on me: I'm going into my final year of college and I'm having an internal debate on whether or not I want to work in software or hardware when I graduate. My degree will be a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 and my technical GPA is slightly higher at about 3.6. I currently have an internship debugging/developing ""embedded applications"" (software on an ARM). I've been doing research since the summer after my sophomore year in the bioinformatics field (C++ programs/bash scripts to analyze genetic data).

Edit:
I am not against working for a large company, I just think I may be more likely to get a position where I can have some of each side at a small company. Geographically, I'd like to stick in the US Midwest but I would move farther if the offer was right (don't know if I have the grades to make that happen).

27fufg,1,2014-06-05,Mother doesn't like Daughters (20/F) Serious SO,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/27fufg/mother_doesnt_like_daughters_20f_serious_so/,"  Hey Reddit, I'm a girl from the USA hoping to get some help with an issue that's been bothering me. As of May 2012, my mother, who liked my SO to begin with suddenly began disliking my SO. I live with my mother, because I'm currently enrolled in a community college working towards my  degree, and working 2 jobs that don't pay well enough for me to move out.  Anyways, she started getting fed up with some of the little things my SO would do, not explaining them to me, and had a big blow up when I came back with a few hickies one day, and she made it seem like she was insinuating less than kind things about me.   (We are waiting until marriage.)
              I told my SO not to do anything that I can handle it since I didn't want him making her angrier by having him stick up for me, and she got mad at him for not sticking up with me. Fast forward a few months of strict gas control, when I bought the gas, and 10:00 curfews, along with various stupid fights because shes mad I wont break up with him, we all went on vacation, where we were not allowed to hug, or even put our head on the others shoulders or shed get mad that we were hanging all over each other. It was incredibly controlling, seeing as how I am an adult, but I guess I get it because I'm under her roof.Things escalated to where my SO was so irritated with her to where he didn't want to go on outings because she was so rude to me, and put me down constantly. .  After the vacation, he wrote her a letter, and told her basically that he didn't want to keep being invited to outings if she was going to treat me like that.She took it the wrong way and made it sound like he was complaining and not sticking up for me again That sealed it for her and she hates him with a burning passion now. My SO and I started college practically the week after that, and she was very distant towards me, not really talking to me, or even talking back to me. My SO kept telling me that he wanted to talk to her and make amends, and I just didn't think it would be OK to do because she was so mad.  I couldn't go an hour without her suggesting to me someone else to date. Finally after a few miserable months, my SO, my mother, and my father sit down to talk, and my mother ends up disliking him even more. This entire talk leads to her telling me constantly about how if something happens he will run off instead of helping me out, and telling me I can do better, and that hes not motivated and wont become anyone.  Its killing me to listen to, as he works through his 3rd year of Medical school, doing internships and getting all A's. After the talk, a holiday came up, and I was invited to spend the day with his family. I stayed half of the day with his family (As I have been doing for all the holidays now) And when I got back she was really rude about me going making snide remarks and the like. She has even recently started not giving me the times for my families celebrations so that I will be late coming from his. She also will tell me we aren't doing anything that day, and when I tell her I am going to his families celebrations, she will wait a few days and spring it on me that we are also doing something that day. She will then go out of her way to make me feel like I am the cause of all our families problems because of this and it really hurts me. 
                      
I feel like I'm 12 all the time, and she will constantly tell me things like she cant believe how immature I am, and how shes disappointed with me, and how she thinks he doesn't support me in the ways he should and all that other good soul crushing stuff. Its to the point where I cry myself to sleep, and make myself sick with worry trying to figure out ways to get out. Im getting really depressed because of living here, I don't have friends who can pay rent, and I really don't want to live with my SO until maybe she can accept him. Which is a stupid dream but it kills me she doesn't like him, since I really felt from the minute I met him he was the one.


Im sorry for any lack of details, any spelling errors, run ons, and all that.

Anyways, this summer I started as a cyber security research intern at a laboratory. So far, I've spent my internship learning cloud architecture, networking, and security. I didn't realize how in depth the field was, and I know that the skills I'm learning now will be very useful in the future. The multidisciplinary nature appeals to me because it mixes software engineering, networking, and business, and I wanted to know about what kind of careers are in the field and if it was worth pursuing rather than focusing on one field. Also, I wanted to know what kinds of skills/languages I should be learning if I want to be ahead in the field. Right now I'm primarily learning virtual networking and IaaS tools, but I am unsure of what technologies are being used in ""the real world."" I don't hear much about these types of jobs on this subreddit so I would like to hear what some people in this field do. "

I need to tell someone my story I suppose so this is going to be long and stuff. Hopefully the bots don't remove it because I really need to be heard.
Anyway, we got together in high school and were in love. I had been dating another girl when she called me one day and admitted her feelings for me and it sparked something I had never felt before. I immediately broke up with my girlfriend at the time because I knew I felt something. 
Anyway after high school I joined the military and we later get married during her senior year of school, I knew we were young to be married but she was my one true love, and I knew it was what I wanted. Anyway, after our honeymoon I immediately left for Iraq. 
Times were hard but she kept me going. During my third month into deployment she tells me with tears in her eyes she made a mistake and kissed my best friend while drunk. It was a mistake and she loves me and only me. After a long time of thinking about that and being very hurt by it I forgave her and eventually got over it. Fast forward. 
I find us a nice house in Cali and we live their together happily until the end of my contract. I knew I wanted to get out and go to school, I have a lot I want to do in life and she agreed. 
At first times were hard as we moved back home. We had to live with my parents a while before we got setup somewhere. Well, we had a lot of friends in town and we got to know some new people. I was a bit depressed from having to change our lives so drastically. She became emotionally involved with another man. It never went passed that I guess but I was devastated. She said it was because I was emotionally distant, I guess because of the depression.

She went to her moms a while and we went to counseling and stuff but I harbored a lot of anger and sadness. I hated myself, and her. I hated everything. I turned my back on my religion and drank a lot. We got back together though, and I was very numb from it. To the point of near sociopathy. After a year of being numb I broke. I tried to push her away blaming her for how I was. I made her leave and we separated. I drank myself into stupors and even had an emotional relationship with a much younger girl. I was 24 at the time she was 19. But in the pit of my soul I knew my wife was still my one true love. So I cleaned myself up, actually tried again in school and begged for her to come back.
I didn't deserve her after that, but I knew I had to try, I nearly killed myself back then. I was in a very dark place I guess. Looking back I was being stupid.
Eventually after long hours of talking and working things out I find out that there had been another man during the time we were together, and it was physical. I think that really broke me. But I still loved her and with tears in my eyes I still asked for her to come back and be with me.
We moved out of our apartment we had been living in at the time into a big house.
At first it was just us, but eventually we got some roommates, and that has been fine I guess. I'm now on my last year of college and I've somehow maintained a decent GPA. I've almost quit drinking completely and she had been the best part of my life. One day I'm looking for one of my math notebooks for a stats exam and I find a note in it. She had a lot of hateful things to say, that I wasn't good enough for her, never was, and that she deserved a fuck buddy or something on the side. 

You know, if you knew me you wouldn't think me capable, but I'm bawling as I write this. :/

I brought it to her attention and she burst into tears, that she was depressed and scared. That I'm not easy to live with, because I'm too relaxed. That I don't have the same work ethic she does. She takes it upon herself to maintain the house, while I'm in school and working to support us. I'm not disagreeing with her though, motivation to do housework at the end of the day is hard for me, but I do laundry and dishes and cut grass when I see it needs to be done. A few months ago though when I was just starting to recover from the note, on Easter actually, she tells me that she just isn't happy and she wants to divorce. I clam up and shut down again. I didn't know how to handle it I suppose. But she left to stay with friends. Her name is on the lease to this house and she wants it so I'm being forced to move. She wanted me out by august I'm told. So I saw a lawyer and started the divorce process. Since then I have changed a lot. I'm a stronger person now, and I take care of everything myself, and made the deans list despite this happening. I've gone on dates and have really grown as a person. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 
So she gets this internship in a nearby town and is alone now. She talks to me daily almost and tells me that she misses me and how alone she feels. That she loves me but wants to wait and see the person I become after the summer. She said she noticed the positive changes in my life and she likes it.

She knows that I love her, with everything I have. I can honestly say that I cannot imagine myself with anyone else, nor do I want to. But I don't believe we should only love each other for who we might be one day. 

Sorry about the novel guys, but i felt like you needed some context. I don't really know what to do reddit. I really need help. 

TL;DR My wife and lover of 9 years and myself have had a rocky relationship and despite it all I love her. But I'm a much better person on my own and she noticed it, she wants to see who I am after the summer is over and if she likes me then she wants to try again. I just can't help but feel like it's not fair to do that to me.

After reading your comments I feel like I must spend more quarters at UCSD. I'll start out by drafting classes to add to Summer 2016 and FALL 2016 to my schedule (or could be an internship as Moogra2u and necbromancer have pointed out that could be used to fulfill CSE 197). I'll add and change classes as I see fits from your suggestions. Please help me working it out. For now, I'll leave it blank. Additionally: is it possible to attend the commencement or graduation ceremony in Spring 2016 if I still have some, say 4 to 5 upper div. major classes left to complete? I know my friend in Berkeley did that, but I'm not quite sure how many classes exactly did she had left incomplete prior to attending the graduation ceremony. I know I must further confirm with the advisor later, but just in case you have had any friends who did that please leave a comment below

27gq94,2,2014-06-06,Supposed to fly to Seattle for an internship Monday (3 days) and i haven't yet received an itinerary. Is this normal?,yooman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27gq94/supposed_to_fly_to_seattle_for_an_internship/,"I'm starting orientation for an Amazon internship on Tuesday, and I'm supposed to have a flight to Seattle on Monday that I was told would be arranged for me.  I submitted the last of my paperwork weeks ago and they told me I ""may not receive an itinerary right away, as we make travel arrangements through a 3rd party"".  But I've got nothing and the flight is in 3 days.  Not knowing my departure time has spoiled my weekend hiking trip plans, and now I'm just sitting on my hands until I get the email.

I've asked my recruiter and hiring manager, and the general response has been ""we don't have anything yet either, we'll let you know."" I want to email them again but I don't want to bug them too much.  Although I'm starting to get nervous.

Should I be worried?  Or is it normal for company flight arrangements to take up to the last few days to be finalized?

If there was some mistake and I don't get my flight info, I'm going to have to fly myself and ask for reimbursement, which is frankly a little ridiculous.

Edit: made some calls, got this resolved.  Apparently my email address was refusing to receive their emails.  Ugh!"

Got some questions about working with an unrealistic project manager....

I'm a non-traditional student (~30 yrs old) who is currently about to graduate with my CS degree and have been working for the past year as an intern at a large hardware/microchip company. Prior to going back to school, I worked in the corporate world for a few years and earned enough money to live on while I was in school.

About 6 months ago I got transfered to a new team/project developing a platform as a service. The project manager/leader of scrumm team seemed like a nice guy when I started, but slowly alot of red flags have been coming up. 

The guy never shows up until 3pm most days, but constantly is scheduling online meetings on our bridge to interrogate us on what we are working on. He claims to follow Agile/Scrumm, however our Daily stand up meetings can run anywhere from 45 min to 1 hour while we listen to him wax philosophical over how great he thinks his user stories are. In addition to long DSU meetings, he also expects us to be able to have at least one feature to demo every afternoon, however this only gives us around 2-3 hours to actually work before we have to demo (unless we work through lunch). He is ALWAYS late for meetings (by at least 20 - 30 minutes) and expects us all to wait around for him to show up. If we don't have anything to demo in the afternoon or are still debugging/testing, he makes us share our screen online and has the rest of the team sit around and debug that one person's code until it works. After he has tied up the whole team for at least an hour or two every afternoon, he gets furious because no one has gotten any work done. His remedy for this is to assign more work and ask for demos to be presented the following morning in our daily stand up..... lol. Also going home everyday is awkward, he feels the need to ask us every night why feel like we can go home around 5:30 or 6 when the work hasn't been done... not cool dude. 

I am not new to development (have been working as a dev for around 3 years now) and have seen how Agile/Scrumm works when used properly. My biggest concern is not being able to deliver for stories, due to not having enough time to work. To be honest, I refuse to take work home since I am already in the office 8-9 hours a day and my pay is capped at 40 hours. However I feel like I can't get anything done because I am always going to meetings or being lectured for not getting my user stories finished on time. The company has made it clear that they will be extending an offer to me once I graduate, and I would love to stay.... just not with this team/project. 

Is there anything that can be done to better my work environment? How can I handle the appearance of underperforming, when a major roadbloack is the leadership in my team?"

But right now I am not in the possesion of it, for now I'm looking for a pc for the time being. I still have my old graphics card laying around which I can use and I might be able to get a PSU from my intern place. Anyway I was hoping to get some advice on what to buy. 

Budget : 200-400 euro (I prefer good parts over a nice case)

OS : Windows 7 64 bit

Setup : Mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers and (GPU msi gtx 750 dont got this one at the moment) and ati radeon saphire hd 5670 512mb  ram 

Location : Netherlands (recommend me some parts and I will look the parts up myself)



Here is a short list of what I need.

CPU 

Motherboard (Mini-ITX to Micro ATX)

RAM 
 
Case (Mini-ITX to Micro ATX)

The computer will be used for school (I'm stuyding IT and I need to run some virtual servers), next to that I enjoy playing some games and recording video footage / edit it. 


EDIT : Okay so I might only be able to afford the motherboard, cpu and ram for the moment. I'm going to ask around for some spare parts from people so I can complete my build. Its very important for school because I'm not able to work at home right now.

My name is Randy, I had been working for Goldman Sachs for a while before I got tired of the ~~misogynistic~~ tedious atmosphere and moved to HR.  I recruited for HBO (yes, the one and the only) for a very long time before I realized I could ~~drink while I worked~~ be more successful on my own! In January I split off and it's been pretty nice so far.

**How I found Reddit**: My friend in Electrical Engineering (working as an intern for me this summer) mentioned the reddit community enough times for me to become curious -- I'd been lurking on his account for the past month until just today!

I have two jobs that might interest some of you:

* one Unix Site Reliability engineering consulting role at HBO through my old friends there
* one sysadmin job at a blooming IT company in Midtown Manhattan

__________________________________________________________________________
**HBO, Site Reliability Engineer**: I am not going to lie, getting a full time  job at HBO is miserable these days. The reason this is a consulting job is actually because I suggested to the current hiring staff there that they avoid the ridiculous process of full-time hiring. The consulting hiring process is much easier.
Here are the requirements:

* scripting other than Ruby
* high volume website management
* full stack troubleshooting
* system management tools (puppet or chef or something)
* ""Configuration and maintenance of common applications and utilities such as Apache, Tomcat, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, Weblogic, SSH, DNS""
you get the idea...

__________________________________________________________________________
**Windows System Administrator**
this IT company is small and friendly, and is looking more for a new team-member than just for the skill set. They're a very close-knit group of guys that is on the rise.  They travel around to companies in the NYC area, dealing with all of the IT stuff for clients who don't do it themselves.
Here are the requirements:

* At least a few years deploying server-based networks
* clearly, Windows
* VMWare ESX(i)
* Really *solid* MS Exchange server and Active Directory 
* firewalls, vpns, networking

yadda yadda yadda... if you have any certification, that's great! Also this company is trying to expand into ""the Cloud"" (*dramatic music plays*), so if you know anything about Office 365 or something similar, brag about it!

I literally **just** had lunch with these guys, and they're a really fantastic group. There are only 16 people in the office and they always crack open a few drinks as Friday comes to a close.  If you are looking for a young and friendly atmosphere, this is the place for you!"

Long story short. I, the ""Intern"" (paid), love my job and do my best with every task and even gone above and beyond with tasks outside my job description saving the company lot of time and money by doing things in house (photography and photoshop for product catalog, web design and development, etc...). 

Meanwhile, 90% of the time I turn around to check what my coworker is doing he is watching videos on youtube. He doesn't respond to email requests on a timely manner - he over all just counts down the time till he can leave. 

He has a CIS degree with a minor in programming but I'm sure he can't even build a simple calculator. The first few weeks (we started at the same time) working with him, he asked me for help installing windows 7(he had never done it before), and he revealed to me that his home pc is 7 years old and he never built a pc in his life - he didn't even know what 7.2k (RPM) meant when it came to Hard Drives, I KID YOU NOT. This guy even asked me for help resetting someones password in AD &gt;_&lt;

I am probably looking at salaried full time position soon since my boss just gave me a major web development project which I finished this week, during which he hinted towards us talking about a permanent position. 

Anyways what do I do in this situation? My boss is too busy to realize his incompetency and I don't wanna be a rat but his laziness is beginning to affect my workload. 

Thanks!

TLDR: Lazy coworker in small IT department, is/was clueless about key components of his job. Watches youtube/doesn't do work all day and my boss is too busy to realize it.  

edit: 7200k brain fart

edit 2: Thanks for the great responses guys! This month should be interesting when I try some of your suggestions as I discuss permanent employment."

I'll be working in the IT department doing web development at a local college. I didn't get offers from any of the CS internships I applied to (I'll be a college sophomore next year). So I used my network and obtained this internship. I'm really excited about the job because I love coding and it's SO much better than retail. Just a few things I'm worried about how:

* I'll be the only intern on the development team. The manager hasn't had interns in a long time, but said there are 5 full-time developers and I'll be put with someone to help me. So it isn't a defined internship position. He said he'd give me easy projects at the beginning. I'm worried I'll get lost and drag the team down with questions.

*  They use PHP and mySQL and I've never used either of those languages. Should I try to learn them over the weekend or learn as I go? I've started doing a CodeAcademy course on PHP. I know Java, Python, and Obj-C so it's not too challenging to learn PHP but I've never used databases before.

Also, should I bring my laptop? I was a late addition and there aren't any more cubicles available so I'll most likely be put at a workstation. They use Windows computers and I'm more comfortable on Macs.

Thanks."

27hwf8,169,2014-06-06,Dressing for a Casual Office,tomlizzo,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/27hwf8/dressing_for_a_casual_office/,"*aka* ""how to dress for an office that has no dress code,"" ""how to dress for a tech startup,"" ""help, I'm a software engineer!,"" ""what is smart casual?"" ""business casual with jeans?"" as well as some variations of ""how do I start to dress like an adult?""


**Overview**

Casual dress code (or *no* dress code) offices can be some of the most fraught environments to dress appropriately for. Unlike a business formal office, a school, or a service industry job with a uniform, there are no explicit rules for what you can and can't wear. Instead, the 'rules,' so to speak, are unspoken and can be extremely variable both within a workplace and between workplaces. 

Dressing successfully in this type of office requires a keen eye and good judgment. The advice here, more than anything else, is intended to help you develop that judgment for yourself so that you can apply it in context.


**Your Goals**

If your particular concern is about what you're *allowed* to wear at a casual office, the answer is: probably whatever you want, just go ahead and try things until someone takes you aside to tell you you're dressed inappropriately. 

However, this guide assumes that you have goals beyond simply not being sent home to change clothes. Goals like:

* Appearing confident and competent at your job
* Positioning yourself for full-time hire (if you're an intern) or promotion
* Demonstrating professionalism and understanding of the industry and workplace you're in
* Gaining respect and trust from coworkers, managers, direct reports or clients

The truth is that most poor fashion choices in a casual office will not get you a stern talking-to or even a passing mention (like I said, that's why this dress code is so challenging!). More likely, the effect of not dressing appropriately for your casual office circumstances will be things like:

* Appearing immature or naive
* Coming across as careless or ""not a cultural fit""
* Making it difficult for your boss to picture you in a more senior role

Finally, please don't call this a Big Girl Job. You are a woman and a professional. There's no need to patronize yourself.


**Who to Watch**

Most advice for casual workplaces will tell you that before rushing out to buy a new work wardrobe, you should watch and take careful note of how other people in the office dress. 

More specifically, you should watch and pay attention to how your boss - that is, your immediate supervisor - dresses. This is because *that* is the person whose attitudes, tastes and biases will have the biggest effect on how you are perceived and how that perception affects your job. As a side note, people also tend to feel affinity for those they see as similar to them... so while you should definitely not pull a *Single White Female* on your boss, if there are any aspects of her style that inspire you and you'd like to emulate, it can't hurt.

If your boss is a dude, or a lot older than you, or dresses in some other way that's different enough not to be helpful in setting your own style, you can look to other people as well. Colleagues who are at the same level as your boss, or people who are 1-2 levels more senior than you, are also good to look to as role models.

Do not look to the CEO or other extremely senior people (or people you don't work directly with) for cues. These people are often held to different standards than you will be, so the way they dress is usually not relevant to you.

Do not look to your immediate coworkers and other people at your level for cues, because often they have no idea what they're doing.


**How to Look Older**

Since this guide is oriented mainly toward people just starting out in their careers, a primary concern (and useful tool) when dressing casually but professionally is how to look older. Or at least, how to look like someone who knows what they're doing and wasn't living in a college dorm just yesterday. 

If this is a concern for you, I highly recommend reading the often-recommended [post on Extra Petite on this topic](http://www.extrapetite.com/2010/05/reader-request-how-to-look-older-in.html). It has great photo illustrations. Her advice plus mine is summed up by the following:

* Style your hair.
* Wear makeup.
* Wear jewelry.
* Replace hoodies and athletic-looking jackets with cardigans, blazers and tailored jackets.
* Replace t-shirts with embellished or printed tops, blouses, and tops in dressier fabrics. Avoid graphic tees.
* Replace sneakers with sleeker flats (try oxfords, loafers, D'orsays) and round toed shoes with pointy or almond-toed shoes.
* Replace light denim with dark denim or trouser fabrics.
* Make sure your clothes fit impeccably. Tailor if necessary, paying special attention to hems, sleeve lengths, leg openings and necklines.

All of the above is optional, of course. But if you are trying to dial up the maturity of your appearance in the office, those are some of the dials you have access to. Use them as you see fit.


**Business Casual and 'Overdressed'**

Have you read any of FFA's existing guides to business casual? [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1i0hqs/business_casual/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ecdsi/business_casual_for_interns_and_new_hires_tips/). It may be useful to know that just about everything that falls under business casual can be worn in a casual office, and does not need to be dressed down in order to be appropriate.

Let me repeat that: With extremely few exceptions, **business casual clothes do not need to be *made more casual* in order to work in a casual office.**

It seems common, from questions I've read, to be concerned about coming across as 'overdressed' in a casual office. I am here to tell you, from nearly a decade of working in many different casual offices, that this is not something to be worried about. Wearing a sheath dress and heels to a casual office is *not* the equivalent of wearing an evening gown to a bowling alley. People are not laughing at you, embarrassed for you, assuming you are stuck up, or intimidated by you. This is especially true, I've found, the larger your office is - there will always be a few people in a large casual office who are consistently dressed more formally than everyone else, and the connotation of that in other people's minds is neutral-to-positive. At worst, no one cares.

(All of that said, if your job requires you to do particular physical or environmental activities that would be hindered by wearing more formal clothes, then dressing too formally is ill-advised. You should not dress in any way that obviously makes it more difficult to perform your job.)


**Interviewing at a Casual Office**

For an interview at a casual office, you should dress on the more formal end of business casual. The only thing that the casual dress code means for your interview is that you don't need to wear a suit. Please do not try to read anything else into it.

Job candidates are expected to dress nicely and somewhat conservatively for an interview. No one interviewing you is going to feel uncomfortable because you're wearing a dress and they're wearing jeans. Also, unless you are interviewing for a job as a personal stylist, no one is going to think poorly of you because you dressed too 'boringly' for the interview.

Don't overthink this.


**Controversial Items**

There are some specific articles of clothing that some people believe *extremely strongly* have no place in an office.

Wear the following at your own risk:

* Shorts
* Spaghetti straps
* Flip flops
* Hats
* Ripped jeans
* Athletic shoes
* Leggings
* Uggs
* Anything that reveals cleavage, midriff, armpit or butt crack

As you observe and gain experience in your own office, I suggest developing your own additions to this list of don't-go-there items that apply to your specific workplace and career objectives.


**Using Your Own Judgment**

On the topic of creating a never-wear list for yourself, you might find it useful to put together other habits and routines for what you will and won't wear, and how often. Maybe you only want to wear jeans twice a week, or always wear a blazer if you have client meetings, or never wear flats with skirts... 

One of the best parts of not having an office dress code is that you don't have to dress the same way every day. Having a framework like the above can help you work within the wide range of choices that are acceptable in a casual office while keeping you oriented toward the important parts of the image you want to cultivate. 


**Some Inspo**

As mentioned above, your specific circumstances will dictate which of these outfits are good choices for you. I tried to mix in a large range of biz caz, actual casual, dresses, pants, jeans, skirts, heels and flats.

:--|:--
[I've never been so prepared for an AMA before!  I wanted to tell you guys that you are hands down my favorite band, ever.  I move a lot due to being a part of a military family, but I've still managed to make it to about 6 of your shows over the past 5 years and each time is like getting a little glimpse of home (I'm a South Carolina native\).  So thank y'all for doing what you do and doing it well!  Now for my question: Y'all are often referred to as a Christian or even a Christian rock band.  Is that how you define yourselves?  Or do you try to stay away from labels in general?  Edit: One more question--You guys are absolutely amazing live.  I'm always blown away by your energy and passion.  Where does all of that come from?  And is it ever difficult to get it going after so many years of touring?  Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v3zf?context=5)|First of all, thanks for being a fan.  i'll answer you're second question first.  The energy we put out every night is because we try to experience the show in the way you do.  we know how hard it is to make it out to shows sometimes and what it costs for a ticket.  believe it or not, we talk about that all the time.  we feel like we owe it to you guys and it makes it more fun for us to experience the night with you.  as far as your first question goes, i hesitate to answer because i know how much unnecessary discussion goes into this question about our band, but i'll try.  we've always hated the term ""christian band"" as it pertains to us.  the reason being is that it is very polarizing.  if your a person of faith, you might love it because your proud to call our band one of your own.  if you're not, it's an easy way to write our music off as something you won't like.  to be honest, our beliefs have never allowed us to be comfortable with the latter of those two statements.  the one thing i can promise is that this band is going to be honest, sincere, and vulnerable in our music.  our faith is something that is a very real part of our lives and thus cannot be separated from our music.  bear.

[SETH BOLT - Do you ever get time to go on dates these days? Will you do me the honor and go on a date with me in Dallas before your show?? You met me on 11/01/13(I asked you how tall you were @ SoundCheck\) :\] ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0vbfx?context=5)|Hahaha ... I have many-a-friends trying to play match maker, but I don't have much time to go on dates because I'm kinda out of town a lot.
 |I won't have time before the Dallas show because of soundcheck, meet &amp; greets &amp; promo, but maybe I can carve out time for a coffee since you are ""the best single girl in the Midwest""
[How was the transition with a new drummer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v4hq?context=5)|Gonna be honest, the search for a new drummer was pretty tough at first. Our original drummer, Joe Stillwell, is a beast and one of a kind. We held auditions and played with a lot of great drummers, but that didn't work out. - Much to our surprise, Randall Harris, the soft-spoken intern that had been getting us lunch every day while we made THE RECKONING is a monster of a drummer. WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE PLAYED! Crazy how he had been there with us for so long and not once did he show off all his drumming chops... but he knew all the songs VERY well. Which is a good thing because his first gig (ever) was in front of 15,000 ppl. -Seth.

[What anecdote best describes what you've learned about the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v5x0?context=5)|There are about a million of these.  i will give you a couple.
 |The day the outsiders came out, we played a local tv station in kansas city.  we were top 5 on itunes and feeling good about ourselves.  the news anchor introduced the band as ""need to dream"".   he then proceeded to ask us what it was like growing up in north carolina.  we said it was great of course.  thats when we learned you're never as big as you think you are.
 |The president at one of our agencies has introduced himself to seth about 5 times that i recall.  each time he assures us that we're a ""really big deal"" there.
 |When we signed our record deal and went on the road for the first time, we put 6 people in a van.  every night we would send one person in to the hotel with 40 dollars.  they would tell the clerk, ""this is all we have""  we did this until we found a room.  yes, 6 of us in one room.  if we couldn't find someone to take the deal, we slept in the van.  rock n roll.  bear.
[Congrats on all the success you’ve had, and thank you for putting out an absolutely on-point album yet again. I saw you perform in Atlanta and San Francisco this year, I was blown away by the experience, my face and throat hurt from smiling and singing so hard.  Listening to your albums, your songs seem to progress from songs about love and relationships, to songs about what it means to be happy and your journeys to become the best men you can be. They are upbeat but calm at the same time. Did that change evolve organically or was that a conscious choice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0v3an?context=5)|The music always happens to us.  i wish we could say that we always had a grand plan when we start a record, but we're normally sorting out our lives while we're writing.  we honestly don't normally know what kind of record we've made until it's done.  thanks for the question.

[A couple of technical questions (I'm a gear head\): - Do yall get to crank your amps on stage or do you have to keep the volume pretty low? - I've seen yall using in-ears before, but I see Bear &amp; Bo with them out all the time... do you have your wedges running pretty hot and most use those, are are yall running click and stuff through in-ears?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0vaaa?context=5)|I like it loud. The natural breakup of the amp cannot be duplicated by any pedal. however, if the venue is not suited to compensate for our outrageous stage volume :) we adjust and do our best with pedals. We use Tyler amps and they are amazing at reaching the ideal tone and texture without being overbearing volume wise. The rest of the guys all use in ears but we take them out from time to time to get reacclimatized with the audience. I do not use ears anymore, and I am in heaven! you can't beat live music pushing thru the air.

[ I would like to say: huge fan! I first heard you on the P.S. I Love You soundtrack, and I've been hooked ever since! Your new album is amazing!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0vmqo?context=5)|The lyrics to this record, like most the records have always been about what we're going through. On ""More Time"", the song you first heard, we felt lots of pressure to fulfill the promises we had made to our families about making it in the music industry. (I kept telling them ""soon, I will stop borrowing money from you! :) .. but we were never an overnight success (now we realize that was a blessing in disguise).  These new songs are more about faith because for the first time in a long time, it's all we had because we didn't have each other. We felt alone or we missed home so we wrote about it. For all we knew, we were breaking up. Then, when the turn around happened, we wrote about that too. Faith was the biggest part of that turn around, so we just wrote about that as it happened. It wasn't really planned out.
[My first question is would you say your album Rivers in the Wasteland was more influenced by your faith than your previous albums? It seems to me more of the songs on this album are more openly faith-based than many of your previous albums. If so, what made you choose to go that direction this time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27hkjn/we_are_the_band_needtobreathe_ask_us_anything/ci0vmqo?context=5)|Yes.

My university, CUNY, runs something called CISDD which sets computer science students in CUNY up with programming/IT-related internships in NYC government departments. I wasn't expecting much, but last week I got an e-mail to come in for an interview. 

The job is a C# software development internship. I've had experience with .NET and so on, so they asked to meet with me today. I wasn't really prepared (I figured they were gonna ask me programming related questions), but I forgot interviewers often ask logic questions, so I spent what time I had going over C#, the concepts of OOP, algorithms, and other programming details instead of the logic questions that I heard about.

After the initial meeting, asking about my experience and programming knowledge, one of the three interviewers asked why manhole covers are round. I hate myself now because I see that it's one of the most common questions asked, but as I said, I had never really prepared myself for an interview as I was never expecting one, so I never bothered to look into these questions. I still feel stupid for not knowing the answer. Initially I said ""because if it was square it would fall through,"" but I now know it wasn't really a proper answer. He pushed on, trying to get me to say more, to break the problem down. My mind was racing, trying to put the pieces together. I was thinking a lot on it, but he wanted me to verbalize it, but I was so busy thinking and when my lines of thought kept leading to dead ends, my brain just kind of shut down. It was made worse by the fact that all three were waiting in silence, watching me, and that only made me stumble and freeze up. I was very embarrassed by it, but fortunately he said let's move on and gave me a sheet of paper with more logic questions on it. He said to answer three out of the six provided, so I did so. Took me about five minutes, but he didn't let me know if I got them right; I believe I did, they were designed to be trick questions, but I'm still dwelling on the manhole cover question. Figure I blew my chance there.

So I guess my question is what do the interviewers think of me now that I completely screwed up the manhole question? Are my chances out the door?

I recently got an internship at a large tech company. It was pretty much a dream job, and I'd spoken to my future boss beforehand about my project. There were a few organization snafus when I first showed up, but now I'm working with my boss. I'm also working with another intern that I interviewed with many months ago.

My fellow intern was here a week before I was and so has a bit of a head start.  Although our boss has implied that he sees us both working here long-term, it seems that my coworker (intern) and I are in some sort of competition. However, it's not that our boss/team is pitting us against one another. It's some sort of interpersonal conflict I can't figure out. 

When I came here, I expected to be putting in more than forty hours a week, but my coworker stays until 9 or 10 PM (or even later) working on portions of our project. He wants to work on weekends and every moment possible. He also seems to be vying to be the person doing all the work. I work on group projects by splitting the work and then meeting up, combining it and reviewing it. He wants to work on everything together/concurrently, which means that I'm staying at work with him, or driving back to work at odd hours because ""he just decided to tidy a few things up"" and reworked large parts of our survey, etc. 

In addition, he wants to spec out/implement more than one improvement to our product (Our project is to only spec out one improvement as far as I can tell). Our first spec is due next Friday, and he wants to iterate on that one, and get a first draft of the second one done this weekend. I'm not sure if we're going above and beyond, or just killing ourselves here. 

I'm worried that keeping up such a schedule/work pace is going to lead to some serious burn out on my end and somehow cost me my offer. I came here to work hard as well as to explore the area and get to know my fellow interns. I don't like this perceived 

Is this how the tech industry is? Maybe I'm not cut out for it. Any advice is appreciated.

27i5r7,19,2014-06-06,My Graduation Story! (Its long),Buttfacenugget,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/27i5r7/my_graduation_story_its_long/,"Here it goes!

I went into the hospital last Thursday night to start the cervidil with hopes that my cervix would open up during the night and I would start pitocin Friday morning pretty early...The cervidil didnt hurt going in other than just being uncomfortable having a doctor shoving something up there really high. I did not sleep well that night and chose not to take any sleep medications. I don't regret this decision because I was still able to function the next day and had been used to getting bad sleep to begin with... (Not to mention I am EXTREMELY sensitive to meds and I knew I would still be in a haze into the next day). 

Friday morning: I took out the cervidil (It pulls out just like a tampon). The dr wanted to immediately break my water which I wasnt really okay with considering I was still only 1.5 centimeters. I wanted to give my body a little bit of time to do its thing first... He ended up coming in an hour later and breaking it. IMMEDIATELY the contractions were painful. I had been having consistent contractions for several weeks up to this point. 
Holy crap, I had a LOT of fluid. It was ridiculous. It just kept pouring out. Every contraction made it spew out even more. lol. My SO was replacing towel after towel from under me. It didn't stop for a long time. I had an ultrasound tech tell me at my growth scan that there was a lot of fluid, and she was right. but SO was a great sport and was knee deep in fluid. Bless him. 
To make a long story short I labored on pitocin for over seven hours. pitocin is not a joke. I asked for an epidural when I couldn't breathe at all during contractions... Getting the epidural waant super pleasant but wasnt the worst and I was a different person afterwards. I dilated to a 4 pretty quick. (probably because I was able to relax). I didnt push the pump because I wanted to be able to move my legs. The epidural was pretty great even though I hadnt initially wanted one. I just couldnt labor on pit any longer. 

So, I wasnt progressing anymore. I stayed at a 5.5 for four hours. My water was going on 12 hours of being broken. My heart rate was going up to 150 and baby was not tolerating the pit anymore so they backed it down from a 28 to a 10. His heart rate stabilized but would occasionally get wonky again. Nothing that happened was an emergency situation but I started getting a fever that was gradually rising and with my heart rate and babies heart rate the doctor decided a csection was the best bet. Everything from here happened really fast. Obviously I was anxious but for the past two hours I had been feeling like this was going to happen and had talked with my nurse (who was a complete DOLL) about everything in detail so I was not in the dark about it at all. I hadnt really read up much about csections because I didnt think I would need one. I knew a bit from knowing others who had them but not enough to feel comfortable about the process. 

Having a csection is really weird guys. I felt like i was being abducted by aliens. I had the shakes from the epidural but it wasnt extreme. As soon as I was in the OR and started getting pumped with drugs the shakes became SO BAD. There was a lovely lady up by my head who was telling me that it was completely normal reaction from the meds and that there was nothing I could do about it and to just let it happen. It was really irritating. My heart rate was climbing I could hear it beeping on the machine.. 180. WOW. They were pumping beta blockers into me. SO was behind me so I couldnt really see him. Turns out he was really really anxious and feeling sick so that would explain his lack of a presence.lol. It felt really strange. All the tugging and pressure and then BAM those sweet baby cries.. and of course I start bawling... it was amazing. Its such a cocktail of feelings. I was so happy that the surgery was almost over, I was so happy that the baby was HERE and he was CRYING and it was so cute. I could see him really from where I was...SO was able to take pictures and watch while they weighed him and got his length. The scale in the OR said he weighed 6lbs 12 oz... I was like.. Uh i dont think thats right... We had been told for months that he was going to be a big baby measuring over full term at 35 weeks. 

After I was wheeled into recovery SO and baby went to get his first bath in the nursery. Their scale said he was 8lb 1oz. That is his correct birthweight.. What the hell OR SCALE!!! GET CALIBRATED- SHIT! 

Basically he is perfect. 8 lbs 1oz, 20 3/4 inches, born at 40 weeks 2 days on May 30th at 10:29 pm. 

Recovery: 
Recovering from a csection SUCKS. Im not going to sugar coat it or try to act like it doesnt, because it did. I am one week post partum and today has been the first real day that I've felt close to normal. Getting up out of bed to go to the bathroom after surgery is literally the WORST. It does get easier each time you get up but it is sooo slow moving and the pain is pretty intense. I had one hot spot on the right side of my incision that was really painful the whole time. I am glad that it was not my entire incision. It was hard getting in and out of bed and getting up to get my baby was pretty much out of the question. The first night was extra scary. I was still numb from surgery and the baby started spewing amniotic fluid and choking on it. I was watching from the hospital bed at him in the little bassinet FREAKING OUT. SO jumped up, I screaming- ROLL HIM OVER ROLL HIM OVER AHHHHH and hitting the nurse button... Obviously, I overreacted but Holy crap. lol.

Discharge day is also crazy. there are a million people running in and out of the room asking questions, finalizing paper work BLAH BLAH. Im getting my masters in social work and a social work intern came in to talk with me about PPD. Which I appreciate that they do this but I just was not in the mood.

We were in the hospital until Monday afternoon. I was so terrified to come home because we live on the second floor and I could still barely get back and forth to the bathroom on my own but SO was getting pissy and I knew that we would get better rest at home so I sucked it up. 

 I had a BAD hormonal crash following the surgery (Which is normal) People need to talk about that more. The normalcy of being weepy and then how you get weepy again when your milk comes in... I was so upset in spurts. 

Breastfeeding. I WANT TO BREASTFEED SO BAD. Since everything else with the labor and delivery did not go as planned I was ready to master bf. nope. Baby has a tongue tie and other latch issues and my milk supply was low because of the section. I am pumping round the clock and feeding him mostly formula and whatever I get fro pumping. Saw a lactation consultant since we have been out of the hospital. She was incredibly helpful because at that time I was horribly engorged and already had clogged milk ducts (which is miserable). We got his tongue-tie clipped yesterday at the ENT and all should be well now. Im hoping to not have too many more problems and plan to start getting him latched on Monday after another meeting wtih the LC. 

One more random thing. Everyone tells you to take stool softeners and that the first poop is horrible etc... The weirdest part to me is that your muscles dont really work... or they are trying to get back into place..and you just have to let it happen (obviously unless you're horribly constipated). There is no ""pushing"" it out... The muscles just dont really work. Another weird thing I had was that my bladder felt like it was about to fall out. This strange kind of painful tugging sensation when it was almost empty. I read that this could be because the dr moves it around during the surgery and it has to find its place again.. either way, ugh. 

AND OBVIOUSLY PICTURES!!!!!

27iiov,23,2014-06-06,Slow post day. Here's some drama to entertain you.,[deleted],KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/27iiov/slow_post_day_heres_some_drama_to_entertain_you/,"I've posted before about the ongoing drama with our young chef.  Husband and I own a 60 seat wine bar/small plates restaurant.  Husband is the GM/sommelier.  I do background stuff (marketing/budget/HR), as I work in an office full time.  Wall of text warning, but hey, nobody else is posting today, so why not...

So, young chef's last day is tomorrow (Saturday), and the staff in our kitchen (about 8 or 9 people) is about to completely turn over, except one person.  

Young chef was pretty bitter that we're firing him, but still *somewhat* respectful because we gave him 30 days to find another job.  Many of you said that was a mistake, to give him any time at all, but it wasn't my choice, and that's that.  

We're now at the end of the 30 days.  

We had 4 excellent candidates apply, two of which are in-house.  We ended up hiring a chef that was formerly a sous at the fine dining restaurant my husband used to work at.  They worked together for 2 1/2 years, and are 100% on the same page, so we're really excited for him to start.

Our current sous decided she's leaving because she wasn't promoted to chef.  Honestly, she wasn't ready, doesn't have the experience in paperwork/management, and has been known to quickly throw others under the bus when she's in trouble.  So, we're cool with that.

We're promoting another female to sous.  She just graduated from culinary school, but has been working for us for 8 months while she's been in school.  I've talked to her professors, and she's their top student.  That's actually why we hired her in the first place.  She's super motivated, creative, and has a good demeanor.  She applied for the chef position, but admitted that she might not be totally ready (we agree), but wants to learn.  We gave her a nice increase in pay and benefits, and full time status.  While she has limited experience, she already works for us, and we trust her.

The rest of the kitchen staff is leaving for one reason or another.  One dishwasher is moving away.  Another dishwasher got a higher paying day job.  A young line cook is a fanboy of our young chef.  Another line cook is going into the military.  And, the other cook is our former young chef's cousin.  

The cousin is actually really good at what he does and is a cool guy.  We assumed he'd leave when we fired his cousin, the young chef.  At first he said he'd stay, but then we had our final pairing dinner worked by our young chef last night, and things kind of went sour.

The pairing dinner was also a fundraiser/restaurant buy out.  The non-profit putting on the fundraiser sold 15 more seats than they were supposed to, so there were 75 people total for a 5-course paired dinner.  We had to bring in extra tables and chairs.  Chaos in the BOH and FOH ensued.

All hands were on deck as the FOH tried to get plates and pairings out in sync, while at the same time, the BOH was trying to plate dishes like mad.  Our young chef completely came up with the menu in coordination with the non-profit.  Apparently, one of the dishes included a poached egg.  Our young chef assigned a paid intern to complete this task, and he fucked it up.  1/2 of the eggs were poached improperly.  Our chef didn't think this was a big issue, he'd just leave the poached eggs off half the dishes.  While trying to figure out what to do, the other 1/2 were sitting getting cold.  My husband was furious, because customers were complaining as some tables got the next course with their beverage pairing, while others just sat...and sat...and sat.  

Our young chef threw the paid intern under the bus, told my husband everything was his fault for overselling the 15 seats (which we had zero control over), and that he was glad he was leaving.  The cousin also stated that the whole thing was fucked up, and he decided at that point that he's quitting because he felt disrespected.

My husband has bigger fish to fry, so to say, with a lot of other stuff we have going on, so he was just ""whatever"" let's get through this dinner.

He talked to the cousin today, and he repeated that he's leaving because he doesn't feel appreciated for all the work they put into platting 375 dishes.  I think it's typical BOH vs. FOH ""who works more"" back and forth, but last night, I have to say everyone worked their butts off.  Coordinating a 5 course paired dinner for 75 people is not the norm for either FOH or BOH.  Everyone was sweating and in the weeds, but they pulled through.  

My hunch is this was the cousin's first real world experience in that type of situation (he just graduated), and takes things very personally.  Oh well.

We're super excited our new chef is starting soon, and to have some fresh perspectives.  He is nearly 20 years older that our young chef, and has been in the business since culinary school in the early 90's.  He's lived all over the place, worked in fine dining, casual, and hotels.  The bonus is that my husband already knows him.  I think he's a well rounded guy, so wish us luck!  Hopefully this will be the end of our drama.

I've just scheduled an interview for another internship at a law office and I don't want to become a lawyer, a paralegal, a judge or anything else. I don't want to work period. After I was laid off from my last job I took a look at my finances, decided I could afford to just, not try until my graduation in December and that's mostly what've I've done.

I actually dropped one of my classes two weeks into this quarter when I realized it wouldn't be a blow off class. My job searching has been haphazard, I don't have any real marketable skills and I don't really care to learn any in my free time. I've made a bare minimum of an effort to interact with people, I spend most of my time wasted.

I was a part of an athletic club on campus. I had joined the club in large part because I thought it would help me to give up drinking- instead I gave up on the club because I realized I'd rather be drunk than do well. I'd say I've averaged 4-5 nights a week for the last, I don't know 14 months. 

I'd drunk myself to sleep for the last two weeks or so.

I was only sober last night because I've come home for a week or two inbetween quarters.

I don't want to face reality. I haven't entirely driven away all of the few friends that I had, but I've driven away most of them and I've become distant with the few I do talk to occassionally. It hurts and I can't blame anyone but myself for it. 

Last Saturday I was invited to two events- a kegger for a club I used to be involved with and a club event by a person I used to hang out with Freshman year. 

I chose to stay in and get drunk by myself. There are so many opportunities out there. I live in a great city, I go to an amazing university with some really wonderful, friendly people and I feel like I'm barely getting by.

Things that I used to enjoy- running, hiking, reading- give me little pleasure anymore. I don't know. I don't want to die. I'm comfortable, its an easy life. I'm just, I don't know. Lazy, unambitious, I feel like I should turn my life around but its gotten too easy as is."

In approximately two weeks I'll be returning to NYC for my road test. My driving instructor says my testing site(outskirts of NYC) is particularly easy, and I should be ready to go by the test date. I have five hours of instruction in the days prior to my actual road test, but I am already comfortable behind the wheel. To summarize, I am confident that I will pass. 

Recently my uncle told me that driving instructors simply teach to you to pass the test, and that I won't learn to drive until I get behind the wheel myself. He suggests that I purchase an inexpensive car($3k, preferably less), and drive it around in this quiet suburban area(rhode island) before I get back to NYC, and deal with all the crazy people. I think it's a good idea and it should help me gain experience, and build up confidence, as well as getting me to and from work everyday without having to be dependent on someone else.  He also said that after a year of driving in the cheaper car, I should be comfortable getting a relatively nicer car after I graduate next year(job guaranteed). He also told me that I'd find cheaper, and better maintained cars here than I would in NYC. If I purchase a vehicle, I plan on using it to commute to school, and work when I get back.

Questions:

* Dealer, or private party?( both used of course)
* How do out of state vehicle purchases work?
* How does out of state vehicle registration work?
* What's a good first time car, for commuting/practicing? (I've personally been looking at the Honda Civic, and Ford Focus. 97-02 range)

On top of the school-based stuff I've scripted/written a few simulations, tiny little projects (nothing hugely substantial), did an internship at a government facility that revolved heavily if not totally around a few-hundred line python project, and have been teaching myself a lot of the more in-depth stuff that I didn't take as a class (the basics: more detailed algorithms, web-dev, etc).

I've been applying to various places for the last 2 months or so with not a single callback. Would this be primarily due to my degree? Am I at a *huge* disadvantage because I didn't go CS?"

I am also proficient in c++ and java. I have no engineering work experience, but was a strategist for an election campaign this year and have an investment analysis internship planned for this summer (don't have engineering contacts in my family, so this is what I took instead). I will likely join the space engineering team at my college.
Not sure what engineering major I will choose, but it will likely be either mechanical, computer, or engineering physics (cool, but worried about the practical value)."

* Maximum coverage of the hotel properties within Europe 
* Maximum no. of nights obtainable through the sign up bonus of the cc

Well here are some updates!

We spent all of yesterday working out the preproduction and basic scratch tracks (vocal, guitar, and some bass). Today was drum day. We did the first two songs for the new EP and Josh KILLED it (no surprise there)! We've really enjoyed our time so far with him and Mike and Chris (as well as the interns Harrison and Tyler). We are very excited to see what happens with the third song tomorrow! For now, here are some links to some instavids I took today!

I am a 2nd year software engineering student at Concordia University in Montreal. During the fall semester, I will be doing a CO-OP internship. I am currently doing interviews through my University CO-OP program. There are a lot of banking firms as well as engineering firms, all looking for software engineering interns so I figured that maybe some Bitcoin related companies might also be interested in hiring interns. 

For those interested, I guess this will be sort of an unofficial and informal cover letter:

TL;DR: I know Java. By the end of the summer, I'll have completed the classes ""Data structure and Algorithm"" and ""Web Programming"". I have good technical experience from the many extracurricular projects I took on. I am driven and passionate. Obsessed with Bitcoin.

I have been obsessed with Bitcoin since the first day I heard of it. It was way back in 2011, I believe, when MtGox crashed the price for the first time from 30$ to a couple cents. At that time, I already knew I had discovered something amazing. Today, I am now involved in creating my University's first crypto-currency related club. Our mandate is to ""educate Concordians about the power and potential of crypto-currencies and related technologies."" (off-topic: if anyone from Concordia University in Montreal is reading this and you want to get involve, hit me up!) This passion for Bitcoin allowed to develop a deep knowledge of the inner workings of the currency.

On the technical side, I have a strong knowledge of Java and object-oriented programming. This allows me be to be versatile as I can quickly pick up new programming languages and software development methodologies. I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. However, by the end of the summer I will have completed the course ""Web Programming"" which will sharpen my skills in this field. I will also have completed the course ""Data Structure and Algorithm"" which will further deepen my knowledge of software development.
In my spare time I enjoy working on extracurricular projects, such as the Bitcoin club mentioned earlier. I worked for fun on many engineering projects. The one I am most proud of is the multi-touch table I built with a friend which won many prizes. (shameless plug: http://thatguyisaweso.me/Table). I also direct and produce short movies, the most recent being ""The Swedish Rhapsody"" (another shameless plug: http://thatguyisaweso.me/Rhapsody)
Taking on so many projects taught me teamwork, autonomy, leadership, and perseverance.

I'm someone who is really passionate and driven.

For those of you who made it through this self-glorifying text: Thank you.

- I am available to work for a 4 month work term during the fall.
- I am open to relocation (but would like to discuss it first before committing to anything)



For those interested, here are the details an employer must meet for my CO-OP program (school's rules, not mine):

- Work term must be remunerated
- Opportunity to develop your technical or soft skills related to your field of study
- Work term duration between 12-17 weeks. The min. &amp; max. is determined by the employer and not designed for vacation time
- 35 hours/week minimum – Full Time Monday to Friday

27j16g,19,2014-06-07,"I'm 18 years old, not a parent, but my family just got in another full-on physical altercation due to my brother's digressing mental state. Long read but someone help me.",[deleted],Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/27j16g/im_18_years_old_not_a_parent_but_my_family_just/,"I've typed this all right now, right from the fight - my back is still bleeding. If you'll only like to hear about the hostility, read (FIGHT) below, but I provide backstory. I ramble on at times seemingly about irrelevant things, but only because I want to cover all bounds.

Is there is a better page to post this on someone tell me, this is sudden and I'm not sure where else to post this. I will likely cross post this as well. 

**This is not a joke. I am being completely serious.**

My brother is mentally ill (not in the obvious way, you'll have to observe his behavior over a few months to realize). He used to be a division I football athlete but failed in his endeavors to go to the NFL because of persistent injuries. That was his goal since 8th grade, and he has the ""my way or the highway mentality"". He dedicated most of his time and effort to becoming the best player possible and chance bit him in the ass. But following his (essentially life) failure, he's gotten into all this weird psychology non-sense - partly scientific but mostly nonsense, and has fully convinced himself he will become a famous musician within some (indeterminate to me) length of time. He said last summer after dropping FIVE FULL ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS and dropping from college, that he will be famous by the end of the summer. That was last summer, and he still isn't famous. It's absurd talking in such binary terms of ""famous"" and ""not famous"" but that's the only way he looks at it. He's delved into all sorts of online philosophies that have only strengthen his inner belief that he was somehow destined to become super rich and wealthy. 
An example of one of these is The Secret: The Law of Attraction. 

It's basically a train of thought that says the following:
1) Our minds are the filters through which we perceive the world. 
2) If we can control our minds, we can control our perception of the world
3) Therefore, if we can convince our minds that something must be true, it will project it to reality
4) From that follows all sorts of absurd claims, such as: If I really want to be rich and famous, all I have to do is think about it really really hard, and it will come true eventually. 

Those premises and conclusion have convinced hundreds of thousands into buying books and living their life a certain way. Needless to say, it is rubbish and nonsense. 

Anyway, as time has passed, and his fame has seen virtually no profession, he's become more and more hostile with my family, which is doing nothing more than convincing him that the path he's chosen is clearly wrong. He refuses to get a job, he think he's above ""desk jobs"" such as Engineers(my father is one), diplomats for the United Nations(my mother is one), and computer programmers(one of my aspirations). All he does is sit at home, burn away the money on the credit card my mother VOLUNTARILY gave him(my parens are acting off emotions), and play loud music he's produced. In addition to this, he believes in essentially every conspiracy in the book. 

Now before you conspiracists blabber, I KNOW NOT ALL OF THEM ARE FALSE. I understand some are true, but most are constructions of fear-mongerers, and dim-wits, such as Alex Jones to make money and prolong their periods of fame (Google metabunk for a thorough debunking of many aforementioned theories). 

He commonly tells my parents to fuck off, that ""they are depressed because they don't live the life they want"" -- which is absurd, for reasons I won't divulge into -- and that he possess some greater knowledge that regular human beings are unable to access. He denies any and all offers for help with acquiring a job, returning to school etc etc. This man (but really, boy), has completely convinced himself that he is the only one on this Earth that knows what is good for him.

FIGHT----- 

Anyhow tonight my parents and he got into an argument, that erupted into him telling my parents to both fuck off multiple times. That was the last straw for me, as I was sitting in my room willing myself to ignore the screams. I got up, went to his room where the lights were off and my parents were standing over him, trying to console him. Now, the last time this happened, a fight broke out between my brother and I, and I got a swollen jaw for a few days, so I knew what would happen if I turned the lights on again. 

I did this only to shake my parents out of inaction, because I want them to see what they're son has become. They've been sweeping this under the rug for two years now and I'm done with his presence burdening our ability to function as a family. 

 I did, he got up, and what occurred was a 20~ minute alteration between my entire family (brother, mother and dad), in which my brother repeatedly swung and hit me whilst my dad and mom was trying to hold him back. He's 20(I think) years-old, 6'1 210b of mostly muscle as he played college football, but I'm not afraid of him so I continued to engage him even as my dad struggled to control both of us. I got punched in the face many times, didn't swing back because I'm not interested in this brutish-back and forth, and my brother ended up throwing my mother to the floor(at which point I engaged him again), and nearly hit my father. My brother kept saying, ""Give me him(me), I'll break his face. I'll take his face off"" The same continued until my father managed to split us apart, before which I broke my brother's laptop purposely, and threw it towards the wall, which it had punctured. This was essentially the end of the altercation. 

My mom kept crying hysterically even as I tried to comfort her, telling her we must call the caps RIGHT NOW, NOT TOMORROW, NOW. But she insisted we wait the night and call tomorrow - though I'm sure tomorrow there will be another excuse to wait. My dad was similarly hesitant, refusing to call the cops even though he asked me to earlier during the altercation. 

Since, I've endured several blows to the face, my back is scratched and bleeding, and this presents a risk for me on Monday, during which time I'd hate for my internship boss to question my bruises on my first day of work. 

Anyhow, this what I'm telling you Reddit, because this exact story has happened about three times in the past year. My brother is brute, and failure repressing his pent up anger. And my parents have been too afraid to make a decision that we know will fundamentally change our family. Almost as if they're secretly wishing everything would be just ok in the morning. But it won't. I'm only 18 but I understand what tough love means. The decision that hurts the most can often times be the best decision. 

What should my parents do? What should I do? "

Occasionally, I will go to the gym near my house and finishes at 8.30 pm, have dinner but sleep at a later time. I really want to have a light dinner if I exercise but my mom would break the house screaming how ungrateful I am for not eating proper dinner (and she didn't even cook. smh). However, the next day, I'll be dead tired because of the lack of sleep.

 I definitely exercise on the weekends because I can't do it on weekdays but I don't feel it's enough. I do les mills classes especially body pump (lighter weight, more repetition) for one hour then do 45 min of cardio ( les mills body combat,rpm, zumba or the treadmill for last resort).

I plan on doing insanity but that means i have to wake up at 4.30am every morning. My goal is to lose the weight I gained from my binge eating episodes. My eating is much much better, although not healthy as I wanted it to be because I'm living with my parents right now for internships. I still have very few binge eating episodes but not as crazy as it used to be and I already recognise back my feeling of satiety and fullness.

 So women of reddit, how do you squeeze in your workout when you work full-time? thanks for the answers

EDIT: Thanks, ladies for the many suggestions. I'll reply to you all tomorrow morning (It's 10:12 pm here).

EDIT 2: Wow, Ladies, thanks for the advices. Most of you suggest that I wake up early to exercise, I think I'm gonna try to do that. I have no gym near my office and biking/running back to home is definitely not an option since my home is far and the deadly pollution and the high crime rates just make it impossible to do so. I'm just working for internships and I will go back to the States after I finish but I'm graduating soon and I feel the need of having a game plan if I were to work in my country. The next option is to reason with my parents to be able to exercise late and eat a light dinner. Wish me luck ladies. I'm lucky to have the support of this subreddit! cheers!"
27jc7c,39,2014-06-07,Skeet Shooting [Real] (Part 1 - Setup),[deleted],gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/27jc7c/skeet_shooting_real_part_1_setup/,"Brian and I work for the same company. In fact, we had met as interns and both ended up working for the company where we interned, and he had always caught my eye. He was an athlete at his college, steel blue eyes, clean-cut, obviously muscular, with a perfect ass… a real all-American boy-next-door type. Imagine the most all-American guy you can think of, then imagine that same guy draped in an American flag with a bald eagle perched on his shoulder holding a copy of the Constitution in one hand and the Declaration of Independence in the other. That’s Brian.

I crushed on him hard when we were interns… who wouldn’t? He was very friendly and funny and outgoing, not to mention drop dead gorgeous, and we ended up developing a bit of a bromance. He knew I was gay, but he didn’t seem to care, even though he was quite conspicuously religious. I don’t think I’ve ever even heard him swear. Our little “arrangement” allowed me to work out some of my, uh… frustration… while as far as I could tell he remained none the wiser. He may have been the prettiest crayon in the box, but he wasn’t exactly the brightest.

It probably helps that I am pretty masculine and “pass” for straight… not that I consciously hide my sexuality, that’s just the way it is. I’m more of a beer and football kind of guy than a Cosmo and Broadway kind of guy.

In the gap between when we were interns and when we started our “real” positions (about 18 months), Brian got married. I actually didn’t know until we started, as we had fallen out of touch. I thought that might change our “relationship,” but it wasn’t long before I realized that Brian hadn’t changed a bit. He dressed quite a bit nicer, and generally took more care with his appearance (somehow) than before, but he was still the same old Brian.

Over the years, I was often baffled by the things he did, but always assumed I was reading more into it than what was there. One time he and I met before work to get bagels for the group of people we started with. When I got to the spot where we were to meet, I noticed the top 3 buttons on his shirt were unbuttoned, which for Brian was unusual. I could just make out a bit of chest hair and his firm pecs, and I remember staring and biting my lip. I took in as much of the sight of his bare chest as I could while I had the chance. When I looked up to his face, he had this smirk like he knew I had been checking him out. What was weird about it is that when we got to the office, he had buttoned his shirt back up.

*Had he done that for me?*

Another time, I snuck up on him at his desk and tapped the lever that raises and lowers the chair with my foot. He was startled, but he knew it was me (we did this to each other occasionally even when were interns), and he reached down and grabbed my leg. He actually slipped his hand under my pants leg and squeezed my calf for a few seconds, with the same smirk.

*Was he flirting with me?*

More of these little things happened here and there, but I eventually decided that he was just very friendly, and left it at that. We still goofed around, but it was more innocent from my side.

Over the last couple of years we began to talk about more serious things – politics and religion and all the things you’re not supposed to talk about with your coworkers. Brian is pretty conservative about a lot of things, but I’d say he’s more libertarian than anything. I’m a liberal atheist, so there is usually no shortage of things for us to disagree about, but we almost always find middle ground. I came to really respect his intellect in a way that I hadn’t before, and our friendship grew beyond just playful pranking.

About a month ago, we were talking about gun rights and gun issues. Brian hunts, and I have fired a gun precisely once in my life, about 15 years ago. We went back and forth, as usual, and eventually he suggested that I come to a shooting range with him sometime. 

“Sure, why not?” I said. “I guess it’d be better to do it with someone who has experience.”

“My thoughts exactly,” he said.

We decided on that Friday, and after work that day I drove over to his house. As long as we had known each other and as close as we had become, this was actually the first time we made plans to do anything outside of work, besides post-work happy hours. Obviously, this was also the first time either of us had been to the other’s home.

We both changed out of our office attire, he grabbed his pistols, and we hopped into his truck.

“Still time to back out, if you want,” he said.

“No way, I’m in. This will be fun.”

“Alright, let’s do this,” he said, flashing his perfect smile. I melted a bit, as I usually did.

We got to the range and grabbed some of those noise-blocking headphones and safety goggles, then we got to the booth. There were only a couple other people at the range, and the walls between booths were solid, so we had a bit of privacy at least. I didn't have to worry about looking silly in front of strangers.

“Do you want to go first, or should I?” he asked.

“You first. I want to watch the expert before I make a fool of myself,” I laughed.

“Your words, not mine.” He gave me a quick wink.

I stood back, and he fired off several quick rounds, nearly all of them hitting near the center of the target. I was thoroughly impressed. He turned to me and motioned for me to come up.

“Your turn.”

I was a bit hesitant, never having fired a pistol before. I didn't know how to hold it properly, or what stance to take. He gave me a quick rundown/demo, and reassured me. He stepped back, and I turned towards the target. I fired off 5 shots, with only one of them actually hitting the sheet at all, and it was wide of the target zone by a fair bit.

I turned to him, and he was just smiling and chuckling to himself. “Here,” he said, “let me show you.”

He walked up to me and said, “Stand like you were just standing, turn the safety on, take your finger off the trigger, and aim the gun, .” I did, and suddenly I felt the warmth of his body getting close to me. I was surprised… and incredibly turned on, but I tried to push those thoughts out of my head. He reached his hands around my shoulders, straightening them and lifting my arms up. Then he wrapped his arms around mine, placing his hands on mine and moving the pistol.

“There, try it like that,” he said.

By this point, my hands were shaking, and I know that he noticed. His face had suddenly gotten very serious. I turned back toward the target and fired a few more rounds, not doing much better than before. We took several more turns, with more of these rather intimate coaching sessions occurring in between… with him pulling in closer and closer to me each time.

Truth be told, I had a ton of fun, and by the end of it I had made a bit of progress. But, I was also rattled and confused by what had just happened.

*Was he coming onto me? Was I inventing things?*

The ride back to his house was thick with silent tension. I don’t think either of us said a word until he pulled into his garage. The first words were his… “Wanna come in for a drink?”

“Sure.”

I followed him in and took a seat on his sofa.

“Whiskey?” he asked.

“Yes, on the rocks.”

“Good man!”

He disappeared into the kitchen and returned with two Scotch glasses damn near full to the brim. It was too much for me since I had to drive back home, but I figured I could just sip and dump it when he wasn’t looking.

“When’s your wife gonna be home?” I asked.

“She’s actually gone for the weekend. Visiting her folks.”

We chatted for a bit, and before I knew it I had drained my glass. I was pretty tipsy, but before I could object, Brian had scooped up my glass and refilled it. He sat a bit closer to me on the sofa, brushing his leg against mine a couple of times and generally being more “touchy”… pushing me playfully, even reaching to tickle me once. After a little while of this, emboldened by the liquor, I started to ask, “Brian… are you trying to…”

“Hold that thought,” he said. He looked almost panicked. “I gotta run to the restroom.”

I sat there for about 5 minutes, going back and forth about what was happening, before I realized he had not come back yet. I got up and walked down the hall to the bathroom, lightly knocking.

“Dude, you taking a shit or what?”

“Just a second, be right out.”

The door eased open, and he stood in front of me with a daring look in his eyes. He took a few steps out, and I turned to walk back to the living room, until I felt his hand on my shoulder. I turned to face him, and before I knew it, he had pressed me against the wall.

“Dude, what are you doing?” I said, startled.

He didn’t say anything. He pressed his body against mine, our faces now just a couple of inches apart. I could feel his cock straining against his shorts, pressing against my stiffening cock. I let out a moan, and that’s all the affirmation he needed. He pressed his lips to mine, and soon we were locked in a deep kiss. I was in heaven, feeling his short beard brush against mine, but I suddenly got gun-shy and pulled away.

“What are you doing?? What’s happening??” I asked.

“Shhhhh. I know you want this, and so do I. Let’s just do this… please…”

Good enough for me.

Hannah looks nervous, as if she has more to worry about than the sociopathic man that almost killed her. Eric is using her shoulder as support, due to his broken leg. Arend, meanwhile, is holding Alexei at gunpoint to make sure he doesn’t try anything funny.*

*Stork looks up from his desk. He furrows his brows towards Arend.*

“Ah, I’ve been expecting you. Please, come in.” *Stork says*.

*The four walk into the office. The blinds have been pulled, and the room is darker than usual.*

“Corporal Klien, would you care to explain to me how you came across this man?”

*Stork looks at Alexei like a rodent that has been giving him a hard time for a while, now. His eyes show menace and unflinching resolve. Alexei, however, remains calm and stares Stork straight in the eye. Menace obviously doesn’t frighten him.*

*As the two stare down, Arend speaks up.*

“Yes sir. We have been conducting an investigation into the disappearance of the recently captured Titan. We learned that it was one of our own, unfortunately, but that this man was the one who put them up to it. His name is Alexei Tokarev, and he claims to be preparing for an event known as the Ascension.” 

“I see.”

*Stork replies next, not breaking eye contact with the man before him.*

“What do you have to say for yourself, Tokarev?”

*Alexei smiles, and Stork’s glare wavers. Alexei is not smiling with malice. He is smiling with a face of good nature. It was almost baffling. He looked entirely different from the man that had been captured.*

“I am but a humble scientist, and your *soldiers* are threatening me at gunpoint. I met that man in the barn by chance-”

“That’s a lie, he was belittling one of the soldiers for not doing the job right.” *Arend interrupts*

“That was merely a coincidence. He happened to be an intern of mine, and-” *Alexei counters*

“You just said you happened upon him by chance! Now you’re already changing your story. Give up-”

“I prefer not being interrupted, *boy*.”

*Stork buts in.*

“And I prefer not being lied to, *doctor*. Now, please, tell us the truth.” 

…..

“Very well. My name is Alexei Tokarev, and I am a scientist who researches the properties of Titans and Titan Shifters. I am preparing for an event known as The Ascension which, by my value only, is far too important to be explaining to some insolent amateurs like yourselves. Stare at me all you want, Stork, but I will never reveal it under these conditions.”

“What do you mean “these conditions”?”

“I mean, in the vicinity of these mere children…”

“I am no mere child, and you should be locked away for your crimes.” *Arend objects.*

“I told you not to interrupt."" *Alexei objects.* ""Stork, I am willing to strike a deal with you, and I’d rather talk privately, if you agree to it.”

“Stop trying to bribe him.” *Eric manages to say.* “Stork isn’t stupid enough to actually strike a deal with some kind of sociopathic mad scientist. I’d recommend just giving up.”

“Private Thomas, please refrain from speaking for now. In fact, why don’t you, Private Stark and Corporal Klien go wait outside for a bit? I’m sure standing is doing you no favours with that leg of yours.” *Stork suggests.*

“What!?” *Arend replies in shock.* “Sir, you can’t be serious-”

“I said OUT!”

“SIR! With all due respect I cannot obey that order, this man is a dangerous criminal, he’ll do and say anything to get his way.”

 “Do not question me again, you may be a favorite of the supreme commander but he’s not here right now.”

*Arend replies begrudgingly,* “Yes sir.”

*The three soldiers go silent, and slowly leave the room.*

….


*As soon as the Corporal and the Privates have left the room, Stork gets up from behind his desk and takes a step towards Tokarev. He offers his hand and Tokarev shakes it. Then Stork offers him a seat.*

“A deal you said? I have to say that I am not repelled by that idea. I… see the benefits in that.”

*Tokarev smirks.*

“I knew that I was conversing with a great mind. One does not achieve the rank of Commander for nothing.”

*Stork goes to a cabinet and takes out a bottle of Scotch and two glasses which he pours the alcohol into, before pushing it towards Tokarev. He sips on his glass and leans back in his chair.*

“I got to say… I could live like that. It’s no comparison to my usual abode.” *Tokarev fantasizes.*

“I can imagine… Now, what exactly do you have in mind for that deal?”

*Tokarev tips against his nose with his free hand.*

“Ah, straight to the point. I like that!”

*He leans forward.*

“Do you want to live? Because that is my part of the deal…”

*Stork furrows his brows.*

“Are you threatening me? It seems I made the wrong decision to hear you out…”

“Not at all! I’m offering to save you! Actually I offer to save humanity. We are both intelligent men… humanity doesn’t stand a chance against the titans and even less against these *shifters*...”

*Stork lips form a straight line, as Tokarev continues.*

“You see… everyone heard of Stohess and these two shifters battling it out. They are afraid… they think that the military and the King are keeping important secrets from them. And they are right, are they not? What are you doing with that girl in the crystal?”

*Angrily Stork puts his glass on his desk.*

“That’s none of your business! How do you even know about that?!?”

*Alexei smiles smugly.*

“I have my sources… however, you didn’t answer my question… do you know what enabled her to do these things?”

*Stork evades Alexei’s eyes and doesn’t answer.*

“I didn’t think so… The crystal around her is too hard, right? You are not able to get to her body. What if I told you that the shifter that she fought, the one that escaped, was a creation of mine?”

*A mortified look appears on Stork’s face and he gulps.*

“What?”

“Do I speak the wrong language? He is my creation! And I long to have him back! He escaped, but after Karanese I know that he is part of the Military now! Benedikt Kohley is his name, but I doubt that he goes by that one nowadays.”

*Tokarev sighs and shakes his head.*

“The design was perfect… mighty, strong, savage. His mind couldn’t keep up with it. First he started forgetting things. Then he forgot who he was for several days after transforming. In the end I couldn’t constrain him and was forced to let him loose. I didn’t hear anything from him for a few years and suddenly he appears in Stohess…”

*Stork’s eyes have gotten bigger with every sentence.*

“Wait! I can’t follow you! Do you want to say that this ‘Beast Titan’ is in fact artificial?”

*Alexei seems to get angry upon being interrupted.*

“What do you think I am researching? Of course he is! I gave him his powers! He was the first functional shifter I created and the only one that didn’t kill himself or evaporate! He’s been my master piece up until this day!”

*He seems to realize that he is losing Stork and decides to get to the point.*

“Listen, I offer you this: With my research I can give you power. I can enhance your body and mind. I can prepare humanity for the fight against the titans. I can give the MP everything to save humanity or even… oppose the king. I’ll even make *you* king.”

*At Tokarev’s last words Stork leans in. His eyes are gleaming.*

“What do you want in return?”

“Oh, not much. A proper lab. A place where I can experiment. Also, test subjects! Many. You should have enough men, right?”

*Initially Stork looks disgusted, but the thought of him becoming king overpowers his mind.*

“We have spare room underneath the military complex. You can have that dungeon… I can’t offer you my men though. Not until your procedures are refined. It would be too suspicious… Also I want to have reports from you about everything you do.”

“We have a deal then. Just give me some men to pick people of the streets. Just the homeless and orphans. Thugs that nobody will miss when they are gone.”

*Tokarev chugs down the rest of his drink and stands up.*

“It was a pleasure to converse with you, commander. I can see a bright future for you…”
*Stork gets up and leads Tokarev to the door.*

“Stay at the complex, I will make the arrangements as fast as possible and you can request everything you need from my immediate subordinates.”

***

*Tokarev walks out the door, smiling. Corporal Klien and Privates Thomas and Stark had been waiting in front of the door, but had not been able to eavesdrop enough. He winks at them, as he walks past them as a free man.*

*Hannah gives him a disgusted look and turns toward Stork to protest, but the door is already closed before she can mutter out the first word.*

27k2xi,11,2014-06-07,EE - Distribution power flow crash course?,WonderJouster,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/27k2xi/ee_distribution_power_flow_crash_course/,"Picked up an internship this summer, but it's about 2 semesters beyond my experience. They're asking me to help quantify or validate the quality of power flow calculations made for their distribution network. I haven't had a power systems course, only basic circuit analysis (through AC circuits).

What I **think** I need is a crash course in power flow analysis. However, I don't know how useful that is going to be as the product they're using to make these calculations hasn't openly shared their algorithms, much less give me any ability to adjust them.

Right now, I'm validating calculations based on additional readings special equipment downstream from the substation breaker. So the system estimates values for my downstream equip and I compare them to the values reported. Ultimately, they want to quantify the quality of calculations made down to the transformer based solely on readings from those substation breakers. The special equipment I'm validating against (IE smart switches) is present on &lt;10% of the system.

So... help?

Thanks.

For anyone interested, I found [this](http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-61697-14555/unrestricted/Ch2.pdf) interesting short article regarding two techniques for power distribution analysis."
27k51f,1,2014-06-07,Obtaining Masters Degree in France,avizzv92,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/27k51f/obtaining_masters_degree_in_france/,"I recently graduated from my University with a B.S. in Computer Science. At this point I am now giving honest thought to continuing my education and going for my Masters degree in the future, as a way to move to France. I had the wonderful opportunity to live in southwest France for two 4 month stays and both times that I left, I felt myself wanting to find anyway possible to go back. I realize at this point in my life, with limited applicable job experience, I would be a tough sell in a country that has high unemployment, even with a pretty good degree.  

Having researched different options for finding employment in France, it seems the most promising route for me personally would be going for a Masters degree at a University in France. Since I only have an intermediate level of French, I would be looking for programs taught in English. I looked at http://www.campusfrance.org I saw that there are a number of Universities that offer a variety of Master programs for Computer Science taught in English. 

My plan would be to work for a couple years, saving up money. I'm fortunate enough to only have about $10k in student loans that need to be paid off. Once I have saved enough money to make such a endeavor feasible, I’ve made rough estimates of about $20k, I would then begin looking and applying for different opportunities. 

So, If I went to France for a masters program, what would be the odds of being able to get a job once I obtain the degree? During those 1-2 years I imagine that I would be building networks and connections through internships and such. Also, I imagine that I will also have a strong grasp of the language. I realize other countries such as Germany might be more promising in terms of costs and opportunities (should I be considering Germany more so?), I'm not against looking at education options there. I'm just leaning towards France since I truly enjoyed the time I spent there and I have some foundation in the language (and regardless my ultimate goal is moving there). "

I'm back again! I'm going to try to do better about putting out at least one of these a day, but I'm in the middle of starting a new job, so it may get a little dicey. Anyway, you're here for stories, not excuses:

**The Cast**

&gt; * CogitaVeritas [That's me!] - still 27 years old, still a doormat, and still visiting Bee in my old hometown.

&gt; * Bee – our 23 year old villain. A tiny red-headed firecracker, and for today's literary comparison I'll declare her to be the female Lord Rust from Discworld. Entitled, overbearing, and unwilling to work for her living.

&gt; * PoodleMan – Bee's boss at the law firm for which she “works.” Somewhere around sixty years old, this man is her “father figure” that often helps her at work and at home. He is married and has an estranged daughter.

&gt; * Esme – one of my best friends, I had previously dated her, ending about six years before this story. She shares my interests in books, television, and board games.

&gt; * CraftyDancer – a mutual friend of Bee's and mine, she is the one that introduced Bee to our circle of friends. Very artistic and an amazing dancer.

When last we saw our naïve hero, he was settling down for a week of living and working in the local garbage dump, also known as Bee's apartment. I was a little bit anxious about staying there alone, because Bee had told me horrible things about her roommate, which I won't even dignify by writing here. Needless to say, her roommate was a nice, fun person that did not deserve any of the slander leveled at her.

This rather uneventful week continued until Thursday evening and Friday morning. On Thursday night, Bee and I decided to go out for dinner at a pretty fancy place, and to treat it like an actual date. We were going to dress up nicely, the whole works. I, being male and unable to understand the nuances of fashion, was ready in about ten minutes. Bee was taking a lot longer, and not just because of her makeup, hair, and whatever. She was in the middle of a text messaging conversation so engrossing, even the dog peeing on the floor by her foot couldn't tear her eyes away from it. When I asked her who she was talking to, she informed me that it was PoodleMan, and he was just showing her some nice pictures of his poodle. No, that's not a euphemism. This man was obsessive over his dog.

Now, a little bit of a backstory: this man buys her a lot of things. He bought her and her mother a cruise vacation. He buys her food and alcohol. He has bought clothing for her. When she got into weaving, he bought her TWO expensive looms. His most recent purchases for her were an iPad... and Brutus. Yes, Brutus was a gift to Bee by her boss, who happens to text her often.

On the ride to the restaurant, she's still engrossed in her phone. She's carrying on a conversation with me, but it stutters whenever a new text is sent. I comment on the fact that it's a little weird that her boss texts her this often, and she tells me that it's normal, that most of her bosses and friend's bosses have been this way. Okay, I suppose... I personally try to separate my work life and my personal life, so maybe I just don't understand the way it is done normally. It gets so bad, though, that I tell her that since it's a date we should leave our phones in the glove box of my car. She protests, but eventually gives in.

The rest of the evening goes well, and the food was delicious. I quite enjoyed myself, and didn't even mind it terribly when it was time to get into the softer pile of garbage she called her bed.

I had gotten into a routine of waking up and taking the dog out before showering and sitting down to work. I am one of those people that are literal zombies until I have my morning shower, and I am barely capable of remembering my own name until then. So I get up, throw on some clothes, grab the dog, and grab my phone. This particular day, though, I swipe my phone to put in my password... and there's no password. Oh, shit. I'd grabbed Bee's phone instead. And it had opened into the middle of a text conversation with PoodleMan. I should have closed it then and not said anything, but:

&gt;PoodleMan: I wish you'd slept here last night instead.

Oh. Uh. What? This... this was her boss, right? Was her boss hitting on her? I mean, she didn't answer, so she was probably trying to figure out the best way to deal with this. In her line of work, her boss would always be believed over her, and it could cost her the ability to ever get a job in the city in that line of work again if she pisses him off. So I do something stupid, and I scroll up.

&gt;Bee: I'm just worried about some of the work they gave me today. I may take an early lunch to calm down.

&gt;PoodleMan: You can always come into my office and sit on my lap until you feel better!

&gt;Bee: Haha, that may work.

Oh God, she's sleeping with her boss. I don't even... I can't even... So I scroll up some more.

&gt;Poodleman: I think a lot of people are just jealous that I've got such a pretty 23 year old girlfriend to buy presents for. ;)

&gt;Bee: Haha, and she's lucky to have a guy like you that likes to spoil her!

I'm now sick. The dog has done his business, and I go back inside. I put her phone back on the night stand next to mine, and sit on the bed. I try to lay back down and sleep a little. Surely I misread or something. I mean, he's sixty. My inability to calm down, though, inevitably woke up Bee. I try to have polite conversation, but I'm obviously not doing well.

&gt;Bee: What's wrong? You're acting funny.

&gt;Cogita: So, you know how I normally take my phone with me to walk the dog? And I browse through Reddit or whatever? Well... I accidentally took your phone. And when it opened, I saw the texts from PoodleMan. They, uh.... they were pretty flirty.

&gt;Bee: What?! You looked through my phone? What the hell is wrong with you?!

[And here I will skip through me convincing her that I really didn't mean to, but that we still needed to talk about the messages.]

&gt;Bee: He's just like that. He's an old man, he sometimes flirts inappropriately. But he'd never try anything and I wouldn't either. He's like my dad, that's just gross! And the 23 year old is not me, it's an intern in another department. It's creepy, but I guess she likes him so why not?

I'd like to say that I wasn't taken in by all of this. I'd like to say that I was smarter than that. I'd like to, but I can't. Besides, if I was, this whole story would be over now. And it's not. It's not even really kicking in to high gear yet.

So, feeling a little disconcerted by these text messages, I try to continue on with the rest of the visit. But no, we're going to have another issue... that very night! See, Esme had recently become obsessed with Settlers of Catan, and she had invited Bee, myself, and CraftyDancer over for a game that evening. Unfortunately, Bee decided that she needed to work an additional couple of hours that night, and wouldn't be able to make it at a reasonable time. She then told me that it was sad I would have to miss the game night to sit at home waiting for her, but that it wasn't appropriate for me to be at Esme's house now that we were dating.

In a rare moment of not-being-a-doormat, I told her that I was going to go over there, because I hadn't seen any of them during this trip yet. She was of course welcome to come by and hangout after she got off of work, though. And so I went over to Esme's and told them that Bee would not be coming. It turned out to be okay, because CraftyDancer invited her boyfriend over and he played instead. It was a fun night, marred only by the constant texting from Bee. Finally, I told her that I couldn't keep texting like this, but a few every now and then would be okay. She instead shut down completely and told me that she would see me when I got home.

Well, that can't be good. Everyone at the table is pretty aware of what's going on, and that just makes it even more awkward for me. So I put on my game face, play it off, and we finish the night of board games, drinking, and merriment. It was nice. After the night was over, I apologized for my rudeness to Esme and CraftyDancer, and finally left to walk back to Bee's. Her apartment complex was literally across the street from Esme's, so it was a nice and easy walk. Plus, I'd been drinking, so driving was frowned upon by my inner conscious.

I made it back to Bee's, and found all of the lights off. She was asleep, with Brutus curled on the floor between the bed and a pile of his own solid waste, kind of like the world's most disgusting teddy bear. I quietly get ready for bed, and as I'm settling myself in, she speaks.

&gt;Bee: You were there a long time. Did you fuck Esme?

&gt;Cogita: Uh... Catan takes a long time to finish, and I absolutely did not sleep with Esme. We've gone over this, neither of us is even remotely interested in the other anymore.

&gt;Bee: You were at your ex-girlfriend's, probably alone. You smell like you've been drinking, and you didn't kiss me when you got into bed. You fucked Esme, and then you have the nerve to try to get in bed with me. You're an asshole.

This continues for about fifteen minutes, before Bee finally apologizes for “being a jealous, paranoid girlfriend.” She explains that she doesn't want to be like this, but it was just so hard for her to think about the two of us having fun together. So difficult, that she ended up having to go out for drinks with people from work. Her boss paid, because she was so distraught.

Right. I'm tired and a little tipsy, I don't even want to deal with that. I went to bed, and went home two days later. Still dating her.

27kf6o,313,2014-06-07,Why Golf is the Best Sport,ar3dson,golf,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/27kf6o/why_golf_is_the_best_sport/,"I am 3 weeks into an internship with a large company that has multiple divisions and thousands of employees.  At an internship kickoff meeting, one of the company's Vice Presidents, Andrew, was in attendance to give a welcome speech.  During the speech, he mentioned that he was a golfer.  After the speech, I went up to him to introduce myself and, in a moment of boldness, I asked if he would ever want to play a round of golf (I'm new to the area so I have been going around to all of the courses and finding people to play with).

Amazingly, he said that he would like to play with me.  Me, one of 50 new interns for a large company with thousands of employees was going to play a round of golf with one of the Vice Presidents of the company.  I couldn't believe it.  He even got my number to call me and confirm our tee time the next day at work.  

The day arrives, we meet up at the course (one that I had not played yet, but he was very familiar with), and it is a wonderful course: well kept, beautiful views, and appropriately challenging for a mountain course.  It was also a perfect day (80 degrees, clear skies, slight breeze) where I could have been playing any sport, but I didn't want to be anywhere other than on the course.  Without warming up, we get called up to the first tee.  We get paired with a father-son twosome (the father being in his 70's, son in his 40's).  Side note: the father had clubs older than his son.  Wooden woods, basic metal putter with all of the markings faded away.  It was awesome to see someone like that on the course.

Back to the story.  Andrew and I play from the tips (he is a 2-3 handicap, I am 10-13).  He strikes his ball perfectly down the middle on the par 5.  I fade my ball down a hill and into the woods.  Lost ball.  ""Shit!"" I think. ""Andrew is gonna think I lied about my handicap.""  Nope.  He just says ""Well struck, unlucky result"" and we move on.  I take a drop from where it went out and proceed to crush my hybrid to just short of the green and I'm back on my game.  

It was a slow day on the course, so we had plenty of time to chat.  We talk about everything from family (his oldest son is a couple years younger than me), to his career and growth through the company, to things to do in the area because I am new to the area. He tells me of all the places he's travelled for work, courses he's played, best rounds he's shot (63!), and more.  Best of all, he gives me advice for making it far in the company (or any company really) and making the most of my internship.  I ask him if I could spend a week or two in his facility and he tells me of a program that they are restarting and will be needing some more Industrial Engineers on the job.  Sweet, I'm in.  

End of the round comes.  Andrew shot a 72 on a par 71, ending with an eagle on the short par 5 #18.  I shot an 84.  He asks me if I am in a hurry or if I wanted a beer.  Of course I'm not turning down the opportunity to have a beer with a VP after such an enjoyable round!  We head up to the clubhouse and split a pitcher and continue our conversations.  We kill the pitcher, and Andrew has to leave.  Before he leaves he invites me to play with him on his next, weekly, Sunday morning round. I guess I made a good impression?  I say yes (of course), we shake hands, and he leaves.  I stay on the patio overlooking the 18th green, almost not believing everything that had happened that day.  

In no other sport could I have gotten that level of quality time with someone who was clearly a lot more skilled than me, while also enjoying a great day and even meeting new people.  It wasn't my best day, but it didn't matter.  The experience was unbeatable.  

TL;DR: Golf gave me 5 hours of quality time with a Vice President of the company that I am an intern for.  I love this sport!"

Personal projects, grad school, internships?",progasian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27kf8e/what_should_i_do_as_a_foreigner_in_a_small/,"I have about a year left before I graduate from a university in a small Asian country (as in not Japan, China, Russia, India, South Korea, etc), and my goal is to work in the US. One of my parents is American so I don't have any problems with visas or language. What should I focus on to maximize my chances of getting a job in the US with a decent salary? 

I've heard that most foreigners go to the US for a masters and then look for work, but I'm not sure if that's the best choice. I want to be as productive as possible, as I don't really have anything that makes me stand out from the crowd other than winning some small programming contests, but I highly doubt anyone cares about those. I'm also competing in some major contests but my chances of winning are close to zero since my team isn't as well prepared.

If I work on personal projects, would it be better to work on one really big one, or three smaller ones? I love algorithms so I was thinking of making some sort of algorithm visualization tool/game but it would definitely take me the whole year to get something nice done. What kind of projects would really impress a recruiter from a good company? I'm very confident in my CS abilities, both theoretical and practical, and I think the most difficult part for me would be getting the interview and not the interview itself.

I could also try to get some internships, but I'm not sure if I could actually get any, and since I don't have much free time, they would have to be very short and with unknown companies. I could also work for my university, but I think that won't look as good.

Another choice is to try to get into a decent university in the US for my masters. The problem is that since I don't have any research experience and my gpa is around a 3.3 (I'm actually at the top 5% in CS, anything above a 3.5 is nearly impossible), I might not be accepted anywhere decent. Also, it would cost me a LOT of money, and in the end I simply want to get into the private sector so if I could skip this and simply start working, I think it would save me a lot of money unless the degree boosts my long-term earnings by a lot. If I go this route, I would need to look into research opportunities asap, and I wouldn't have time for much else. 

I would greatly appreciate any advice, should I do something else? Or what is my best option?"

I don't have a drawing on paper of what it is REALLY going to look like at the end. My  biggest question is, will I regret this?  There is a stigma to people with tattoos, and although mine can be covered up, will I start applying those stigmas to me and thinking less of myself?

27kfdp,7,2014-06-07,Career advice for bioengineering Undergrad,horeycowe,Synthetic_Biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Synthetic_Biology/comments/27kfdp/career_advice_for_bioengineering_undergrad/,"Hi, I have also made this post in the biotech subreddit, but I thought people here might have some experience to share as well, however this subreddit is fairly inactive. 

I was hoping to get some insight into the biotech industry, so I can better make my decision about my future. I would like to know what kind of degree will be required to do research in biotech. I will graduate from college in May 2015 with a Bioengineering degree. My main interest is to conduct research in synthetic biology and exciting new biotechnologies. I have worked on several research projects throughout college, working in genetics labs, 2 summers of the iGEM competition, and I am currently doing an internship with a biotech company this summer. 

My original plan was to get a PhD and be able to design my own experiments and guide the direction of my research projects. However more recently I have felt that I would rather just start working and not do any schooling or money spending that is unnecessary (I have been finding that most of the real learning I have been doing has been outside of the classroom). The more management duties and less lab work doesn’t sound like something I want. This has made me look into the more independent biotech start up environment, and it seems like something I would really like to do, rather than working for a bigger corporate biotech company. I have also looked into the different biotech incubators that have been made recently (synbio axlr8r, biocurious) and could also see myself working/starting on a project there. 

Things about my job I would really like to have, 1. Freedom to design my own types of experiments and research direction 2. Freedom in work schedule, not standard 9-5 M-F hours 3. Money is not a high priority on my list, I would much rather enjoy everyday I’m working than know I have plenty of money. My DREAM JOB would be a small lab with a few smart people that I can be free to do any kind of research Im excited by, be able to work whenever I am truly motivated to, and lastly have enough income to live modestly (kind of ridiculous, I know but loving what I do is VERY important to me! and I do not see myself settling in any job I don’t enjoy). 

Also I realize funding is a huge factor in research and one of the biggest limiting factors for startups, but I could see myself enjoying working on a really cool project and using kickstarter (like glowing plants project) and finding funding other ways. 

My question is, would I need a Masters or PhD in order to do research in a biotech company (startup or corporate) or would I be able to find work after my bachelors degree? Would a few more internships in biotech (like ginkgo bioworks) be as good as a masters? Would it be worth it for me to get the more years of schooling so I am more marketable? To be honest, I would much rather find work right away because I have really grown tired of the academic environment, but on the other hand I would be willing to do more schooling if that is the only option because I do not want to be unqualified for biotech research and be stuck making reagents all day. Any advice/insight/regrets/realizations would be greatly appreciated!

tl;dr: Undergrad Bioengineer graduating in a year, wants to do biotech research. Should I continue schooling or would I be able to find work I enjoy with just my bachelors degree? "

	My name is XXXXXXX and I am applying to a full PhD program with the fellowship XXXXXXXXXXX. Operations Research and Probabilistics /Combinatorics  is a field that gives me drive to learn. I believe there are important developments yet to be made in this area and I am looking forward to being a part of it. As the most prominent  scholars studying these topics are located in the USA, there is where I want to go for my PhD.

	 The study of the unknown has been of my interest for long now. In my high school, learning math and science came easy to me. One teacher, acknowledging this, invited me to have advanced classes that covered material not taught in regular classes in a small, selected group. At this moment, I started taking part on math Olympiads, being placed among the 20 best in one year. I remember well when he taught us probabilistics and combinatorics for the first time. When I left, I was thirsty for more. 

 	A couple years later, I started studying Industrial Engineering at XXXXXX. I was lucky enough to have two outstanding professors of Operations Research that revived the same feeling I had that day in high school. They taught me how to solve complex problems with simple, but powerful methods. Still during my undergraduate studies,  I was awarded a scholarship to study Engineering in Nantes, France for one year in 2010. While there, I went after a professor who taught Recherche Operationelle (Operations Research) and asked whether I could attend his classes even though it was not officially part of my accorded class schedule. He agreed and I was able to learn different methods and approaches to problems that were similar to the ones I had seem at XXXXXXXXXXX.
 
	Afterwards, given my high GPA (top 10% of class), I was awarded another scholarship to study during one year at XXXXXXXXXXXXx in 2012. I was so happy to be in such good school I decided to challenge myself taking classes that interested me, disregarding the pre-requisites or the level of them, including courses aimed for Masters in the field of Industrial Engineering, Finance and Math.  Additionally, I took one course that was aimed for second year MBA students, called Experiential Learning Initiative. It was a research based class in which a group of students had to solve a real-life industry problem. My group had to build a model to better predict production order and lot-sizing for a well-known company that manufactures glass bottles. Being the only one with experience in Operations Research, I was defined as the leader of the modeling part. This was of great value to me. The scope was too big to be done in one person, so I had to teach basic concepts to one of the fellow students and organize myself so the others could provide us with meaningful data on a timely manner. There was a lot of pressure since the deadlines were short. Eventually we were able to deliver what was promised and I ended up with an A on my report. That was a true feeling of accomplishment.

	I also think my working experiences, though few, help shape the person who I am today. While in college, I worked as a tutor and a teacher, teaching Analytic Geometry, French and English. I loved it and hope to become a professor someday. I am eager to learn more and develop myself, but  I am just as eager to share what I know. I have also worked as an intern engineer in manufacturing at XXXXXXx and as an intern consultant at XXXXXXXXX, a strategy consultancy. I had a glimpse on how vast the applications for Operations Research, Probabilistics and Combinatorics can be while working for I could apply my knowledge of using math to optimize production lines and to help on the decision-making process. I am currently working as a Trainee forXXXXXXXXXX, a company that manufactures gases for the industrial and healthcare segment. At this moment, I am doing a job rotation to learn how every single area within the company relate to the others and what are the peculiarities of each one of them. This is a very competitive position, having had more than 4500 candidates applying for 10 places.

	Having this background and this experience, I would like to conclude by saying that I am excited to conduct a research in this field. I am confident I am the ideal candidate for a PhD in Operations research, Probabilistics and Combinatorics. The fellowship will cover my expenses so I can fully devote myself to this program. Upon my return, I intend to become a recognized professor in my field and develop my country's education by doing world-class research and helping students learn how to face the complex problems they might encounter.

Related but not FPS - [Things Hamtern did 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/badpeoplestories/comments/27nqut/things_hamtern_did_1/)

My current employer has a large population of ham planets, galaxies, and mini moons. It was also due to the HR director in charge of hiring was also a Hamplanet too.

&gt;Be me - Overtime - working days at the time.

&gt;Don't be- Hamtern - Intern that was selected because she wanted to be in Human Resources one day. And lets face it a young ham that wants to be in HR made our resident HR Ham all squishy inside. It also made for a ""entitled and protected"" ham that became a terror.

When Hamtern first arrived we didn't think much of it. Our company is always taking on interns. But this one became ""special"" after the first day. She began talking down to everyone that she thought was beneath her (well HR, this will become important in the next FPS). She complained to me and several of my co-workers that we were lazy and couldn't do our jobs so HR would have her ""monitor"" us. Problem is it wasn't her job or HR's job to ""monitor"" us. She didn't actually have any work to so she walked around the building delivering papers. Which led to ....

**The chicken Nugget Heist**

My work loves offices, Labs, and whatever you want to call it rooms. You work in something, here its a something or other room/lab/idunno. There was a women (lets call her Nine-because she was nine months pregnant) who had a box of chicken nuggets on her desk in one of the computer labs. She was the only person in there. She needed to leave for a few minutes. When she returned her chicken nuggets had mysteriously vanished.

So Nine came to me and asked me if any of my guys had been in that room after she had left. I checked the door logs and nope none of my guys had gone in but behold I found Hamtern had gone in there. So I went and had the security footage pulled up. There was Nine leaving, a minute later Hamtern enters, then leaves eating something, and then Nine returns. Well you'd think that was a clear cut case. Nope HR Ham fought for Hamtern tooth and nail.

&gt;HR Ham: She was delivering important papers.You have no proof that those were chicken nuggets in her hand. She could have been carrying a snack with her at the time. Besides Nines is pregnant and hormonal and she could have very well eaten them and forgot it.

So Hamtern survived.

**Fridge Raider**

We've had some things go missing from the communal fridge. But when Hamtern came onto the scene food went missing like they testified in court against her. I requested a new security camera put up at the fridge. When Hamtern saw it she complained to HR Ham.

&gt;HR Ham: Its a violation of her personal privacy. You cant monitor what people eat or how much or how many times. 

&gt;Us: We are having to monitor because of stolen food. Also there is a set lunch time limit so if we see someone taking much longer breaks we can report that as well.

At first food stopped disappearing. Until Hamtern started bringing in a big blue lunch bag/tote. Food started to vanish again. So another rule was created. All bags and carrying containers were to be clear. Hamtern was not pleased but the thievery suddenly stopped.

**Vending Machine Key and Boogers**

Somehow Hamtern thought because she was in HR that she needed skeleton keys for the whole building. More importantly the vending machines. My boss denied her a vending machine key and the (food) storage key. 

&gt;Hamtern: I'm HR I need keys to everything

&gt;My Boss: Give me a good reason why you need to get in the vending machine.

&gt;Hamtern: Someone has to collect the money!

&gt;My Boss: Someone already does and it isn't HR's responsibility to do that.

&gt;Hamtern: But I neeeeeeeeeeed one!

So she never got the storage or vending machine keys. Shortly thereafter boogers started appearing all over my boss's desk and office phone. We figured it was Hamtern but couldn't prove it. Another place boogers were being reported were on the vending machine keys.

I've been researching and learning about SCOM 2012 as you will learn below. But I wanted to field sysadmin for some help since some information I have found is pretty sparse. 

I've been given free reign to setup a SCOM server for a datacenter as part of a project for a short internship. I will be starting with a dev environment to make sure things go well and such. After reviewing a few threads on here and elsewhere, I have come up with a basic idea of how to build and implement the server pool/databases. However, I am unsure of which packs to use or even suggest to the manager in an upcoming meeting I will be having with my suggestion concerning what we need. 

Currently I was planning to use: 

* Windows server 2012 r2 DC edition x2 for server pool

* SQL server for DW and Operational DB. Based on an excel sheet, we have a rough idea as to the necessary storage based on the active agents. 

What I sort of know that they want: 

* 100-150 servers to be monitored, some physical, some virtual.

* Virtual machine management of both hyper v and vmware.

* web console

* reporting server

* application monitoring

Not necessary: 

* No gateway mgmt server is necessary for the network. 

* No network management is desired.

* Currently they are unsure of auditing use, so likely not going to be used.

Does anyone have any tips, suggestions, or warnings I should know? Any suggestions on the best practices for grouping servers together for monitoring? Also, does anyone have any recommendations for packs to use?"

I love the culture there and I really want to be a part of the cool projects they work on. 

I'm currently in an internship this summer at a large high-tech corporation as a software developer, but it feels like the exact opposite of what I want to be doing. I'm constantly in meetings and writing specs about the project I'm working on, and the few times I get to work with code, my productivity is stunted by trying to get the build environment to work with their massive codebase. 

I love theoretical computer science and especially enjoyed the theory of computation and algorithms classes I've taken in school, but I'm doing none of that in my internship. I miss working on hard CS/math problems. 

Is my internship an indicator of what a job in computer science would be like?

How do I cope?",Kreelix,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27ltgk/my_22m_relationship_of_half_a_decade_just_ended/,"Hey /r/relationships..

Not sure if this is the right place to post something like this, but I could use a little help. I've been in a long distance relationship for about a half-decade. We weathered a lot of challenges together, and I still managed to propose in Spring 2013. Things were more or less stable up until the Summer.

That said, this year things really started to fall apart for us, partially due to the distance, and partially due to the general lack of future direction (I'm close to finishing college, she's not sure what she wants to do, etc). She ended up asking for a lot more freedom than I was comfortable with, and all in all things weren't going great in terms of communication or stability.

Cut to this Summer, where I was able to spend a little time at home before leaving again for an internship out of the state. On our last day together, she prompted a conversation in which we spoke about how we might be better off as friends (lack of mutual passions, distance, etc etc), and she asked to end things. We ended them. I left, and we only spoke sparingly for a few days, myself starting to try and move on. Three days into being single, I discovered she'd met someone online the first day I was gone, and had since been on a date and slept with him. She mostly intimates that this is just a distraction for her, that she knows it's too soon, that it's her way of coping with the break-up, but it's tearing me apart just to think about it, and I'd really like to get past the pain. 

So, fellow redditors, how do I deal? I'm mostly considering just cutting her off conversationally for a few weeks, but I'd love to hear your opinions. 


Thanks for your time! 
Kreelix

P.S. - This really isn't meant to be a ""let's bash my ex"" thread, I understand why she chose that course of action, and I don't ""blame"" her. 


TL;DR - Long-term, long distance relationship ended last weekend, she's already sleeping with someone new, could use help with some coping methods."

I started cutting back on fast food to twice a week and my sugar/splenda and creamer intake from 3 packs and 2 creamers to a pack and a half and 1 creamer. Soda intake is down from multiple times a day to once a week (and I very rarely miss it). I also started going to the gym and doing weight machines and 45 minutes on the treadmill. I went from walking at 3mph at a heart rate of 127 to 3.9mph at a heart rate of 152. I exercise 2-3 times a week, but if I do a 3rd day in a row I feel super unmotivated.

27m0p5,12,2014-06-08,Need advice from ER nurses and techs please.,[deleted],nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/27m0p5/need_advice_from_er_nurses_and_techs_please/,"Hey guys, 

So last year I took a nursing internship at a well known magnet hospital which opened up a job opportunity for me in the ER right after graduation this past December. During nursing school I worked in an ER as a tech for 2 years for a different hospital. After graduation I moved to a new state to start work for this hospital but hit a roadblock with the board of nursing. There were issues with my paperwork that are still being worked on. Long story short, I was taken off my temporary nursing orientation and put into a tech roll there so I could still work while waiting for my paperwork to get situated. This was a bit devastating but I went in there anyway and gave it my all. The bar was already set very high (the internship was competitive and there are high expectations for those interns who are hired after graduation) so I felt the need to prove myself to my co-workers. I have established wonderful relationships with both the nurses and the techs, but this overzealous attitude I went in with has dug me a grave. The nurses have told me they love my work which is why they put me in triage and the front rooms only (which means constant running/working your ass off the full 12 hours, lucky if you get a break before 5am). It took me a while to catch on, but the reason the nurses love putting me in the front is because I am working as a tech but thinking as a nurse which allows me to help in a different way that is more convenient for the nurses because I can anticipate treatment for the patient and help accordingly. This behavior is now expected of me and even though I love what I do, it is killing me. I already have a problem saying no to people but do not want to be known as the complainer at work or decrease my work ethic. These nurses already think I can do all this crap with a smile on my face day after day when really I am constantly running to the supply room to let some tears fall before going out and killing myself again. I am starting to notice the nurses are becoming needy and greedy with delegation and some of the techs are starting to kick back while I do the community work (restocking, floating) by myself. My back is starting to hurt severely, I have to sleep fifteen hours after a 3 day stretch just to recover and I'm constantly having emotional breakdowns. I have already scheduled a meeting with my manager. The nurses are supposed to rotate techs to all 4 stations, but that is not happening. I know I need to learn to limit what I take on, but with the expectations already there...how do I say no without being a complainer? Another problem is we use the intercom, not phones. If I am paged, it's like saying ""Do this"" no room to say ""I'm busy"" The message has been put out and if you don't get to it right away they KEEP paging you until it is done and it's crap. Sometimes I'm backed up 10 tasks deep and they still demand I drop what I'm doing because what they want is more important. 

 Here is what I need from you guys.I know this situation from both the nursing side and the tech side, but I want your advice. 

Nurses, what do you think of this situation? What can I say to these nurses to make them understand that I am a human, not a robot? I want to be tactful yet firm. 

Techs, does this ever happen to you? How do you deal with delegation overload? (Some of these nurses are beginning to delegate out of convenience not because they really need something done. If I see one more nurse tell me to do a catscan run while they sit and giggle on their phone I'm going to fucking scream). 

Thank you so much for your feedback, I need this to better prepare before I talk to my manager. 

And I also just wanted to say to both the Nurses and Techs- Thank you. Nurses, please treat your techs well, it is physically exhausting and they literally break their backs to make your job easier. Don't delegate just because something is hard or you don't want to do it. Techs- just because nurses are sitting, doesn't mean they aren't working...it is a demanding job with more responsibility and liability than meets the eye. What you do is so important and helpful to the big picture of patient care/satisfaction. Bottom line- Please treat each other with respect! "

I have a slight dilemma and I'm not sure how to deal with it on my resume, my schooling went:

University A (1 semester, 3.46 GPA)

University B (1 semester, 3.52 GPA)

and finally once I had enough credits for them to let me transfer to the school I wanted to go to,

University C (2 semesters, 2.25 GPA)


and in the fall, I will be returning to University A because I was offered the full ride I had again, and I will be switching from engineering to CS+math.

By the end of the summer, I'll have 1 year of internship (although engineering) experience at a Fortune 500, which I'd like to highlight.  For the place I'm currently at, I was able to rationalize why I did this and get hired.  I just feel it's at the point that I jumped around so many times that it'll be harder, not to mention that my GPA was so low that I'm embarrassed to even have that year on my resume.

I'm rambling at this point, any advice would be appreciated on how I should list my education."

I was a virgin until I was 24 and decided I was done with this ""keep your virginity"" bullshit. I had sex with a guy I hooked up with at a party, never saw him again, was happy about it. Wasn't that great, but I had read enough to know orgasms aren't mandatory, so it didn't bother me. It hadn't hurt, too, and I hadn't bled.
Being silly me, some time after it, I wondered if I had indeed had vaginal intercourse.

Fast forward a few months. Still single, another party, another guy. HELL, the pain. First, there was his fingernails. FUCK IT I SWEAR I'LL GUT THE NEXT GUY WITH LONG FINGERNAILS WHO TRIES TO FINGER ME. Then his dick, but I was still in pain and so we stopped the session and cuddled before falling asleep.
After that, I was really anxious about sex.

New Year's Eve. I thought I'd give it another try. I got hammered, picked a good-looking guy, we danced and ended up in bed. The last few months interval, I had been shortly with a guy who was honestly the king of cunnilingus (we only did oral), so I knew sex could be awesome. What could possibly go wrong ? Well, everything. It fucking hurt. We stopped, but he had been pretty rough, and I bled the next day.
So, I figured : blood+pain, that must be it. Next time will be better, right ?

Wrong. Another party hook up. Kept myself sober. Plenty foreplay (and excellent foreplay too). Bam, vaginal intercourse was so painful he stopped. Later in the night happened what gave me matter to think. After what must have been my 10th orgasm of the night from oral, we tried anal, at my request. While it didn't feel great (I honestly felt like I was pooping, which was weird), it certainly wasn't painful. I might even have liked it.
It was my first time doing anal. I had read/heard a lot about sodomy hurting and etc, but it had been sooooo much more comfortable than vaginal intercourse I began to wonder.

Now is the time to tell you I'm a medical intern. I was fucking embarrassed. The gynecology ward of the hospital I work at is really good, but there was no way I was showing my vagina to people I have coffee with on a daily basis. Private practice in my town is really, really expensive, and I couldn't count on a confraternity discount.
So, being my usual avoiding self, I avoided the problem for nearly a year.

One day, feeling unusually brave, I did what I had never done during the first 27 hers of my life. I looked at my lady bits in a mirror.
I have very little experience in gynecology, but I could definitely identify remnants of my hymen. I was still worried that my vaginal opening looked reeeaaally tiny, and spent the next few months wondering if I shouldn't go see a gynecological surgeon to check I hadn't a micro perforated hymen.

Then, yesterday evening, I was unable to sleep. I have a date coming (a real one, not a party hook up) with a great guy. If we catch on, I want to be able to have sex unimpaired. So I got my mirror again and looked at my vagina. Then I got paraffin oil and a Q-tip. Lubed Q-tip went it OK. No pain, just a slightly weird feeling. I went to bed happy and slept well.
So today I tried the lubed Q-tip again, gently pulling around the opening, that already looked a few millimeter wider. Then I got paraffin oil on my finger (short nails ^^). No pain either.

So I don't know if it's just that I've been unlucky with my previous hookups, or if it was the stress, but I'm definitely kinda normal down there. I won't go see a gynecologist yet (my general practitioner is great at prescribing my birth control and not pushing a speculum where I don't want one). I'll keep working like that every day. Might get a dildo, too, for science, you know ^^

TL;DR : have overcome my anxiety about vaginal intercourse. I might be normal after all."

But there doesn't seem to be any work in my area, at least nothing for Junior Developers. I've been keeping an eye open the last few months but the same companies are still looking for Senior Developers. The couple of companies that have had positions open for Junior Developers have had my resume for a couple months now and I've only heard from one in which I got the screening interview and was told I would get my technical interview but that was nearly a month ago and haven't heard from them since.

Should I be willing to relocate on my own to a larger city for the sake of finding work, flying or driving back home occasionally until my family can join me in the new city? Or am I being impatient and need to keep looking in my area? Our long term goal is to move to a larger city like Raleigh, NC anyway.

I worked a couple of part time jobs through college to help pay the bills, but was never able to land an internship and I fear that may also be affecting my ability to find work. 

Overall I feel like the pressure to find work quickly may be affecting my judgement and making my overly anxious.

27n199,5,2014-06-08,Me [21F] with my sort of boyfriend [20M] of 8 months- am I wasting my time in our long distance relationship?,ldrgal009,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27n199/me_21f_with_my_sort_of_boyfriend_20m_of_8_months/,"We met while studying abroad in the Fall and had a ""whirlwind romance"" (aka we were having great sex all across Europe). After we had spent some time together, I ascertained that he had never been in a serious relationship and had some vague ""commitment"" issues, but I was never too concerned. I honestly chocked it up to a fling with a great guy.

 We go to school about two hours apart in the States, both in major cities. Surprisingly, we managed to grow even closer after coming returning home from our semester abroad, and visited each other multiple times. I began to really fall hard for him, and he clearly expressed through both actions and words that the feelings were mutual.Everything was smooth sailing until I pressed him to label our relationship during his visit over Valentines Day. Looking back, I did this for all the wrong reasons (insecurities with myself, issues in past relationships, etc). He expressed apprehension at calling me his girlfriend before I had met his family (this may seem like BS, but he is incredibly close with his family and I knew it was genuine), but he agreed that he wanted to take our relationship to the next level and we decided to be exclusive. The following week, we got into two arguments over bullshit stuff... and after NEVER having argued in the past, it felt really awful. He called me the following weekend and said he wanted to take a step back because he thought the pressure of labeling our relationship was ruining us. I was rightfully angry and upset, but eventually agreed as long as we rephrased it as taking a step forward. He readily agreed.

Fast forward 4-5 months, and everything is going well. He visited last weekend, and it was absolutely perfect. We were both pretty vulnerable with each other, we said I love you. I'm not one to get caught up in the labels and certain milestones in relationships if it doesn't present itself as a problem, but here are my issues: 

1) He still won't call me his girlfriend. Are labels really that important? I am 99% sure he's not hooking up with anyone else, but it stills feel weird to me.

2) He still hasn't invited me to meet his family. Granted, this may be due to circumstances, but it still feels like a red flag. I have told him multiple times how much I want him to meet my family. However, he has a relationship with his parents and sister that I am unaccustomed too. They still dictate his major life choices and are SUPER overprotective. He has to ask their permission for basically everything. He has to call or text them multiple times a day or they panic. He has to lie about where he's staying when he comes to visit me because he doesn't think they will approve of him spending the night at a member of the opposite sex's house. He recognizes this controlling behavior to be problematic, but he also hasn't set boundaries himself. He adores his family and really tries to please them. I respect how close he is with them, and I also respect that I don't have that type of relationship with my family so it may be hard for me to understand. But, it still weirds me out. I pressed him about meeting his parents, and he finally admitted that he's terrified I won't like them and want to break up with him. While I know that his parents and I share different political and religious beliefs, I never gave him any reason to think I would write him (or the people that gave birth to him) off like that! I'm starting to think while that may be true, he's afraid they won't approve of me and that just makes me feel totally shitty. If he really loves me, wouldn't he be dying to introduce me to the family he worships so much??

3) He never talks about our future together. We have never explicitly talked about it, but he seems especially strange about it. I can't tell if its my own insecurities, but the way he talks about things makes me feel shitty. This summer for instance: we're both super busy with internships and classes, and were talking about how we won't be able to talk or visit as much as we did during the year. He vaguely says ""but it won't be a problem, we'll definitely keep in touch..."". We both have the mindset that we're young, and enjoying our last year of college, but I also know that I have serious feelings about him. There's a really good chance I will be moving to his city in one year for grad school, but he doesn't seem to take that as a possibility of us having a shot at being together long-term. I'm not sure if it's because he has no experience in committed relationships, or still feels the need to keep some sort of guard up, or he's just bidding the time with me. I love him desperately and I know he loves me too, but I'm worried that I'm wasting my time. It feels like we go through arcs, where we see each other and everything is fucking incredible like this is my soulmate and best friend and I can't get enough of you...and then when we leave each other, it's hard to find that feeling again. 

What do you guys think? I guess a lot of what I wrote is speculation, but I am so wrapped up in this that I can't think clearly. Am I wasting my time? Are these redflags that I need out?

The worst is that we won't know results until end of the week. I'm kinda stressed out now, so please cross your fingers for me.


EDIT: I'm finally after it, I think it went quite good and now I can only wait-""There will be water if God will it."" So thank you all for support and good words.

27n3zr,0,2014-06-08,"My [23F] ex-boyfriend [22M] is coming home for the summer, we live on the same street, might work in the same city - to contact or not contact?",FeelingWorthless100,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27n3zr/my_23f_exboyfriend_22m_is_coming_home_for_the/,"Recently my boyfriend broke up with me, telling me he needs time to focus on himself and his career; we've been 100% NC since it happened 3 weeks ago, but this coming weekend he's coming back for the summer from school. We live in the same city, on the same street, and if things go well for me with an upcoming interview we may also be working in the same city. 

He cheated on me last summer at an internship he was at, we worked through things but were in a state of limbo in terms of whether or not we were a couple, but when I found out he'd lied to me about some woman he met in Vegas and had partied with at his school behind my back, I couldn't take the continued lies and manipulation and told him I couldn't deal with him taking advantage of me any longer. He claims the breakup wasn't about finding anyone else, that he doesn't want anyone else, and loves me, but that he needs to fix the things inside him he feels are wrong with him.

He also claims his internship will have him flying back and forth between two parts of the state, and that he's ""only 22"" and can't commit to me and a relationship ""right now."" What I think is going on is that he wants to sow his wild oats and not have to worry about being faithful, but wants to keep telling me he can't be with me ""right now"" to try and keep me close - to have his cake and eat it too.

I know that I deserve better than a cheater whose lies have become pathological at this point, and who is so riddled with low self-esteem and peer pressure that he continues to bend over backwards for ""friends,"" claiming he doesn't like partying with them and would rather ""stay inside and be a nerd"" but never says no to their pushing and prodding, and always points the finger of blame at me and his parents for the mistakes he continues to make.

What's difficult for me is that we've been friends for 9 years, and dated for 4. We were each other's best friend, and we could confide in one another in ways we can't with others. I know that to go back to someone whose constant empty apologies and manipulation have an unhealthy hold on me is a bad idea (which is an understatement) but I can't lie to myself - I love him with all of my heart, and don't want to lose him from my life.

Should I contact him? Should I see if he even contacts me?  There is quite a long history between us and a lot of strong emotions that are still there. I can't honestly act like he's disappeared off the face of the earth when he's a five minute drive up the street. Please help.

TL;DR: Ex broke up with me 3 weeks ago, we've been NC, he comes back home for summer this weekend, we live on same street and may work in same city. He cheated on me last year, had another shady instance with another woman, claims he still loves me. Do I contact him when he's home or no?"
27n52z,2,2014-06-08,My biggest struggle to-date.,Subject-changer,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/27n52z/my_biggest_struggle_todate/,"I know this is going to sound whiny, but I just need to vent, and I need some encouragement. Maybe it'll help one of you too, who knows.


**tl;dr** the girl that was keeping me sane during my nofap quest has moved 8 hours away for the rest of the summer, and is now torturing me with tasteful nude photos of herself. I have 2 weeks until I can visit her. I have 2 weeks until I reach my 90 day goal.

A little backstory to the full story: I quit cold turkey back in March, and I'm going for 90 days on my first attempt. I went through more than the first month completely on hard-mode. No form of release whatsoever, until I had a totally embarrassing drunken one-night stand with a girl I've known for a few years. Here's an excerpt from that for your amusement:

&gt;It's worth prefacing this by saying that before NoFap I had actually almost never came from having penetrative sex. After 40 days of hard mode I was finally about to have sex with a girl, and even though I had a condom on, I came... literally upon insertion. Like immediately. I tried to play it off for awhile and managed to go maybe a minute or two longer, but christ. I had seriously exploded. Like more jizz than I've ever seen come out of me in my entire life, and it had just totally filled the condom, which then proceeded to slip off from all the extra lubrication inside.

That was painfully awkward, but it was good preparation because a week or so later I was slated to enter a more physical relationship with this girl that I ACTUALLY like, who I had been talking to and hanging out with for a few weeks. I would have been way more upset if I had just came immediately the first time I had sex with a girl that I really care about.

Anyway, fast-forward a bit, things are going great and this girl that I like has become my only form of sexual stimulation, which is sort of a big deal to me, but then she leaves. Pretty suddenly too. She got a really great internship and she's going to be 8 hours away all summer. It could be much worse, and I'm already planning to visit her soon (just 2 more weeks), but it's not ideal.

So we've been talking essentially every day; she's only been gone a week and she's saying things like ""wish you were here right now"", ""come see me soon"", etc. Longing things, essentially. But **here's the kicker:**

last night we entered a new phase of long-distance. She sent me nude pictures of herself.

We were on the phone, and she said something like ""I'm sending you something. You might not want to leave your apartment. ;)"" then, BAM. Like 5 nudes in my inbox. Instant erection.

So now I'm entering 2 weeks of my own personal hell. Literally, to the date, the day that I go visit her will be day 90 of not fapping if I can hold out that long. 

The problem is, I WANT to fap. But this time it's different. I'm not watching porn, I'm not fapping because I'm bored, or because I'm thinking about some girl other than my own. I want to fap because I'm so sexually attracted to this girl. MY girl. I want to fap because I want to be able to please my girl when I get there, and not be done in 10 seconds. And that's the worst part: if I don't have some kind of release before then, I'm just going to explode in 10 seconds the first time we have sex after I get there, and I don't want that. :|

* I have an understanding of core, basic programming concepts and have worked with several languages enough to be familiar with them. My knowledge in these areas is always expanding and I have no problem picking up new info quickly that is needed for a particular project to allow for easier communication and understanding of limitations.

* I'm an active reader of design articles and books and write many of my own analyzing specific games or design concepts in general. Check the bottom of the writer section for links, or if you want help finding a specific game design article I've written, just ask and I'll provide some links.

I have worked in the IT field for well over ten years, I have followed a career path: school, contracts, internships, previous IT assistant jobs, and finally a fully legitimate IT professional desk job for the same company consistently for the last 8 years. While with this company I went back to school to increase my education they have reaped the benefits and I am 9 credits from graduating. While discussing with my boss about how I would repay my student loans he said his boss would have to start looking into the cost of out sourcing our jobs vs ANY raise we would get. Mind you my salary is way below the average of what the position I have pays in my area. There is no role to advance to other than my bosses position. We service 100 PC's, 100+ IP phones,  over 30 servers, half a dozen routers and switches plus all the software the company runs and in a half a dozen locations. I have tried job hunting via dice, monster, career builder, and been on dozens interviews, I seem to always get passed up. Personally (and I know the comeback is you are among millions) I am sick of living paycheck to paycheck doing any side job I can find, not being able to fix the car, running out of food, missing out on the fun, have an actual savings account. I paid my dues (proof on request) and feels like there is nothing left to be had. I just want a fair shot! Edits will be added for requested/missing details."

She said she wants to hang out again, but I haven't heard from her all day and I am not sure if she letting me off easy?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27nth8/i_24m_had_an_amazing_date_with_this_girl_21f_she/,"So after a few not-so-great relationships/exes, I decided to try Tinder.  I ended up matching with this girl earlier this week who was here for ""friends or dates"" for the summer as she is here doing an internship.  We started chatting for two days or so and she told me she really wanted to check out the night life in the city, so we agreed to meet up on Friday and that I would take her to one of the popular bars in the area.

I picked her up and we chatted in the car.  Immediately, I felt a connection. She was different from the other girls I had dated - she was educated and could actually carry a convo.  We bonded over everything from our childhood to our same musical taste.  She seemed to really enjoy the night.  Since she is only here till mid August, I am hoping to take her out and show her as much of the city as I can, as she really wants to see the hot spots.  I told her I was up for showing her around whenever. So towards the end of the night, I put my arm around her and she seemed to enjoy it.  She seemed a bit shy and told me she likes when guys make the first move so I gave her a kiss.  She said she liked that and loves that I take charge/don't beat around the bush like a lot of guys she has dated.  I told her I thought she was beautiful and she said she thought I was a great looking guy as well.  We left holding hands and at the end of the night, I drove her back to her place and she said we will for sure text and gave me a goodnight kiss.

Next day, I get a text in the morning that says ""Thank you for taking me out last night! I had a lot of fun. :)"" I respond ""My pleasure. I had a great time as well"" and briefly mentioned a funny moment from last night.  We exchanged a few messages the whole day here and there.  She then suggested ""Maybe next weekend we can hang in your hometown if you're free? Or this week or whenever!"" So I said ""That sounds great.  I'd love to show you around so just let me know when you're up for it. I'm free whenever (except two days when I have a wedding and a family dinner).  She then said we can just ""play it by ear and figure out a good day for it.""

I then asked her what she was up to and she said she is staying in the city with her cousin cause she may have ""inadvertently gotten slightly intoxicated"" so I said  ""Be safe.  If you need me to come drive you to your place let me know.  Have a great night.""

So the whole day, I haven't heard anything.  Not even a ""Thank you for offering me a ride back.  I am better.""  She also got on Tinder back today, so I am thinking she is not interested at all? Or maybe that text was too much? I want to text her asking how her day was or something but I don't wanna come across as too much or force anything, you know? I feel like I am overthinking things.. she said she wants to hang out again but not till next weekend and when I asked her what day works, she said we will ""play it by ear"" .. so is she letting me off easy?

TL;DR - Went on an amazing date with this girl who is in my city for a few months, we bond and kiss by the end of the night.  Get a text the next day saying she had a great time and wants to hang out next weekend. She texts me that she got wasted that night and I said to be safe and offered to pick her up and take her back to her place.  Haven't heard from her since so I am not sure if she took that the wrong way or if I am overthinking things."

The thing is, me and another student will be the only ones working on the project, which is rebuilding the companies website.

I have a Canadian bank account with Bank of Montreal (BMO), as well as a MasterCard with them and always deposited my pay checks to there.

Now that I'm in the US I'm not sure what to do for depositing my checks. Bank of Montreal has a US branch called BMO Harris, and I'm leaning toward opening an account with them.

I'm only in the states temporarily, and will be heading back to Canada in September to finish my degree. Because I'm not sure if I'm coming back immediately, I feel like I'd like to close the US account at the end of the summer and transfer it back to my Canadian account (unless there's no harm keeping it open and empty).

I'd also like a MasterCard as I'm paying 5% per transaction here with my Canadian card.

Would my best bet be to go with BMO Harris for a bank account and get a credit card as well? And cancel after the 3 months when I go back to Canada?

Should I get a checking or savings? The savings account offers 0.05% interest, but that messes with being able to get a credit card, right? Not to mention 0.05% would bring me about $100.

What should I do, reddit?"

You've been expecting me to deliver finished the necessary paperwork for an important account for the last hour.

My hand swings out and catches you right across the mouth smearing your $80 french lipstick you never shut up about.

You put a hand to your stinging face. You look at me with shock - opening your mouth to speak - I lash out with my other hand. Harder the second time, its turned your head and left the other side of your mouth hurting even more then the first.

Your shock subsides - you arms start to move as I grab you by the hair and pull you against me. You try to push off of me. In one swift move I twist with one leg behind your knees - pulling you off balance. I yank your head backwards, then shove you forward guiding you down to your knees. I pull your hair harder tilting your hair back and exposing your throat to me. Forcing you to look into my eyes

""First, I want to thank you for being such a huge fucking cunt. If you hadn't been riding my ass so hard I wouldn't have worked as hard double checking the accounting errors on the Vanderlay account.  Ms. M….I think I know how you keep buying those Coach purses.""

The look in your eyes says everything - I know what you know - and you know that I know. Everything you've ever worked for and everything your name means in this company and in this industry is in the palm of my hands.

With my other hand I reach over and pick up the coffee. YOUR coffee. I hold it out in front of you 
""I want to tell you something - and I want to make sure you understand it completely.

I shake the coffee in front of your nose - it reminds you when you potty trained your dog.

""Everyone in the office - FUCK - Everyone in the entire building knows. 'These are your coffees, they are ALL your coffees' You have an entire shelf devoted to them and you can't help yourself can you - you have to remind ALL of us ALL THE TIME they are yours. We get it."" 

I relax my grip on your hair. 

""Open it up""

You are still in shock - staring at me in disbelief. ""Limp Dick, you stupid motherfucker""

I tap you on the forehead with the bottom of the bottle, it rings enough to bring you back to reality. You start to talk again - I raise the bottle to give you another ""love tap"". Your mouth trembles closed as you reach out for the bottle.

""Open it up. Now. Bitch.""

You fumble for a moment before popping the bottle, the lid falling to the floor.

""This is YOUR coffee"" I say tipping it over to slowly spill out a Ice Cold Mocha Frappuccino over your tits. You squeal, your legs kicking and scrambling against the floor. I twist my hand in your hair - the pain twisting your neck against yourself keeps you in place.

I snatch the bottle out of your greedy little hand.

""This is coffee is ALL YOURS"" It pours out agonizingly slow - drawing out your humiliation. I keep pouring until its all out and your blouse is completely soaked. I'm still not done until I've shaken the last few drops out. A few fly high and leave you with a couple droplets around your mouth. 

I look down at you and smile sympathetically - you can feel my cock jump against the side of my leg and smile.

""Awww Ms. M - you've made such a mess you barely managed to get any in your mouth at all - let me help you."" 

I reach out to your face. You struggle, tightening up but knowing your resistance is futile you don't flinch as I collect the coffee drops with the tip of my finger. Your cheeks flush when I hold my finger out to you.

""Go on.""

Your head shakes a tight little no, still in my grip.

""I've got all night to play. The custodians will be here in a while to clean up….you know considering how you treat them maybe we should wait for Maria and the….""

You jump forward and take the very tip of my finger in your mouth and pull away.

I shake my head condescendingly ""Ms M… I am disappointed. That's it?"" I give your head a little shake.

""Well, good thing for you I like playing 'just the tip' too. In fact….lets finish this game in your office. If I let go of your hair will you try to run?""

You shake your head - trying to convince me.

""I don't believe you - and I like it. FUCK! I hope you run.…."" I pause and close my eyes relishing the thought - involuntarily licking my lips.

""ungh…if you fucking run….let's just say … when you crawl into the share holder meeting on Monday to explain what you've done. They won't even fucking recognize you.""

Beads of sweat start to roll down the sides of your pretty face.

Disappointed….""You're not going to run are you""

trembling - you shake your head.

""Ah well. March.""

I push you forward by your head - you have to catch yourself from falling face first on the floor. You get to your feet. You try and fix your hair and clothes out of instinct - your hands flopping about confused - its very cute.

When we get to your office, you turned - embarrassed - you've forgotten your key. 

You are only getting cuter. I move you aside and boot the door right above the lock - the flies open hanging on the hinges. The sound and the suddenness of the violence shakes whatever will you have to resist out of you.

""Get naked, bitch.""

You peel clothes faster than you ever have in your life - your cold wet sticky blouse still clinging
to your chest as you peel it away. Your nips are still hard and swollen the perfect tips to such full round breasts.

You've just stepped out of your slutty black thong, with hot pink trim - ""Stop. Hand those to me.""

You timidly reach out and put them in my hand. I hold them up - looking at them admiring them. Really appreciating the texture of the fabric between my thumb and forefinger - and then I find the wet spot - YOUR wet spot.

""Oh. OH!…Ms. M you should have told me you were getting so excited. You fucking little slut. Open up and let me see.""

You open - slowly - I can just see a highlight on the rim of your lips - a little shine where your pussy juice has betrayed your true feelings.

""Fucking look at that"" I point and laugh ""I've turned my project supervisor into a common whore.""

You shift a little in your stance - starting to bring your hands around from your sides to cover up your dripping shame.

""No. Hands behind your head - interlace your fingers, pretend I'm a cop and you've been busted for being a whore. A common street whore at that look at how fucking wet you are right now.""

I bend down - face first to stare into your pussy. I dip my finger just inside your juices to get it wet - and bring it to my mouth to get a taste. So hot and sticky and sweet. 

You, can't help yourself from being a stupid whore, think that this is your chance and focus all your energy into kneeing me in the face.

I see your remarkable thighs tense up, reaching behind your leg when you move to knee me I guide you by the back of your knee past my head, and past your center of balance - I hold my left hand out with my middle two fingers up as you sit right not to them. Your pussy is so wet my fingers slip all the way in you and its my hand in your cunt and my other hand behind your knee keeping balance.

First of all, when should I begin to look into graduate schools?  I'm about to begin my junior year of college, and I know that a few people seemed shocked that I have already narrowed down my list of schools to which I would like to apply.  Secondly, how important is GPA as a factor for graduate school admissions, particularly for clinical psychology programs?  Mine is less than stellar, but I go to one of the top liberal arts colleges in the country, and grade deflation is a big enough problem that my college attaches a letter to our transcripts explaining this.  I will have had research experience, experience working as a lab intern, and I anticipate my GRE scores to be high.  I am also involved in my school's neuroscience club as an extracurricular.  My third question involves my major.  I am majoring in neuroscience and minoring in psychology, so that I will have taken all of the relevant psychology courses needed for graduate school.  But will the fact that I am not a psychology major in any way reduce my chances, or affect my ability to compete with psychology majors?

I have a lot of other questions, but those are the main ones.  Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this!"

* I'm always tired, sleep too much, totally crazy sleep schedule

* I have lots of anxiety and guilty about how I neglect myself (and other stuff)

* Can not focus my attention, procrastinate too much, no self control

* Eat too much, too much computer games, too much masturbation

* Never had a girlfriend

* I can't hold responsibilities, I'm too unreliable

* Always miss deadlines and I'm constantly anxious over it

* It's like I'm not living my life, but instead I just wait and kill time. It's like I live in a prison

And more importantly, in the last years I've not really achieved anything, and I've failed at every task I committed myself into. I'm about to graduate university.. and I've been for more than 2 years. I'm stuck at my undergraduate course for, believe it, 8 years. I made a point in graduating this semester but this won't be possible. Among other things, I've yet to write a single page of my final year project. That's a nightmare.

In my teens I supposed I had depression but now I'm not entirely sure. I had some really bad crisis in my teens and almost killed myself (I'm okay now), but perhaps I have also other kind of issues (perhaps attention deficit or some kind of anxiety disorder, or both). I never saw a doctor over it or had any kind of diagnosis.

But actually this stuff isn't important (it's, like, context), I'm here to ask for advice.

Like the title says, I'm 25 and never had a job. I had an internship in a startup and was sent home in about two months because I always arrived late or sometimes didn't show up. I've finally decided that I should seek some kind of professional help. It might or might not make things better, but my issue is, what next.

Believe it or not, I've marketable skills; I'm graduating in computer engineering and there's a job market in my area, and I've actually some proficiency in computer programming, electronics, this kind of stuff. But how can I possibly apply for a job with this kind of ""curriculum""? What exactly can I say? Should I just say I've been depressed or something like this? How can I possibly explain that I haven't seek professional help?

I suppose being upfront and honest is always the best option. But mentioning my issues in an interview is like sabotaging my little chance of someday having a normal life. Who would hire someone like me? I wouldn't.

Has anyone here been in this situation?

I just had the realization that I *shouldn't* pursue my ""dream"" of going to grad school and eventually be an university teacher. And definitively not before I work a regular job for some years. It's pretty pathetic that I can't write a stupid undergraduate thesis; or that I've been almost a decade in an undergraduate course and haven't published any paper, even in local conferences. Instead I should, you know, work.

That's kind of a powerful realization."

This was a polarised light film which made it impossible to see the screen unless you were facing it directly ([illustration](http://www.officemax.com/technology/computer-accessories/glare-screens-privacy-filters/product-prod3800594)). Later when I did my internship there I saw that everyone in the office that I worked with had their laptops covered with a similar film that made it impossible to see the screen. At the time I didn't think much of it since I didn't really have anything to hide, but lately I've been travelling at work a lot, which means I have to work when commuting, which means I'm working with confindential information in an open space.

I've been trying to find more information about these films but the only thing I can find is the [3M filters](http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3MScreens_NA/Protectors/Shop_Products/Product_Catalog/~?N=5019651&amp;rt=c3). These, however, only have 1 year warranty which leads me to believe they are not as good as you'd expect. The ones I saw in Japan was extremely good and it only took a few degrees to each side before you couldn't see anything on the screen, whereas the ones they used for cellphones could be viewed even at about a 30 degree angle.

Anyone here have a suggestion for a long-lasting, highly polarised film for computer screens like this?"

-Brief background-  
(Copied from old post)  
I work in a software company as the Head of Support for the APAC region. Mostly we deal with support tickets from our clients regarding our software but occasionally we get some internal tickets for general support.  
  
Normally Satisfied Customer (NSC): A bubbly lady in her 30s that is generally pretty happy with how the system works  
  
-The Story-  
Returning to the office after a quick trip to the coffee shop I notice a bright pink post it note on my screen.    
&gt;NSC called for you. Something about her iPad version not downloading. Seemed a little mad -Intern
Very informative... our iPad application has had some issues downloading in the past but NSC's version has been working flawlessly for months at this point, definitely odd. I decide to get as much information from the intern who took the message as I can before calling her back.  
&gt;Me: Hi Intern, did you have anymore information for me regarding NSC's call?  
&gt; Intern: Oh Hide, only that she's very angry for some reason and I can't reproduce the issue.  
She shows me her iPad, I check the version number on our application and it is NSCs companies' version. Very odd.    
&gt; Me: Did you do a clean install for this version?  
&gt;Intern: {Other Intern} passed me this iPad and it was already on there. He said it was from this morning when he was doing testing.  
I wish they'd just say no. I finish up with Intern and take the iPad back to my desk.   
Alright lets do a quick test. Delete the iPad application, navigate to NSC's installer page, click the download button and... Error, Unable to download this application at this time. Well da1mn, the client IS always right.  
Flummoxed as to how a page that has been working flawlessly for months suddenly breaks I begin my investigation. Modified date of the installer page? Months ago. Hmm. Link within the installer page? Pointing to the right place. Maybe the FTP server where the file is hosted is down? That's a troubling thought, if it was I'd spend the rest of the day putting out fires. I ping the server and get a response, phew.  
Next step is to Remote in, navigate to where the .ipa file is and... it's gone. I look at it in disbelief. somebody actually  deleted the file from the FTP in the last few hours. I asked around but no body was owning up to the mistake. Ah well easy enough fix. I restore the file and retest, download begins and installs successfully.  
Time to call my possibly furious client.  
&gt; Me: Hi NSC, it's Hide from {Company Name} how are you?  
&gt; NSC: Hi Hide! I am doing extremely well, did you here we passed our audit with flying colours!?  
She continues to chat to me in her normal bubbly tone, didn't Intern say she was furious?  
&gt; NSC: But I suppose we need to talk about the iPad version.  
&gt; Me: Actually I already found a small issue in the installer page. Not sure why it was changed but the URL was pointing to the wrong place. I fixed it and should be working now.  
Please please please.  
&gt;NSC: Excellent! I suppose that is it then. I'll test it an email if I have any further problems.  
Can't help myself.  
&gt;Me: Are there any other issues you need help with? Intern mentioned you were pretty frustrated earlier.  
&gt;NSC: Oh that! She just sounded so nervous on the phone, I couldn't help myself!

27p69a,4,2014-06-09,Should I stay at UT Austin and major in Electrical and Computer Engineering or transfer to the University of Michigan (or another school) as a Computer Science major?,Sekrim,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27p69a/should_i_stay_at_ut_austin_and_major_in/,"I came to UT to study computer science and math. It was my first choice college, and I'm glad I came to UT. I came in as a math major because I wasn't accepted into CS with a 3.8. They told me to get my grades up and apply again, so I applied again but with a 3.97 GPA, but was still denied because the department has reached capacity. I can't reapply until Fall 2015. I just finished my freshman year, (19 year old) and I would be almost a junior by the time I applied again, if I got in at all. And it would be the last time I can apply.

I'm looking to apply at UMich, UWashington, UIUC, Cornell, and maybe UCLA for January 2015 too. If I wait to apply for Fall 2015, I can also apply to Berkeley and Caltech too. But those are kind of a longshot. Also, I could apply to UT CS again. And I would have more than 3 weeks to move; I'd have the whole summer. I only mention Michigan in the title, because that seems to be the school I think I could most likely get into.

So I'm left with two options. I can probably transfer to the University of Michigan and major in Computer Science and Mathematics in January 2015. Or I can stay at UT, and be an Electrical and Computer Engineering major and maybe reapply Fall 2015.

Obviously having to move would be a pain. Plus transfer credit would push graduation back a year if I did. But at least I could major in computer science. My career goal was to get degrees in CS and math, then get a CS PhD from a top 10 university in CS, then become a research scientist in industry. I could still get into CS PhD programs with an ECE degree, but I'd prefer to have a CS degree. Luckily UT ECE has a specialization in Software Engineering which is somewhat similar to CS. And the University of Michigan is a great school too! Maybe I could come back to UT for grad school.

As far as jobs go, I wanted to intern at Microsoft, Facebook, Google, NASA JPL, SpaceX, and cool places like that. I'm more interested in programming than the hardware side of things. One thing I do know is that I definitely want to be working in California when I'm done with college. What would better help me achieve those goals? 

Anyway, what should I do?

This is a X-post from [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/27ibyo/should_i_stay_at_ut_austin_and_major_in/), but I thought I'd get better advice here."

This is a brand new position in this company, so I can't ask them what they generally offer for this position, right? The other negotiation threads I've read on here have a salary range to work with. I don't want to ask for too much bc my education is so irrelevant that they might rethink my candidacy..

Years back, shortly after I graduated college, I got my starry-eyed self into a internship with a nicely-sized contracting company that did IT work for a large local company (LLC).  Fortunately, the large company knew how to do security, and had an isolated lab environment they used for testing new technologies and doing pre-deployments of software.  I, along with several other interns, was tasked with assisting the large company in re-wiring the lab with updated ethernet cabling, new switches, the whole nine yards.  Simultaneous to that, my company (via another contract) was also helping LLC beta test some new software my company had produced for them.  

I use the term produced loosely, because we had actually purchased it and then spent considerable time and money customizing it to meet the customer’s needs.  For this particular test deployment, they had a consultant in house that was a SME on the original software to help troubleshoot any problems.  

And of course there were.  There are two types of deployments -- failed ones, and ones you don't realize have failed.

Unfortunately he was pretty stumped by the error messages, and caught our attention by asking if he could email it to his colleagues.

No can do.  Isolated network.  But here’s a floppy (yes, back in those days…).

By this point he’s attracted a gaggle of gawkers, myself included.  Yeah, we were bored, but you would be too if you’d been making cables all day.

He takes a screenshot of the whole screen (not just the error window, mind you), copies it to paint and saves it to disk as a bitmap, and tries to copy to the floppy.

We watch in silence.  We all know there’s no way it’ll fit.

The copy fails.  Too big.  Stumped, he looks around at the LLC employees.  “CD Burner?”  Nope.  Too expensive still to be standard equipment in the lab.

With bated breath we lean in, watching him closely.  Surely this highly paid, senior, technical consultant should be able to solve this problem.  After all, any of us interns could, but speaking up could mean getting labeled a trouble-maker or smart-ass and we all wanted to be permanently hired after the summer.

One of the LLC employees finally got tired of the consultant staring ineffectually at the computer screen and suggested he convert it to a smaller format, say, a jpeg?

His eyes cloud over in confusion. 

Convert?

Convert?

His hand trembling, he mouses over to the file on the computer.  

Convert?

Rusting gears turned in his head.  His thought process seemed almost tangible at that point.  Convert?  Convert like change?  How to change?  Change… change name!

He right-clicks the file, selects “Rename”, deletes the extension and replaces it with .jpg.

Oxygen levels in the room dropped dangerously low as everyone inhaled.  Oh.  No.  He.  Didn’t!

But we couldn’t laugh either.  Too smart-assy.  Definitely not something to do in front of the customer.  LLC employee was already giving us the side-eye.  I think deep down he didn’t want us to ruin it and tell him how to do it, that he wanted to see the consultant fail.

After successfully changing the file extension, Mr. Highly Paid Consultant starts to drag and drop the file to the floppy drive again.  We can hardly contain ourselves.  Schadenfreude begins early in the tech sector.

LLC employee stepped in, breaking the spell.  “I’m sorry but I’m pretty sure that’s not going to work.”  Damn it.  He gives us a look.  “Don’t you guys have work you should be doing?”

Double damn it.  We went back to terminating cables.  White-green, green, white-orange, blue… We may have been stuck building and testing cat5 but for just a minute, just a minute, we were all smarter than the highly paid consultant."

27pqw2,9,2014-06-09,"Tips for expanding my network in the Electronics, Semiconductor and IT Industries?",Jonas223XC,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/27pqw2/tips_for_expanding_my_network_in_the_electronics/,"Hi /r/engineering 

First, a bit of background about me: I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at a top 50 research University looking to finish up my M.S. at the end of the summer. Naturally, this means that I am actively in the job hunt. 

I've come to the conclusion for a variety of reasons that I would enjoy working in the technology, IT, Electronics, and/or semiconductor industries. I have succeeded in getting a few interviews in these industries (most notably for Hardware/Thermal Design positions at Cisco and HP), and everybody that I have talked with who works in those industries has told me that I am a smart, likable guy who is an all-around great candidate for their company. 

However, for a variety of reasons that seem to be unrelated to my qualifications, these leads have not actually resulted in my Employment (i.e. an available position has been closed to budget restrictions/layoffs or they were unable to find a position that is right for a college grad with my background, etc) . 

The main issue that I have seems to be not with making myself more appealing to employers: while I am not going to act like I am perfect (in fact I am eager to learn all that I can when I enter the working world) I think that I have basically all of the accomplishments that a new college grad should have. All of the ""goodies"" that employers like to see from a new college grad like a 3.7+ Graduate and Undergraduate GPA from a respected school, Months of research experience for my Thesis in a widely applicable field (in my case, that field is Computational Fluid Dynamics), three summers of engineering internship experience, etc I have.

My issue is that, whenever I apply to the companies that I want to work for on their website I rarely if ever get a response. When I do get a chance to actually talk to people about myself and what I do I seem to impress, but getting past the ""automated website"" barrier and on to the ""talking to people"" phase of the hiring process has proven to be difficult.

Most of the interviews that I have succeeded in getting have come from connections that I made from family and friends, and leveraging those connections to get in contact with the right people at those respective companies. Applying on company websites all day and  getting automated rejection emails weeks later is about as depressing as can be. So to avoid doing that further I would like to go about expanding my network, but I am unsure of how exactly to go about doing that. 

So I guess the tl;dr is: how can I go about reaching out to other Engineers and recruiters in these industries? Those of you who are in those industries (or others who have been in a similar position as I have described), how did you get your foot in the door? "
27pu6m,1,2014-06-09,I just want someone to understand what I'm going through.,shatonbylife,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/27pu6m/i_just_want_someone_to_understand_what_im_going/,"I'm about to turn twenty and while I've been incredibly fortunate in certain aspects of my life, a lack of money has kicked me down again and again, and none of my friends understand this. I've got nobody to talk to about this and I feel alone.

My family has enough money to get by now, but a few years ago my mom was unable to find work for a long time, and it resulted in the family bank account diving down to just over $200. We were so close to having no money at all, think about that. One trip to the movies would have cost 10% of all the money we had.

We were just getting by and there were just things I couldn't afford which make me feel like I'm not living, I'm just surviving. We could never afford braces, so now my teeth are completely fucked. I could maybe get them now, but really my only two options are to graduate from university with terrible teeth or with braces. I'm very self conscious of both options and its just a nightmare for me. I look in the mirror and think, "" Jesus, who would ever want to date a guy who can't smile without looking like a freak? Who would want to date a 20 year old with braces?""

On top of that I didn't ask anyone out after grade 9 out of embarrassment for my family's financial situation. I couldn't afford to go with my best friends on a grad trip. I keep seeing peers on Facebook going to Cuba, Spain, Italy, France, Australia, and I can't do that. I can't afford to get on a plane anywhere because it would ruin me. I was born and raised in another country and I haven't seen my extended family for years because of this. I miss them so much and I can't see them, it makes me feel like a failure.

 I had the grades to get me into the best schools in my country but had to settle for a mediocre one because I couldn't afford residence and it was the only one I could reasonably commute to. This distresses me the most. I worked my ass off and I could have gone to very prestigious schools, and now I get made fun of for the one I had to settle for. 

Even to afford that one I have to work night shifts year round while taking on a full course load of engineering classes. Its destroying my body and my brain, I'm disrupting my circadian rhythms on an almost daily basis, and I have no choice. Even with student loans I can't afford school unless I work that job. My friends are having their school paid for by their parents and I'm killing myself just to afford what the loans don't cover.

 I lack the free time to do anything other than study, work, and try to sleep a little from September to may, so I haven't even begun trying to date. All my friends talk about their girlfriends or hookups at res and i'm living with my parents and haven't even begun to experience any of it. I'm so fucking tired of living like this.

I feel like nobody understands the situation I'm in. I have to work twice as hard to get half as far as those around me. I have half the opportunities that students at schools I couldn't afford do, regardless of the fact that I work much harder. Employers barely gave a shit that I've pulled 16 hour shifts while at school full time. I couldn't get an internship this year because my school barely has an internship programm. Its just the student job hunting by themselves. The university does fuck-all to help us out. I know a friend who got set up with a $30/h internships by their school on their grades alone. He didn't even send in a resume. And here my dumb ass is praying for employers to give me a pity job.

I'm going to graduate with much, much less life experience than any of my friends, the same if not worse financial situation as them, no significant other whatsoever, and probably schizophrenia from how I treat my sleep cycle after four years of absolutely busting my ass to barely afford school.

And I just feel like nobody understands that. None of my friends, as far as I know, could relate to what I've had to and will have to go through. I just want to talk to someone who understands and sympathises with me, but everywhere I turn its like my peers are living on another world.

I just feel so alone."

I don't know where to begin.",reprs22,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/27pul8/shut_in_for_over_a_decade_no_friends_or_anyone_to/,"So the title kinda says it all. It'd be too much to explain how I got into this situation but I suppose it all began with depression. School was rough for me because I had severe social anxiety that went undiagnosed and untreated. I was home-schooled and got my diploma early. After that I basically just crawled down into a hole and here I've been since. It's been just over 11 years now.

Over this period of time I've only left my house 5 times. I don't have any friends online or offline, no assets, the only family I have are my 2 parents who are ""functional"" alcoholics who seem try and forget that I'm even in the basement, my daily routine over all these years has been wake up, turn on my PC, and sit there until I go to bed, and to top it all off I live pretty much in the middle of nowhere.

I really don't know what to do. For lack of a better word, I get something called ""planning shock"" when I try to think about steps I need to take to get out of this or ways to improve my life I get a sort of mental block that locks me up, kind of like trying to remember something that isn't quite there. My eyes will roll to the back of my head and it's just nothing.. blank.

Since I don't have any friends or anyone to talk to, I'm really at a loss. I don't know what's out there, what tools are available to me. I'm an adult but I feel like I know just about as much as a 10 year old.

I'm turning to this place for advice. What would you do in my situation? 

I've already tried getting jobs. I've put in hundreds and hundreds of applications for internships and everything but never has anyone followed up. There is nothing around here but farm land and I don't have transportation. 

To be honest I feel completely trapped. "
27pzah,3,2014-06-09,Should I take an internship that wants to classify me as an independent contractor?,ngc_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27pzah/should_i_take_an_internship_that_wants_to/,"I was recently offered an internship in the Bay Area for the rest of the summer. All seemed fine until I started reading through the internship agreement they just emailed me today. Apparently they are wanting to classify me as an ""independent contractor"". I'm guessing this is probably a way of getting around not paying health insurance for short term interns (and saving on some tax fees for them). I'm fine with the no insurance part (I already have insurance), but the rest is starting to look a bit shady.

According to the IRS, an Independent Contractor is:

&gt; If you are an independent contractor, you are self-employed. 
&gt; You are not an independent contractor if you perform services that can be controlled by an employer (what will be done and how it will be done). This applies even if you are given freedom of action. What matters is that the employer has the legal right to control the details of how the services are performed.
&gt; If an employer-employee relationship exists (regardless of what the relationship is called), you are not an independent contractor and your earnings are generally not subject to Self-Employment Tax.

After some research, it seems that every place I've looked says that interns can NOT be classified as independent contractors. A general consensus is that an IC is someone who the company can assign a task and a due date, but has no control over how, where, or when they accomplish it. They are also supposed to supply all of their own resources (computer, etc).

As an IC, they won't withhold taxes, and I'll be subject to self employment taxes, adding up to 15.3%. They're offering $20 an hour, which seems alright, except this is the Bay Area. Having that extra tax requirement is going to make it fairly hard to afford living there even for just the summer, I think.

It just seems rather fishy, and not even legal from everything I've read. Anybody run into this before? Any thoughts? I guess my options are: just take it as is, call them out on it and ask to be classified as an employee (which they probably wouldn't), or ask for about 7.5% more pay to offset my extra tax requirement."

27q7u9,3,2014-06-09,Me [19 F] feeling like a failure in the eyes of my Dad [52 M]. Feeling suicidal.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27q7u9/me_19_f_feeling_like_a_failure_in_the_eyes_of_my/,"I'm reusing an old throwaway account that I used for this subreddit. I would really appreciate any support and advice you guys have to offer.

So to preface this, I guess I should do a quick backstory on my father. He grew up the oldest of 4 sons to a father who was a Ph. D. chemist who valued his work more than his family. My dad always seemed to strive to impress his own Dad, but the latter was never really around nor did he appreciate just how fucking smart my Dad was. Needless to say, this sort of behavior rubbed off on my Dad.

He graduated from Brown University to attend Harvard immediately afterward as a graduate student in hopes of becoming a professor there. In the meantime, he met my Mom there, and then earned his Ph. D. However, Harvard didn't see him suitable to be a professor, so he spent 20 years of his life mad and bitter at Harvard that he didn't achieve his dream job. He currently works in a respectable position with very good pay, so it's not like his life is horrible, but he still feels resentment and regret as to what happened to him.

Another point I feel like I should mention is that one of his brothers also attended Brown as part of their pre-med program. However, he took on too much and had a mental breakdown that left him debilitated. My mother (my dad's girlfriend at the time) was very concerned and helped him get back into a stable state of mind while my dad actually felt /embarassed/ that his brother wasn't doing well to the point that he didn't like to be associated with him. This becomes relevant in my story.



So now, it's my backstory. I just finished my first year of college and it was rocky, but I don't regret a single thing that happened. First semester was a joy: I met so many wonderful people and did well in all my classes. But in my second semester, I had a bit of a falling out with my best friend when I went insane from being a constant third wheel (hence my account name). But my friends were very supportive and kept me strong.

Last semester, I took four courses which I will call A, B, C, and D. I was advised by my advisor that most students found it difficult to put courses B and C together in the same semester or putting courses B and D together. Course A was notorious for being one of the most difficult classes taught in the entire school, and pretty much everyone in my major has horror stories of that class. It's reputation is that about 66% of all students who start the course end up dropping it after the first test.

I looked over my future schedule, and realized that I would need to take B and C or B and D together anyway because they were all prerequisite courses and I needed them if I wanted to advance in my curriculum, as I had switched majors and was a bit behind in my studies. So I devised a plan that I would register for all four courses and plan on dropping one of them partway through the semester. I ended up dropping D.

I can say with /absolute certainty/ that taking B and C together did not affect my grades. B was by far one of the easiest classes I've taken, and I excelled in it and became friendly with the professor. Using quotes to differentiate between class name and grade, I earned an ""A-"" in the class, as expected. Class C was attrocioius since my school doesn't curve grades at all even when test averages are around 50%. Ironically, I got a ""C-"" in Class C. And in Class A, I had several mental breakdowns from stress almost every week. It was miserable, but I learned a lot and still passed with a ""D+"". I mean sure, it's disappointing getting such low a grade, but I've learned I can't regret what I've done. I worked my fucking ass off, and in the end it paid off because I passed. If in the future I feel like I need a higher grade, I'll retake the course my senior year when I've definitely become better at the material.



So I'm back home for the summer, and I've just started an internship that's close to home with great pay and even better professors and connections available. My friends are some of the most amazing people I've met, and I've got all my limbs and fingers. I can safely say that when I look at my life, I'm blessed and doing well for myself.

But this isn't how I feel like my parents, especially my father, feel about me.

The day before my Class A final, I was having a mental breakdown at college. Sobbing my eyes out and constantly depressed, all I wanted was for someone to tell me that life sucks at the moment but everything will be okay. So I called my mom, but all I get is that she feels that the field I'm in isn't what I should be pursuing - after expressing multiple times that she thought I would be pursuing the field I'm currently in - and that it's stupid to think that I'm aiming for a job that would make my father proud of me. She also thought that all the drama I had with my friends was a complete waste of time and that I should have instead ignored them and focused on my academics 24/7 even though I knew that I would become even more insane had I done that.

I ended up telling her off and saying that I regret nothing of what I've done. And that's the truth. My dad regretted everything he did when he was a graduate student, and he's become miserable about it since. I don't want to be that guy; I want to keep moving forward and accepting that what happened happened and I should be proud of what I've done. Since then, she still mentions that I should, ""learn to listen to people, like what my advisor said about taking the classes together"" even though I've told her repeatedly that it didn't make a difference on my grades.

But then there's my father. In every instance growing up, whenever I would get a bad grade, my mom would tell me to never tell my father about it and keep it a secret from him. And at the moment, that's what we're doing with my Class A and Class C grades, telling him stuff like we need to request a transcript from my university and then they'll send it to us in a few weeks. But the pressure of keeping this a secret and feeling like I should be /ashamed/ of the grade I've earned has made me feel more stressed and less confident.

It got so bad that when I was going to a concert with my dad yesterday, I just started thinking about school. But thinking about school and how I felt like a failure in my dad's eyes because I didn't do well in a few classes somehow lead to thoughts of suicide, causing me to start tearing up during the concert. I wasn't sobbing, but the tears wouldn't stop, and I kept forcing myself to count the keys on the piano to calm myself down. My dad turned to me a few times, but then he would turn away as if to pretend that we weren't together. After the concert, he got mad at me when I didn't want to discuss why I was so upset and demanded that I tell my mom. When we arrived back at the house, he yelled, ""It's your fault for taking those classes together!"" and stormed off into a different room while I retreated to my bedroom.

When my mom came in, I refused to talk to her about it too since up to this point whenever I want to tell her how upset I am her advice has only made me think about what I SHOULD have done rather than what I can do now. Heck, I don't really like talking to her because in one way or another it seems to lead to her criticizing me like about how I play video games for fun when I should be doing something productive /in my free time/.

I eventually told her briefly that the reason why I was upset was because I had suicidal thoughts yesterday, and her response was to tell me how I should eat healthier and that she feels like she's ""failed me"". She said she found a psychologist that she'll set up an appointment with, but that probably won't happen for a while hence why I'm just writing my feelings out here until I consult a professional.

Today was the first day of my internship, and in the middle of one of the lectures I started tearing up again just thinking about this whole thing. Even as I'm writing this out now I'm tearing up. I don't want to hate my parents, but I do. My dad has been in no way supportive of me, and every attempt to ""bond"" with me has always been something he wants to do. If I told him about the grades, he would be lashing out at me every day about how I'm spending too much time playing games. My mom would be relaying to me about how much my dad is lashing out at /her/ because of how much of a failure I am.

All I want to do is just sit them down and tell my dad how much I hate him for making me feel like absolute fucking shit. I don't want to live a life where I'm never going to impress him and be a constant embarrassment to him. It's making me feel sick and not able to feel like I deserve to have fun.

What should I do? At the moment, the tears have escalated to sobbing, so I'm thankful that I'm in my room right now where no one can be near me. I miss being happy or proud of myself.

Sorry that this was so long.

Am I just being silly?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/27q8er/why_am_i_so_sad_am_i_just_being_silly/,"After months of job-hunting after graduating from university, my SO finally got a great job a few weeks ago and I couldn't be happier for him.

But while he was  unemployed, he'd been staying with me in my university accommodation for weeks on end and sleeping on my floor when he wasn't at his parents' house or needed a place to stay to commute to an internship or interview. And as a result, over the course of this past year, he seeped into every corner of my room: his socks in my dresser, his shampoo in my bathroom, his books on my bookshelf. My room began to feel like ""our room""; we'd tidy it together, do laundry together and go to sleep together.

Last night, when he collected his things to move down to his new flat, he got really upset and said things like he wished I could come with him and he didn't want to leave me (which is unusual for him, since he's very ""stiff upper lip"" about most things). I think he was just having a last-minute anxiety spell about moving after a very stressful first week, but a lot of what he said resonated with me.

I'm in my room now, his air mattress tucked away under my bed for the first time in ages, and I feel so incredibly lonely. I know he's going to come up to visit again this weekend and he's only a few hours away, but I still feel like I've lost something.

A lot of debt. I was pressured in to going to college. My parents did the pressuring but guess what, they couldn't help me pay so I got stuck with an ever growing pile of student loans in order to go to school. I thought I would love my chosen field (which is architecture) but I don't. I like it enough to make a career out of it but I don't love it. After 6 years of school (4 UG and 2 Grad), my debt will be in the triple digits. $126K to be more exact and that is with working as a manager at a restaurant for 4 of the 6 years. I knew it was bad but I didn't realize just how bad it was until I added up all the different loans last night. Then I went and calculated how much the minimum payments for each loan will be once I graduate next May. $1500. $1500 will be my MINIMUM monthly payment for the next 10 years. That is a fucking mortgage payment! I don't know how I'm going to pay for that as well as have a life. The average salary for a fresh out of school intern is about $36,000 gross where I live which is roughly $2,000/month net. That means I have $500/month for living expenses. How do I live off of that?? I know I will have to live with my Mom or Dad for a while but they both have mentioned me paying rent to live with them as well as taking over my cell phone bill and car insurance. Those were the only 2 bills the cover, everything else I pay for.  

None of my friends know what this knot in my stomach feels like because their parents paid for their schooling and anyone that does have loans only has enough to make their payments around $300/mo so I have no one to talk this through with. I am going to have no money for the next 10 years. I am really scared that something will happen and I won't be able to pay for it. I'm basically fucked from all angles. If I just work one job I can have a social life and very little money but if I work more than one job I won't be able to have a social life but I will have more money. I'm just at a loss for how this is going to work out. 

TL:DR; Got fucked by student loans and now I'm in massive debt"

**Why I chose what I bought.**

**4770k** - Was going to go for 4670k, but I stumbled upon a 4770k on sale and I figured it would be useful for video editing and rendering that I do every now and then.

**CLC Over Air** - IMO, CLC's look a lot cleaner, nicer, and prettier than large air coolers. Plus, with the Swiftech fans, the H100i cools my 4770k very nicely.

**8GB of RAM** - At RAM's current prices, I really couldn't afford 16GB. Another 8GB is planned for the future though, to fill up those two extra slots.

**Two SSDs** - I bought the first one a couple years ago when it was on sale at the local Memory Express. Pretty cheap (can't remember exactly what I paid for it) and worth it. Then, a certain friend who will be mentioned later, happened to have an extra. So I picked that up.

**Two HDDs** - Nothing special here. Ran out of space on one, bought another.

**280x** - IMO, this model of 280x looks *insanely* good. It's great. Quiet, cool, and plays all the games I want to on high settings on 1440p.

**EVGA 750W PSU** - On sale at local Memory Express, needed a modular PSU. Gold rated was an extra bonus.

**Windows 8.1 Pro** - I did not pay 250 dollars for this, so don't call me insane. I have it thanks to a very good friend, and owe lots to.

**1440p IPS** - I was running on an old 21.5"" 1080p TN monitor for a year and some, and I really wanted a 1440p monitor. The same friend I mentioned in the SSD section had one for sale, so I picked that up off of him.

**H440** - IMO, this case is very clean, sleek, and stylish. A lot of small but useful things like the screws for the side panel don't completely come off, so you don't drop them and lose them.

**The white, blue, and black theme** - I've always loved the colours white and blue (no, not racist.) and I figured a touch of black would look very nice. As you can see from the album, it does. It turned out amazing, and I hope you agree with me.

***HONOURABLE MENTIONS:***

*/u/Jappetto* - A truly amazing person. I met him just over a year ago, yet he has been a great friend. He helped me with picking parts, finding deals, and other things. He was the friend mentioned in the SSD and monitor section. He also was the one who sleeved the cables for me and helped with the H440. Most of this build is because of him. I could go on forever about him, and I cannot thank him enough.

*/u/AnimalFarmPig* - Another good friend. We became friends when he offered me an internship of sorts with where he worked. Gave me experience in the web development area, and I owe him lots. He was the friend who helped with Windows.

*/u/alok99* - Another great friend. Helped me pick parts out, and helped with personal stuff too. Two words. Hom and butts. ^(Dumb inside jokes, sorry.)

*/u/n0Obpcbuilder* - Another good friend. Love picking on him, but he knows I'm not serious &lt;3

*/u/othtim* - An awesome friend. Helped me learn some basic networking stuff. Always fun to joke with.

*/u/IncendiaryPlatypus* - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

*/u/Firebolt1914* - Cuz he cried.

*/u/filleman123* - For the Swedish snapchats!

*The BaPC IRC* - This is where I met all of these good people. This is where my knowledge began to grow. This is what made this build happen. Some people are nice. Some are douchebags. But I have to thank them.

**And last, but definitely not least, shameless plug to www.homstardware.com!**

Thanks for taking the time to check my build out. Ideas, questions, and constructive criticism are all welcomed."

I've done SOME dabbling outside of school, but nothing substantial and it almost feels like it would be embarrassing to mention it in an interview. Stuff like a flash game (that's half broken and bad, made it after freshman year), going through other peoples' Javascript games to help bugfix (again nothing substantial and nothing documented), and using programs to solve trivial problem's I've had (like finding all valid permutations of letter=number arrangements for a math/crypto puzzle I was trying to solve, or doing crude simulations to find the probability of something because too lazy to math). 

I've also lightly participated in a competitive programming group called Codeburners, but I never went to the meetings and never won any of the competitions (participated in 3, solved 2 problems on average out of 6, though they were made to be difficult so that score was pretty average). 

But yeah, outside of those things, I have NOTHING other than my degree. I felt like it would get me pretty far, but without internships or a portfolio I feel like it'll be impossible. And to add insult to injury, I had to move and stay within the area to keep my sales job, and if I don't get a real job offer by August, I'm going to have to relocate again.

I'm starting to diversify my job search (so far I've primarily searched in one or two cities, though I'm willing to relocate almost anywhere). I just don't know what I can do or what I can say to get a job in the meantime. Are there are resources to help me out? Would you suggest I make something for a portfolio, and if so, what? Would it be too late or a bad idea to go ahead and take on an internship if one was offered somewhere? Should I just BS the hell out of my resume and speed-learn the topics relevant to position before the interview rolls around (something I definitely feel I'm capable of, school definitely prepared me to do that).

I know I'm not the only one who's ever been in this position, so any advice is welcome =)"

27qpv6,10,2014-06-09,Need help assembling a basic wardrobe for my first professional job,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/27qpv6/need_help_assembling_a_basic_wardrobe_for_my/,"**Long post ahead, TL;DR below. Thanks for the help!**

Hey all- I'm a rising senior in college and have an internship this summer with a government agency. I looked up the dress code and it is as follows:

Monday-Thursday:

* Blazers, suit, or sport coats
* Dress slacks
* Ties
* Dress shirts with collars and buttons
* Dress Shoes

Friday:

* Sport coats or blazers
* Slacks, Chinos, or Dockers
* Polo shirts with collars
* Oxford button-down shirts
* Sweaters, cardigans
* Loafers and huaraches

I have enough stuff to survive Fridays I think but I'm seriously lacking in the professional attire for the rest of the week.

As a college student I'm not quite swimming in cash and over the past few years I grew a few inches and outgrew a lot of my old dress clothes. I can still make them work for the occasional formal event but I know they aren't going to cut it for a real job.

Here's what I have:

Outer layers:

* Navy J-crew blazer (good fit)
* Black calvin klein blazer (decent fit, could use tailoring)
* Black suit (tailored slim fit, good quality)

Shirts:

* White dress shirt, no breast pocket (decent fit, needs tailoring. I think it's intended to be worn with a suit only but I'm not sure?)

Slacks:

* Nothing (other than the slacks that go with the suit)

Shoes:

* Black, sort of pointed toed lace up shoes from Aldo. (Really shitty quality, I'd never purchase from them again)

So clearly I'm lacking a few items. What I think I need:

* Maybe one more blazer/sport coat to go with the navy and black ones, especially since black isn't very versatile
* 2-3 pairs of slacks. I'd love color recommendations and what color blazers and shirts to match them to.
* 2-3 new dress shirts. What fabric should I get and what colors? I assume pretty basic, conservative colors are good, i.e. white, light blue, and maybe a salmon/pink as well.
* Dark brown dress shoes
* *Maybe* another suit, from somewhere cheap, in dark grey? Unless another color (light grey, navy, pinstripes, etc...) would be better

I have a dark brown belt and a black belt and plenty of ties so I should be set there. I have a friend who works at J-Crew who can get me a discount, so I was thinking I'd do that for everything other than the suit, and get the suit somewhere cheap i.e. Men's Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and get it tailored.

**TL;DR: Wardrobe is lacking, looking for the basics to get me going on a business professional dress code. I'm mainly looking for recommendations on what styles/colors of blazers, shirts and slacks to get to work with what I have already, as well as what style and color of dress shoes I should get that can work with everything. I want to get as versatile of a wardrobe as I can in as few items as possible. Sorry for the long post, any advice appreciated!**"

I am a senior, and graduating soon. I have a nice internship, but want to pursue some extra education in order to ensure job security. The companies I have been offered jobs/talked with about post bac positions all have some type of tuition match so it wouldn't be so bad to pay for.

In my area, we have two well known CS schools. One offers a masters in CS the other a masters in Software Engineering. 

I was wondering which one of these programs is generally the best for someone who wants to work as lead developer at a large software company?

Also, how important is the school's name for a CS/Software Engineering Masters? One of the schools here is a top 10, the other a top 50. But I've also looked into online programs that may be easier for me to complete.

Thanks!

* 23
* BA in Political Science, International Relations, Asian American Studies
* Graduated from a Big Ten School last year
* $55k in student loans, I was reckless with them.
* 2.87 GPA

Other things:

* I intended to go to graduate school for SE Asian Studies and hoped to work in the intelligence field or foreign policy/state department. I thought it was a good career choice because of the ""pivot towards Asia"".
* I spoke with the dean to the graduate program and she really turned me off about it. She seemed to not like me, questioned my academics (I would too if I came to her with a 2.87), and spoke about how the entire program has no funding for me. It simply turned me off, plus I don't want to go into academia.
* I'm joining the National Guard in a few months. I wanted a career as an active duty military officer but missed my chance at ROTC due to some complication. I don't believe my GPA is competitive enough for OCS, and I have a GF that does not like the idea of moving out of state. This is sort of a compromise and I can use the educational benefits to go back to school if I want.
* I have experience only in non-profit and internships at my state's house of rep. I don't want a career in non-profit, at least community based ones. There is no money in it and I do not like working for small, unorganized non-profits that lack good missions (I found out I am a great worker when the mission is something I resonate with). I want to break into maybe corporate, marketing, or government.

I guess what I'm asking is, where do I go? My passions seem to have died and I really just want a job after my NG training that pays decent. I'm focused less on my career and more on money, because, I feel incredibly pressured by my girlfriend, my family, to settle down soon.

27qxcy,19,2014-06-09,Play with the cards you're dealt: The story of a balding man.,ShinigamiArjen,bald,https://www.reddit.com/r/bald/comments/27qxcy/play_with_the_cards_youre_dealt_the_story_of_a/,"We begin the story two and a half years ago. At the time I just turned 22 and still unaware of what genetics had planned out for me.
I was an intern at our local hospital, I had great grades in college, amazing friends. Life was good.
It was around that time that I first noticed a change in my hair. Now, I always had thick, curly hair. Slightly uncontrollable even, but I was happy with it. I was standing under a spotlight in a hospital bathroom when I glanced at myself in the mirror. To my horror, I soon noticed that the hair in the temples-area was a lot less thick than the rest of it. Slightly panicked, I quickly turned off the light and refused to look at it in the mirror anymore. What I can't see isn't there, right?

Months passed since that horrific moment and the hair got worse. The temples thinned even more. I was in full denial at this time. I changed my hairstyle so I could comb hair from the top of my head forward, covering the temples. I was clinging firmly to what seems to have become my life motto ""If I can't see it, it's not there."" It was at this point that some of my friends started noticing. Of course, friends love making remarks on eachothers' flaws, and so they did. I laughed it off, telling them I didn't care what they said or thought about it. I couldn't have been more wrong; every remark they made about my receding hairline was a bullet piercing straight through my confidence, chipping it away bit by bit until there was nothing left of it.

We skip ahead to a few months ago. By now, clear bald spots have formed in the temples-area, and the hair at the front is also starting to lose its thickness, awaiting the same gruesome fate as the non-existent hair on my temples. My confidence was reduces to rubble and I started wearing caps to cover it up. Unfortunately, some occasions require me to remove said cap, revealing my thinning scalp.
One morning, I was attempting to style my hair with some hairgel, trying to effectively cover up as much of my bald spots as possible. Getting so frustrated that I wasn't able to cover it up, I grabbed the clippers and instantly shaved it all off.

I was shocked at first, but for the first time in years I could look at myself in the mirror! It looked pretty good, if I say so myself. It didn't take long for people around me to notice and shower me in compliments of how good it looks, and how they think I'm awesome for shaving my head.

We fastforward to today. My confidence is all back in its former glory, and now rocking a beard with my new shaven look. I've heard no remarks whatsoever for the past few months. Life is once again good.

Play with the cards you're dealt.

TL;DR: Shave that head!

27r2ab,0,2014-06-09,CS question regarding languages,NewArithmetic,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/27r2ab/cs_question_regarding_languages/,"#1) I looked at a final exam for CS 125 on koofers and saw that it uses Java, though it is a bit old. So, does CS125 still teach with Java? If so, I think I will take a proficiency test because I've been coding for a while, so I understand basic OOP, and I have some experience with Java. 

#2) I've heard it's slightly possible to get an internship after freshman year. If so, knowing which languages would give me a better chance? (I've also talked to one guy who got a part-time job at a cs firm during his freshman year, but this is probably super rare)

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I'm going south to the UCSB for school.

My experience is a tad bit limited:

* Java,  C++ a few semesters each up to Data Structures

* Scripting in Python at this job

* Got a some experience messing around with Linux but nothing major

* Circuits and Devices

* Math -  completed Calculus, Differential Equations, Discrete Mathematics  (No probability or Statistics just yet)

* Physics - Mechanical, E&amp;M and Modern

I am taking a look at CUDA right now and planning on checking out some Verilog once I get through this Udacity course.


I don't really have much experience with hardware just yet, but I am open to any tips and recommendations you all may have for me.


P.S. Does anyone know anything about getting into Photonics? It seems like it may be an interesting subject.

And every time I try to edit a control in Visual Studio it freezes for 5 minutes and I have to wait.

27r7l5,0,2014-06-09,Why I need a NASA mentor. Why I wont give up looking for one. (This is a long post),[deleted],nasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/27r7l5/why_i_need_a_nasa_mentor_why_i_wont_give_up/,"To any NASA personal,

My name is James and I've posted to reddit inquiring for a NASA mentor for some time now. The reason why I need to find a NASA mentor is because I am ending my 3rd year at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York with a degree in computing security and I need a career at NASA. 

A little background story about myself I would like to share with you. I was born on 23 Feb, 1985 in Las Vegas, NV. My birth was very traumatic because   a drunk doctor delivered me. What happened was my mom was to small to have me and a doctor whom have been drinking earlier delivered me with forceps and crushed my head causing me to become legally blind as well as other impairments.  It was a early Saturday morning and he had came in from a party Friday night. A took a NASA flight surgeon by the name of Dr. Lonnie Hammargren to stop the bleeding on my brain when I was a baby(How cool is that?). After the incident, my family tried suing the doctor, the hospital and the state of Nevada only to have someone hire a hit man whom killed my mother's sister in law two weeks before it went to trial. The reason for them killing my mother's sister in law was because she looked the same as my mother and they were both EMTs at the same fire station. To this day, they have not found her killers. I should say my mother thanks it was hit man because she was getting threatening phone calls in which someone told her to 'Drop the law suit or your family will start dropping like flays"". That is what my mom told me. 

After my whole birth ordeal, Iwe moved from Las Vegas ( my mom divorcing my dad at that time as well)  and we; my mother, my younger sister and myself moved to Asheville, NC where I attended kindergarten though third grade ( in first grade I was molested by  my teacher.)before moving to Pensacola,FL because my mother found her real mother for she was adopted when she was a baby. In Florida, I was placed in those stupid special educational classes (ESE) because of my low vision. Everything was  uneventful until I quite the public school on my 18th birthday and went to a junior college which had an adult high school program. There I got my high school diploma with in a year and a half because each term was 8 weeks long( I had no idea it was so acculturated). After I completed High school, I attend college prep classes then I took pre-engineering &amp; physics courses and transferred to New Mexico Tech for astrophysics and worked at NRAO/VLA. However, I discovered that New Mexico tech was not the right school for me and so I transferred back to Pensacola State college and took information security courses and then I transferred to the Rochester institute of technology to complete my degree in computing security. I am doing very well here although it's expensive but it's a great school and if I had known about RIT sooner, I would have gone here right after my first two years.

What has pushed me so fare and to NEVER give up my academics was NASA. I want to be those guys that are team players and that can come up with a good innovative idea and teach it off to the next generation of explorers. People who wont take failure as an option and strive to go beyond and tackle the unknown. and to think rationally and know how to handle stress while under pressure. I know I have what it takes to be one of those guys. I just need to find someone at NASA who I can do a co-op with. 

I am on the NASA OSSI and I have found some areas I would like to intern in. Moreover, RIT requires me to do three Co-ops or one year's worth in order to graduate and frankly, I don't see myself working for a small business or corporations not that they are bad or anything but because I see myself in the space program. NASA is the main reason why I came to RIT and have so much student loans because it is worth it. 

I want to work in the NASA IT labs but anywhere would be okay with me. I would also like to work at JPL but any center would be good for me. 

PS; I will keep posting here and on other places until I can find someone. I honestly don't know how people even get picked for it's so competitive and there list of applications to get in is so high. 

Sincerely,
James

27rd6b,18,2014-06-10,Tips/exercises for developing better critical ears?,ohmypseudonym,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/27rd6b/tipsexercises_for_developing_better_critical_ears/,"Hey guys. Firstly, I wanted to say that I've been lurking here for the past few months as I've begun to dip my toes in the audio engineering world and this subreddit has been a valuable resource in my learning so thanks to everyone who contributes.

I'm wondering if you all could provide me (and others on this subreddit) with **advice on how to further develop critical ears**. Perhaps you have suggestions on **things to consider or 'exercises' to do to help me be a better listener**. 

One thing I struggle with as I learn about recording and mixing music and experiment with different techniques is that I often don't know what, to me, sounds 'good' or 'bad' or how to describe what I dislike/like about a sound or how to conceptualize what I want a sound to be like.

For example, as I read about miking techniques, common setups are often described with the disclaimer that mics cannot be effectively placed by sight but must be found. When I try out different positions, distances and angles at this point the differences can sometimes be subtle to me and I'd like to eventually get to the point where it's more obvious what setup I would prefer for a particular situation.

Now, I realize this comes with time and experience. I am a photographer by trade. It has taken years to develop a critical eye and the process is never-ending. With photo I had the benefit of professors, classes and internships to guide me when I was a beginner, but my recent interest in audio engineering has been a more self-taught learning process that, for now, is a hobby.

I am **not looking for the obvious answers to my question, such as ""listen more,""** or ""record more,"" or ""read more and talk to as many people as possible."" Those are all a given and I am seizing every opportunity I have to do those things. I am **primarily interested in** **things I can do or think about independently between these hands-on opportunities (as well as during them) to aid in the development of my critical ear**.

Any insight would be appreciated and probably useful to anyone here. Thanks.

Hopefully, after I land a few internships in the upcoming summers, I can get a good job by the time I graduate. The problem is where I should be located.

What I tried to find on the internet, but failed, is the place where a young person like me would have the highest discretionary income. Discretionary income is income right after the taxes, insurance, and basic cost of living issues (Let's not necessarily include retirement funds yet as they are useful for building net worth) so basically personal consumption. Except my personal goal isn't to consume, of course. I just want to make my money by the time I'm ~30 so I'm looking for highest discretionary income in absolute dollar terms. What kind of areas would that be? Thanks and of course if more information is needed I can provide.

Edit: The problem isn't whether Silicon Valley or Austin is good or not. They're both good. The problem is which one provides more **discretionary income**? As for luxuries, the main luxury that I probably want is the ability to live by myself. Because of this, perhaps Austin would be better? Thanks if you can comment more."
27rgje,0,2014-06-10,Engineers more conservative?,Rifter519,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/27rgje/engineers_more_conservative/,"Hello, this is something I have been curious about for quite some time.  

A lot of people have said that engineers typically lean right.  I'm about halfway through engineering college studying computer engineering (physics double major) with plans to get a Master's degree, and this definitely doesn't describe me at all, I lean pretty left both socially and economically.  

I can understand why there'd be a classical conservative/libertarian bent as many engineers are high earners and tend to emphasize efficiency and simplicity (small government), and I've seen a fair few of these in my engineering class, is this what people mean when they say ""engineers are conservative""?  Or do they mean that the majority of engineers are socially conservative as well as fiscally ie against gay marriage, Earth is 6,000 years old and Darwin was a Nazi, Religious Right stuff?  Becuase if that's the case I may need to change majors :P

But I haven't observed the latter case at all among my class or in the engineers I know who are practicing, and only one person at my internship even gave a hint that he was religious.

Is this really the case, and if so, what are the reasons for it?  My own theory is that a conservative religious background could cause scientifically minded students to be more attracted to engineering than the sciences due to science's association with liberalism and atheism, but I haven't done any great research into that.

Simply put, I can't believe (or am not comfortable with believing) that a majority of the people building bridges and nuclear reactors might seriously consider creationism valid science.  

Does the field within engineering have anything to do with it?  I can see why someone working for a defense contractor would lean a bit more to the right since obviously their job depends on a pro-military political climate or why a petroleum engineering working for an energy multinational would be skeptical of climate change, but I can't fathom what might cause electronics or computer engineers to be more socially or religiously conservative than the rest of the population."

How do I sink-or-swim?,narett,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27rgvo/how_often_should_i_seek_help_with_my_work_how_do/,"I've been working as a junior developer in a small-to-mid sized company for about a month and a half.  Was unemployed for 3 months, lived off my savings, and took this offer.

In the beginning, I was given simple change requests.  Sometimes I'd have to generate SQL reports for higher-ups.  That was easy yet I was learning comfortably.

Now, with the guy who had been there 8 years quitting, unloading some of his responsibilities onto me after a one-day 'data dump', the difficulty increased and I'm lacking resources to learn how to do my job.  This is worsened by us tending to software written in a proprietary language where there's little documentation.  The business jargon and acronyms goes over my head and makes me question why this stuff is complicated.

I don't mind asking for help, but it gets awkward when someone is doing their own work, I'm the one responsible knowing how to do the specific work I'm assigned.  I suppose this is the sink-or-swim situation, and I feel like I'm drowning so shortly in.  I guess I can't figure out how to not be spoonfed.

The pay sucks, and I don't see myself - so far - staying there for 7+ years like the biggest complainers.  A problem is I've only had one real job I was in for 9 months, and a software engineering internship that lasted for 6 months.  I'm 24, and I feel where I work is a drag.

If anyone has any advice on seeking help with the work you do when it's all in proprietary gunk, or if anyone has advice on dealing with a job long enough to get unquestionable experience, please give it to me.  I'd greatly appreciate it.

27rriw,1,2014-06-10,Rant? Rant!,zums,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/27rriw/rant_rant/,"Hey r/depression!

So, I'd like to indulge in a bit of hedonistic word vomit with an audience this time. I'm going to bare out, so bear with me.

&lt;rant&gt;
As seems to fit in with the flow of reddit, I'm a 20-something college student in a STEM field. A field that I've slowly came to the realization I have absolutely no passion for, besides having received good marks for it in the past. In fact, I often ask myself what I have a passion for. That question's faithful companion is silence. It seems as though everyone I'm around at college is uncommonly mature in that even if they don't know what they want, they're probing the world for it, in a sense justifying their privilege by making maximum use of their resources. The students at my college are inundated with resources to get them to be successful extremely early on. I was put on the train leading to the hedonistic lala land of the 1%, partially due to being born to parents who were willing to sacrifice for my education and partially because of being told that I was worthy of fruit of my parent's metaphorical martyrdom. 

One thing that I've struggled with greatly is expectation. Ever since I was around twelve or so, I have been told in some form or the other that I'm intelligent. Whenever someone hears of where I go, without fail they respond in some way that references my supposed intelligence. I seldom believe them, for obvious reasons. Meanwhile, I have been languishing intellectually ever since I got out of high school. In high school, my day was structured, heavily supervised, and restricted. I went to school. I HAD to pay attention in class. If I didn't do my homework, teachers would call me out on it to my embarrassment. It was more of a pain to skip than to go. Because of my situation at home, I was supervised constantly. It didn't really bother me because that's the way it always was, is, and hopefully won't be. I was on autopilot. 

I spent the next two years in college doing jackshit, while feeling miserable that I was doing jackshit, and then in an attempt to reward myself for suffering from doing jackshit, I would socialize with friends. Wake up the next day and repeat. Eventually, my ""not currently in conversation"" thoughts would come up in conversation. ""He's taking six classes, and doing well enough in them to land an internship at Facebook. Why should you be talking to him?"" ""You're sitting in a room talking with people who all have a non-negligible chance of making you feel like shit. I mean fuck, that kid founded a start-up. What are YOU doing here!"" I would and still lie about what I like, what I'm doing this summer, or what my grades are. I just wish I didn't have ""to those which much is given, much is expected"" quote etched on my consciousness. This mentality that your worth is given by how much you give to society is just miserable. Why can't we just have human worth? Why do I have to be constantly reminded and impeded by thoughts of what I'm not doing and what that makes me? 

One of the most infuriating things is that people rarely view me as a depressive person, even- get this - my fucking therapist! Last time I tried to open up to a friend with the feels and all, she responded ""...zums, I don't believe it! You're about as close as you can get to a natural producer of THC without being Marijuana itself."" Sometimes I feel like the Joker, the further and further I sink into depression, the wider my faux grin gets. Even when I talk about it, I can't help but make jokes constantly for fear of how someone would respond if I talked about it in anything more serious than a cheeky manner. It's like there's a portion of my brain that livens everything up in conversation, but rarely stops by when I actually need it, beyond an occasional unhelpful ""Oh, woe is you."" or ""Oh that's cute. Your grandfather was tortured, survived, and prospered, you weak fuck."" The last one, albeit, wasn't quite the same, but meh.

Recently, even engaging in anything my brain processes as remotely intellectual or something that isn't ""wasting"" my time is extremely difficult. It almost feels like I'm illiterate at times! After all, I told myself I would do something with my summer.

Honestly, in my day to day life, all I look forward to are my meals. I don't eat many of those anyway because I'm getting fat. It's really awful to see oneself let go. I used to have abs at one point.

I feel that one day, my parents will be dead. I'll hold a deadend job that I know is way below my potential. I'll be alone because the anguish associated with not achieving what I'm capable of (HELLO CHILDHOOD CONDITIONING) will render me incapable of talking to people my age. I desperately want to feel for once. Aren't you supposed to cry when you're depressed, or be angry, or something? Seriously, it's bullshit. I feel as though I've drowned all emotions but self-hatred, anxiety, and existential dread. 

My dad, somehow prophetically, likes to jest with this quote: ""The past is dead. The present is gone, and the future ain't what it used to be."" My belief in the beauty of my own future truly ain't what it used to be. I might remember what it felt like to dream big(™), but honestly right now I feel like I'll just continue sleeping absurd hours, browsing reddit in a haze, and shirking responsibilities better than Sally from HR. I just want to feel competent again...

I guess I have more to say, but then my random marblings (heh) will end up making a poorly written book. Also, yes I am getting a new therapist...when I get around to it. Goddamn sometimes writing a two sentence email takes me a week to do.
&lt;/rant&gt;

tl;dr My life is easy. I go to a fantastic school that's paid for. I'm doing poorly because I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. I don't have motivation to find what I want to do. Nothing and no one matters, and I know I'm not supposed to think like that. Also, not sure if narcissist. What do?

I appreciate any and all comments!"
27rs0m,1,2014-06-10,[HELP?/RANT] Bad anxiety at internship,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/27rs0m/helprant_bad_anxiety_at_internship/,"This became a tad long, sorry. I'm on a college internship and it is really enhancing my anxiety.

I work in a doctor's office doing mostly desk work. I work the front desk. It is almost constantly busy with phones ringing every 2 minutes, people coming in to see the doctor and/or get physical therapy, and people coming in on official business (lawyers, attorneys, other doctors. etc). It is my responsibility to sign in all the patients, get them to the place they need to go, answer the phone, take messages, fulfill record requests, get insurance information, call new patients and set up appointments, fax/copy things, do all of this correctly, and do any little things the doctors ask me to do in passing.

One of my coworkers talks down to me when I ask him for help or clarification, which is really taking its toll. Sometimes he's nice, other times he's acts like I was born yesterday and speaks to me condescendingly. Also when I ask for help from others, they will tell me in a ""you were supposed to know that"" kind of way. I've been here for 2 months, it is really hard to learn all these different things when there is hardly time to learn any of them in this ridiculously busy office. :(

What is worse, I catch most of the people I'm working with giving me attitude for seemingly no reason when I'm only trying to be as nice and helpful as I can. This gives me the worst anxiety. I'm guessing it is only because they are stressed and busy, but I am not trying to make their lives harder... just easier, like telling them they have a patient waiting or letting them know a patient has to leave. I thought I was just doing my job. Am I annoying? It sucks that they can't understand this.

Another major problem is the doctor's hardly ever take their patients on time, which is extremely anxiety-inducing for me.  Some patients wait 45 minutes to an hour. This usually happens because the doctor is either 1) on the phone (what the fuck??) or 2) already has a patient or 3) hasn't come back from his 2 hour lunch break yet (again, wtf). I always tell the doctors when they have patients, but they seem to get backed up a lot. I want to suggest making appointment times longer so the schedule is more spread out, but no one wants to listen to me. I've had people waiting for so long and I feel so terrible that the doctors aren't considerate of their time. But the worst is I get the attitude and brunt of the patients' reactions. Sometimes they are understanding, but mostly they are angry.

I've cried twice so far at this job (sobbing, uncontrollable, can't breathe, can't get face to stop being red, incredibly painful headache) in the bathroom because patients were being rude to me. In one instance, one man wouldn't tell me his name so I could sign him in, so he acted like I was unprofessional and stupid, and in the other instance, a woman was waiting so long for the doctor so she decided to act like it was my fault (""Does he *know* I've been waiting? Where *is he*?""), while also having a very condescending attitude, rolling eyes, etc.

My anxiety initially wasn't so bad. I thought this internship would help me grow, get used to people, and get the social skills and office skills I need to work in the medical field (I'm thinking about physician assistant school), and also learn some things about a private practice and how things generally work in a doctor's office. I even get to shadow the doctors sometimes when it isn't insanely busy. 

But now my anxiety is through the roof. Every day I dread going in because I know something anxiety-inducing will happen and I sure as well don't want to cry again. Every day at work is a like a nightmare and I don't know how to make it right. I can't quit either since the job is an internship/co-op. Quitting is actually possible but something serious would have to happen.

I've secretly hoped that someone would brandish a weapon/gun so I would have a ""legitimate"" reason to quit, such as fearing for my life. This is how much I hate my job."
27sh0s,5,2014-06-10,Since I got back on the wagon,brosimov,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/27sh0s/since_i_got_back_on_the_wagon/,"I don't know why but I felt compelled to share.

I'm a senior in high school graduating in two weeks. I had some 50+ day streaks earlier in the year but fell back into some old habits for a while. But about three weeks ago I got back on the wagon and it's been an interesting ride (in a good way!) since.

Honestly I don't even know where to start even though it's only been 16 days.

I've been working an internship for about 5 weeks now and in the beginning of it I felt kind of uncomfortable and out of place given that I was much younger than most people there. But in the past week or so I've been feeling a lot more confident, doing great work, getting respect from others, and just overall feeling like I belong and interacting well with everybody. It's a really cool contrast to how I felt a couple weeks ago.

Last week I had to give a speech at a school function, and from what I've heard I absolutely killed it. I was funny, charming, sincere - it was just awesome and I felt awesome doing it. People came up to me afterwards because they just wanted to talk to me more. And people say a ton of girls have a crush on me now just because of that speech but I don't know about that haha. So take that, high school!

Also, my senior prom was this weekend. And it was a hell of an interesting night. The girl I took as my date was just a friend and she was kinda boring but I didn't even care. I felt good. Really confident. The prom itself was really nice and everything, and looking around I realized all that I missed out on in my introverted years. Missed friendships and other opportunities. So that's unfortunate but I have the future to look forward to - bigger and better things. Anyway, after the prom most people went to the after party at this club, which really isn't my thing usually. But that night I was dancing up a storm! As I was about to leave, I sat down in the lobby area of the club with a bunch of people and next thing I knew this other girl I know was all over me out of nowhere. She was REALLY drunk. Like I have no idea how she was even conscious. She's also kind of slutty. She was feeling me up and saying I was ""adorable"" and ""actually pretty fit"" and she definitely wanted me to kiss her. People were telling me to do it because this was happening right in the middle of things but I just couldn't morally do it. She was so drunk and I was stone cold sober, it just felt wrong. I guess I did the right thing. But the funny thing is I'm actually going to college with her next year and she point blank looked at me and said we should be fuckbuddies next year at school. Now I don't know if she actually meant it or even remembers it given how drunk she was or if I actually want to pursue that, but that part of the night was definitely a major confidence boost, and I feel really good going into the summer.

So what I'm trying to say is I can't necessarily attribute this all to NoFap, but things have been great recently. The shy smart kid is finally realizing his potential.

The first project I was assigned was to figure out a way to do safety checks on fire extinguishers by having a guy go around and inspect each extinguisher easily. I want to be able to have the guy inspect the item, and if it passes inspection, let him scan a small device that has its own code next to the extinguisher, and either store that information, or send it to a spreadsheet or program on a PC. The information stored would include the date, time, location, and the name of the person who scanned it. 

This would replace having to write down all that onto a piece of paper and then having that information typed into a spreadsheet. It would also keep inspectors from slacking on the job by just signing off the paper without actually inspecting anything; he would have to be right next to the device to scan it.

I've looked online for devices such as the [iBR9000](http://www.touchprobe.com/index.html), but they are so expensive. There are going to be more than a hundred stations that need the ""buttons"", and more than ten people are going to need the scanner."

I know California and Texas are more tech-oriented. Once I receive a bachelor's should I stay in NY or move out West or down South? It seems like for a tech based world we live in the U.S. only has two states that are tech-oriented and it's kind of sad.

I'm still deciding on what I should do to make myself more employable. I have limited job experience and once when I return to school, work at my school my resume will build up.

By the time I graduated I figured college would be different. ""You can recreate yourself in college!"" people told me.  But after getting burned yet again by a group of people I thought were my friends I decided I invested too much of my happiness on other people. So my sophomore year I decided to devote myself to self-improvement. I got straight A's, spent the year learning ukulele and bass, worked out, worked on long term art projects, got the internship I wanted.  I did all the things I was told to do to be happy.  I always heard stories of people over coming their sadness by spending time focusing on themselves.  But it's been two years of this supposed self-improvement and not much has changed.  The random crying fits have stopped, the social anxiety has stopped, but now I'm numb.  I go to work and intern out of habit at this point.  I have no urge to keep up with my instruments, I no longer have the urge to create art, I'm not interested in girls anymore (I haven't even masturbated in months) I just don't care and as a result I have stopped trying. I work and intern out of habit, come home, reddit/play videogames and sleep. This has been my routine for months and I can't break it.  I don't know what to do anymore except keep trucking and hope things improve as I don't really have a choice.

I really need some help.

I have build a pc in may 2013.

Everything turned out pretty good and the pc running good generally. Except when it comes to gaming.
My pc will crash/freeze and the monitor will go black and turn into power save mode. The sound will also be very distorted. I am searching for a long time now but I cannot find out whats wrong.

Some games crash not all. For example, I have played Far Cry 3 and the latest Tomb Raider fine. The strange thing is also that I had run 3D Mark and this will also run fine. At first I thought it might be a driver issue, so I have re installed my whole pc, and updated to the latest drivers with no positive result. I have uninstalled programs/drivers like: Intel rapid storage technology, Intel Smart connect. Tried another PCI-e slot on my mobo. Checked the fans after crashing (still running). Tried to change AMD catalyst control center settings and test. But all without a good result.

I have checked the temps at the moment of crashing using second monitor and the temps looks good (not high).
The event log is giving some errors, but I think this is from holding the power button to turn of the pc. Im starting to think its the PSU but I cannot test this. Or maybe its an SSD issue (according to similar issues) but I do not know what to do anymore.

Here is a summary of all info:

I have placed all settings and errors in an imgur album (with description) :

27tb13,5,2014-06-10,Help building a CJC thermocouple thermometer,crushendo,AskElectronics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/27tb13/help_building_a_cjc_thermocouple_thermometer/,"(Also posted in /r/engineering, sorry about any overlap)

Hello! I'm an engineering student working an internship, and a situation has come up where I would like to build a thermocouple thermometer for relatively high temperatures. I hope this is the right place place to post this question.

 It will be used outside and using an ice bath is definitely impractical, so I would like to make it handheld, battery powered, and cold junction compensating. However, I'm a bit overwhelmed with all the different thermometer types and parts, I do not have a background in EE. Could someone tell me if my design is correct or point me in the right direction?

I want to use a wire probe thermocouple (K) and connect that to a cold junction compensator: [omega CJ-K](http://www.omega.com/pptst/CJ_MODULE.html). Then as the manual instructs for the CJC, I will attach copper wire to the other side. Finally I want to attach the copper wires into a mini connector and plug it into a cheap handheld meter, like [this one](http://www.coleparmer.com/Product/Cole_Parmer_Remote_Monitoring_Thermocouple_Thermometer_Deg_C/UX-86460-05) for example.

Is my design correct, or close? Or am I way off? Is there a better way to do it? Again, I do not have any background in EE. I plan to buy the Omega CJ on eBay for $10-20, so don't worry about the price of that piece. Thanks in advance, if I can design this thermometer it will be a huge help in my internship."
27tpso,56,2014-06-10,Steal my spot and waste my time - I'll waste your time too!,PVgummiand,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/27tpso/steal_my_spot_and_waste_my_time_ill_waste_your/,"As part of my education I'm currently an intern at a fairly large company/organization. Roughly put it is divided into a number of ""areas"" which in turn are dividied into a number of ""centres"". 

Some of the centres in my area share an open work space in the HQ with about 20 desks. The majority of the desks have computers or docking stations for laptops - the computers/laptops recently got upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7, and it didn't exactly boost their speed. Most people have a desk that's theirs, but usually only a few of the desks are used at the same time since each centre has their own office spaces around town aswell because it eases logistics.

As an intern I apparently don't get my own desk or computer even though that would make my life a lot easier. There's a couple of desks I usually use if their usual occupant isn't around. Today I was sitting at a desk that belonged to Nice Lady Coworker. NLC is rarely in HQ more than 1 or 2 days a week, so that desk being free is a pretty safe bet.

I had set up all my things which takes a while. After doing a bit of work I need to do a quick errand. I'm gone for about 15-20 minutes and when I get back all my stuff has been pushed to the neighbouring, computerless desk. I ask one of the others if NLC had come in to work but it was someone else. It was Bossy Bitch.

BB is the boss of one of the centres (not mine though) and she is more or less never around in HQ. And she had left again just as quickly as she had pushed my things away.

""Oh well. If that's how she wants to play then that's how we'll play"" I thought to myself as I moved my stuff to my 2nd favourite desk.

Once I had gotten set up at the other desk she comes back and proceeds to move towards my desk where she introduces herself and shakes my hand. We've met before so I'm rather puzzled by this.

""Because I'm so rarely here I need a specific desk to work from. That desk over there is reserved for me because... reasons"" she says.

I just say ""Yeah yeah, sure. That's super duper okey dokey marvelous and fine"" because I can't be bothered to argue with her. She's Bossy Bitch after all and I might land a job here some day.

She then walks over to her newly conquered desk. She can't just log in on the computer though because I didn't just log out. I shut that sucker down so she could spend a good five or more minutes on booting that medieval piece of scrap. Aw yeah, that'll surely teach her!

TL;DR I got forced away from my desk by Bossy Bitch while doing a short errand. I shut the computer on the desk down instead of logging out, so she'd have to wait for it to boot at a snail's pace."
27tr2j,0,2014-06-10,21 [M4F] Philadelphia - We're potential energy. Let's go be great.,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/27tr2j/21_m4f_philadelphia_were_potential_energy_lets_go/,"Background: 21 year old male, summer biomedical research intern at Penn. Senior biochemistry major also contemplating professional school in Philadelphia.

Note: This r4r is a mammoth insight into what goes on when a person who works long hours does when he gets bored in his free time. If you don't like reading a lot feel free to go browse the other male personals filled with incorrect grammar and multiple uses of the word ""YOLO"". I'm sure the borderline retardation and personality disorders will be a lot more entertaining in the long run.

Anyways, I'm a fairly laid back person. I like to live life as easily as possible while still keeping things fun and interesting. With how busy my work schedule can be, I'm not the average 21 year old. I do go out and have fun on my off time usually, but I cannot stand clubs. I would rather hit up some hole in the wall bar than go into a club with as much room to move as a garbage compactor and listen to the buzzing and thumping ring in my ears for the next 3 days.

I value the little things in life over most other larger things, such as being able to put a smile on someone's face, an unexpected surprise, a day of to relax, and dance fights against the Sharks with my buddies the Jets. I love to travel whenever I get the chance, and one day hope to see all of Europe. Already been all over the coasts of the US and South America, so Europe is my next step. One of the few things I take pride in is my ability to grow facial hair at an alarming rate. So, best to stop reading if you prefer men *coughpussiescough* with translucent boy faces/chests. Which, if you do prefer them, I'm sure you're looking forward to the legalization of gay marriage for when you inevitably come out of the closet. The last couple of sentences may have only been *semi*-facetious. 

When it comes to dating and relationships, the most important things to me are communication, affection, and a very open sense of humor. I make plenty of terrible jokes, and can find something to laugh about in almost any situation, though I do know when to calm down and be serious. My sense of humor knows no bounds, and so I expect a match to be able to enjoy it as well or at least be understanding about it. For communication, I am not the kind to text 10 times an hour until you reply; I'm not a stalker. But, I am not the kind who is okay with going days without talking to someone I'm seeing. I like to talk as much as possible, but am understanding that it can't be all day, every day. And, like I said I love affection, I am not talking dry-humping in the mall, but if you aren't comfortable with any form of affection around other people (such as holding hands or a kiss every now and then) then you might as well stop here. I might sound picky, but truthfully I'm at the part in my life where I've had plenty of dating experience and am tired of selling myself short by stopping things I like doing because a partner doesn't like it. 

I'm trying to find happiness, not make myself miserable with a partner for the rest of my life.

EDIT: Bring on the down votes, man children."

When I graduated, my GPA was 3.7/5.0, which is around 3/4.

I have 2 years of work experience as a consultant at a well-known tech consultancy, and have done 4 internships at well branded companies during my university (which might account for my poor attention to university work). I also run my own start-up, though it isn't very successful (yet!). I got a decent GMAT score of 720 on my first try.

I hope that the admissions office will take into account the type of grading system used in Singapore, and will also look at my GMAT scores and work ex.

Let me preface this by saying that I am not (technically) in IT, being the only person in my family with any computer knowledge that kept growing after 2005, I'm pretty damn close. 

My dad and I have always had a rather tense relationship when it came to anything computer related (and in general but that's not relevant). Him being an ex-project manager for Ford and me being a compSci major has led to us always being on opposite sides of the problem solving spectrum. Whereas I always took Tech support advice with a grain of salt (and a healthy dose of Google), he would naively believe anything ""John from Massachusetts"" would tell him because they were being paid to know how to fix his problems. This difference has led to quite a few arguments between us with me being too proud to stop arguing my logically sound, cross-referenced side and him promptly ignoring anything that proves me right. 

The real story begins with me getting home from my job to find that my computer refused to connect to the internet. Ever since TWC's ruthless takeover of Insight, our internet has been less that stellar (Insight was not much better but ""better the devil"" you know and all that stuff) but it had never outright dropped off without the phone and cable going out as well. ""That means it's probably a local problem!"" I thought. So off I go downstairs to the tangled router+modem setup by my dad's desk. Being one of those ""age implies experience and knowledge"" types, my dad has very little faith in my technical skills since I had just graduated from high school the previous week. Never mind that I had spent the majority of my senior year working for probably the smartest CompSci teacher in the school district just for the fun of it and now intern at a very successful software development company. I was 18. He was 63. He was obviously smarter and I had no right to mess with his ""perfect"" network setup.

As I approach the router, my dad defensively asks what I'm doing. I tell him the truth of ""I'm just switching the port my ethernet cable is in."" So i unplug it from the router and think ""hmm, my connecting would be better if it was plugged directly into the modem."" So I do just that. About 5 minutes later, I'm back at my desk reading up on the latest AskReddit thread when I hear ""TELHELKI WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO???"" Turns out that wasn't my ethernet cable I had unplugged. It was the ethernet cable that connected the modem with the wireless router.

While fixing this rather simple mistake (under the furious eye of my dad) The power cord for the modem gets snagged on one of the multitude of other cables knotted together. out it comes and down goes our internet. I quickly plug it back in a pray that my *oh so understanding* dad didn't see. Turns out it would have probably been better if he had. With our modem, loss of power means loss of network settings. So dear old dad gets furious and demands that I go upstairs and let him call tech support to fix my mess. 

Another 5 minutes go by while I moniter whats going on with the modem from the safety of my own computer. When everything is done, i realize that the tech support guy had no idea that we had both a modem as well as a wireless router. He had just reconfigured the modem to function as a wireless router on its own while our original router remained untouched with nothing connected to it. Seeing my opening (and knowing what I was doing as this was not my first time messing with our router) I quickly change the settings of the router so it is entirely out of my dad's (very limited) control completely. After another 5 minutes my dad comes up and icily tells me how he had to create an entirely new network because of my fuck-up while I'm sitting there with as straight face as I could possibly maintain. He was clueless to the fact that I now had my own network and he had his. I was now my own man! no more fearing any wrath for forwarding ports or changing settings! 

TL;DR: I AM A NETWORK GOD!! "
27uh53,2,2014-06-10,I can't deal with my family anymore and I feel horrible for it.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/27uh53/i_cant_deal_with_my_family_anymore_and_i_feel/,"So about a year ago exactly my sister was fired from her teaching job and arrested (I'll let you use your imagination as to why).  No one in my family had *any* idea that this was coming or that my sister was capable of what she was being accused of.  A bunch of media was hounding us after someone leaked some information (before she was arrested).  I couldn't deal so I ended up living with a guy I met online the entire summer just to get away.  I wasn't able to take any internships that I had planned on and this was the summer break between my junior and senior year at college.  Fuck.

I get back home a week before I can move into my apartment at school and just my luck I end up being there the day my sister gets arrested.  I was the one that opened the door.  It was kind of traumatic and I never thought I'd have to deal with something like that.

When I went back to school things got a lot better because I was far away.  I didn't have to deal with any of it and I was pretty much on my own, but I didn't mind because I knew my parents had stuff to deal with.  But now that I've graduated and I've been back home for ~ 3 weeks everything is different and horrible.

My sister refuses to leave her room.  My mother refuses to give me any information on what's going on.  All I know is there still hasn't been a trial.  Worst of all my parents barely talk anymore and don't even sleep in the same room.  I'm pretty sure they'll end up divorced and it makes me feel miserable.  I never thought that would happen.  They were fine before any of this happened.

I've been applying to jobs like crazy to try to get an income so I can get away from this.  But the process takes a while and I feel trapped.  I want to just get up and leave but I feel guilty for it because I know my parents are suffering too.  I have no idea what to do.

TL;DR: My sister ruined everything."

27ur40,4,2014-06-11,Five days today after smoking daily for a year straight.,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/27ur40/five_days_today_after_smoking_daily_for_a_year/,"I moved into a house with some friends at the beginning last summer. I had smoked on occasion up to that point, but had kept it in check. Pretty much all of my friends living with me smoked so what was a rare occurrence became a daily habit in about two to four months. 

What drew me to it was the fact that I could smoke and feel happy. I grew up with major depression issues and attempted suicide once. 

It started with me working 12+ hour days between two jobs. I would wake up at 7:45 and not get home until after 10. I had trouble sleeping and weed made me pass out like a light, sleeping soundly and ready for the next day. I am diagnosed ADD so to clear the fog in the morning, I’d take an Adderall.
It worked for a time until school started up again. Thank God it was my last year full of blow-off classes, I don’t know how I would have made it otherwise. I never felt challenged in college and am a proficient enough writer to vomit out any paper assigned to me in a matter of hours. I’ve honestly never really felt challenged in school- everything was either too easy it was a breeze or too challenging it felt like busy work. I hate busy work.

I bullshitted my papers and coasted along until I somehow landed an internship in the spring (it’s all about who you know). I adopted the rule that I wouldn’t smoke on nights when I didn’t intern in the morning. That lasted for about two months until I was back to smoking every day.

I was diligent at my internship, never missing a day, but I would practically speed home every night to smoke with my friends. It was refreshing for all of us to unwind and watch stupid shit or play games together.

Two people quit the place I was interning at and I was offered a job. This changed everything. I had a job where, for the first time, it didn’t feel like busy work. If I didn’t get my work done, the company would suffer from it.
I tried to balance weed and work. I moved out to my own place and kept my stash at their place… that lasted about 10 days until I brought my vape at my new place.

I never had an enjoyable session at my new place. It’s in an apartment and, even though I was using a vape, I always thought someone would smell it and call the cops. What started as a way to unwind became a terrible nightly bout of paranoia.

I was sick of it. I wasn’t getting any sleep from being afraid of a knock at any moment on my door. I was hired out of college and could lose it all in a blink of an eye. I wasn’t enjoying it, and it was making me dull and flat at work. I asked my friend to take it for a while.
I switched generics of Adderall and am on day five of no smoking. I can’t remember the last time I went five days without smoking. Definitely not this year, maybe last October? I now understand why AA gives out chips! It really is an accomplishment! There was an issue at work this morning and I was able to come up with a temporary solution within ten seconds. My boss even used the word ‘brilliant’! I’ve worked there for a month and am sure she’s never said that before!
And oh my God the energy! I have to give some credit to the generic switch on this as well (no more terrible crash when it wears off), but I haven’t slept this great in ages! I put in nearly 10 hours of non-stop work, came home, and got on my stationary bike for the first time since I moved. I’m getting paid this Friday and thinking of rejoining an MMA gym once I get my cardio back up.

Honestly, I don’t regret that I smoked, I have some amazing memories I wouldn’t trade for anything… except I don’t remember too much. My only regret was that I smoked too much. WAAAY too much. I’ve had to pretty much cut off communication with my friends at the house I used to live at, which makes me pretty lonely, but my girlfriend has been awesome at keeping me busy with my downtime.
Today was the first time I mildly craved it, but I didn’t smoke… not that I had a choice in the matter. I wouldn’t of anyway, I’m getting a feeling there will be an ass-reaming across the board tomorrow that I’m not looking forward to (weed making me slow didn’t help the situation).

I guess this isn’t your typical post. I’m not convinced I’m done for good, but I want to add my two cents to this: weed DOES affect people. Maybe not ALL people. I can’t prove it affects you, and in cases it can help more than harm. But I know it affected me when I thought it didn’t. 
So if you’re thinking of taking a break, thinking that maybe weed is affecting you negatively, then take a break. Worse-case scenario, you’re stuck with yourself for a week. It isn’t all that bad- people who have smoked a lot in the past usually end up pretty fucking chill!

More specifically help with dress shirts, ties, pants, belts, and shoes or I guess simply stated whole outfits haha. What would you guys recommend? Brands, colors, styles etc. And where should I look for all of the above that would be appropriate for a Big 4 firm? 

*SIDE NOTE: An E-mail was just sent out saying it is recommended while in Florida for training we dress in khakis, loafers, blazer so advice on those particular items would be much appreciated!

I am also in need of suit help. I have one suit right now, but am thinking I will need to purchase another. I was thinking of visiting Suit Supply in Manhattan and ask for their assistance. Any other recommendations?

Keep in mind I will be in NYC so if you know of any places in the city that aren't too pricey I can frequently shop at let me know. Price is important as I really want to keep my costs low all while looking like I fit in. Although I am not too against spending a lot on certain staple items like decent shoes or pants. My current plan is to spend this weekend shopping around at H&amp;M, and Uniqlo, but I am unsure those places will have all that I will need.

27uskf,1,2014-06-11,The First Date - How to get There?,rebatwa2,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/27uskf/the_first_date_how_to_get_there/,"So there is an old childhood acquaintance that I haven't seen in I believe 9 years.  We would always maybe once a month strike up a conversation through social media always asking how the other one was doing and what our plans were moving forward with school and what not.  Starting last summer(only during the summer both in college) I had wanted to get together with her in person and try to catch up just to see and talk with her again.  The only problem was that I only thought about scheduling this meetup midway through the summer and during that time we both had conflicting schedules until we both went back to school.

Now another summer has rolled around the corner and this time I don't just want to get together and meet with her to catch up, but I also want to try and get together with her.  I haven't yet talked to her about going out just to see each other again, but plan to soon.  Here is my question.  Do I want this get-together to be like a first date which I feel like is the wrong approach.  The other option was going to meet with her again and have a wonderful time talking about our pasts and future(again school wise and now possibly recent internships or job offers) and then ask her for the first date.  Now, if this is the correct approach, how do I go about asking for/getting that first date after the get-together...and when is the right time?"

I figured, I am good with computers, and it pays well, so why not do it? However, after a few terms, I realized I really don't want to be stuck in an office, but I am not really sure what what else I would do. However, I think I may enjoy doing something outside, I get bored easily, except when I am hiking or sitting by the fire, or doing anything outdoors really. By far my favorite class at school has been a wilderness survival class I took for my PE requirement. So I've been looking into jobs that would allow me to work outdoors, or at least somewhere besides a office building. 

I have no illusions that it'll be easy work, I imagine it will be harder than anything else I've done, and I'll probably hate parts of it, overall though, I think I'd enjoy it. But I am a bit worried about the job prospects for rangers. Or for that matter what all types of rangers there are. I have been looking at a few, like LEO's, but I'm not sure I can do that, since I have asthma and apparently you have to get a waiver. Are their similar requirements for other types?(I don't see why there would be, except liability) What is the living situation like? do you live in the park? How is the pay, I know the work is usually seasonal, especially when you start. What exactly do you do in the off season when you aren't working? I don't mind working with the public, I love teaching people about stuff I enjoy.

The Community College I go to has a two natural resource programs, Forest and Wildlife resources. Would it be worth it to go for either of those? What else would help improve my chances of getting a job out of school? I could always go back to get a 4 year degree too. 

Edit: Forgot a few questions! Are you able to get paid overtime, and how much can you advance your career? 

Edit 2: I have been looking at internships at the SCA, does anyone have experience? I'd love to do it, but I'd be kind of scared to leave my job and go off to another state alone. It says they provided a weekly stipend, does anyone know how much it is? How hard is it to get an internship with them? "
27uzms,1,2014-06-11,About to drop out of college. I'm terrified and having a quarter-life crisis.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/27uzms/about_to_drop_out_of_college_im_terrified_and/,"I got a full-time job I would be studying to do (yay programming). I'm working full-time right now. The work itself isn't bad at all. It's just the right amount of challenging to not feel like meager bitch-work/to not overwhelm me, my co-workers are pretty cool, and I'm learning a lot.

The catch is that I dropped out of college to do it. Well, sort of. The official date to make the final deregister decision is somewhere in August.

I thought I was hot shit in high school, but college hit, and the classes became really, really hard. And they kept getting harder, and I generally felt incredibly inept. I studied really hard (seriously, I never partied much at all if you're thinking about that), but I just pulled through with meager passing grades every semester, and they kept getting worse and worse. I felt like I was getting diminishing returns and not really learning anything at all. I simply struggled to comprehend my material to have hope of passing my classes. It made me feel really, really dumb when it came to school, especially seeing how all my other peers could just get the material down.

To cope, I made a bunch of personal code projects. I made a lot over breaks and some weekends to prove to myself I could still do something right. So many, in fact, that I was actually able to pull a couple of freelance gigs, as well as an internship, despite my shitty GPA/academic ability. It was the final nail in the coffin that made me think of just quitting the struggle of school and working.

But then it hit me today. The permanence of it all. How I'm going to watch my friends and peers graduate and be the one on the side who struggled and couldn't make it. How I'd live the rest of my life potentially without getting a degree. How I'd be a disappointment to my mom and dad. How I'm going to be in this industry for the rest of my life. And how things will never be the same, and I'd be working every single day for the rest of my life.

And I had a breakdown. I'm in tears as I type this. 

I don't even know what the fuck I want from life anymore. I don't think I ever knew. I'm just so overwhelmed with the magnitude of everything right now."
27uzxu,13,2014-06-11,[First Post] My OkCupid Success(?) Story,[deleted],OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/27uzxu/first_post_my_okcupid_success_story/,"Hello. This is the first time I've been in this sub. I typically don't stray out of my usual subreddits, but since I'm going through an incredible amount of heartache at the moment, I thought I'd try telling the story of my successful OkCupid relationship so that I can remind myself of the times we were happy.

I (currently 22-year-old female) started OKC last year right after one of my good friends got a boyfriend for the first time. At the time, I've never had a boyfriend, so when I lost my partner in crime (we always used to commiserate with how single and lame we were), I went on OkCupid. I was on there most of the time when I didn't want to study, and I did go out with a small handful of guys who never made it past the 2nd or 3rd date. I've always been an awkward bookworm with an incredibly manly personality, and coupled with the fact that I had been in an abusive relationship (with a girl) back in high school, I was probably one of the most inexperienced/dysfunctional people to enter the dating world.

My new account influx of messages had died down for weeks by the time that he had messaged me out of the blue one day to say that I had the ""best picture hands down"" on OKC (it was an image of me laying face-down in the middle of a busy shopping plaza). I clicked on his profile and found that he was a long-haired, heavily tattooed, Korean-American metalhead from South Carolina. I found him so intriguing that I had to answer him. We shot a lot of messages back and forth for almost 2 months, talking about tons of things, including our interest in anime, our desire for a cuddle buddy, and our tendency to partake in self-deprecating language due to a history of low self-esteem (*so* healthy, right?). I disappeared for a week or two several times due to finals and other preoccupations, but I kept coming back to talk to him. I then found that I got an internship in the same city for that summer, so I would not be moving back home. I told him that, and that was when he finally asked if I'd like to go on a date with him.

He was completely the opposite of what I usually gravitate towards, but I liked it. He had an athletic, thin build (I typically ogle super yoked dudes); he was covered in tattoos; his hair was longer than mine and naturally wavy; he wore cut-off band t-shirts and smoked heavily. Smoking is one of the biggest things I avoid, so when I saw him standing puffing away at a cigarette outside the bar that we agreed to meet at, I was incredibly turned off. However, I approached him anyway and we went in to share a few drinks. Before we knew it, hours had passed and we were so comfortable talking to each other that it felt like we had been friends for a long time. We set up our next date and parted ways. In the days between our dates, we tirelessly texted each other all day about anything and everything.

We went to get a late lunch for our second date. Our rapid back-and-forth persisted even during this date. At one point, I called him out on his slight southern accent and said that he sounded really cute, to which he turned completely red and stuttered, ""S-stop embarrassing me!"" By then, I knew I had a thing for him. At the end of this date, we admitted to each other that we were interested in each other but agreed that we'd continue taking it slow to see where it goes. However, both of our work schedules were getting busier and we no longer had coinciding days off, so our next date was undetermined. We promised to keep in touch and update each other on when our schedules got lighter. We hugged and parted ways.

We spent the next several weeks texting daily. I was beginning to think that our schedules would never allow us to meet again (he worked weekends and was off two days during the week while I worked M-F, 9 to 5, and had weekends off), so I agreed to go on a date with a new guy to pass the time. However, that new guy didn't answer my calls on the day that we were supposed to meet, so I was stuck looking dressed/made up with no plans for a Saturday night. I called this long-haired boy and asked if he were busy. He said he had just gotten off work and that he was just going to relax for the rest of the night. I asked if he wanted to hang out, and next thing I knew, I was taking a bus to his apartment. We ended up drinking beer and watching a movie together. Then we talked about our relationship history and families, during which we both revealed a lot of very personal things. We really bonded over that conversation, and afterwards we decided to watch another movie. This whole time, he had always kept a 3-foot distance between us and he never touched me in any way out of respect and shyness. I was eager to make a move on him, so I scooted closer to snuggle next to him for our second movie. After I did that, he turned to me, looking surprised, but with a huge grin on his face. Then I just kissed him right on the mouth.

His eyes widened, and he said, ""Goddamnit, you're gonna be my girl.""

I agreed, and thus began our incredibly short but fulfilling relationship. We never had a dispute as we always fully voiced our concerns and worries with each other. We went on adventures and explored the city together (I was there for college; he moved there because he got tired of his small town in South Carolina). He quit smoking and went back to school to pursue a higher education. He helped me work towards my goals. We learned from each other. We laughed. We loved. We helped each other improve and encouraged each other to always strive to be the best that we could be. I have never met someone more caring, accommodating, and compatible than he.

At 6 months, he told me he was in love with me. At the time, I wasn't ready to return his feelings, but I told him that I was glad he felt that way about me. He smiled and said that I could take my time. Two months ago, during out 9th month together, my father passed away and my family was subsequently plunged into a lot of financial hardship. He held me through the phone call that told me my father passed away. He lent me his shoulder to cry on for the following weeks that I felt like absolute shit. I needed to move home immediately after graduating from college because my family needed me, and I told him that. Still, he supported me as always and told me to go home and take care of my mother because ""I know she needs you more than anything right now. Don't worry about me.""

Shortly after, his own mother asked him to return to South Carolina to help out at her brother's restaurant. I supported him as well and told him to go and take care of things. Last Sunday, I told him for the first time that I was in love with him. The next day, he walked me to my bus stop for the last time after spending the night with him over the weekend. We decided to take our time and say our goodbyes while the bus had not yet arrived. We hugged, and it was so hard to let each other go, but we did, and tears casually started to fall as we pulled away from each other. As I watched him walk away, I saw his shoulders falter, the characteristic shudder and heave of a sobbing man with his heart just broken. He flew back home to South Carolina the day after. We would have hit our one year mark next month. A LDR is not a feasible option for us due to a lot of financial issues and other complications.

I haven't been able to concentrate ever since as everything reminds me of him. I never would have thought that OkCupid could have given me something like this, and it still surprises me every time I remember that we met over the internet.

_____

**TL;DR - I met the randomest guy ever on OkCupid, but he unexpectedly ended up being everything I ever wanted in a partner. We had a very fulfilling relationship and we fell in love. We had to break up due to financial, family, and distance complications.**

So questions to you all: 

Did you ever decide to try dating someone you didn't think you'd be interested in (someone who's not your ""type"")? How did that go? 

Have you had any successful relationships with someone you met through OkCupid?"

I found the corpse of the author of this journal, in the year 2009, in mid July, as a long dead skeleton in one of the rooms.  The other room was far out of the way, but both held stone tablets with words engraved upon them.  And after years of work to be able to read it properly, I give you this.

From the Journals of John Trask (alias)


January 27, Week 1


Today, I have stumbled upon a massive labyrinth.  It is a beautiful structure, with sections covered in barnacles, other sections obviously covered in some form of coral, as well as a giant section that obviously used to be underwater, with 3 springs within.  And I am stuck here.

Forgive me, whoever reads this, finds my journal.  I mean no insult.  But I do not know why my mentor sent me out here, alone, to deal with this situation.  But I am cold.  I am tired.  And my astral body feels hungry.  The fact that it CAN get hungry, disturbs me on more than one level.  That should be impossible, no, let me be frank.  According to all that I know, it is impossible.  The only reason why it would be so, is if somehow my physical body is HERE and I am not projecting here at all.

God help me if that is true.  God help us all.

I am filled with such utter horror at the thought that if that is true, because if it is, then the Astral Plane has somehow fused, or linked itself to the Physical plane, upon where our mortal bodies reside.  If that is true, then our bodies have all somehow linked to the Astral bodies, which means?  I'm not sure, I honestly cannot say for certain.  But the thoughts chill me to the bone, of what it could possibly mean.

I disgress, however.  I have found no way out but straight upwards, out of this labyrinth, and the way up looks trecherous.  Every inch seems to be covered in horrific, large barnacles.  Ones the size of a large person.  And when I threw a rock at one, the piece that fell down cut through the stone at my feet like a hot knife through butter.

I have, however, saved another.  It looks like it might well be a perfect peace for writing in, if I run out of ink in my pen, or, worse yet, be forced to write this upon stone tablets that I found earlier.

God be willing, I will triumph over this place.  Help me, God, for this place scares me like none other.

Why, oh why, did I listen to my mentor and come here?  Why did he insist that this place needed to be explored, and something within turned off, if the Astral plane was to continue to exist?  And why did he only send me 15 pages of paper and a pen to write in this hellhole?


Week 2


I have explored with more diligence, and found a horrific discovery.  Only one of the water sources is safe to drink.  Another is an acid, which burns even the barnacles like a hot knife through butter, and the final one reeks of sulpher and several other chemicals I cannot identify.  Thankfully, the third water source appears to not only be safe to drink, but somewhat nourishing.  I don't feel or look as horrible as before, as shown from the peculiar moss that lights up the lower sections.

The nature of the water disturbs me, horribly.  And in my disturbance, I have done several tests.  The stones from the main structure appear to be completely unaffected by the acidic and sulpheric water, which explains part of the clean state of things.  However, that suggests a tide of water in this place.  One that moves upwards and downwards.  If that is the case, then the tide must burn anything between it and the barnacles far above, in the roof.

God help me.  God help me, for I have no solace anywhere else.  Oh God, my God, please, in my time of need help me.
I threw a fingernail into the acid.  I threw a FINGERNAIL into the acid.  And I saw it melt as it laid on top.  And then the acid rose up 3 inches.

God help me.  It's slowly increasing up further in the tunnel.  As I run, I write this, shuddering from the light of the moss...?  No, the moss is moving?!
God, help me.  God, help me.


Week 3


I have, since the last writings, transcripted the writings to stone.  And in this central chamber, is the only place of safety.  Since I discovered the tunnels, I have found a more horrible discovery.  The “moss” is much like the fish at the bottom of the ocean, the... what's it's name?  Anglerfish, maybe?  The one with a glowing “worm” dangling in front of it?
I managed to cut off a bit of one, using the last barnacle, and found that the stuff is acidic.  Horribly acidic.  It melts through everything like a hot knife through butter.  Luckily, by the grace of God, I managed to avoid it on me, but it cuts through the stone like a hot knife through butter.  And so, I write upon the stone slabs here of my experiences.

This place is a giant death trap, with some sort of device at the bottom.  What I took to be walls were some sort of giant snake-like leviathan, with thousands of glowing pieces that resemble those Anglerfish.  Most people would carve a little piece off the wall, to keep the inside of the area light up, only to die a horrible death, instead.  And with how the acid sprayed out of the sacks around that one, it appears that the “moss” is a form of a lure for prey to be eaten by it.

Another thing I noticed?  One that is worse?  The acid from the acidic pool is still rising slowly, at the rate of a foot a day.  In 32 days, I will be unable to drink water, and will eventually starve, if I don't perish from dehydration, first.

Even still, I search the tunnels.  Even still, I try to figure out how to get through this place.

God help me.  No one else will, so please, God, help me.


Week 4.


In desperation, I have done much work.  There is less time to write, now.  The light that shines through the overhead tunnel seems to get dark earlier and earlier.

Trace amounts of that “moss” from those leviathans have returned, and I have journeyed towards the bottom of this hellish place.  And at the bottom, I found a massive device, of unknown origins, and several people in what appeared to be Nazi uniforms, all dead.  I stole from them their weapons, and a journal nearby, then returned towards the surface.

It appears that they themselves also found this place.  I'm not sure if it's before, or after, however.  Time seems to flow WEIRD, here.  Not weird as we know, but weird in a more, shall I say, Lovecraftian way?

I do not know much of German, but a teacher I had taught me much of the words for german engineering, while I did an internship under him.  Through my memory of his words, and the notes, they appeared to have done several chemical analysis attempts upon the stone, and the coral like rock.

It appears they were on a breakthrough, but could not bring down any more manpower, from the leviathans that I encountered in the tunnels.  However, they did note this.  The coral counters the sulpheric water completely, and the stone counters the acid water completely, due to something in both's composition.  They noted, however that the water from the third spring rises rapidly when the other two springs are not.

I can see windows from this place, too, showing massive numbers of rather large serpents? with glowing eyes, that look around in watery depths under this place.  With the glowing on their backs, I suppose that they are the Leviathans I worry about.  They much resemble giant eels, or perhaps even Chinese dragons of legend.  Chinese dragons don't have moss like that, though.  None of the legends I read said anything close to that.

In the center was my biggest discovery, though.  Some sort of large cylinder, that had the words “Prototype Reactor” was in the middle of this room, which I now suppose to be at the lowest depths of this massive building I must be in, overlooking the Leviathans in their watery home.

It writes  of being an “Elerium prototype reactor”, whatever Elerium might well be, and has several notices that it powers several substations within this place.  It also notes the liquids inside, and insists that the liquids are gone before I can access it, and gain access to the equipment within.

Perhaps this is what my teacher wrote of?  I must

What was that sound?  It's black out again, but it sounded like something falling!


Week 6


I am in some sort of giant chamber, located in what must be the nesting grounds for the Leviathans.

Pardon my time, it has taken a while for writing in here again.  I had to recover from a broken leg, when that titanic head came down into this place, and tried to crush everything in here, in a vain attempt to find me.  While I hid in the tunnel below, what appeared to be unique carvings on the wall were wiped away, and giant eyes looked in upon the room, with a great many pieces of glowing “moss” slammed against the newly shown windows to illuminate all inside.  After a great deal of time hiding, even with a broken leg, the eyes and “moss” disappeared, and I heard it again below, against the windows.

As time passed since then, I have built a crude shelter in the rubble.  With this, I have come to realize that somehow, the entire building has an equal pressure to the water outside, thus the “moss” on the backs of the serpents in the tunnels, as well as the giant serpents down below.

I suspect these leviathan serpents all use this building as a chamber to hold food captive in.

The more worrying event that happened, after the serpent crashed within, one day a great many of the moss like acid sacks fell through the top of the building, and poured down upon the center of the chamber I usually write in.  Thankfully, I had finished my shelter, and had constructed a well made room.  Unfortunately, almost all of the lower half of the shelter has now melted, leaving only the “roof” as the floor.

The serpents, I believe either know that I am here, or suspect, with my carving away a sack several weeks ago.  It appears they also have some form of intelligence, and prey upon the occupants of this place often.

Even still, one thing has been noticed, that I am blessed by.  A perfect sphere of the stone has been formed by the damage done from the serpents, one that I can use to plug up the stream of acid.  Now, if I can make another for the water that is sulpheric, out of the coral, then I will be able to stop both.  But at what price?

The serpents still hunt for me.  Those leviathans of the deep, scare me beyond words, and occasionally thrust their heads down into the chamber to check for me to see if I live.
Even in this small room I have made, where I carve these words, I fear.  And I fear they watch over the opening above, far above this place, waiting to devour any that might climb out.  That leaves me with only one option.

I must solve the mystery of this place.  I must jam the two holes with a sphere of stone, and a sphere of coral, so water floods this place, faster than the acid the Leviathans emit might hurt me.

I hopefully will find that device my mentor told me about, when I have time, at least, if I can keep out of sight long enough to survive.

God, help me.  You are the only one that listens to me here, in this forsaken place.


Week 7


I have plugged up the acidic spring with a massive boulder of stone, and the Sulpheric one with a massive one of coral.  With that, I now hide while the spring of water fills the rest of this place with water, and the reactor room seals shut.

Soon, I will make my way into 3 tunnels, normally sealed shut from this.  Soon, I will...

I can hear pounding in the upper levels.  Horribly loud pounding.  Like massive drums, only I know for a fact it is not.

I must hide.  But I have noplace to go.  Noplace to run to.

The reactor!  The reactor is opening holes in the walls, to tunnels... and water is pouring in from 3 of them?!

I must rush to the fourth.  I must race to the fourth, and live.  I write this even as I run.

No.  No, no no.  The fourth has the gaping maw of a serpent in front of it.

I have checked the others, and the water rises to my waist, now.  The others are full of broken equipment, and shattered oxygen tanks.  There are no other devices in here.

That means the generator, the reactor is the one thing that I have to shut off.  I will either feed it to the monster, or drown.

It appears, I was wrong.  There is another room, with a broken stairwell above the great serpent's head.

After I throw the small reactor into the serpent's head, I will try to climb into that room.  It looks like there is functional equipment in there, at least for oxygen.

If I do not make it, then I will say this.  My most famous internet alias that I have used is John Trask.  I entered this hellhole on January 27, 2017.  Please, let there be someone out there that will find this.  Publish this.

God, don't let me fail this.



Author's Note:  When I found this corpse, there was no ""moss"" that exhibited lighting.  The only thing that was there was an unlight cavern.  I presume he killed the entire species off with the reactor he threw into the mouth, and noted that the pedastal in the room he claimed the reactor was in, was about the size of a large duffel bag.  Perhaps it was some sort of as of yet unknown reactor, not known to man?

I also could not find any of the other rooms that he had described, while exploring the place, or the massive barnacles, or stone chamber.  Most of the labyrinth was long ruins, broken and destroyed beyond repair.

I've seen more things like this, and there's other tablets from that place.  Would you like me to post that next, nosleep?"

In my country, to finish the university, you need to be an intern for a whole year (in the last year of studying. Professional University.). Because I think I won't find anything what will suit my dreams/desire/needs in my country (plus, the pay is like... 500 Euros when you have finished university...), I was thinking to check out of my country. So- why not UK? I know English quite well (at least I think so) and I'm not stupid (Just like about my English- at least I think so).

I forgot to mention, that I am studying IT. IT is my hobby, I have been learning everything what I can find about it since age of 13, I have always liked it. I want to be a web developer (back-end or front-end, but not designer. I already know I suck at this field) or App Dev (for creating Apps for websites e.c.). I'm one of the best student in my course, but still I need to learn a lot more, if I want to succeed. And you can learn mostly something by doing actual work or by doing something, not only learning. 

So... Anyone who could help me- how hard it would be for me to find internship? Are companies keen to find new people who could work for them? 

P.S. What's a good salary for IT in United Kingdom?

27vqb4,31,2014-06-11,How to decline invitations to hang out?,intensiveporpoise,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/27vqb4/how_to_decline_invitations_to_hang_out/,"Recently, I've started a year long internship at a company that has a lot of student interns. This other intern often wants to make plans to hang out during the weekends. I think I see him enough during work and we eat lunch together every day. Hanging out on the weekend is an excessive amount of time to spend with him. I don't mind his friendliness and company during work, but I would like to limit the time we spend together to be at work only. I don't want my turning down his invitations to be interpreted as rejecting his company at work though. I told him that I was making plans with my cousin so I'd be busy this weekend and he suggested that he tag along. Not what I hoped for... I guess I don't have much experience turning down social invitations before since I haven't received many, haha. 

This intern is originally from another city whereas I'm a local. He relocated to work for this company, so he doesn't know many people here and has taken the initiative to acclimatize to the new environment. I've hung out with him a few times already and shown him some things around the city, but I feel too socially exhausted to continue hanging out every weekend. I don't go out to socialize much and would rather spend my weekends relaxing at home. I feel bad because his eagerness and willingness to be friends is a rare thing and it's probably good for me that I'm being social once in a while, but it's too much. Anyway, I'm thinking he'll probably find other interns to hang out with eventually. In the meantime, I'm not sure what to do about declining his invitations outside of work while keeping up a friendship at work."

I'm a 5'3 female currently around 126-127 lb with a starting weight of 135 lb and a goal weight of 115 lb(which is how much I weighed before I started college last fall-oh the freshman 15, or freshman 20 in my case). 

After just deciding to eat less for two months with a relatively sedentary lifestyle, I got to about 132 lb around mid-May,the end of the school year, which is when I started exercising and counting calories. Ever since I left for my summer internship, I'd say on average I walk about 3 miles per day(to get to and back from my summer internship) and every morning I head out to Pure Barre studio for an hour long Pure Barre workout. For those of you not familiar with Pure Barre, its a workout that combines of yoga, pilates, and ballet. It is MUCH more intense than it sounds, and here's a link describing Pure Barre from a male perspective(since it is usually more ""female-oriented"" haha) http://www.brobible.com/life/article/tried-pure-barre-being-woman-hard/

On average, I eat anywhere between 1200-1300 calories of healthy food a day, and lately I've been feeling dizzy and extremely tired when I'm not exercising. Usually my meals are something like:

breakfast: 1 cup 1% milk, hard boiled egg, 100 cal chobani greek yogurt

lunch: grilled chicken with tomato, onion, spinach

dinner: salmon/tuna with avocado, spinach, zucchini, or another mix of veggies

snacks: handful of almonds, 50 cal string cheese, fruit(3 figs or one apple,etc.), sometimes small servings of dark chocolate/red bean ice cream when I want to cheat

After looking at myFitnessPal logs, I've noticed that I often don't reach the iron or potassium quotas for the day,and I suspect that they might be the reason. Or might I not be eating enough calories? I guess I just feel hesitant about changing my diet or routine right now because I've had a lot of success losing about 6 lb in a month following this pattern of eating and exercising, and would like a confirmation of my suspicions. 

Thanks so much for reading through this. I'd really appreciate any advice or experiences you might be able to share:)

I'm only getting paid 30k a year, which is rather low but I didn't really have any other options open so I had to take it. The pay itself is just getting me by with me spending most of my money each month on repaying my school loans, but I'd like to be make some more probably doing something else that isn't heavily programming based.

I don't think I could find a decent job for my main interest, video games, as most are programming jobs and I'm not too fond of C++. Another interest of mine is history but I don't even know how a CIS degree would get me a job dealing with that.

27w5a4,2,2014-06-11,Where to go?,beefgaming23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27w5a4/where_to_go/,"First off, hello everyone!

I just have a quick question, but first a little back story.

I graduated with a BS in Applied Computer Science and always coasted through the classes because I did the bare minimum effort. Due to this, my programming skills are lacking severely, however I understand the concepts not implementation.

I did however learn SQL and how databases work pretty well from a teacher who actually knew who what he was talking about (go figure). I really want to pursue this, but I'm not too sure.

Due to this, I always stuck to IT internships, helpdesk, grunt work. Nothing spectactular, but I am good at it. I learn quick and do well under pressure.

Though I am good at help-desk things, I do not see a potential career in this, at least with enough money to pay off loans and make some sort of fund for myself.

So, my questions are this:
What are some of your stories with career choices, what did you do while in college, strengths, weaknesses?
What can I do with IT related work down the road, is the higher level stuff worth it?

I don't want to sound demeaning, I just see the loans coming my way and I want to choose something viable."

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a 3.04 GPA (but I don't list my GPA on my resume) and I've had one summer internship (between my jr and sr year) as a production/process engineer at a semiconductor-related company.

I've been looking for a full-time process/production/manufacturing/quality job near Bronx, NY (I have compelling personal reasons for wanting to relocate) since October, but have not received a single interview. At first, I reported my west coast address-- no luck. Then, I reported no address-- no luck. Now, I'm reporting a Brooklyn address (using my close friend's address)-- still no luck. I do my best to call companies and follow-up, but 90% of the time phone calls are not allowed or the person managing the opening doesn't pick up their line.

I've been looking in the NY/CT/NJ area and I've used glassdoor, aftercollege, monster, indeed, careerbuilder, and craigslist. Just recently I started using this website (https://duncan.cbe.cornell.edu/cheme112/CHEMESITES/COMPANIES/) to search for jobs by company and then filter by location. A huge problem for me is simply *finding* openings that I qualify for. An even bigger problem is that I'm not hearing back after applying.

Prior to graduation, I used to think I wasn't getting calls back because I hadn't officially received my degree. A month after graduation, I've unfortunately still not heard back.

I'm not particularly sure what I'm looking for by posting this other than some encouragement, similar stories, or just advice in general. I do have one question though: is it okay to ignore certain experience qualifications (ex: applying as a recent grad when the opening specifies 3-5 years minimum relevant work experience)? 

I check my email incessantly and I just can't help but feel more and more discouraged as time goes on. I've looked into six sigma belt certification classes and possibly taking the FE exam, but I have not decided whether I wish to complete them. I have called some employment agencies in the Bronx, but they seem to focus primarily on reception/administrative jobs and tend to not have many engineering openings, and if they do have any, they're never entry-level ones. I have built my LinkedIn profile, I edit my resumes and cover letters accordingly, but I must be doing something wrong...

I'd be happy to share examples of my previous application materials with those that would be so kind to look at them. Any responses would be greatly appreciated and thank you to whoever took the time to read this post."

I was not even four weeks in when last Thursday I miscarried.

I'd never been pregnant before, but I have fibro myalgia and may very well also have SLE, so I am *extremely* aware when anything out of the ordinary happens with my body. At first I thought it was just paranoia caused by my anxiety (which is from the fibro), so I didn't bother getting a test. It wasn't a rational paranoia or anxiety and with the way my body reacts to anxiety, I could very well test positive on a urine test while not pregnant.

(Not that I've had a hormonal pregnancy before, but given just how much control my fears and anxiety have over my physical state, it was well within the realm of not just possibility, but likelihood.)

Anyway, Thursday night, I miscarried. Since I had been in denial about being pregnant in the first place, I tried to shrug it off as a weird fibro symptom and keep functioning normally. 

Friday, my entire body was freaking out very, *very* badly. Coughing, sneezing, trouble breathing, pain everywhere - because it was responding to the stress from the miscarriage. I stick out the day at work anyway because I can't afford to take a day off, and go home at the normal time.

That's when it hit me. 

My partner then had his turn in denial and said that he was relieved that it happened and that this was really a good thing for us. Logically, this is correct. We're on opposite sides of the country, my paycheck doesn't quite cover my bills as it is, but I don't qualify for government assistance and all he has is a paid internship and is going to be living with his parents until he gets a solid full-time job.

I don't have to explain to you how well I received that because I'm sure you can guess. On top of everything else, I now had a solid swath of guilt from ""Oh, well, I'm better off that this happened!""

Saturday rolls along and during a party to celebrate his brother's graduation, it hits him, so he's hiding in the bathroom crying and having a breakdown.

And we live on opposite sides of the country, so there's no way to get any sort of physical comfort to help ease the burden of pain and guilt and grief.

Monday rolls around and I have to go to work. As I said, I can't afford to take time off. Well, since I had been so sick on Friday, everyone was asking me if I was okay. 

I've had my own parents stub out cigarettes on me. I've been beaten. I've been emotionally abused to the point where if I see my abuser, I go into hysterics. If I hear that my abuser was at a location I frequent, I go into hysterics. While suicidally depressed, I was told that I deserved it and did it to myself and then broken up with by my fiance.

And this is so much worse than all of those other things. No, I was not okay.

Tuesday, it's all I can do to not curl up under my desk sobbing. I never really got any time to grieve and I'm the receptionist, so I have to play perfectly fine and happy. However, by this point, the strain and pain and stress has kept my muscles too tense for too long and they are cramping constantly, so now I have a significant amount of physical pain on top of the emotional devastation.

I woke up this morning and had to decide to take the loss on my paycheck because I was fairly certain that if I got in my car, I would purposefully wrap it around a pole so I wouldn't hurt anymore.

My stomach rejects anything I try to eat and it's all I can do to keep food down. I'm in terrible pain and now further stressed out by having to miss work. I don't know what to do.

I've talked to my friends and they're as emotionally supportive as they can be, but they also all live at a distance and can't help me financially because they're also only barely making ends meet (yay college loans!).

Most of my coworkers have kids and I've confided in the ones I'm close to and, depressingly, they've all had miscarriages - much further along than mine. But they also now all have kids.

I will most likely never have that.

And additionally, I haven't even had time to properly grieve because I keep having to go to work and right now, I just keep feeling worse instead of better.

It's just... I don't even know anymore."

My LTR/LDR girlfriend of 4 years just broke up with me yesterday. I'll try to explain the situation accurately and fairly. The background will prove to be scarily relevant to what's happening now.


We started dating during my junior year of high school. She was a grade below me. We pretty much saw each other every day until the end of the summer before my freshman year of college. We entered a long distance relationship, despite both of us not really thinking it was a good idea. We were madly in love with each other, each other's firsts, etc. 


Fast-forward to November of my freshman year of college, merely 2 months after moving away. I was making a decent name for myself at a top university in the US, meeting new people, getting exposed to all sorts of career opportunities, you know...seeing what's out there. 

As I'm seeing all these new futures ahead of me got me thinking that maybe now is not the best time to be in a relationship (After all, you can imagine how needy an immature high school girl was in the eyes of a now ""big-shot Ivy League college student""--I should also note that I was always focused on school, and she wasn't. I was not too popular in high school, but she was. School was never a priority for her.). I was selfish, relentless, and completely disregarded all those around me. I dumped her. I then ignored her completely. I acted as if she was nothing to me. I did whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I was single, free, etc. 

6 weeks later, I return home. All of a sudden, things didn't feel right. They didn't feel right as I was spending my last couple of weeks back at school either. I realized what I had done. Life without her was much much worse than life with her. Being without her didn't bring me happiness. Being with her made me the happiest person in the world. Skipping some details, she took me back. We get back into a full relationship. No bullshit, no sadness. It was heaven. We both appreciated each other, and I certainly didn't take her for granted anymore. We were happy, even apart.


I should probably add that our LDR wasn't nearly as bad as some others. I was only 2 and a half hours away by plane and I would regularly fly to visit her every 4 weeks or so. The longest we have ever been apart from each other were those 6 weeks after I broke up with her. 


Now we are here, 2 and a half years after we got back together. We've been dealing with this long-distance shit for 3 years now. She's going to a state school and graduating one year early, so we could graduate at the same time. I'm taking a year off after college before medical school. She's applying to law school. Our plan was always to spend the rest of our lives together after college. We were prepared to follow each other anywhere. We loved each other deeply and completely. 

During her second year of college, she became very involved with politics and law. She is the president of a large political club on her campus and she performed excellently in school. Her grades were great, her career looked great. She seemed happy. This summer, she got a really solid internship in Washington, DC. It's the first time she's lived more than 3 hours from home by car. Her life is changing very rapidly and she's seeing a new life unfold before her eyes.

Yesterday, she broke up with me. She said that she didn't think it was the right time for her to be in a relationship. She doesn't want a boyfriend. She wants to be able to make a career move or be able to move to Europe for a year without worrying about how it would affect someone else. She just wants to be free. The worst part is that I understand what she's feeling. I was having the exact same feelings when I broke up with her before. It would probably be easier if she had cheated on me, at least I can be pissed at her. But I can't even be pissed at her since I know those feelings.

My biggest fear is that she won't come to the same realization that I did. I fear that she might not ever want to come back and realize that life without me is better than life with me. I don't want to dwell on that, but I can't stop thinking about it. She said she wants to remain friends and talk every day, but I feel as if talking to her would help her live life without me and have it be easier for her. If I stop talking to her and let her have some space for a few months while she's working, maybe she sees how living completely without me affects her. 

What should I do? Should I stop talking to her? I want to get back together with her, but only if it makes her happy. I don't want to force her into anything, but it would be ideal if she looked at her life at the end of the summer and realized that she would rather be with me than without me. Thanks for reading and I appreciate any help!

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me yesterday for the same reasons I broke up with her briefly a couple of years ago; what can I do so that she might come to the same realization I came to when I got back together with her?"
27wpps,10,2014-06-11,"I am an undergrad with a non-STEM major and no real STEM experience, I doubt my own competence, but I can't give up the dream of being a scientist. Advice?",[deleted],LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/27wpps/i_am_an_undergrad_with_a_nonstem_major_and_no/,"Hi, Ladies of Science. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question, but I wasn't sure where else to go.

I have always loved learning and been passionate about a broad range of academic subjects, ranging from the humanities to the sciences. By the end of high school I had won a few awards for writing and earned a lot of local recognition. So I began to think that, since writing was definitely one of my passions, I should just study English in college. I applied to one of the top Ivy league schools as an English major, got in, and chose to attend. Almost immediately I realized that I only really enjoyed writing for myself, and that a career in writing would make me miserable unless I was one of the impossibly talented few who could become novelists and earn a living from it. So I have been searching for a major since then, and I finished my first year with a laundry list of 10 completely unrelated courses in various disciplines that interested me.

Over the past year, I have narrowed my interests down a bit. I have realized that I am passionate about a career in which I can help people, but that I am too sensitive and introverted to work directly with those who are suffering all of the time. I started to think about studying public health or epidemiology, because it interested me greatly and seemed to combine a lot of my broad interests. 

But I just can't seem to forget the idea of studying ecology and evolutionary biology. I don't know why the idea appeals to me so much, except that since I was little nothing has fascinated me more than nature and wildlife. I have spent long periods of my life walking around in the woods. When I was very young I used to memorize the names of species and draw pictures of them in my notebooks, pretending to be a wildlife biologist. I collected seashells that I found along the beaches in my state and classified them for fun. I attended marine biology camp for a few summers and loved it. 

But I also realize that none of this is remotely similar to an actual career in wildlife biology or related fields. This is where the dream stops. I tell myself I am being juvenile, I wouldn't actually like a career in science, and most importantly, that it's too late. Everyone around me already has lab experience and I don't. Everyone around me has spent their four years in high school helping with papers and doing internships and I've just recently begun to learn how to read scientific papers. I guess this is the consequence of going to such a competitive school (and having applied with a completely different major)-- everyone who's studiyng STEM is miles ahead of me and it seems impossible to catch up. 

Furthermore, I wonder if I am not cut out for this kind of career. I struggle a lot with math and I find science much more challenging than other subjects. I am also very sensitive to stress and I worry that STEM careers are too cutthroat foe me.  I wonder if I would just never amount to anything if I studied science because I don't have the raw talent nor the determination.

I know that I am too ahrd on myself. Right now I have a 3.8 GPA. I have taken Biochem and Biophysics and got A-s in both. I took calc II and got a B. Logically I know that these grades are good enough, and that I could probably do it if I wanted to. But emotionally, I wonder if I'm really capable of handling the stress and rigor. I think part of it is that the idea that women aren't really cut out for science has been drilled into my mind by my parents, who always encouraged me to study law because of my talent in humanities. 

Because I have taken a few prerequisite courses, it isn't too late to study ecology and evolutionary biology. I would just have to take a slightly heavy courseload next year and then I'd be on track. But I need to decide before school starts again, and I'm wondering if you can help me.

Do you have any advice for how to decide whether or not this major is worth attempting? How will I know if I'm cut out for the work? And if I do choose this path, how can I get on track with research when everyone else who applies to work at labs already has years of experience?

Can anyone who works in these fields give me an idea of what the work looks like on a day to day basis?

Thanks, adn I'm sorry if this is long and disorganized. Everyone told me I had plenty of time to choose a major, but time really is running out now if I want to do my degree in 4 years.

27wq9e,2,2014-06-11,CS major vs. CS/stats double major considering possible interest in data science,cs_stats_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27wq9e/cs_major_vs_csstats_double_major_considering/,"I'm an undergraduate student in a North American university, planning to major in CS. I'll be taking mostly second year CS courses next fall. I already have an European bachelor's degree in physics with a CS minor and quite a bit of math/stats courses. Data science, machine learning and the like seem very intriguing to me, since while I love coding, I'm afraid that I'll get bored in a dev job that doesn't involve any math or science. It will be time to declare my major soon and I found out that my school offers double majors, one of them being in CS and stats which would probably serve me well if I did decide to continue on to a master's and/or PhD in something involving data analysis.

The problem is that doing the double major would limit the number of CS courses I get to take, since I don't really have the money to take more courses than are required for a BS. The CS/stats double major would require me to do a total of 13 CS courses and 11 stats courses, leaving room for only a couple of extra CS electives. The other possibility is a honours degree in CS, consisting of 21 CS courses and just one stats course, with a little more wiggle room for the electives (which might as well be stats courses).

Will I be at a disadvantage in the software development job market, if I do the double major and decide not to do a graduate degree (which I realize is required for most real data science jobs) later? I would of course try to get some good internships and personal projects under my belt before I graduate, no matter which major(s) I choose.

Thank you for any responses!"

27x1hr,9,2014-06-11,Is summer internship worth it when it's not exactly in your area of interest?,rui278,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/27x1hr/is_summer_internship_worth_it_when_its_not/,"So, i've got a chance to do an internship, and i'm torn about it.

I'm a computer engineering grad student, about to enter my final year, and i have the chance to do an internship this summer. The thing is, it's not exactly in my area. It's about design validation, while i'd be more interested in the actual design part. What i'm really asking is, it's not really exactly my area, but i feel like it is in the vicinity of it/close to it.

So my question is, do you think internships that are only close to what you want to do, but not exactly, are worth it (and i'd be losing around half my last summer and it's an unpaid internship)

(p.s. i've already done an internship before, but while an undergrad, and was not in my exact area of interest, but was in a big company(though, again not my exact area))

EDIT: I'm from Portugal. In here unpaid internships are kind of the norm around here, so i wouldn't worry too much about that part of the deal. It's a bummer, but a normal bummer. If i'd gone through more trouble i could probably have gotten a paid internship, but i didn't so i just when through my schools internship pool, which is mostly for unpaid stuff... The actual company i'd be working for is actually a multinational and cool, though not exactly in my area..."

[Are you concerned that George R.R. Martin will kill you off?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54tnr?context=5)|Hopefully not until I am able to finish off the very last episode of the show!
[Also, on the back cover of season 2 soundtrack, it says it was recorded in Prague by The Czech Film Orchestra and Choir. Were the other soundtracks also recorded in Prague?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54dpn?context=5)|Yes, all those soundtracks are recorded in Prague.
[Do you come to consult or supervise to Prague?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci559wy?context=5)|Oh yes! I connect with them through the internet and am present during the entire session and give comments over the internet. 
[Has George R R Martin spoken to you or commented on your work at all? What does he think of the music? What did he say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54gnn?context=5)|I think he likes the music. We saw each other at the premiere for Season 4 in New York, and I actually thanked him for creating this amazing world of Game of Thrones that I can now paint with music. 
[Hi Mr. Djawadi, I'm a huge fan of the Pacific Rim soundtrack I could listen to whole CD everyday. I was wondering did you and Guillermo del Toro talk during development to discuss how he wanted the score of the movie to sound like or were you given free range? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54lr7?context=5)|Guillermo was a huge influence during the whole process. He's super-creative and he had a very clear vision of how he wanted the score to sound. So everything was discussed, from guitars to big brass to the choirs, and he was very sophisticated with ideas. It was an amazing collaboration. 
[Hi Ramin, I can't thank you enough for giving us the opportunity to interact with you in this AMA, and my question is ... what instrument in your orchestra do you feel best encapsulates the Game of Thrones aura?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54eo0?context=5)|That would be the cello, because that's the instrument you hear in the beginning of the main title and it's very prominent throughout the score.
[Adore your work, and I cannot recommend enough listening to your sountrack while reading the books on long flights ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54eo0?context=5)|And that's great!
[What sound library do you use for that cello sound most often?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55gqu?context=5)|I don't, because it's a real cello. It's all live performances. 
[Did you know anything about Game of Thrones before you were asked to create the theme? What sort of guidance/information were you given by the showrunners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54df9?context=5)|I was approached while the show was still in production. They actually showed me the first two episodes, which were ready, and explained to me the overall approach of the show. And for the main title, they said ""make it like a journey."" That was really the overall comment that they wanted for the main title, just because you see all the locations. So they said it needed to be like a journey. I saw the first 2 episodes, and they just spoke for themselves, I just saw how great this show was and was very excited to be asked to be part of the show. 
[What's the music-making process like in general for GoT?  How collaborative is it?  I mean, do you just watch the raw material and score based off that, or have D+D sat down and outlines specific things they want to hear or do with the music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54dac?context=5)|We get together before very episode. We watch it through, then discuss where the music should start and where it should end. Then we discuss what the music should do in every scene. And then I go off and write all the music, and then we meet back again, I play them everything that I've got, and then they give me notes and we make tweaks and then that's it!
[What is your usual inspiration for your music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54nqw?context=5)|Silence. I wake up in the morning, and when it's completely quiet, that's when I usually have my ideas. Because there is no other external influence. 
[Hello Mr. Djawadi! Is there a chance we’ll ever hear your unreleased music from GoT? Is it possible you’d release it on your webpage or some other place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54dbo?context=5)|I don't know if there is any? There is not, really. Obviously as I write them things get changed, and I talk with the producers and have to make changes, but it's generally pretty much intact based on what's been written. I'm trying to think if I have anything laying around unused and I don't really.
 |It's a collaboration with Dan and David, they are just so good at giving guidance and that's a huge part of it. 
[Ramin! How did you go about composing for such a heavy emotional scene as the Red Wedding? I really felt like you brought us up and down throughout the scene right along with the characters and the dialogue. Is it difficult to compose music for the deaths of such major characters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54hwu?context=5)|Definitely. Especially throughout the show I've gotten attached to a lot of these characters, and then to see them go, and having to underscore the drama of that is definitely hard. Especially because I have to watch the scene over and over again. 
[Is it harder for you to compose music for disturbing scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54l6b?context=5)|Definitely. I mean, because I have to play the scenes over and over again, there's definitely been scenes where it makes it harder if you have to look at the same scenes over and over. 
[Huge fan of the parts of the season 4 soundtrack I've heard so far! We've seen you combine themes and mix and match them such as with the track 'Two Swords'. What two themes would you like to see come together in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54l3a?context=5)|That's a good one. That's tough. The main theme has been combined with so many of these other themes... How about Arya's theme with the Lannister's theme, that could be very interesting. We haven't seen that yet and it would be an interesting ""payback time,"" right? 
[Do you have any favorite arrangements/covers of the Game of Thrones theme? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54d5a?context=5)|There's a couple actually.
 |One of the original rock versions still sticks in my head, the person who played the drums and the bass and the guitar. That was one of the very very first ones that I heard. That I liked a lot. Then there were a couple of very creative ones, there was one where somebody had the theme playing with computer hard-drives, I have no idea how they did that, but that was incredible when I saw that. 
[What was your favorite piece of music that you composed for Game of Thrones? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54fsu?context=5)|It might have to be the main title, I will say. The visuals were just so inspiring, when I saw an early version of the visuals of the main title, that's when I sat down and wrote the theme. I wish I could take credit for the metal-shine sound on the sun in the introduction, but the mixers did it, it's not part of the music, unfortunately I can't take credit for that. But the rest of the music is all me. 
[I know you most likely don't pick what songs go on the soundtracks but there's some cues that are left off of them (most notably Oberyn's theme this year\), will we ever see them get released in Suites? (ie Stark suite, Lannister suite, etc\) or perhaps a complete soundtrack when the series concludes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54gq2?context=5)|Definitely. Obviously we can only put so much on the soundtrack, and I am definitely listening with open ears to people's comments of what music was left out and I will do my best to include in the next round.
[How did you come up with the Pacific Rim soundtrack, I'm listening to it right now? Also what inspires you to compose the music and how did you start composing? Thanks ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54i4b?context=5)|On Pac Rim my big inspiration came from Guillermo. Talking with him about his idea and his vision and just what he wanted to do with the film. I met him on-set when he was still shooting the film, and just seeing those big sets, I remember one set was just the HEAD of one of those robots, and seeing just the scale of it was inspiring to me to come up with an equally sizable score. 
[What was your experience of moving to LA to pursue writing music for film and TV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54nfp?context=5)|I was fortunate to find a mentor in composers Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer. Basically I ended up working for them and that's where I got my experience in writing for film &amp; TV. It's a lot of hard work and long hours but it was a great experience.
[Also, favourite movie/soundtrack?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54nfp?context=5)|And my favorite soundtrack? The Magnificent 7 by  Elmer Bernstein. That movie score, actually, triggered me to want to write music as a kid. That was a big, big point for me. 
[What are the main differences between composing music for TV series, movies and videogames? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54tjq?context=5)|I approach them all the same way in terms of how I start writing my themes and picking my instrumentation. The big difference in video games is that most of the time the music has to play in the loop, so you have to pick pieces that after a while will repeat themselves. I guess that affects things like my TV scores. 
[What software did you use for composing the wonderful System Shock 2 score? Are you a fan of videogames? If so do you have any favourites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci556ah?context=5)|I love video games. The whole thing was done on a Korg keyboard.
[What are some of your favorite film and television scores?  I am a big fan of your work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54mja?context=5)|Magnificent 7, Star Wars is very important, Back to the Future, all those classics. I liked Magnum (the show from the 80s), the A-Team.
[How much are you integrating the themes during the show? Or will they integrate in the future?  For example, when I hear the 'You Know Nothing' theme for Jon Snow, I can hear the possibility for the 'Winterfell' theme being played over it, we know that Jon has Stark blood, is stuff like that a conscious choice? Are you working to integrate themes together (I'm pretty sure I read somewhere you have read the books so you kinda know where the story is going?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55w2d?context=5)|The exciting thing about the show is that the themes have to be created in a way that they can be combined with others. We never know where the story is taking us.
[Also, will we ever hear the complete actual main theme in during the show? We hear variations of it, like the recent episode 'Watchers on the Wall' where we hear a minored rhythmic version of it. Are you saving the main theme for pivotal moments when GoT draws to the final few series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55w2d?context=5)|We use the main themes ( parts of it) only in special moments. That's why it usually plays towards the later episodes at the end of each season. Let's see if we will play it in full at some point.
[Have you heard, and did you have a reaction/opinion to the South Park parody of the GOT theme song? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci551mi?context=5)|Yes I've heard of it and it made me laugh, a lot. It's very cool. 
[What are your thoughts about Sigur Ros's performance of Rains of Castamere? Is there a chance that you will collaborate again with established artists like this in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55uvm?context=5)|I'm a huge fan of Sigur Ros and I think their version of Rains of Castamere is amazing. I hope that there are more opportunities to collaborate with other artists.
[Who is your favorite GOT character and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci55kzl?context=5)|Well, it sort of switches from season to season. It's really hard actually because I try not to favor any of them, even though I sometimes tend to like Daenarys because her story is so very compelling and I think the dragons are cool. 
[How much do you love the Ukulele? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54edr?context=5)|I love the ukulele! I own one and I play it all the time!
[One of my favorite songs you composed was 'For the Realm' in the Season 3 soundtrack. Was that used in the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci564lq?context=5)|No, it was not in the show. I thought it would be a nice rendition of theme for the soundtrack.
[Hello Mr. Djawadi! Just curious here, in which language the choir sings ""Mhysa"" and ""The Children""? Is valyrian? And where is possible to find the lyrics (and translation\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci551k8?context=5)|They are Valyrian-influenced.
[Composing music for films is often about capturing a certain emotion. Is there any emotion that you feel music can't convey? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27wqjx/i_am_ramin_djawadi_composer_for_game_of_thrones/ci54wgw?context=5)|In general music should be able to capture any sort of emotion.

If you could elaborate on your influences and and inspirations for the various House themes, that'd be be great. Examples such as: Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Targaryen and also the theme for the Old Gods and the Lord of Light.  Also, how much leeway do you have in your compositions?

The themes always enhance their actions and behaviors. So in that sense, the theme is an extension of their character. It's just looking at what I see on the screen, what they go through emotionally and that's what I have to express with music.

The big difference is that a lot of pieces have to be created that don't 100% match the picture but overall capture a mood, like tension, or action, or emotional states overall, rather than being precise because you can't anticipate where the player is going to be at what point in time.

I think she is making the wrong choice and I don't know what to do anymore.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/27x8yf/my_22_m_coworker_21_f_is_torn_between_either/,"Some background information to start. All three of us are interns at the same company, work and see each other almost every day. My coworker [21 F], let’s call her Bee, sits in the same cubicle facing my other coworker [21 M], Vee. I [22 M] am in another department downstairs but often interact with them when I need to. The interns are all pretty close and we hang out regularly. 

Bee has never been in any type of real relationship or even been kissed (until recently by Vee). Things have been really good between Bee and we really click. She’s more comfortable around me than Vee. I’ve always thought about making a move on Bee but since we’re all leaving in two months and are going to be a few hundred miles apart, I didn’t see myself doing long distance, and I kind of let that go.

Until recently, I found out that Bee and Vee were getting more intimate and they’d gone on their first date earlier this week. I was so heart broken. 

Bee and I talked the night before they had the date, and she told me that she didn’t want to hurt either of us and she is in a really stressful situation. Our talk was going smoothly, talking about our feelings for each other and expectations in relationships. I kind of shot myself in the foot when I told her that she’d be the luckiest girl to have me. She took it the wrong way and the conversation ended. While by our cars, we embraced and she cried on my shoulder for a few minutes. She told me that whatever happens that I was going to promise her that we’d still stay friends. I said of course. We kissed each other on the cheeks and went separate ways. 

I knew I’d fucked up saying some of the things I said, and her sister, Tee, thinks I should talk to her again. Tee has been supporting me and thinks me and Bee would make the perfect couple. Tee and I have bonded over the past couple of days and she’s kept my mind off of this and has encouraged me. She’s told me that Bee has been waiting for me to make a move. I think it’s a little too late now.

Part of me thinks that she’s going after him just because she’s never had the experience and since he will be gone in two months anyways, it won’t matter. It seems like she’s just using us. 

Bee is coming over late tonight and I’m not sure what to tell her. I feel like an ultimatum that I can’t be friends with her anymore if she dates Vee is going to be the only thing that could turn things around for me but it would hurt her a lot.

Guys, what can do to hopefully fix this situation? And what do I say to her tonight?



TL;DR: Female coworker has feelings for me and another male coworker. She is more comfortable around me than him yet she’s still pursuing him.

I was recently handed down an account that my mother opened up for me in 2006 and am unsure if keeping it there will be the most efficient use. Altogether it is currently about $15,000 between three different mutual funds with expense ratios of 1.5,1.45,1.54. Since 2006 the investment return is nearly 6.5%. 

My question is should I keep the money in the goldman sachs account or find a more efficient way of using it? I am 21 years old and am planning on using my summer internship money to start a Roth IRA so the options I am considering are as follow:

1. Keep the 15k in the Goldman sachs account 
2. transfer over the money to a index fund in vanguard (lower expense ratio and possibly greater return)
1. put the 15k into my roth ira account 

*NOTE: No matter which option I choose I still am going to open a Roth IRA in the next month or so with contributions monthly.*

I am not sure what to do with the money mostly because I am not sure of any possible penalties/taxes that can make moving the money out of the account the wrong choice.

I just got a fall intern offer from Amazon.  However, I was planning to take several important classes this fall (distributed systems, databases, fundamental algorithms).  I asked my recruiter if it was possible to trade the fall offer for a summer one.  The recruiter said they will not have the necessary summer information until fall, but it should not be a problem since there are plenty of summer spots.

Here are my two options and what I think are their benefits:

Fall Internship

* I can pursue another internship next summer.
* Better resume, sooner.  This summer I am doing programming for my university and last summer I interned at a non-CS centric company.  So thus far, I have not had any California/Seattle-caliber resume strength.
* I am paranoid that I will end up not getting the summer offer.  If I wait until fall to hear the news, then it will probably be too late to accept the fall offer.

Summer Internship

* More experience from classes.  Will enable me to perform better during the internship and receive a full-time offer.
* Normal schedule and graduate on time.  I calculated it and I could graduate on time, but there is little room for retakes if I fail and I will be behind my same year friends/classmates.

Please tell me which is the better option and why.  Thanks!"

I've graduated college and I've got a decent internship with a much better job i'm interviewing for next week. So I've got some decent money coming down the pipe and its time for me to get a new-to-me car.

My current car (04 Grand Am V6), has seen neglect and abuse like no other. I hated the car when I first got it, and I put it through hell on purpose. As I got older and more mature, I loved that it took *everything* I dished out and kept on running, but I inadvertently had to put lots of abuse on it these past 3 years (they've been pretty rough on the car). This doesn't have much to do with the story or my post, but count it as a winning endorsement for Pontiac's Grand Am. I would not hesitate to drive it cross country tomorrow, despite the fact that it once went 60,000 without an oil change (I told you I used to hate it). I've owned a couple cars while owning the Grand Am, but they were all shitboxes (a 1st gen crx) or totally impractical (MR2 and Ford 302-powered-mid-eighties-Volvo wagon)

Anyway, I have already decided on the car I want. I want something classy. Something that has a hatch, a stick shift, and a turbo. I want something with HID's and heated seats with a bitchin' stereo to match. I want a Volvo C30. I've done some searching and C30's are in my budget and have everything I want in a vehicle right now.

What I want you folks to do is to tell me why I shouldn't buy one. Give me a good reason not too. There are a few things I don't want to hear though:

""X car is in the same price range and is awesome. Why don't you get that instead?""- I've looked at all those makes and models and settled on the C30. 

""European car = Expensive maintenance/complicated to work on/etc""- I've been wrenching on cars on my own for about 10 years now and I did it professionally for 3. I'm not really worried about maintenance. I am a bit of a stickler about good maintenance habits these days. 

So convince me that I shouldn't buy one. I am open to criticism or new ideas. I mostly just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Also if there are any C30 owners in this sub-reddit let me know. Also should I go with the R-design trim? Is it worth it?"
27xfzj,1,2014-06-11,My roommates are living breathing pieces of worthless shit.,AnewRevolution94,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/27xfzj/my_roommates_are_living_breathing_pieces_of/,"I'm entering my third year of university in fall, currently in summer session right now. Being an indecisive about which of my two top universities I wanted to go to, I didn't put a housing deposit down and got assigned a shitty dorm. The dorm was literally full of weirdos, but I managed to meet two somewhat normal people on the floor and one of their friends, and in the same fall semester decided to sign a lease for the apartment I'm currently in and have lived in for a year now.

Here's the part where the shittiness unfolds. To be fair, one of the guys isn't so shitty, just passive about the shittiness. One of my roommates is positively sociopathic. He's a huge frat-boy meathead, tribal tattoo to boot, huge ladies man too. Freshman year being around him I thought he was a little rough around the edges, stubborn, slightly sexist but otherwise a normal person. Living outside the dorm and in an apartment together made me see the real side. He's a chronic liar about everything, not just to save his ass. For example, he denies turning the A/C to 65 degrees and leaving it there all day several times a month running up the bill, denies igniting the kitchen range on fire when I come back to a smoky apartment, denies removing smoke detectors that we get charged for tampering with, etc. He got his car towed for parking in a reserved spot, and argued against the tower even after the tower pulled up pictures of his truck. He'll brag over phone calls to his younger brother about how many bitches he's slammed and then in the same conversation complain about being stuck with only one slam. I thought it was funny at first that any girl that showed any romantic interest in him would hate him infinitely after he used them, but I realized how completely dysfunctional this motherfucker is. Aside from chronic lying he's the nastiest motherfucker on the planet, leaving his sweaty ass gym clothes everywhere, leaving MY plates and cups everywhere around the house, spitting on the fucking carpet when he smokes his hookah around the house, never cleaning the kitchen counters. This motherfucker never washes his goddamn hands after taking a shit either, it's fucking gross. This dipshit refused to buy toilet paper when it was his turn in the apartment and instead stole brown paper towels from his work's bathroom and would clog the goddamn toilet everyday for a week until we hid the roll. Now that I signed a new lease without them he consciously goes out of his way to be more of a human pile of shit than before.

The other roommate is the most discouraging pathetic excuse for a male I've ever met. I didn't get to know him quite as well my freshman year but quickly become disappointed in the future of masculinity when I did. He came back loaded and in better shape than before after a summer internship, and somehow managed to waste all his money eating fucking Chipotle everyday, sometimes twice a day. Naturally, he gained most and more of the weight again as well. He had a summer fling with a girl that never amounted to anything because of his fear of commitment and her reluctance to sleep with him outside a relationship. After that shitship sank, he went back to skyping his ex that cheated on him and goes out with another dude multiple nights a week for the entirety of the fall semester. He managed to find a freshman girl that he wanted to keep off to the side as a freshman slam while horribly failing to pick up other women, and he denies they're anything even though they might as well be Siamese twins at the crotch. The guy always invited me out to go clubbing with his not-girlfriend/basically wife, but I hate clubs and have early classes, but when I did go he gave me endless shit for not picking up girls there. Motherfucker clubs are literally the shittiest places to be an underage male, especially if you don't go with people you know/are comfortable dancing with. After signing the new lease, he got all mopey about how I never talked about our dismal living situations (although I raised the issue, multiple times). He proceeded to be a mopey fuck, trying to bargain me to stay with empty compliments and whatnot.

Fuck this apartment, just two more months. 

TL;DR one roommate is sociopathic shit, other is whiny depressing shit"

Although corporate IT handles the SharePoint stuff, I don't work as part of the official SharePoint development team. I work in the IT Project management office where I've done some basic business application development type work. My 'dev environment' is basically a SharePoint site that I have full admin access to and although I have full admin access, the SharePoint team has some company wide security settings that restrict things like editing certain site settings like themes and master pages. The 'development' work I've done is mostly HTML/CSS/JavaScript copied and pasted into content and script editor web parts or the .aspx files for the sites. 

I recently received an e-mail notification for an MSDN account subscription. I didn't sign up for it and I don't know this means exactly but they also remote installed Visual Studio 2013 on my laptop without notice. (I was using Visual Studio 2010 before that). 

I read that with an MSDN subscription, I can have different resources like dev environments and stuff like that. If this is true, is this the next step in my development as a SharePoint 'developer'?

27xz6p,1,2014-06-12,Confused in what field I enjoy and want to do (EDA or design),[deleted],ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/27xz6p/confused_in_what_field_i_enjoy_and_want_to_do_eda/,"I'm going into my junior year at UIUC as a computer engineering student. I didn't get an internship so as I'm spending time over the summer enriching my skills, I'm seeing some confusion in what field I want to do. My first semester there as a freshman, I got hooked into digital logic and did extraordinarily well in that class in contrast to my other programming/math/physics courses. For the last two semesters, I've done 2 digital design classes that really stress upon the HDLs, optimizations, and designs of modern digital components. Up till this summer, I've been focusing on basic internships that cover ASIC design, validation, or testing of digital devices.


My fall semester courses cover layout and validation techniques with an emphasis on EDA software, and to get ready I decided to learn over the summer. Over the past few weeks I've been working on modifying a microprocessor we wrote in Verilog to a full layout that would be sign-off ready. As I've been doing this, I've started to gain interest into the EDA process and the tools that facilitate them (Cadence Virtuoso, Synopsis Design Suite, etc). I've looked into routing, placement, self-tests, LVS and DRC checking, etc and thought about how these big companies wrote the algorithms for doing so. And as such, I'm considering internships focused in testing for EDA companies using their tools.


What I'm really having trouble with is where to specialize. Other than some required system-programming classes, I have six slots of tech electives which I can fill. I was planning on doing digital courses that take me to advanced SoC design, but now am considering to do courses in verification and manufacturing. I have no idea what way to go based on the market; it seems there's the same number of jobs in both areas and they all have the same requirements, pay, etc. As a future BS graduate who's gonna do an MSEE after a few years in the workforce, what in your opinion is the better field to get into?

27y0u3,2,2014-06-12,What are useful minors/degrees for a career in software/web development? Also general advice for a Colombian aspiring dev.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27y0u3/what_are_useful_minorsdegrees_for_a_career_in/,"So hey, first time posting here. I'm starting college (for the second time) this next semester after ditching my old major (Physics) and my old university for a better one since I got a full scholarship. I have a few questions though, and I was hoping to get advice from older, more experienced people in the CS field.

First of all, no school in my country (Colombia) offers CS degrees. The most similar degree (in terms of jobs and career) I can get is called Ingeniería de Sistemas y Computación which you could translate to ""Systems and Computer Engineering"". It's a 4 year degree, with a big focus on IT and software development/architecture. I've asked a couple of professors and they all agree the name is misleading, since ""Sistemas"", at least over here, is used to talk about computers and computer networks almost exclusively, unlike the actual or more commonly used meaning of ""systems"". I'm really interested in pursuing a career abroad, and I was wondering how well received/regarded such a degree would be. It's one of the top universities in my country (if not the best) and obviously I'm not providing tons of details about the degree, I'm mostly just asking for opinions. The degree focuses mainly in four things: programming skills, mathematics (calculus, algorithm design, discreet maths, etc), computer architecture and software development. But I also have to take quite a few classes from other engineering fields, like electrical or industrial.

Now, since I get to study for free for a few years, I wanna make the most out of my time and get another degree, mostly because Im really interested in other fields but also because I think a wider view can also benefit my career once I graduate. My university offers courses all year long, even during vacation, and shares tons of elective courses between majors, which means if I work reasonably hard I can get two full degrees with 2 or 3 more semesters in school, I just don't know which to choose.

My first contenders are electrical engineering, design, mathematics and physics. I like electrical engineering and design because (at least afaik, you can help me out if I'm wrong) career prospects seem better. I've read quite a few job applications/requirements/I don't-know-what-to-call it and lots of frontend and back end web development jobs require both design and software engineering skills, for example. I'd love to be a web or software designer/developer/engineer, and I've always been an artsy kind of guy (if that makes any sense) so I think I'd like it. With mathematics and physics I'm not so sure. I ditched physics because over here job prospects outside of academia are basically non existent and I don't wanna be a professor or do research for the rest of my life, even though I still love physics. I just don't see how a degree in science would help a web/software dev career, is it worth it? 

Another option would be focusing on my main degree and building a portfolio, but since I'm getting paid to study and job finding can wait for a bit, I just wanna do what I love: study things I enjoy. Even if I do, though, a few classes are precisely focused on portfolio building and I'd be able to cram out some time outside of school to work on my own projects. I'm also planning on getting an internship in the US for a few months, almost a third of students do, according to my Uni department. I met a guy yesterday who got a paid 4-month internship at Microsoft (and have heard of a few other guys at google) in Seattle, and according to him, all the big tech companies target my university when looking for interns in Colombia, which is pretty nice.

I mostly just want some opinions. I don't know anyone whom I can ask  about these sorts of things, I'm just a 17yo dude who's starting out from scratch. Any advice or thoughts would be hugely HUGELY appreciated. Also sorry for the long post and excuse any mistakes, English is obviously not my first language. Thanks if you made it all the way down here!

27y3lc,7,2014-06-12,I need advice on how to not screw up my life.,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/27y3lc/i_need_advice_on_how_to_not_screw_up_my_life/,"So I just read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/27we3l/student_loans_have_ruined_my_life/) post, and I can't help but think this will soon be me. If I continue living the way I am now, it definitely will.

Here's my situation:

Problems:

1) I've been at a moderately expensive US university for 2 years. I have a 2.0 GPA because I pretty much failed my entire sophomore year. I've been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety disorder, and adult ADD all in the past 6 months by two different doctors. I am near $25,000 in debt with less than 40 credits to my name, and I need 120 to graduate.

2) I don't really know what I want to do with my life. I would like to someday own my own business, or maybe freelance or trade stocks. I really want to work for myself. But specifics, and how to get there... I have no idea. I went to college because that's just what you're supposed to do, I guess I'm not the first to fall into that trap.

3) I hate where I live. Maybe it's the depression, but even after the meds kicked in I still can't stand it.

Good things:

1) My family is very supportive, I never would have seen a doctor in the first place if not for them. I have a place to live and food to eat, but I don't want to be a burden.

2) Medication kicks ass, really. I feel amazing compared to six months ago, but I still haven't accomplished anything.

Goals:

1) I don't want to be in a ton of debt. If I stay at my current college it'll take three or four more years to graduate, and I don't even know what degree to pursue. I'll be over $100,000 in debt.

2) I want to find out what I want to do with my life. What do I need to know to start my own business?

3) I NEED A JOB. Well, another job. I work part time at a call center now, and... well... yeah... What are some good paying jobs that I can get with only a high school degree and 3 summers' internship experience? Something that will give me enough money to save up and invest in myself.

4) As much as I love my family, I would love to move. I constantly daydream about waking up one morning, trading in my old civic for an old truck, and running away to kansas to work in a factory or something.

Options:

Here's what I think I can do about my situation. This is the part I need the most help with.

1) I'm already signed up for next semester at my university, I don't know what kind of fee I will have to pay if I don't go through. So I planned to switch my major to financial economics(they don't have business or accounting) and try one semester to see how I feel. If I get nowhere I would take more hours at my current job and go to a community college to save money. And get a more focused degree.

2) Leave my university and try for a community college now. I like coding, and I figure a compsci degree from a community college would land me an ok job to get me on my feet. Still like the business degree Idea more though, but I'm not sure what kind of jobs there are in that field.

3) Take a semester off of college to relax, and figure out what I want to do. Unfortunately I can't relax no matter what I'm doing because of the anxiety, but it would be nice to take the pressure of school off

4) Leave college completely, find a no-degree entry level job and roll with it. I really wouldn't mind this, because I could pay off my debt, and even start to be financially independent. Not to mention I could move.

I'm sorry if this was confusing, but I'm a pretty confused person right now. Any suggestions?"
27y6dv,2,2014-06-12,"Got really sick for a few months, have no internship arranged for the summer. Is freelancing my best bet? How do I get started?",AladdinP,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/27y6dv/got_really_sick_for_a_few_months_have_no/,"The title basically says it all. I would like some kind of CS job experience this summer. Because I was ill, the plans I had before fell through, so now it's early summer and I am still without an internship. Is freelancing/working remotely a realistic option for someone without any work experience? For the record, I do have some impressive-sounding school projects to put on my resume, I'm strong in a number of practical programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, MIPS assembly, Javascript w/ other web technologies) and have learned the basics of a number of others. I have dedicated a lot of my own time to learning development best practices along with several technologies. After working with others, I would rank myself as in the top 10% of programmers in my class, although there is no way to communicate that on a resume.

I have a friend who dropped out of college to start a company that is willing to have me work with him for a few months, but

- The company has been around for 2 years and has been held afloat by funding from a startup accelerator in Cleveland. I know the initial funding was $20,000. They are probably provided free housing as well, since they live in a fairly swanky yet nearly completely empty apartment.

- There are only 3 employees, including my friend

- I suspect there will be low/no pay. When I asked him if there would be pay, he said ""Kind of? I think we could pay you, yeah."" His tone of voice didn't give me much confidence.

- The company is at a critical time in its lifecycle, as they only just demo'd their product after 2 years of work. This is a make-or-break moment, and I don't want to deal with the possibility of my internship being interrupted prematurely

As such, I would rather make money and save that connection as a last resort. I like the idea of working in a startup environment, but the simple fact is that I need cash right now.

edit: Further complicating things, my GPA is crap. If it makes a difference, Newsweek has recognized my school as one of the hardest schools in the nation. Additionally, frequent trouble with my health has made it difficult to perform (I had another severe illness the year before this one.) I am confident that my programming abilities are excellent even though my academics are not. Excuses aside, it's not worthwhile applying to any companies that value a high GPA."
27yd6h,1,2014-06-12,Finding my first job as a developer,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/27yd6h/finding_my_first_job_as_a_developer/,"Hello everyone, I need some advice.

I graduated college with a degree in philosophy (I know, I know) back in December 2013. Since then, I took an interest I had in programming and web development and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, Responsive Design, and various other web technologies. I created a website to use as a portfolio, and have since done a few projects, one of which is ongoing, another of which is on pause.

 For the past two months or so I have been regularly applying for positions looking for anything entry level doing websites, web apps, mobile apps using web tools/frameworks (I have worked with cordova/phonegap). I have had plenty of talks with recruiters, had phone interviews/screens, and had one position that sounded like they were ready to take me on board. Unfortunately, its seemingly like they don't have the means to bring on someone who will need to be mentored at the moment, so I'm simply applying for more jobs and waiting for more phone calls. 

The thing is, I feel a bit stuck. Nearly every job ad I see requires 3+ years of experience, occasionally as little as 1, or it happens to not be suited for me (a lot of C# and ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails, etc.). I have found a few (paid) intern to hire jobs that I thought I would hear from for sure, but nothing. I really don't know what to do at this point. I am getting to the point of being really in need of a full-time job, so taking a lot of time and expanding into other areas of web development isn't really an option. 

So what I ask of you all is if you can point me in the right direction as to what I should do to strengthen my chances or where to look that I may have not considered. I check Indeed, Monster, Dice, Craigslist, and Internships.com regularly. What did you do to get your first ""entry-level"" job in web development? Or is it unrealistic for someone in my position to expect to get my foot in the door? 

For the record, I am open to other types of positions so long as they are technical and I can grow and learn new technologies/languages, so if you have a suggestion falls into that category and would be maybe easier to get or just bolster the overall number of applications I can put out, please let me know (one position that I may be interviewing for is software testing, for example).

Thanks guys and have a good day.

**TL;DR**: How did you find your first job as a developer and where is the best place to look for entry-level positions?"
27ydxj,8,2014-06-12,First number close of the summer. With a girl from another country.,riot92,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/27ydxj/first_number_close_of_the_summer_with_a_girl_from/,"Just a heads up my game is a little rusty and so is my grammar so don't be too harsh

So I am home for the summer working at a big company downtown. Today we had a huge conference for all of us interns. During the presentation the CEO points out a girl who traveled all the way from Poland to take part in this internship. He has her stand up and right off the bat I knew I wanted to make a move she is a definite 8 and I love Polish women(being of Polish background). So a few hours later after the conference was over I walk over to her and ask her a question. With her Polish accent she says yes. I then ask her if she could pronounce my last name,(it's a very difficult last name I've always had to teach people how to say it) and just as I expected she got it right. 

After this we begin to make a little small talk about where she is from, how she likes it in the states, and our positions at the company we're interning at all the while making sure to use kino. Turns out she's an architect and I work in IT. She then asks if I could fix an issue with her autoCAD software to which I jokingly said ""well maybe I guess we'll have to see."" After this we had to go our separate ways(I was going to the gym and she had to catch the bus home) so I just asked her if I could get her number so we could get together and talk more to which she happily obliged. I'll probably attempt to fix her computer issue and ask her to go out this Friday.

Any CONSTRUCTIVE criticism is appreciated."

My gf was on an internship abroad and I was 100% certain I would beat my addiction. I actually managed to beat my addiction, and had a badge of 60 days (I was very proud). 

Then my gf came back home. The day before I was reunited with her I PMO'd. I was too excited for her to come back and to show her my progress, but nevertheless I made the huge mistake to actually fap. I was furious at myself and was depressed for a long time. I felt her disappointment when I was trying to seduce her, not being confident, and that hurts.

Since then I haven't visited /r/NoFap for a long time. I saw my badge sitting at 182 days today: 182 days of not resetting my badge everyday. It was a harsh reminder of my struggle past year. I am back to fapping everyday and I am unhappy.

I want to try this again and I want to succeed this time. I made a new reddit account specially for /r/NoFap so I could share my story with you. I still remember how your stories helped me achieve that badge of 60 days; when I had urges, in stead of visiting a porn site I visited /r/NoFap and read a couple of posts on the front page. My urges then quickly subsided. By sharing my story I intend to help other fapstronauts and want to contribute to this wonderful community.

I know I can do this and I have confidence in starting this journey again. Stay strong and keep sharing your struggles!"
27yyfd,6,2014-06-12,Switching from CVS to Rite Aid. Any feedback or general information?,[deleted],pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/27yyfd/switching_from_cvs_to_rite_aid_any_feedback_or/,"Hey all, 

I recently switched from working at CVS to Rite Aid. I had worked at CVS throughout pharmacy school, accepted a job offer from them, but ultimately decided to move to a region where I'd be more happy. Unfortunately, that area has very few CVS locations and is a pretty saturated market (it's hard for interns to get jobs here), so CVS was unable to offer me anything (oh wellll). Thankfully this area has an abundance of Rite Aid locations and they picked me up rather quickly. 

Does anyone have any tips or general information they'd be willing to offer about RA? I'm not looking forward to learning a new pharmacy software system, but I'm a quick learner. I've moved from Massachusetts to upstate New York if it makes any difference. 

Thanks all and have a fantastic Thursday!"

Being as I am just an intern this summer with a couple of CCNP level classes under my belt through school, I dont really have the faintest idea where to start in terms of equipment.

Looking around on the internet I have learned a couple of things, feel free to correct me if im wrong.  

- should keep CCIE v5 in mind while designing the lab

- routers should be able to handle IOS 15.X

Other than that, the information out there has been pretty scarse.  Any information out there regarding equipment has been to ""rent it out.""  Not really what im looking to do seeing as we have a lot of spare equipment sitting in inventory (see next paragraph)

Just to give you an idea of what I have to work with here, we have a data center that is full of pallets of inventory just sitting around collecting dust.  We have some equipment such as full chassis's with blades, multiple 3750-G, -E's, and X's, AP's, several dozen 7900 VoIP phones, a handful of 1841's, and even a couple of N5k's that were just added to the pile.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.

Now given that you had a large pile of inventory and the ability to throw together a CCIE lab at work what would you use and how much of it? Try to keep in mind though that this has to be in reason.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

P.S.: any help **without breaking a NDA** would be greatly appreciated."

He's also really business-smart and already set up two somewhat successful business ventures before that paid through his college. He's really into exercise, in-shape and handsome, but most important he's taller than me - I'm 5'11. So I feel like he's perfect - almost too perfect.

I'm currently working a full time job as an engineer but I just moved to a new place so I don't have many friends here and I'm a little lonely. I just came out of college and found out it's hard to meet people. I'm more reserved and not very trusting but I'm smart. We seemed to have a lot in common except he seemed outgoing. He told me he has a really big ego and introverted but he just didn't seem like it.

I first met with him to go on a date and then he suggested we go to my place. We cuddled a bit but when he went for the kiss I told him I wasn't ready for it and I need some time. He told me he respected that but he didn't seem happy. We kissed on the second date and cuddled but he wanted sex and I told him no, he told me the same thing and asked if we'd like to do oral in 69 and when I told him no he didn't push any further. He also told me he liked sex a lot too. I asked him if he was dating anyone else and he said he was but nothing serious yet just initial stages. Later I told him I thought we progressed too fast and he said that's fine and we can just be friends because I didn't want feel like I'm wasting my time. So we hung out again the day after for some food and movies at his place and he didn't try to do anything. He also mentioned jokingly all the guys and girls who'd give him pickup slips and showed me a bunch of them.

I felt he had a nice personality and he seemed like he wasn't in it just for sex so the next time we ate out I just grabbed his hand and we went back to my place to cuddle. He told me he needs to think about it and would like to go exclusive after a few more dates. We cuddled a bit more and kissed but no sex. So after a few more dates but he said he wants to be exclusive and I agreed. But he wouldn't have sex with me and it's already been a month! I'm really anxious, what's up with him - he tells me likes sex a lot and he feels horny all the time but he won't initiate anything (he usually initiates everything)..is he seeing someone else?

**Work**

I landed an internship at a insurance company for this summer. It's a summer long program. I commute about 3hrs every day via bus, which means I wake up at 5:45am. I get into work around 8:20am.

At work, I sit in a cubicle all day. There are other interns here, but many of them are so difficult to get to know well. The rest of the employees are jaded and fill a demographic consisting of older middle-age women and overly egotistic men.

In short, there is no one to talk to and the work never ends.

I leave work around 4:19pm. I catch a bus and we sit in traffic for about another 1.5hrs. I get home around 6pm, eat family with my dinner and try to find time to go to the gym. Most days I have just enough time to get my shit together for the next day. I'm in bed by 10pm.

**Social Life**

My days are consumed by my job. I don't have a summer anymore, which means less time for friends. Occasionally there is time on the weekends, but I only have maybe 2 or 3 friends who I speak to regularly. They mostly work part-time, so while I work during the week, they pick up weekend shifts.

**Relationship**

And of course, this story wouldn't be complete without a fucked up relationship.

I fell for a close friend maybe 5 weeks ago. I like her a lot, too much even. She captured my heart, and right when things were heating up, she tells me she is going away to Boston this summer (140miles) and will be living in an apartment with 4 friends for the entirety of the next 12 weeks.

She left 2 weeks ago. She was planning to come home this weekend and see me Friday (tomorrow) but she just texted me telling me our plans have fallen through.

She has a problem with communication. She does not reciprocate well. She told me about this when we got together and I just sort of brushed it off as a problem that we will fix when it occurs. 

Anyways, communication is a huge problem. I don't know if she has lost interest, or is too busy, or just doesn't understand the fundamentals of conversation but I am always starting the conversations, always asking questions. If i stop at any time, the conversation dies. She is more than willing to go 2, 3, 4 days without talking to me; HOWEVER, she claims she cares for me, and I believe her. She apparently has a hsitory of communicating this way with signifcant others. She is use to infrequent communication, while I am use to constant communication. I know she cares for me and I am not in denial about this. I just need to talk with her, but with her inability to converse well through texting, I am hesitant to bring up the conversation by text. I planned to talk things over with her this weekend, face to face but there is a problem: she isn't coming home which means another week, in the very least, of not seeing her.

There are times when this relationship, even with the inherit distance, is fantastic. But the while I’m stuck in my box all day, with no one to talk to, she is out in the city having fun. We are on two different frequencies. I know this is detrimental for my health. I know the relationship is failing but I’m not ready to give up yet. This isn't going to be easy, and we knew it wouldn't be when we started, but I will have to speak to her after work and try to mend this.

There are plenty of details about our relationship that I am omitting that change things, but this isn't r/relationships

**PLEASE** go easy on the relationship help. I don't need people telling me my relationship is failing. If anything, just give me advice on how to make it work. I know, it's not doing well but I need strength, not criticisms.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________


I'm feeling pretty terrible right now. Every day I have this bipolar depression that washes over me while I’m at work and rinses itself clean with happiness once I am home. I get upset not talking to my girlfriend; I get upset with work and the shit hole of a city I am in where I see people taking shit behind trees in the park. I get upset with not being in control of my life, with facing the inevitable 40 hours a week grind that will occupy my future. I get upset thinking how to fix my relationship, when my SO just doesn't see how difficult this is for me but I don't think I should mention it to her because then I am suddenly that needy little burden back home who is only going to bring her down.

I'm not suicidal. I'm not on medication. I'm just exhausted and need to talk

Historically these have been paper, so there are I kid you not, **1,000+** Bankers Boxes filled with paper (they are organized at least into general topic/year) dating back several decades.

My boss (CFO) and myself are very pro-paperless. We'd like to get some interns at some point and give them a procedure for easily scanning them all and ditching the *literally* rooms of paper we have. I have a nice SAN, full backups, offsite cloud storage even, so it'll be fine to toss the paper once it's digital.

I would like to keep this as economical as possible, so I'd rather not ask for $20,000 for a super-scanner. We do have a number of Konica Minolta bizhub's (C454e, C452, C224, etc.), and some large Canon office copier/scanner/printers as well. I was hoping to use the scanning capability of one of those. Have it scan compacted PDFs, and put them into folders based on the box they were in. Easy. The only problem though is naming the PDFs. Sure, it auto-generates a name, but it's cryptic, so you'd need to rely on search, but you can't search the PDFs then when scanned. I could look into an OCR add-on to one of the Konica's, but am unsure how the indexing of that would work out.

I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible with as little extra software as possible, hopefully keeping it to just files in folders on a server.

Anyone else take on such a project and have some thoughts for me?"

What would you reccomend I do next? My long-term dream is to make my own medical device and/or own a business. I really enjoy the over-all design process and being able to bring all aspects of the field together for innovation, but I am definitely most skilled in Electrical/Mechanical engineering.

27zkk1,8,2014-06-12,I [20F] am finding it more and more difficult to spend quality time with my [31M] boyfriend. Way to comprise or are we simply in different life stages?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/27zkk1/i_20f_am_finding_it_more_and_more_difficult_to/,"Title Update: **COMPROMISE** not comprise. Whoops!


I have been dating my boyfriend for about 1.5 years. We are in committed long-term relationship. 


My boyfriend recently got a job in IT. Though he enjoys his job, his work schedule can be stressful and exhausting. In addition to regular hours, he basically functions as an ""on-call"" IT guy. As a result, he is usually too tired lately to go out and do things with me. He prefers me to come to his place to hang out. 


I usually enjoy hanging out at his place, but things have changed. My boyfriend has recently taken in a roommate. The roommate is an old friend of his who would probably be homeless if it weren't for my boyfriend. The roommate isn't permanent, but my boyfriend said he could stay over for up to 5 months (which I think is more than generous!). Anyway, I do not enjoy going over &amp; hanging out with my boyfriend and his roommate because I feel like a ""bro."" Our time together doesn't feel special to me. 


We tried compromising by having the roommate hang out with other friends while my boyfriend and I spent time alone at the house. Even then, it wasn't enjoyable because there would inevitably be a time limit on how long I could see my boyfriend before the roommate would return (this was usually only a few hours). Plus, I felt more pressure to make our alone time ""worth it"" since it was kind of a hassle for the roommate to coordinate things so he would be out of the house on our date nights.


Eventually, my boyfriend and I decided to simply do more things outside his house. This way, the roommate wouldn't be involved in our plans at all. It is easier to coordinate things with 2 people instead of 3. However, due to my boyfriend being so tired after work (with reason!), he usually doesn't have the energy to go out with me. 


Currently, I see him maybe once a week during the weekend. We text and IM sporadically throughout the day, but even that can be difficult because he is so busy at work. I wish we could go out more but I also understand my boyfriend physically doesn't have the energy to do so as often as I want. I feel kind of torn at this point. I understand my boyfriend's situation, but I also wish I could go out with him more often than we currently do.

My boyfriend's answer to this is that I should come over more often. He said if I want to see him more often, I should loosen up and be willing to hang out even if the roommate is present. Based on my past attempts to hang out with my boyfriend and his friends, I end up feeling like a ""bro."" In my mind, we're not having quality time. We're just ""chilling"", watching TV, or playing video games with his guy friends. 


Between the sparse texting and once-weekly visits, I feel disconnected. I love the guy, but part of me feels like we might just be too fundamentally different to make things work. He simply has more responsibilities than me right now (I am actually pretty busy with a summer internship but I don't work nearly as long/hard as he does).


Reddit, any solutions that could work for both of us? Part of me is hopeful that, as my internship responsibilities pick up, I might be more accepting of seeing my boyfriend less since I'll be busier. But the other part of me feels like our lack of time spent together is making it more difficult and less fun to date him. I do want to stay with him though! Help me think of a solution! 
   

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend is too tired to take me out as often as I would like. He says I should visit him at his place, but I always feel like a ""bro"" in the presence of his roommate and friends. Should I simply accept seeing my boyfriend less often and learning to become more independent? Or are we destined to always falling short of each other's expectations of ""quality time""? Can we find a happy medium or do we have to accept that we are in different stages of life?

I was a journalism major that specialized in photojournalism and data journalism. I loved my school work and my internships at college but my new job isn't a great fit for me. My friend is the company photographer and I got placed as a Commerical Data Analyst at the same company. I thought it would be a really good place for my to use my data handling skills. I was pretty wrong.

The company I'm working for has been contracted to put a major supply house on the Internet with their first web store. They're severely behind the curve and their competition is starting to catch up and put a dent in their sales because they all offer online ordering. 

Here's the catch, I have extremely limited knowledge of web development, almost no programming experience that would help me even start this project and I'm feeling so incredibly overwhelmed by the task at hand. Our company is very small and the rest of the team is spread out working on all of the other projects we've taken on so I'm currently working on this massive project by myself.

I can't seem to get anything to work for me. I've tried write code but I'm so inexperienced, I would have to start a legitimate class to get myself on pace. The clients I'm working with are extremely difficult and today I got yelled at by one of the owners because ""they're paying me to sit here on my computer."" 

I'm just having a lot of trouble adjusting to post-grad life.

I was the first in my family to go to college. Dad never even graduated high school. It's only relevant, because ""go to college"" was the only advice my parents were able to give me - in fact, I didn't know what a bachelor's degree was until after the first semester I was there. I also lived in a small town in Kansas with an archaic, technologically trogladyte-like set of parents, so my true exposure to the internet happened in college, where I got my first laptop (quote from my Dad: ""Me and my Dad never had the internet, why do you need it?"". God I love 'em, he's a bad ass old fart).

Anyway. Freshmen year, I start in computer science. I loved all of my classes, except the one EECS course I was in, ""Digital Logic and Design"". Despite understanding the material, the material was so foreign to me, I talked myself out of continuing, which I regret. Fast forward a few years, I'd switched into mathematics - which I loved, and was about to graduate without a plan (I wish I'd known I needed one), when I found out that the class that I'd taken Freshmen year was hardware programming, not software.

~Now~

This past year, since I graduated, I was teaching High School Math. I enjoyed it, but I started to notice some finer details. The first: most of my friends that I maintained after college weren't education - or even math - majors, but rather engineering, computer science, and IT. While teaching, I started to notice that I felt restless - wondering what else I could be doing. I continued to read up on computers and popular science. In my free time, I mod games like Skyrim just to see if I could get them to work - making it *not* crash was oftentimes more fun than playing (A good friend says that sounds like I'd love compiling code, as I'm a glutton for punishment). When teaching, I often found myself down in the tech and programming lab, talking with the tech teachers about the needs of the tech industry. I also built my computer, spend a lot of time messing around on it, manage servers for my friends and I to play on... and... you get the picture.

Why I'm here:

Reddit, I just finished a BA in Mathematics. I got introduced to coding while I was teaching - didn't know what software coding was until then, and before long, I was wasting most of my free teacher planning periods on codeacademy and watching videos about software development. I've also been learning Python. It's incredibly intuitive, especially with my background in mathematics.

I'm wondering what I should do here. What do you think? I left school in very good standing (close to a 3.4gpa), but I'm rather interested in computer science. Would a BCompSc be a good idea? I think this might be beneficial to me, as it will allow me to relabel myself as a more marketable employee (BS in CompSci instead of BA in Mathematics), get relevant internships (none ever happened, as I was teaching), learn to program, network more, and continue going to school (I love being a student, learning! WOO!).

**TL;DR** Got a BA in math - not so useful outside of teaching (maybe you could tell me otherwise?), heavily considering a BS in CompSci. All three of my summers and my afternoons were heavily taken by teaching ""internships"", so I've no relevant work experience. Advice on what to do?"

First, thank you for taking the time to check out my question.

Here is a little background on myself: I just graduated from a top university with a business degree but found out during my junior year summer internship that I hated working in finance (which was my previous dream job). However, I found out during my senior year that I really enjoyed programming/CS after taking CS1 and CS2. I couldn't take anymore CS classes due to my graduation requirements but want to continue trying to become a SWE or atleast be able to build an app/program. I used C++ in my CS1&amp;2 classes and have done the Python tutorial on CodeAcademy but didn't feel CodeAcademy really taught me anything.

My question is: Is it realistic to teach myself the material taught in CS undergrad classes? If so, where should I start?

I don't really know whether she is truly narcissistic. She doesn't seem as bad as the Nparents some you've described (I've been lurking for a while), but there have been so many times I've read some of those descriptions, and said to myself, *That's her!*

She just sent an e-mail saying ""long time.. I miss you every day. Let's please talk."" This is the first time she's wanted to talk after I went NC. I feel weak, scared. 

I need to remind myself why I went NC, so I can be strong again. So this is a rant as I try to do that. 

this is the person who stood by while i was abused by her husband (not my father). the person who routinely let me starve because i couldn't eat the food they made, and she couldn't be bothered to find/cook anything for me, the person who let me be sick alone in my room with no medicine, the person who hardly ever showed any physical affection, which, when she did show, always made me feel uncomfortable because she needlessly pushed my boundaries (i didn't grow up in a very ""huggy"" environment), the person who touched me between my legs while she thought i was asleep (once), the person who touched my breasts without permission after making me change clothes in front of her, the person who told me i ought to go wash dishes for a living because i was no good at school (when i was 12), the person who could never muster up the love for a single comment of praise or pride in me. the person who hounded me for every penny spent on her credit card after *telling* me to use that card, the person who sold me her 10 year old car when i was just beginning to start to stand on my own two legs (but was still completely broke), (the car then required 20% of it's cost to me in repairs within the first year of me owning it), and then when the car got totalled (my fault), refused to give me the money the insurance company gave in compensation, the person i had to fight so i could get a bank account at 19 (the beginning of my rebellion), the person who insisted on being present at my routine OBGYN exams (until one day when i practically shoved her out of the doctor's office, while the doctor stood there, mouth agape), the person who hung on to all the money i ever earned through jobs, internships, and college awards, until i finally learnt to put them in my own account and not talk about it to her, the person who told me, ""you should look for a man next time, after you break up with [my wonderful, supportive girlfriend]."" this from the woman with a phd in gender and sexuality! (my girlfriend and i are still together after 5 years, btw, and each day i know her more, i love her more). this is the person who followed me to another country when i left to get away from her and all the bullshit that came with being around her, and started questioning me about what money i had been spending on her credit cards. the answer was NONE because i was using my own meagre savings, and i cut up her cards in front of her and told her to fuck off. the next day, i caught a train out of that city and went travelling alone until she left. this is the woman who never gave up that abusive man, the woman who basically gave me the finger when she stood by him, showing me how little i meant. i meant nothing to her. not then, not now. not ever. My dignity, my body, my humanity -- they mean *nothing* to her. 

One and a half years of being NC wasn't always easy. I was ostracized by the rest of the family, my e-mails, phone calls, texts simply ignored. But I stuck through it because this was the way it had to be. I didn't make it come to this. I tried every. single. thing. i could to save my relationship with her. I don't even know why. So this is the way it had to be. 

For the first time in a long time, I had peace of mind. Stress-free days. Laughter. Affection. Friendship. A happy home. Love.

She's still with him, and now she has the gall to contact me. No matter what she wants now, she will never change, and it's not my job to change her. I used to tell her that he wasn't good for her, her relationship with me, or even himself. That when she found the strength to leave him, I would be there to help her. But not anymore. Not now. My life is my own and only the people I choose to share it with can have access to it. And I don't choose her.

Thin privilege is being able to find your genitals.,CHONaPS,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/280gsp/hamfinity_the_final_chapter_thin_privilege_is/,"Welcome back my porky little masochists. If you've read the previous three installments of this tale and you're still reading, you're either a special kind of brave or a [particular type of stupid.](http://www.thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/05/pity-party7.gif)

Before we begin I have to tell you, regretfully, this will be the last Hamfinity story. It seems I've used up all my material. If that makes you sad, I apologize. There's a chance I can cobble together a compilation of stories about one of my other patients. He was way less gross and a lot more funny. Those tales would be pretty low on fat logic, but really high in abject and unrepentant gluttony. Not sure if it meets the guidelines of FPS, so I've been holding off. It might be something...in time. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, we can start. I'm sure you're all faint with hunger. Lets get some sugah in yas before you [go into comas!](http://img.pandawhale.com/112171-Simon-Pegg-faint-gif-Imgur-Pau-Ac6C.gif).

The Cast

same as last time! If you haven't read [parts 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/27q4kb/introducing_hamfinity_bro_do_you_even_lift/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/27r146/hamfinitys_adventure_at_the_hospital_part_2_the/), and [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/27thlt/hamfinitys_hospital_adventure_part_3_the_great/); you got some homework to do. Don't worry though. I hear reading burns lots of calories.

In this tale I will recount you all with the story of how Hamfinity got his catheter inserted. 

[Doesn't that sound like fun!](http://i.imgur.com/EgqnRyp.gif)?

&gt;It's typical for a patient who is not ambulatory (can't walk) and incontinent (can't hold their pees and poops) to get a catheter right away. Moisture can very quickly break down skin, so the patient can not simply baste in their own juices...which is apparently how Hamfinity was accustomed to living. 


[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/whzga.gif)


&gt;Inserting a catheter is usually a pretty easy task. They even let us CNAs do it. I didn't have to, since there was no admissions on my shift (3p-11:30p). 


[Hell yeah](http://i.imgur.com/HD4tg.gif). 


Hamfinity was a special case. He didn't get admitted to our unit. He was transferred in. When he arrived, he had not been cathed. 
For an incontinent patient with that many folds and crevices for his bodily fluids to build up in...


[Why?](http://i.imgur.com/pzIug.gif)


Later we figured it out. 

&gt;Our first attempt to cath him had been done by an RN. She required two CNAs to hold up his massive stomach roll and underlying fupa. Even with two people lifting as much fat out of the way as they could hold, she couldn't find the penis. Or even an opening that might lead to a penis. 


&gt;We rescued the poor nurse from his [cavernous under-rolls](http://wildbasilliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P6190008.jpg) and it was decided that we needed a specialist. 


There's a confusing chain of command at hospitals. If you happen to be one of those lucky souls with terrible veins, you may have met the Lifeflight crew for a blood draw. This is because when you can't do some medical procedure because of various circumstances, you call someone who's better at it than you. Lifeflight crews can draw blood on coding patients in a moving helicopter, so they're the phlebotomist's go-to.


So, who do you call for *this* kind of problem? 

You call in [a bad ass nurse](http://i.ebayimg.com/05/!CDCt97QCWk~$(KGrHqR,!kwE0FEUnU4iBNNN0RjcU!~~_35.JPG). 

These are typically the ICU or ER nurses. Those people have seen some shit. There's almost nothing in the entire spectrum of nursing related duties that they can't perform. 


&gt;ICU nurse comes up and attempts to insert a catheter. Two people once again held up as much of his massive bulk as they could hold. It looked like someone trying to force a whale to take a pill 

(I tried to find a gif for this. I guess there aren't any. Use the power of [imagination](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m79xgnKNOS1qcf707o1_500.gif).)


&gt;She gives up and goes back to her floor. We move to the next person on the list. 


[His poor doctor](http://i.imgur.com/8z7D9.gif)


&gt;It took some convincing to get him to come down. He seemed skeptical such a simple task should be so difficult! 


&gt;he arrived with two interns, and the three of them disappeared into the room. After about ten minutes, they asked to borrow a nurse's aid to help hold. 


Twenty fruitless minutes later...

&gt;The doctor exits the room defeated. He can not find this man's penis. 

Eventually we had to call in a urologist to locate Hamfinity's urethra. He was able to get the catheter inserted, but he came very early in the day so I didn't get to witness how it was accomplished. :( 


The entire time he kept bitching at everyone. Why didn't we simply allow to urine to fall where it may? We were clearly morons for attempting to keep him clean. 

Remember how I told you it was beyond confounding that he had fathered a child? 

[How?](http://www.thegloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Contemplating-Benedict-Cumberbatch-GIF.gif)

Anyone with insight on how a man with so much fat his penis was inverted beyond retrieval managed to make a kid?

At the time of this story I was going to be an RN.
&lt;sidenote&gt; I've since deferred into The Lab of the hospital, which I fell in love with on first sight. They do science, and I love it there. 


&gt;Since I was going to be an RN someday, I wanted to get extra practice in at doing nurse stuff. 


&gt;this day I was reading medical charts. It's the best way to learn the lingo and abbreviations and such. I was pulling each chart one at a time and flipping through all the various test results and doctor's notes. Pathologists and surgeons take lots of pictures. They're gross. :D


&gt;then I got to Hamfinity's chart. I found a handwritten note from one of the admitting doctors. Here's the jist:


&gt;Upon initial examination of the patients abdomen, I found there to be a large mass in between abdomen and groin. I was originally under the impression that it was the patient's scrotum, and was concerned there had been a hernia. Upon closer inspection, I found it was simply an extension of the distended abdominal wall. 

Translation: Doctor had never encountered a fupa before. He thought it was the dude's gigantic, 5 foot wide, ball-sack. Then he figured out it was simply the stomach roll that migrated the farthest from the motherland, and also happened to be the size of a beanbag chair.

I have no industry experience or internships.  I'm great with people and fairly proficient with data structures and best practices.  I believe my interviews were a great experience and the directors I interviewed with were amazing.

I was offered 56k and standard benefits.  This would almost triple my current income.  I will have to spend a lot of time learning new technologies, but this medium sized company appears to be the experience that I'm looking forward to.

Payscale.com shows this offer to be above 80% of offers for new grads in my metro area.

Would it be wise for me to see if I can negotiate higher or just run with it and ask for an increase during performance reviews.   I hear most new grads don't negotiate offers and I don't want to ruin the chance to work with this company.

3 internships:
1 with F500 Company (Tech) in Finance 
1 w/ Bulge Bracket in AM Division
1 in Government - Mayor's Office of (top 4 city in terms of population)


Long story short  - I was pretty brilliant at landing internships since I'm very motivated and had a nose for finding groups in undergrad that had connections to some alumni. However, I didnt realize what I wanted to do until now. Unfortunately, their is a lack of finance jobs in Arizona, coupled with the lack of mentors that can help me along the way (I'm an AAM who wishes to go to t10 MBA program in the next 3-4 yrs or T-14 law program within the next 2yrs, I havent found many other AAM who have done so)


As it is, I'm moving to LA in 2 days and I plan to do a lot of networking. I was part of INROADS in college, so I know that their alumni network is good. Can anybody else give me some extra pointers? I'm basically looking for a Analyst job with a F500 Company or even better a job in Advisory with the Big 4. I know my GPA isn't the best, but through networking I've always been able to explain how my life interfered with my studies in a significant way (had horrible family life due to me being a foster system kid &amp; run away among other things, learning disabilities that I was unaware of) Thanks!"

Since the start of my college career I was fortunate enough to land an IT job.

However, after feeling like I have been stuck in a rut, I began to apply for internships. One of these internship was a web analytics internship, which pays a good chunk more than my current job.

Although, I do not plan on staying with the company, as I wish to pursue a career more related to my major, I worry whether or not this job will be better or worse towards my Computer Science career goals.

With my current job, I have a lot of free time at hand. I use this ample amount of time to learn and practice a diversity of programming languages. This new job would cause me to have to sacrifice this ability. I am also unsure if my experience as a Web Analystics intern will have any benefit towards becoming a better programmer. Should I proceed with the job or stay with my current one and keep looking towards other internships?

I apologize if this is the wrong sub-reddit, and if so can I be pointed towards the right one?"

28162x,21,2014-06-13,Snowflakes and Tartare,Philosohraptor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/28162x/snowflakes_and_tartare/,"I remember watching an episode of the television series “Hannibal” in which FBI investigator Will Graham is having a conversation with his therapist about what it is to kill someone. His therapis, is Dr. Hannibal Lecter. At one point in the conversation, Hannibal leans forward and says to Will; “We both know the un-reality of taking a life…in those moments they are not flesh, but light, and color, and air.” Will looks back to Hannibal and answers tentatively “Isn’t that what it is to be alive?” I remember being so profoundly struck by the complexity of that exchange; I was captivated by the layers of meaning  and subtle nuances.Today though, I should hope Dr. Lecter is wrong; as flesh is the best part.

I’m graduating early this June as a pre-med student and I’ll be leaving for medical school in the fall. I have always had a fascination for biology. I memorized all 206 bones in the human body by the time I was four, parading around family reunions demanding my family refer only to me as Doc. I sincerely hope that is not how I’m remembered.

On the weekends, I drive-well, drove, 50 miles off campus to my home town, where I work at a gas station. January 6th though was a particularly cold Friday night. The roads hadn’t iced over per-se, but nonetheless that was no reason to be reckless, but Jeremy was reckless anyway.

Jeremy Ditter led a troubled life. When Jermey was eight, his father shot himself at the kitchen table during family prayer. The subsequent police report mentioned he was “severely disturbed, a heavy drinker, and frequently violent.” When Jeremy was twelve, his older brother, Thomas, was involved in a fatal car accident with a drunk driver. He was leaving for college in two weeks. Jeremy began to suffer the effects of manic depression when he was 14 as his mother did. She would frequently emotionally and physically abuse him until he left home at 18. However, despite having an incredibly traumatic childhood, Jeremy was an academic success. He was supposed to graduate from my university next spring, one year early. 
	
I was driving home late that night, a drawn out argument with my roommate over how we handled food in our fridge had prevented me from leaving earlier. Around 3:10 a quite determined motorcyclist whizzed around me going at least 90mph. Mind you, it was a cold night and there had been warnings of black ice, so I kept to a smooth cruising speed of 60mph.
	
 I made it about 4 miles before I happened on him. the bike was sitting crumpled in the middle of the road, headlights searching the sky for god knows what. I came to a stop and put my hazard lights on. I sprang out of the car and began to search for the missing biker…which did not take long on account of the groaning. 
	
Jeremy Ditter lay in a heap of flesh and clothing. I was surprised he was still conscious. He was flat on his back in the dirt, next to his leg. I was shocked he was till conscious…let alone alive. Trembling, he managed to remove his helmet.

“Please…” he groaned, “help” 

Being a medical student, I was in a position to do just that. I was certainly no E.R. doctor, but I had acquired enough experience between school, internships, and volunteer work to know what to do. Ditter needed a tourniquet, and quite badly otherwise blood loss (never mind the shock) would kill him. I knew exactly how to give Jeramy Ditter a chance at survival, but I didn’t give it to him.
	
I sighed, “I’m sorry, but I can’t help you.”

When I was a child, a boy who was my year slit his wrists in the school bathroom. He did it one night after everyone had gone home, he hid in the library and waited for all the lights to be turned off. Consequently, the morning janitors were the one who found him, no child saw the mess. Nonetheless, everyone in my grade was forced to see a school psychiatrist. The woman who saw me handed me a stuffed animal and asked if I knew the boy, if I was sad. Our discussion was brief and I was told to go back right back to class. As I was dismissed, I glanced at the counselors notes; “A disturbing lack of empathy.” At the time I didn’t know what that sentence meant.  In hindsight, that peculiar observation probably had something to do with my asking of the fate of the boys Gameboy, and if I might have it. He wouldn’t need it anymore, right?
	
“Wh-why?” he croaked weakly. I cocked my head and kneeled beside him. 
	
“A wise man once told me; ‘the real tragedy is not to die, but to be wasted,’ you have a slim chance of survival even if I call emergency services right now. Wouldn’t you hate to die for nothing?” 

Jeremy’s eyes met mine, the light behind his was dim, but absolutely terrified nonetheless. He began to slowly wag his head from side to side.
	
“No, I w-w-want to l-live!” he managed.

 I sighed again and rose, brushing the dirt from my knees. It was then that I noticed it had begun to snow heavily. Hard enough that one could distinctly hear the snow impacting the foliage. The surrounding black forest hummed with ice. I remember noticing in that in that moment how snow is analogous to human life. Snow falls into this world purely by circumstance,  and comes to its resting place by chance. Each flake is unique and precious, however, collectively they are hopelessly the same. Each flake exists beautifully and briefly. The snowfall inevitably melts, each flake only leaving just a cold impression, a momentary reminder of its existence before every trace of the ice vanishes forever…Examined in scope, what is a life but a single, meaningless snowflake? 
	
Jeremy’s gasps for breath had devolved into weak wheezes, and they were growing weaker still. In those last minutes, he clutched on to life so fervently. He coughed up a great spat of blood, the crimson heat pooled on the white snow, quickly melting all the ice it touched. Had the snowflakes fought for existence, in the end? I kneeled beside Jeremy again, I looked into his eyes, brushing the matted hair from his face. A jagged piece of the motorcycles body work lay next to Jeremy’s near lifeless body. I moved for the piece,  he made panicked  noise and tried to shake his head, I plunged the shrapnel into his neck. 
	
When I was seven, my parents got me a dog. Baxter, a black lab. One day after school, my mother came home to find Baxter and I playing doctor. She shrieked and quarantined me in the guest bathroom until my father  had rushed home from work. My parents released me after some hurried discussion, explaining that in playing doctor with Baxter, I had killed him. They explained the concept of death, and mortality to me, with faces pale as ghosts. When they were finished, I told them that I hadn’t meant to kill Baxter.
 
“I know honey, I know,” my mother cried. 

“Mommy, it’s just that the first time I tried to play doctor with Baxter, he bit me, so I cut open his tummy.”

 After that, my mother bared me from having play-dates away from home with children who had any animals… Luckily, my neighbor had quite a few cats. 
	
I kept eye contact with Jeremy till the last pitiful wheeze. It took only a brief moment for him to finally relinquish his grasp on life, and as his body finally relaxed. No longer incumbent with the weight of life, I relaxed too. I sat back on the ground, and listened the forest hum. The life inside it was dormant, but the ice was plentiful thus giving Jeremy’s death a macabre and hollow ambiance. I exhaled, and drank in the moment. However, my appreciation was short-lived, I knew I had limited time. I rose once more, noticing Jeremy’s severed leg. I couldn’t very well leave that there could I? I took the leg, which carried more of a heft than I anticipated, and deposited in my trunk after wrapping it in a blanket. I then retrieved  my phone from the car, and gave the paramedics the call Jeremy had requested. 
	
Sunday, I returned to my apartment, finding my roommate to be smoking in the living room, again. As I crossed the threshold, he rose to greet me, putting out his cigarette on the arm of the lounger he was in. 

“Listen man, sorry about Friday,” he said. He was slurring his words. It was 2pm.

 “I didn’t mean to go off like that, it’s just you can be kind of a control freak when it comes to the apartment being clean ya know? Like it doesn’t have to be fucking sterile, right?” He playfully punched my arm, then caught himself on the door frame for balance. 

I sighed, “It’s fine-“ 

“Oh and by the way, you might want to wash your sheets, I got a little too fucked up and took a girl in there…Sorry” He laughed and punched me too hard once more.

I cocked my head, making eye contact with him. “Actually, on the subject of food, I have something I want you to try.” 

I went into the kitchen and took off my backpack, placing it on the counter. I unzipped it, and carefully produced a tupperware dish. Taking off the lid, I took a smell, it was intoxicating. 

“Beef tartare I prepared last night, made with lemon juice, capers, onion, garlic-“ Before I could finish, he grabbed one of the balls bare-handed, and deposited it into his grotesque mouth. I smiled, 

“how is it?”

“That’s great…That’s actually really fucking good! Holy shit!… Doesn’t taste like beef though…what else is in here?” 

“It was a different breed of cattle…all the butcher had I’m afraid.” I couldn’t help but to think back to how easy it was to filet Jeremy’s leg. “As to what else is in the dish, garlic, as I said, and pepper, egg, dijon mustard, parsley… oh and shrimp.” 

My roomates' eyes shot up with horror.“Oh no…” 

He was deathly allergic to shellfish… shame. But due to his erratic, and unorganized behavior, no one was surprised he made such a mistake. Besides, who will miss one or two snowflakes?

What is my situation? I have a Bachelors of Computer Science and I live with my parents. There are two software development places here and they ain't hiring. What now, motherfucker!

Slavery and employment are two different things. Slavery is work for work sake. Employment is trading something you do for money. Employees are not and should not be classified as slaves. You can't just say employees are lazy, because they ask for too much. They ask for more than minimum wage, because they fucking need more than minimum wage to live. You can't say they're entitled, because they want to be paid for their work. An unpaid internship is not a job.

When it is stated that wanting to be paid for work is psychological problem, you set up a system where people forget why they are working. I'm not lazy. I also don't work solely to fix your sorry ass problems. I do it in exchange for money.

I finally figured I didn't have anything to lose and a little peace of mind to gain.

 I don't like parties much. I'm that quiet girl. There are times I can get excited of course, but I don't like socialising all that much. After what happened, I suspect I'll like them even less.

 It was one of those parties at varsity - I didn't even know the host, or who the host even was for that matter. Neither did the friends who had invited me and maybe half the guest list. Invitations spread by word of mouth and there must have been at least a hundred people crammed into two apartments. The place was pretty standard - the sort of apartments our varsity authorities lent out to students who wanted to room together rather than alone: two medium sized bedrooms with two beds each and a small bathroom attached, a large sitting/dining/drawing room with a sliver of a balcony and a small kitchenette. I knew it so well because it was exactly like my own. It was even in the same residence block, though in a different building and floor.

 I hadn't wanted to go simply because I don't really enjoy hanging around strangers - I can talk to them, but I take time to become comfortable around someone. My friends - who were also my roomies - dragged me there because in their words I needed to go out more (I was recovering from a particularly nasty break-up and pretty much fed up of the whole dating scene after my last horrible experience with it). 

 I felt miserable. Normally I just stick close to my group of friends and enjoy myself somewhat, but this party was pretty wild. There were couples making out in plain view, and the booze was a little too liberal. I'd been already hit on by a couple of guys, one of whom wouldn't leave me alone and kept infringing on my personal space and I slipped away into one of the bedrooms to get away from him. Not only did I want time for myself before starting anything either physical or emotional, I also didn't really want to sleep with someone who was reeking of booze. 

 Thankfully, there weren't any couples making out in this room. There wasn't anyone else in here, and I didn't care to question it in my relief. I locked the door so the guy couldn't follow me in there and went to the bathroom to wash my face and center myself. I was already a bit depressed from my last relationship and the incident with the drunk guy who wouldn't take no for an answer dredged up bad memories.

 I'd locked the bathroom door out of habit, and stayed in there for some time. After a while, I became aware of sounds from inside the bedroom. There was a soft rustling that I associated with clothes shifting and clicking footsteps like you'd expect to hear if someone wearing dress shoes was walking around on a tiled floor. I was freaking scared because I really didn't want to open the door and see that the guy had followed me into a bedroom. I mean, he had alreadfy disregarded my several requests to leave me alone, and he was drunk off his ass.  I'd had a few situations like this with my ex, none of which ended prettily. 

 I huddled against the door (which was to the right of the sink where I'd been standing), hoping he wouldn't notice I was in here. I knew that if he had seen me go in the room then it would be only logical to conclude that I was in the bathroom, but I was hoping he lacked that reasoning in his drunk state. 

 No such luck. The noises continued for a while before the banging started. They kept banging on the door and started this high-pitched groaning that made me worried about their health. By this point I was convinced it wasn't the guy I was hiding from because the moans sounded too high pitched to be male. In fact, the pitch was way higher than I'd ever heard a female use. And yet there was a sort of roughness to it that made goosebumps rise on my skin. It was really unnatural, and if a party hadn't been going on just beyond the door I would probably have been more scared. As it was, I felt concerned that whoever it was was feeling ill and needed to get into the bathroom to throw up or something.

 I started undoing the bolt on the door before I suddenly remembered something which sent waves of ice over my body. *I had locked the bedroom door!*

 I lived in a similar apartment. They were all cookie-cutter apartments, spitting images of each other right down to the bathroom tiles. And I knew that we had to get special permission to change the locks - understandable, since we needed to give the apartments up after we finished Varsity unless we stayed on as Staff or Faculty. So I also knew that, having been locked, there was no way someone could have opened the door from the outside. 

 I took in a deep breath, fighting to stave off an oncoming panic attack - I've never had them before, but I'm a med student so I knew the symptoms. And I knew it was the worst thing that could happen right then considering there was no one to help me should I go into one - and tried to think logically. 

 Alright, so nobody could have come in from the living room. I was pretty sure there hadn't been anyone when I entered - the room was simple, I knew. It reflected mine, because we weren't allowed to have any extra furniture or replace them with our own in any way. There were two box beds, which meant no one could have hidden under the beds, the windows were large but without any sills, and the curtains had been pulled back because I remembered fumbling for the switch in the moonlight that filtered in through the glass windows. True, there had been a closet, but in my experience the closets in student apartments never stayed  closed unless you locked them from the outside. It had been the source of many an annoyance among us - punching in combination for your clothes meant losing more time when you were in a hurry to get to class, but leaving the closet doors gaping open for all sorts of bugs and dust just wasn't an option. As far as I could remember, the two desks both had had the accompanying chair pushed into them, and that didn't leave enough space for a person who might be hiding in order to play a prank on the next person who came in next.

 The windows had definitely been closed. It was a windy night and there hadn't been any wind inside the room. It had been even warmer than the living room with all the people in it, but the air con had been on out there so it made sense.

 I hadn't heard the sound of glass breaking, either. That ruled out both the possibility that someone had been hiding in the room for a prank or had broken in from outside the apartment.

 Now that my attempt to rationalise the situation was finished, I began feeling afraid for real. If I had thought that I was afraid of the guy getting a hold of me alone, then this was sheer terror. I've always been a calm, logical woman and now I was facing something which I couldn't explain. I kept trying to tell myself that there was a logic behind all this, and tried to hold the scared panic at bay. But I also knew that I couldn't come up with an explanation and telling myself there was one I just couldn't come up with stopped working as soon as they - it - started banging even louder on the door and the strange groaning rose to a frenzied pitch. It was, weird as it sounds, somewhat like a baby's babble. I had the feeling that it was saying something but I couldn't understand what.

 And God knows I wanted to. I wanted anytyhing that would tell me a little more about what the hell it was and what was going on and what did it want and what could I do to make it just *go away*. Or maybe I didn't want to understand what it was saying. I was too afraid of knowing.

 I didn't know when I started crying, but I did, and I remember that I kept thinking *Please* over and over again. There wasn't even any other thought attached to it, just that one word. The only time I'd come even close to feeling this type of fright was just after my ex had come home drunk and tried to force me into things, which had led to me breaking his nose and breaking up for good. But looking back, I'm sure even that black day of my life came nowhere close to what was happening to me then.

 I felt suffocated, as if I were drowning. Everything ceased existing except for that bathroom door, whatever-it-was on one side and me on the other.

 I cried myself to sleep on that tiny bathroom floor. I'd considered opening the door, shoving the large toilet brush in the bathroom at it and running like hell but I knew I wouldn't get the lock open in time. And in the end I just couldn't muster up enough courage to face whatever the hell it was because I didn't think it was even human any more.

 I woke up intermittently throughout the night to the sound of the same banging and that voice groaning and moaning out things which only seemed to get louder every time I woke up. I had my phone on me but didn't even have the energy to make a call or text. I didn't want it to hear me, however redundant it may sound, and found myself grateful that I'd forgotten to change it back from the silent mode after class. It was a bad habit of mine, but I was so freaking relieved for it at that time.

 When I woke up to silence, I thought it had finally gone away. I hadn't opened my eyes, and I didn't want to open the door just yet in case it was just taking a break or preparing a trap that the moment I walked out it would jump me. I lay there groggily for a while, listening to the sound of breathing before realising there were two sets.

 My eyes snapped open and oh God, I don't think I can describe what I saw. I don't think I want to. It was humanoid, it had a mouth and a nose and eyes like a human should. But for some reason it was all so fucking wrong! I don't even know why, I don't remember its individual features clearly. But it left this distinct sense of wrongness. And its eyes were - I don't even recall what their colour was, but I remember the strange images that filled my mind when I looked into them. I had fallen asleep propped against the door, with the lower half of my body twisted and splayed on the floor while my upper half leaned against the door.

 It was sitting right in between my legs, its face maybe a couple of inches from my face. I could only stare at it, numb and horrified. We were making eye contact and grotesque images and scenarioes filled my mind. Even now when I think of what I 'saw' I want to retch, and this is coming from someone who has dissected people and animals, and done it without the slightest bit of repulsion.

 It leaned forward slowly until our foreheads were touching. Then it tilted its head and *pressed its damned lips to mine*. 

 I wanted to cry and throw up and scream. As if on autopilot my mouth opened. I didn't know why. I was absolutely repulsed by this thing, whatever it was. It tasted a little like soil and like the taste stale air leaves in your mouth, and something else that I couldn't pinpoint - it tasted horrible.

 That seemed to break the trance and I punched It. Its head snapped to the side but it didn't react. I was already up and I kicked it away from the door, unlocking it and slamming it shut and locking it on the outside as soon as I was out. Looking back, it was a stupid gesture because  It had already gotten into the bathroom with the door locked, after all. But I wasn't really thinking very logically.

 I opened the bedroom door, still screaming and expecting to see people but there was no one there. I didn't even wait to look around but hightailed it out of there - tried to, because the apartment door was locked on the outside.

 It was the second floor, and I scrambled to the balcony and jumped out on the fire escape, locking the emergency door behind me again. As I said, I wasn't thinking rationally. I jumped two or three stairs at a time, not even caring that the thin iron steps rattled fiercely. I ran all the way to my own apartment, where I found my roomie who had been at the party looking grouchy. She started cussing me out, and said that I could have at least called them before I went off from the party. Turns out they'd noticed me missing and since I hadn't answered my cell had thought that I'd gone home with a guy. When she took a proper look at me she asked me why I looked so pale and like I'd just run a marathon. I lied through my teeth, confirming that yes, I *had* gone home with a guy and that I just wasn't ready for it, which was why I looked so stressed out. Thankfully she didn't ask many questions, because I'm honestly not sure how long I could have gone without breaking down completely.

 I never told any of my friends about this. I mean, at the best of times the whole thing just sounds like a particularly bad nightmare to even me. I don't even want to know what it would do to my reputation as a level-headed med student, about to enter into an internship. It would be disastrous for my career. Besides, its been over two weeks and I haven't seen It again except in nightmares. I don't want to ruin my dream of being a doctor because of something like this, and who would even believe I was sound enough to let into an ER if they knew I said something like this?

 I went back to the apartment where this happened after a couple of days. There was this strong, almost morbid curiosity that attracted me to it. I wanted to know what the hell had happened. I wanted to know if I was insane and hallucinating, or if the people living there had witnessed something too. The whole way I phrased the questions I had to ask to get them to talk about it without revealing what I had seen first. I had to be careful, they probably wouldn't want to tell a complete stranger about something as delicate as this. And I couldn't speak first, in the case that I *really* had been hallucinating.

 As it turns out, no one lives in that apartment. The guys who gave the party - all really nice - live in one of the other apartments on the same floor (every floor has three apartments in our building block). Apparently its one of the two apartments in our whole block that were empty, and they couldn't really tell me why. They had persuaded the RA to let them open up the apartment for the party because their apartment couldn't fit in all the people who they had invited (and they hadn't even counted the ones who had been invited through the invitees). I went to the RA, but all she would tell me was that that apartment hadn't been up for rent for a few years and that she wasn't at liberty to discuss the reasons with me, though she assured me that it was closed up for purely legal reasons. 

 Well, I figure that chapter is closed. I doubt I'll see It again since I haven't seen it since. But I feel a lot lighter having shared this with someone else.

I'm a little late on the internship thing though, I know that.

I know there are summer jobs and internships out there that would be useful to picking up some valuable skills and experiences, my second option would be to work retail, but that's not useful to me. 

I was wondering if anyone here had any leads for any potential positions or any recommended finance related companies I should look at in the OC that would be hiring!

Thank you for your time!

We are both in hard places right now, do I wait until we are both better off and ready to date again?

I get it, I haven't been the best partner. I let myself go physically and have developed an anxiety problem.  

She fell out of love with me a while ago and didn't tell me. I am in college in another state, so when I came back for a few weeks before heading to my internship, she finally said she didn't want to date me anymore.  But she wanted to continue our relationship as is, without all of the romantic stuff.  No calling each other pet names and definitely not saying I love you as often as we did.  She still wants me to talk to her constantly.  She is a very busy woman. She works 40 hours a week as the only manager of her restaurant, as well as being a full time commuter student at a great college, with hopes to start graduate level classes in the spring.  

I have felt her slowly backing away from me romantically for the past year.  It was slow, like she was afraid to tell me directly that she didn't want certain things anymore.  We stopped having sex, but never talked about it. She promised me that one day we would talk about it. I waited, and I admit I pressured her to talk many times before realizing how awful it must be to be pressured like that.  I gave it up after awhile. I also gave up on her ""coming out"". Her family sees how we love each other.  But we never kissed in front of them, there are no pictures of us kissing on the lips.  Was it wrong for me to ask her to talk to me about ""coming out""? I don't know. I know out-gays should never try to out someone still in the closet. But I felt trapped, and almost like I was being used.  At her house, we could only kiss behind closed doors. At my house, even before I came out, we always had more space to be a couple. I can see how she could feel pressured by me in terms of sex- my ""home turf"" was where we were more comfortable to be a couple. Yet I consider her house my home because her family took me in when my father fell further into his mental illness.  


When we first became friends, I was very anti-touching.  I would only let my boyfriends in my personal space.  But Sarah was different. When I cut my hair, she came right up to me, took off my hat, and ran her fingers through my hair. and I let her in.  For the first time, I had a best friend who didn't treat me like crap like my other best friends. We cuddled and took naps together. I don't think I knew what I was feeling.  I don't know if she knew either. She told me that best friends cuddle and hold hands and nap together.  

  I realized that she was treating me better than my boyfriend.  She realized that I was treating her better than her boyfriend.   So we broke up with our boyfriends eventually, and we skyped pretty much all the time my freshman year in college. I kissed her when I went home briefly for the summer. Sophomore year we began dating and realizing our love.  Junior year, in the fall, she didn't come up to my school to visit me. I was really hurt and confused by it.  She had always made an effort to see me in the past, just as I made the effort to visit her.  She was promoted to her manager position and had a million other things on her plate that semester, so in hindsight I can forgive her. Then December and January came and she didn't want to visit my family like she had the previous Holiday season.  It was then when I began feeling like something was up- we hadn't had sex or been intimate really since February or March.  Was it her stress or birth control, or was it me? She kept saying it wasn't me, but she wasn't ready to talk. So I waited and waited. She came to visit me for Valentine's and I was a wreck. She said she didn't want to break up with me because she didn't want me to commit suicide.  That really hurt because, well, who wants to hear that? I felt so guilty that she felt my life was depending on her love.  Even though years ago, when we were just best friends, she made me sign a silly little contract promising to never hurt myself. I won't kill myself or directly cause harm. But I haven't taken care of myself physically so I guess that's just as bad.


I will always love her.  I am still in love with her, if she were to walk in right now and kiss me I don't think I would push her away.  I am just really hurting from her dragging me through this relationship for the past year and a half.  I was holding on to our romantic relationship because she was giving me just enough to feel like we were dating but going through a rough patch.  She's so busy with work and school that we didn't get to skype as much as I wanted to during the semester. But we text constantly. I ask her to call me but she doesn't anymore.  I would call her at work every now and then to say hi and ask her about her day. I would keep sending letters but she stopped sending me letters back. But she would send me flowers and chocolate for every holiday with notes that kept me in love with her.  She would apologize for being so busy at work and with school and would say that I am always on her mind.  And I believe it. 

I don't want to fall out of love with her. I have been home for three weeks and I leave for my internship tomorrow morning.  I will see her one last time tonight after she gets off of work. When I came home three weeks ago, she told me she didn't want to date anymore. But we have seen each other nearly every single day, in between work and school.  Some days she would pick me up from my house after school and I'd watch TV next to her as she napped before going to work.  How is that not love? Wanting someone to be around you, just BE there.  She wants me in her life, but on her terms.  I understand boundaries, but I don't understand why she wants me anymore. I guess I've never had a break up like this. Usually break ups end in flames. But ours was like a fire dimming for so long and I'm burning myself on the embers.  

When I leave tomorrow, I don't know if I want to come back to my house anymore. I don't have a need to return home anymore, hopefully I will have a position for December/January break somewhere, and after graduation I don't have plans to return home.  I feel obligated to tell Sarah that I may not be returning.  But what good would that do? That won't make her snap back into loving me.  Part of me just wants her to beg me to return or whatever. I want to feel wanted by her again. But I don't want to hurt her either. I don't want to stop being her best friend, and I don't want to stop talking to her. I don't want to see her lonely, without a best friend to talk to. She has two coworkers that she is friends with, and one 35 y/o married w/ kids guy from school as a friend. I used to be jealous and worried about Sarah plus that old dude, but have since realized that's my anxiety playing games on me. 




I have to work on myself, I know.  The idea of dating someone else is scary but relieving? At the same time, I don't want to move onto someone else because I have this stupid hope that she will be upset at me for moving on.  and if she showed any interest to me, I'd be right back with her.  I don't want to date someone else to make her jealous. I just know that if I moved on and she wanted me back, I'd probably cheat and go back to her.


God , I am crazy, please tell me what to do....

For a lot of that time he has had feelings for me, but I was in a very long-term relationship for the majority of our time as friends.

About a year ago I started developing feelings for Steve, which was shortly after my boyfriend of over six years had cheated on me/left me for her/moved her into my house while I was away at work. Steve and I talked about things but at that point I was absolutely not ready for a relationship. 

After this, Steve got really passive aggressive and mopey, and made a show of how many women he was sleeping with. I now realize I should've accepted this as a red flag. 

So, a year has passed, Steve and I were great again. Hanging out, going on adventures, back to normal. The sparks and the connection were obvious, and I felt finally ready to move on and be with someone new. So I told Steve I want to be with him, he told me he loves me, I told him I love him, blah blah blah. All was well. Note that part of his job involves traveling across Canada a few weeks at a time once in a while. In addition to that, he lives about two hours away, so we mostly see each other on weekends and do a lot of texting.

Almost immediately after our ""love"" talk, he started getting serious, and accusing me of being in bad moods and having ""changed"". Keeping in mind, we only decided to try about a week ago. 

So, last night I took a nap after work, for about three hours. When I woke up I texted him to ask how work was, how his day was, what he was up to, lots of exclamation points and questions, etc. His response was ""it was fine"". I continued trying to converse and getting one word answers in response. 

I asked, ""would you like for me to continue trying to talk to you or shall I leave you alone for a while?"" And he FREAKED OUT. He sent me TWENTY (no exaggeration) very, very long winded texts about the following:

-not trusting me, his friends (who don't know me well AT ALL) telling him not to trust me, MY FRIENDS (who don't know me well AT ALL) telling him not to trust me. 

-making up quotes by me about wanting casual sex and nothing serious (seriously, made up quotes)

-explaining how awesome he is ""I'm a pretty neat guy"" because my not responding (for three hours, because I took a nap) makes him doubt himself

-claiming that he knows nothing about my days (seriously, every fucking day he gets a play by play, except for yesterday because I took a fucking nap)

-""I know you have no plans to make us happen"" (this is because I applied for an internship in the fall...) ""you keep telling me about all your plans that don't involve us, what am I supposed to think!?"" (again, my exact quote was ""I'm applying for an internship with just for laughs for the month of september!"") ""almost a year's worth of stuff that excludes me"" (WHAT!?)

-more and more anger that once I'm done school (I have one more term) I'll be busy working on my career...which ""speaks volumes"" about my plans for ""us""

-panicking that I didn't tell him where I was or what I was doing in the three hours that I didn't respond. ""it's fine as long as I'm not left wondering"". ""if you're busy it kind of sucks but ok, whatever"" ""what am I supposed to think?"" ""what could I imagine? come on""

-""was it a mistake to tell you I loved you"" Keeping in mind I fucking said it first, dude!?

-then he gets this idea that ""whatever makes me happy"" is A THREAT TO HIM, US, whatever. 

-he pictures me meeting someone, this point was made over and over and over and over in this conversation

-meanwhile, talking about temptations for him, becoming infatuated with people, blah blah blah, and me not freaking out about it

-""if you think everyone lies, what does that mean you're lying to me about!?"" 

I know that most of that is irrelevant, I'm just reiterating my point. This is NOT how I do relationships. This absolutely does not work for me. I need space, trust, independence. I'm terrified that I've made this huge mistake and I feel trapped in this god awful situation. 

Should I tell him that he becomes someone I can't be with when things turn romantic? Should I try to help him through his craziness? Is the friendship ruined? I don't know what to do, but I can not have things remain this way. 
---   
**tl;dr**: Recently started trying to be in a romantic relationship with a long time friend. He's instantly become a completely different person,  one that I, in all honesty, can't stand. I feel trapped and don't know how to get out of this without losing my friend."

Looking to join an existing group or, time pending, form a 2-3 person group of my own. I have no preference on roommate gender, I'm animal friendly, and would prefer a smoke-free area . 

A little about myself, I'm a recent graduate from an out of state college and came to the city for a three month period for a pastry internship. They offered me a full time pastry cook position, but it happened too late for me to remain in Chicago. At the moment I'm back home in western NY and looking for housing from here, because I cannot make it back to the Chicago area just yet. I'm a pretty quiet person by nature. Somewhat of a PC gamer at heart, and this usually takes up what little free time I have from work.

If you're interested, don't hesitate to PM for contact info. I've been working hard to find a place to move into by July 1st and would like to live with others to keep the costs down. I'm sure there are others that feel the same way.

282r0g,2,2014-06-13,Got a question about Programming work and location,somelazyhobo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/282r0g/got_a_question_about_programming_work_and_location/,"I live in England (United Kingdom) and I took a small programming course. I've fallen off since then and recently decided to re-learn from the basics via Python. 

I have plans to go back to education at some point (Or attempt to get an apprenticeship / internship if possible) so I can really learn how to program properly.

Now here is my question. Any sort of job hunting I went with in England went quite poorly, I've even heard of companies moving country due to the lack of people wanting that sort of job.

So here is my question. If I get to a point where I can start working as a programmer, Should I try and stick to England or is moving to another country (America) an -Easier- time to find proper work? 

If I had a degree from an English university, would that influence any decision if I did move country?"

I currently can't apply for an internship due to some college bureaucracy, so I'm trying to find something online. Is there any place where I could find or start a developer team to work on some small, probably non-commercial projects?


I thought about working on open source projects, but since I consider myself an amateur, I don't believe my contributions would be good enough to be integrated into the project.


Also, I'm somewhat used to doing projects by myself, but it always happens that, when I'm nearing the polishing/bug fixing phase, I start to lose motivation and to doubt if the project is any good, and eventually abandon it. I believe having a team to work with would help me stay motivated."
282y03,1,2014-06-13,Getting out of depression when money isn't a necessary motivation.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/282y03/getting_out_of_depression_when_money_isnt_a/,"I'm scared of everything, I hate leaving my house. The only times I'm happy is when I'm drinking/doing drugs (which I've cut way back on and has resulted in me being depressed even more of the time because I don't have any escape) 

My mom killed herself three years ago (2011) and I'm still not over it. She hinted at it my entire life (""Keep these papers in case I kick the bucket"") but she never told me how bad it was. She never talked about herself, she was depressed my entire life, spent most of her time working or sleeping or watching mindless television until she fell asleep at night. (I also had a boyfriend kill myself two months before that)

However, 25 months before she died, she signed up for two life insurance policies (with a two year suicide clause) and with the other ones she had from her previous job, I ended up with a reasonable amount of money. I haven't done anything extravagant with it and since it's all invested, I try to take out as little as possible. But it's only made me lazy and hate my life more. I have enough to live, but not comfortably. I live in a tiny apartment. I avoid spending money unnecessarily, but it's resulted in me avoiding work/leaving my apartment/anything. 

I spent three years cleaning up her estate, dealing with debt, and fixing up and selling her house. But now that it's done, I have nothing. At least when I had her estate to deal with I had things I had to do, but now I have nothing. 

I want to travel, but I feel guilty wanting to do anything with the money other than live my pathetic life. 


I have an associate's degree in a field I've realized I'm awful at that took me 5 years, and to get a bachelor's degree, I'd have to go back to school for four years (or more, considering it took me 5 to get a 2 year degree)

I got an internship right after graduation (2012) because I had a friend whose girlfriend worked at a company I was willing to work at (because I didn't have any other leads?). I was hired as an unpaid intern (and yes, I was doing actual work the company made money on, no it should not have been unpaid, but I was willing to put time in because I thought they would maybe hire me on). I did put my time in and when the hired me on, it was strictly part time at less than half of what people normally make in my field. I accepted it because it was my first job in the field and I wasn't about to fuck it up. 

My boss came in late every day and I ended up having to stay 1-2 hours late every day to wait for her to give me the work I had to have done for the next day. I spent countless hours working at home unpaid just to finish stuff for work. I got yelled at for billing too many hours (because I had to stay late, I wasn't billing the hours I spent at home.)

Then, three months later, my boss was offered a better position in another city. They didn't hire anyone to replace her and expected me to just know what I was doing. I didn't. I spent most of my days crying in my office because I missed her and I was terrified to be blindly doing work I didn't know how to do. I fucked things up. I had to be told to do revisions at least three times on every project. I had a nervous breakdown after getting a cold sore in November 2012 and didn't show up for two weeks because I was so disgusted by myself (I have honestly thought the next time it happens, I will kill myself because of the stigma surrounded with it). I lost a good friend because he thought I was disgusting. 
I ended up getting laid off in early 2013 and haven't had a job since. I worked part time at a clothing store this entire time and it turned into me crying at that job. I asked for my hours to get cut and they ended up just leaving me off the schedule one day and I stopped getting emails from them. 

I tried ECT and it mostly just left me with a four month hole in my life and horrible memory problems after. Six months after, I'm finally able to get around the city/to and from places I've gone to regularly even though I've lived here for 8 years without a GPS. 

I recently switched meds (3.5 weeks ago) and I'm still exhibiting the ""brain zaps"" from serotonin discontinuation syndrome (or whatever it's called). I know this is normal, but I'm tired of it. I know I need to go 4-6 weeks before knowing whether the new med is working, but I feel worse than I did two weeks ago. 

I joined a gym a month ago and have been going regularly, but I don't like to go after I've been crying all day because everyone stares at me. I've gained 30lbs in the past six months and I'm only just starting to lose weight (haha three pounds down) I'm not entirely going to the gym to lose weight, mostly to get some endorphins that will make me feel better. I usually feel okay an hour or so after going to the gym, but after that I go back to feeling awful. 

I'm not going to kill myself because I can't do that to my dad so I'm waiting for him to die (he's really old) before I do anything stupid. Basically something I tell myself when I feel incredibly suicidal. It's fucking selfish and hurts more people than you know and yet it's all I can think about. 

I have no hobbies, everything I try I just feel like I'm not good at and I give up (I used to be really smart and didn't really have to try at things to be good at them so I never learned the concept of working at something to get better at it.) Failure in any form breaks me down and I give up. 

Basically what I'm saying is that I don't have to get a job for money and I can survive for at least 10 years (unless the stock market goes up a-ha-ha) without working so I need some sort of encouragement to do something with my life other than distracting myself from being depressed with reddit and netflix. The only time I feel okay is when I'm drunk or high and even then it's really brief and once I come down/sober up, I go back to feeling awful. Like I said, I've cut back on those and I just feel worse because I have NOTHING that makes me happy. 

I've been broken up with twice in the past three years because I'm ""too depressed"" and ""I didn't sign up for this"" and it FUCKING HURTS. I understand sometimes you have to take yourself out of a toxic situation, but it HURTS when you're the toxic person. My current boyfriend is a lot more understanding, but he still sometimes just has to leave because I'm hurting him with my depression and he doesn't know what to do to make me feel better. And he does try, pretty frequently, makes me breakfast, gets me coffee, encourages me to go to the gym (but still tells me I'm beautiful (though I don't believe it)), but he's DUMB. He's okay with delivering pizza for the rest of his life and I'd rather date someone smarter, but I don't think anyone smarter than him would want me. 

tl;dr: I have no motivation or passion for anything and don't know what to do without the motivation of possibly becoming homeless if I don't work. "
282zjc,7,2014-06-13,20 and depressed,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/282zjc/20_and_depressed/,"Hi everyone, I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post on the site. I read a bunch of posts and I already love it here, so I thought I'd share a bit of myself and maybe get some advice or comments or whatnot.

I'm turning 20 in a month and I feel that ever since high school ended my life just got worse and worse. I'm starting to find it hard to even put a smile on my face. I'm currently struggling in University, going into 3rd year and having trouble switching into the program that I'm not even sure if I really want to do (Just shadowing the business program with a low GPA). I can't figure out what I want to do in life. I got laid off from my full time job last month, and I'm working part time right now for only a day a week, which is enough for my living expenses as I'm still only living under my parents' roof, well with my sister and brother in law, because my parents work in Hong Kong. I have some friends with great marks and working at great internships, so I feel like an under-achiever. Comparing myself with my sister and bro-in-law who graduated University so smoothly and have their life together doesn't help either. I'm slowly starting a small home business so that makes me feel a bit better.

In terms of relationships, I'm not doing that great either. Ever since grade 9~10 my circle of friends slowly got smaller, so did everyone else's. By the end of grade 12, there was so much drama between my friends that I didn't even want to associate with most of them. Then my close friend decides to basically steal my prom date (He knew I was going to ask, and decides to ask a day before I do it), which shocked me pretty badly at that time because I felt betrayed in a way. Plus I considered her my best friend at the time and I really wanted to make things official with her. (But I got friendzoned pretty hard without realizing.) So I went with another girl because I wanted to go for my friends. Then I had the worst time of my entire life at the after-prom party at the beach cottage over the weekend. Me and my ""close friend"" had such a bad argument our friends had to step in before we got in a fight. I felt like absolute trash while watching those two hook up (I saw them in bed together [whore]) and eventually started dating. I've never felt so angry before. I think that's when I started developing some serious trust issues. For a long time after the after-prom party, I felt like a loser, a nobody. I would just stay in the library studying for the upcoming exams, trying to get my mind off of what happened. I had no one to talk to. I cut off all my friends, because I felt no support from them, it's like no one cared.

So later that summer the still emotional unstable me decide to start dating a girl that I've been friends with for a while. But then frosh week for University happened, and all I cared about was to party, and decided to dump her. (That was probably one of the stupidest fucking ideas that I've ever made.) She was one of the prettiest and nicest girls that I've met, and we had a lot in common too. Now she hates me and she has a boyfriend that treats her good. When party time was over, I decided to be a loner and avoided serious relationships for like 2 years and stopped meeting new people as much. I started adapting the habit of being alone. I started feeling more lost, and lost direction in life. Recently I feel like a failure and I feel lonely and empty and I don't have as much confidence anymore. I've been getting close with this girl that I have a crush on, we've been friends for a long time and we just click really well together, but she has a boyfriend, and I realize that I'm just torturing myself being the other guy so I made a decision to start staying away. It's like a lose lose situation.



Sorry for writing this much I really don't know where I was going with this. I just feel as if I lost all direction in life idk what to do. Any comments or advice is welcome. Thank you :)"

And I could not have done it without theXeffect.

Here's a little story about my journey (you can skip to the end if you don't want to read all of it)

A few months ago at the end of April, I was finishing up my second semester of my first year of college and I was extremely disappointed at where I was. I was lazy, I didn't have my priorities straight, I hadn't done so hot in school and I was too lazy to get started on any goals I had. On top of this, I had been trying for months to get an Internship for this summer and I had at received least 5 different interviews. Problem is, each job turned me down. I had no idea why and every time an employer sent me that email saying, ""We're sorry, we've already [some pathetic excuse] the position."", I would just get less and less motivated to do anything. 

My semester was nearing an end and to procrastinate studying for exams, I found myself browsing Reddit and trying to find some sort of way to get motivated to study or do something productive. Somehow I ended up on /r/getdisciplined and I found the post. Yes, the post in the sidebar that started theXeffect. I saw this and was inspired to try this in my life. I grabbed a notecard and tried to think of something to do with it. I really tried hard to think of something unique that would help me learn something new, experiment in my college major and possibly help build my pathetic resume. I had taken two classes in my first semester that were introductions to Computer Science and intro to Java. I had an Android device and I had known that they were coded in Java but I never explored it. I suddenly realized this was the way to go.

At the top of the card, I wrote to do at least 1 hour a day working on learning about and creating Android Apps. It didn't matter what the app was. As long as I coded for at least an hour a day and taught myself something each day, I would hopefully develop a new habit and maybe build my resume with an app that came out of it. I started that day and never looked back. And in the last 49 days I did not just develop a new habit, I found my passion. I learned that I absolutely LOVE making mobile apps. I love coding. I love UI design and graphic design now all because of this simple card. The last 49 days have transformed my life.

I coded aimlessly for about a week, following simple tutorials on making easy apps and simple games. At first I would do strictly an hour because I will admit the learning curve is tough, but suddenly a few days in I found myself doing more than an hour of work a day naturally. Instead of spending my free time playing video games I was actually using that time to learn about Android and app development. About two weeks in, I had some simple apps made from tutorials and I had only missed one day. It was around then that I came up with the idea for my app: 7 weeks. The card method that was working so well for me inspired to make an Android app just for the purpose of making or breaking habits using this method. I worked and worked each day and now that I had a goal in sight, my new habit became an obsession. I am now very proud to say that as of a few days ago, I have released my app, 7 weeks, onto the Google Play store!  

On top of this, about three weeks ago, I told one of my friends about this app. He was extremely impressed that I was making an app and gave me the number of one of his good friends that owned a start-up and was looking to hire mobile application developers. I called him up and we met and I showed him my work. My app was still very rough, but he too was extremely impressed nonetheless and offered me a position to work for him as a mobile application developer! I accepted the position and I now have that summer internship I was working so hard for!

tl;dr: Made a card for doing 1 hour of Android development a day to teach me. Ended up learning about something I now love and I now have an app on the Google Play store along with a job!

Looking back on all of this, I don't think I would've been able to do any of this had it not been for theXeffect. I wasn't perfect, but I successfully made it 46 out of the 49 days with my habit, and it all just came naturally to me. From now on, anytime I want to start or end a habit, I'm going to use this method.

Oh and I almost forgot! Here is the link to my app on the Google Play store: [7 Weeks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryan.brooks.sevenweeks.app) If you have any feedback or ideas for improvement for it I would love to hear about it. I really want this app to help others break their habits using the same method as I did.

Here is the card that started it all: [The Card](http://i.imgur.com/5Fe9pHk.jpg?1)"

I am a full time grad student that interns 9-5 for tuition and works nights/weekends for gas money, bills, etc. In the limited free time I have, I try to run a few times a week to shed off all of my remaining college beer weight. I would consider myself a pretty level headed guy but what's been happening lately has been a bit bothersome.

Tuesday, June 3 2014: After getting out of class around 8:30 I tried to make the best of the longer days by taking a run at the track. I had left a pair of gym sneakers in my trunk with my shorts and headphones, I was ready to go. Although its long winded, it's important to note that I wear glasses through out my day but like most people that have ever run, hate running in glasses. I generally leave my keys, glasses, and belongings in my car when I go running and had done the same this night as any other. My town is fairly small, not one in which people are concerned about theft or any criminal activity in general, really. 

At 8:30 at night I wasn't surprised to be the only person on the track (at least I would think, I am near blind without my glasses but hadn't run in to anyone) so I was free to run to my hearts content. Run to my heart's content I did, just under three miles and back into my car before 9. I took off, headed home and went upstairs to start my daily unwind. 

After setting down my briefcase on the table, I saw the corner of a note barely peeking out of the front pocket. I grabbed the note and saw ""5:48AM"" scrawled on the sheet. Now this wasn't exceptionally odd, I write notes all the time for work and although I didn't recall writing this one, I hang onto old notes at times and this may have been the case. 

In bed by 10:30 life is good.

Wednesday June 4 2014: Alarm wakes me up at precisely 5:31AM (I am one of those weird people that can't wake up on the five or zero, it started as a kid and old habits tend to die hard, plus I deserve the extra minute). I roll out of bed to turn on the coffee pot and get my outfit ready to be ironed. Midway through my morning routine I peer outside my window next door to the church parking lot neighboring my house and I see a pair of headlights facing towards my house. This isn't incredibly uncommon as they constantly have funerals and other services, but the headlights seem to be flickering. After starring for another minute or so I realize that there is a woman screaming something circling her vehicle. 

""I told you this was stupid! I fucking told you! Fuck this shit!"" I hear as she walks circles around what appears to be a grey/brown Ford Explorer (far too early to remember, really). I now pulled up the blinds and cracked the window a bit more in an attempt to hear her a little better, maybe make some sense of this. 

""It was a fucking stupid idea, this has already gone too- fuck he's up, let's go!"" she screamed, jumped in the driver's seat and sped through the parking lot like a bat out of hell. I peer at the clock, 5:51AM. Now I am not sure if I was able to get her conversation down verbatim, it was certainly weird but not strange enough to really make note of as an isolated incident.

Day continues as normal.

Monday June 9, 2014: Monday's are my easiest day, I don't have class or work and my internship gets out a bit early to give my time to run some errands. I go to the bank, get a haircut, and do some grocery shopping. When I begin placing my groceries in the fridge I notice another piece of paper in one of the bags, same paper same hand writing. This one says ""9:38PM"". Weird. I mean at this point its pretty strange, but the last one seemingly had no result (although I am sure you see what I do too, after all I am writing this long winded account of the story). So 9:30 rolls around I lock my doors, lock my windows, and turn off the lights. Playing it safe. Rounding the corner to my bedroom I peer out the window and see the headlights peering towards my house again from the same parking lot. Weird. Same flashing pattern with the headlights two, one after the other. The lady must be circling her vehicle again.

I do my best to crouch down below the window and open it up a crack to hear if she's screaming again. Mind you, I am 25 and I am feeling simultaneously spooked... and stupid. Sneaking around in my house? Hiding like a kid? Anyway, I crack the window enough to make out her screaming again as she circles the car. 

""Just drop it! Fucking drop it! Just put it down and let's get out of here! Something's not right!"" She jumps in the driver's seat and speeds away. It seems no one is around her, no one is getting in the car with her, it's weird. This is weird. Too weird. It's 9:40, (okay, super weird) I read a bit of my book and go to sleep. 

Friday, June 13 2014: Get out of work, class is canceled for the night so I head home early. As I am pulling up my street I can't help but notice a vehicle that seems to resemble the one I have seen in the parking lot speeding down my road. I pull in the driveway and enter my home. Go into my room to grab a change of clothes for a run when I notice the same sheet of paper (it's a pretty distinguishable blue index card) on my bed. 

""We know you know mother fucker. We know you know. We know more than you think. Where you work and when. Who you know and how. Where you'll be and why. We know."" And the back, ""10:15PM."" 

Now I haven't really spent any time looking around the house for any other notes or abnormalities. I am not sure what legal action would do, as these people haven't done anything. They know some things about me but they haven't made any threats. They set up post near my house but nothing seems to come of it. I simply don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated, if you aren't as lost as I am. 

At this point I realize they have entered my home, but I am usually pretty relaxed about leaving a window open when I leave the home. As I had said my town is pretty safe, and my house is no Fort Knox. I intend on changing that start 20 minutes ago. If there's anything you think I should do, let me know. Updates to follow if anything warrants such.

283eyt,1,2014-06-13,Absent Mom wants In,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/283eyt/absent_mom_wants_in/,"God this could be a long post so I'll try and make it short as I can. I've been reading posts here and people seem to actually have good insight into these kinds of problems. 


I want to cut my mother out of my life so that she does not have an influence on me and cannot have any sway over my choices. There are a lot of problems here with our relationship. 


F 22 and living at home. 

First this has all come about after culmination of factors and years, but started when I graduated undergrad and was persuring Gradschool. 

I've been making my way to break into my field, Graphic Design, after rejecting an offer to go an okay grad programme for a year in england due to money  in April and not wanting to take out loans with no experience. My mother told me I had to take out loans, until I stopped talking about it and she quickly lost interest. She had promised to foot the bill for a final year two years ago, which I felt somewhat betrayed about, since I was working to save up for living expenses if tuition was covered. 


I had quit a terrible job as admin asstitant for a really terrible boss after six months and in Jan took supplement classes for graphic design, that I paid for while I waited to hear back about Grad school.  Couldn't keep the job since boss wasn't flexiable, and had trouble finding work afterwards. I don't have a degree in Graphic Design, parents didn't find value in it, couldn't major in it due to Common Merchant program, and couldn't minor in it had to choose a buisness minor, which is handy. 


I have to work my way backwards to get experience. My goal is to get a basic posistion hopefully by this fall or sooner to make a real salary so I can move out of the house. It is working out, I've gotten a local internship and promise of freelance gigs on the horizon. I started applying for part time posistions again to have some kind of income and savings.

Now to sum everything up my mother finds no value in anything I do, or if she acknowledges it she always expects it to be better. I stopped telling her what I was up to two months ago as I went through lots of  interviews for flexiable part time posistions. She kept begging my dad that I was cutting her out of my life, so I was fooled and gave her a quick overview. 

More critiques of why i wasn't looking for a better position, why I wasn't looking in major cities, but refusing to understand everything I relayed above or take responsbility for the power she had over my choices in that time of my life. 

She always finding critiques about my weight (size 9-10), when we were younger she point out other skinner girls at the mall at say you could look like them or recently lost some weight, ""You could be a size six"",  house has to be clean, but she doesn't pick up any of her stuff, doesn't engage at night when she homes from work, and often is playing tennis during the week, evenings and weekends. 

It was worse when she would talk with her friends and their daughters and the wonderful careers they were able to start, either through their networks or the major they had chosen or lucky enough to get the right kind of experience before they graduated. 

I do not enjoy spending time with her, since she doesn't take an interest in my hobbies or my opinions so there is little to talk about.


Now she came from a highly dysfunction family, but always had money, good education and has a great job that is expanding, plus plenty of her own friends through rec sports. I'd rather her not take an interest in me, than have her feign interest for the sake of making critiques. 

I think I'm being pretty damn resilent without the option of moving out right now and making the career I want and life I want with stuff I have to work with, but it gets hard when she keeps pressuring me to persue her goals, not mine. I would like to have a relationship with her, but on my terms not hers. 

Any comments or feed back is welcome. Thanks.

283hfm,38,2014-06-13,My year with a Glock 19,Irlyh8usernames,guns,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/283hfm/my_year_with_a_glock_19/,"Around one year ago I purchased my first center fire handgun, a Glock 19 generation 3. I did so based on the recommendation on /r/guns. I thought I would give my accounts of how this gun has worked for me over the past year based on how well I have developed shooting it, how I carried it, how well it concealed, etc. Why should you care? Because reasons and other stuff too.

I will do this based off of seasons rather than exact months because it will be easier on my part. It should be noted that I live in Florida as well so *seasons* may be a little bit of an overstatement.

**About me**

I'm 6' tall and was 165 pounds when I purchased the gun. I currently weigh about 140 due to inactivity and lack of working out (I was trying to gain muscle and have finally said fuck it). I am 22 now, was 21 when I purchased the gun. I am also a Finance major at UCF and now work in self-directed IRAs, I used to work in plumbing.

**Summer 2013**

This was around the time I first purchased the gun. I paid $540.35 after tax and background check. I had my CCW license, so no wait period was required. The gun was on sale for $499.99 for the gen 3 and $549.99 for the gen 4. I went with the gen 3 because the grip fit my hand better. The mag release was a bit easier to operate on the gen 4, but I figured I would be doing more range shooting and less tactical reloading during firefights, so I went gen 3. I purchased a Foxx Hybrid holster and a Hanks Amish CCW belt. This carry setup was amazing, for a while - we will get to that. I was working for my fathers plumbing company, so jeans and a t-shirt were fine for my daily tasks. I would carry everyday that I had work. I began carrying it with just a loaded mag but not a round chambered. I was nervous about it. After about a month I finally bit the bullet and tried it; obviously everything was fine because here I am today.

Having only owned a .22LR handgun I was not used to the recoil of a polymer framed 9mm. My technique was lacking and I realized this immediately. I began researching tips online (gunnit) for dealing with this. I finally decided that dry-fire practice was what I needed most. Trigger control was the issue I seemed to be having. Would sit in my room at right and dry-fire at the TV. The Griffins have been shot thousands of times.

**Fall 2013**

Fall was a great time for carrying and shooting. Prices locally had finally started to return to normal, so I was able to buy and shoot more. This was probably the time I did the majority of my shooting with this firearm. I put probably around 1,000 rounds through my firearm during this season, not a single issue. My grouping became much more consistent. I typically shoot 15-30 feet and I was able to get my grouping close to the size of a silver dollar up to 20 feet. Anything past 20 feet and the grouping would get a little larger the further it went out, but still nothing drastically inaccurate. Carrying also became much easier due to the cooler weather starting to set in. Sweaters were my new best friends as they would sit well around my waist and not ride up if I needed to pick something up; you should always squat!

**Winter 2013** 

For the majority of winter carrying was not an issue what so ever. I did go to NYC for 2 weeks in December, so I was unable to bring my firearm with me. [My father held it for me and made me a unique holster while I was away.](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1v7j16/my_dad_makes_holsters_as_a_hobbyfor_fun_i_asked/) So that was nice to return to. I have since then used this holster for the range and camping at our hunting camp. I do not hunt, but will not enter the woods unarmed. The Glock makes a wonderful hiking gun, so I assume any caliber in this size will as well. For safeties sake I would always conceal a 33 round magazine when I would hike solely due to the caliber being smaller/under powered compared to something like a 10mm. I figured more rounds would give me a better chance right? I would carry the stick in my left pocket. It's illegal to hunt with that many rounds, but since I was just hiking at the campsite and the magazine was concealed I figured fuck it.

**Spring 2014**

This was when carrying would get a little tricky. I was so used to the ease of throwing on a jacket and the gun hiding I had forgotten how to carry in hotter weather. I began buying large sized shirts so that they would sit lower around my waist. This pretty much solved my issue. By this time I had pretty much mastered my firearm in and out. I learned how to detail strip it, and even though it had about 2,000 rounds through it the inside wasn't as dirty as I thought it would be — I cleaned it regularly but had never detailed it before. It took about 20 minutes to fully learn how to do it and I used nothing more than a multi-tool to take it apart; it had a small punch on it.

**Summer 2014**

Here is where the gun began to show its *true* size. I am in my senior year at UCF and began an internship (which is now just considered a part-time job) for a self-directed IRA firm. The dress is slacks and a tucked in button down shirt. The biggest issue here is that my hanks belt does not fit the dress of everyone else in the office, and dress belts just suck for carrying. I have considered looking into belts like Orion Leather, but that still doesn't solve the problem of tucking in my shirt and wearing slacks. I am afraid the gun/holster will ruin my slacks as they did a pair of jeans; but slacks cost a hell of a lot more than a pair of jeans. But being the resourceful person that I am, I came up with a great idea. My range bag was working as my work bag and it has a pocket that my gun fits in. I just slip the gun in my bag and no one knows. I honestly do not feel that it is necessary to carry at work since it is on a higher level in the building and also in a safer area of town, but I like having it available *after* work in my car, but I do not want to leave it in my car all day — I do not feel like this needs explanation. I have considered getting an LCP and will probably do that once I get caught up on some previous expenses (I was jobless for 2 months after my father laid me off due to budget cuts, thanks dad!). I have not been shooting since Spring of 2014, but I look forward to getting back to the range.

**Summary**

I bought my Glock 19 about a year ago. It has worked wonderful for me as a range gun and a self defense gun - not that I have used it in self defense, but you get the picture. It conceals well on my smaller sized frame, but it difficult to carry in dress clothes. I highly recommend this firearm and it has brought me great joy to own. I have no plans to sell it and plan to continue shooting many more rounds through it. Overall I give the Glock a 9.5/10 — 9.5 strictly due to having to alter my grip to release the magazine, even if it is just slightly.

What can I do to prepare in my last two years to help my chances at grad school?",[deleted],AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/283lo5/low_gpa_lots_of_research_experience_and_23/,"Hi all.

I know there's quite a few posts with people asking what they can do in order to help their graduate school chances when they only have 1-2 semesters left, and I was wondering if you had tips for those of us with a bit more time.

For background -- I'm double majoring in English and Psychology, and minoring in History. I have two years left to go. Although I'm not minoring or majoring in stats, I am getting a lot of stats experience with a stats/research methods internship and I currently work as a data analyst for a group through my college that works with education data. I am also a mental health worker, not sure if that helps any. 

 I am on one publication (7th author) in experimental psychology and am first author on another publication in education policy. I plan to have at least 2-3 more by the time I apply to graduate school in the fall of 2015. I'd like to be a college professor and work somewhere in the legal psychology field, specifically juror psychology, but too many interests here to have it narrowed down yet. 

HOWEVER -- I bombed a year of college (yes, straight F's) and dropped out for a year. Although that was about 5 years ago, it is still on my transcript and my university does not have a policy to remove it. My overall GPA right now is a 2.7 (all A's and B's for the last year) but I probably won't be able to dig myself out of the hole I got myself into all those years ago. 

So my question is what can I do to help my chances at graduate school besides what I'm doing already? I figure if I nail the GRE and have plenty of research experience, I'm as good as I can be, but is there something I'm missing? "

283mae,14,2014-06-13,One professor is at my university is single-handily ruining my summer and future,irate_student,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/283mae/one_professor_is_at_my_university_is/,"I an Informatics student - think business, IT and social affects. My university requires me to have a capstone project to graduate and I have three options to fulfill that requirement - an approved internship, a thesis, or a year long IT project. I am going to be a senior this semester and plan to graduate in May. Like many, I chose to take a summer internship that I found through my University's career fair.  

I snagged an internship as a Systems Admin/Analyst with a Fortune 500 company. Upon arriving I was told by my university that I had to submit a application stating basic contact information, roles, hourly pay, etc. by a certain date. In addition I had to submit a document detailing what my project would be. (On the website for this my university said projects are often not necessary and not included). So I detailed my project (which in non-technical) and gave a brief overview of what I do as a SysAdmin ending with"" If need more information from me or my managers on my job duties please let me know. You may also contact them here:""  

I submitted everything and heard back from a Career Services Director at my school saying ""Professor John Doe denied your application stating the technical component was not strong enough"". At this point I was fuming because I take regular workflow like a sys admin, in addition to hardware support like running cables, retiring servers, and remediate hardware failures.  

I sent three emails back to him and have heard nothing back after 2 weeks. I detailed EXACTLY what I do in those emails and remained as polite as possible. I believe he thought I ONLY do project work that isnt technical - though I said otherwise - and that this would handled accordingly but not. I can't even get an email back from him. I escalated to the Director of Undergrad Ed. and he said he ""trusts Doe's decision"" and I decided to move on to Student Advocacy Office. The problem is that the guy who is making the judgement call on ""technical-ness"" has ever worked in industry but accepts much less technical jobs than mine.  

This is a huge concern to me because without this acceptance I cannot graduate on time because I would have to take a capstone course for the whole year that I can't begin taking till spring, I cannot accept a full-time offer from my company, and It will cost me an additional 20k to finish. 


I feel hopeless and hate that ONE GUY can change my entire life. I love the company I work for and have a great chance of getting an offer but that wont happen if I can't graduate. 

HE WONT EVEN REPLY... jesus.

So I move !Intern.B to new location, and we're all set. Two monitors, docking station, and all of that jazz. (Crappy monitors btw.)

Next day, do a silent follow up to see how the move went, and it was good. !Intern.B's ""friend"" - !Intern.D said that they had also wanted a second monitor, upon seeing that !Intern.B had two of them. My department does NOT cover the cost for the interns, they must go through their own department, and we would set it up.

Next thing you know, !Intern.B finds my dungeon of doom, and sneakily tries to have me set up a second monitor. I explain to (l)user the proper due diligence, and the proper protocols. Hence the following:

!Intern.B: But dude! She's a friend of mine, and she's really cool.

Me: Doesn't matter. Due diligence is our priority, and all protocols must be followed. I'm not getting fired for it.

Every CVP and their Mother:

Due to unintelligible unforeseen circumstances - all interns will be getting a second monitor.

My dad was very emotionally manipulative and sometimes cruel when I was growing up, and because of that I am kind of a mess and hard to deal with (I get angry very easily and I used to be very manipulative as a defense mechanism before I started dating the BF), but I am working on it and he makes me want to be a better person. The BF is like everything good in this world wrapped up into a person who makes me happy, and that is insanely hard to do. 


He is interning out of state right now and loves his position, which I am very happy for him. We were talking the other day and he stated that he was worried about me just spending the summer doing my internship (local) and watching netflix in my room instead of getting out and hanging out with people. He then said that he was concerned about meeting people and establishing roots in a new place if he moved for a full time gig. He said that one of the biggest things that made life better was, at the end of the day, having something to come home to or make plans with. We both have talked in the past and agreed on how it would be nice if things worked out (and he said earlier that he wants to try to stay local when he starts his career), but that it was dumb to make plans before we knew where we would end up job wise. I am his 2nd or 3rd girlfriend ever and he is my 9th boyfriend and the only one I have actually cared about more than myself. I am worried that he has decided to take a full time job there if offered and is trying to get me to a place where I won't freak out and take breaking up super hard. I start my senior capstone the semester after he graduates, which is one of the most intense classes/project in my major. I don't want to fall apart and not be able to recover over Christmas break. It's completely illogical, but after 5 years I've grown quite attached to him. I also don't want to cause a scene or be any less than supportive of him, because this job would be amazing for him and something he could do as a career that he has worked very hard to earn. Do we have an expiration date, and if so how do I make the most of what time we have left, exit this relationship gracefully, and not fall to pieces in the months following so I can graduate in process? 



---   
**tl;dr**: I might lose the love of my life because life/jobs get in the way of us being together. How do I handle this properly without falling apart? He has given me his best thus far and I want to act in kind."
284394,2,2014-06-14,How do I meet people in a new city far from home?,thr0waway2048,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/284394/how_do_i_meet_people_in_a_new_city_far_from_home/,"Backstory for my situation:

For my internship this summer, I moved to a new city 1000 miles from the area that I've lived my whole life in. A big part of the reason I took this internship was to get a change of scenery and do a ""dry run"" so to speak of living far from home before I graduate next spring. Another big reason for me choosing this particular internship was that I was told firsthand by a friend who did a similar one with the same company last year that it was a blast and the company does a great job of giving their interns a full experience - professional and social. The problem is, the plant I was assigned to is located in the middle of nowhere (this is coming from a small town kid) in a remote town of less than 5000 people.

So another intern (who I had never met other than through email) and I decided to live together in the closest city, which is a little over an hour away. From talking to different people, pretty much everyone who works at the plant lives in the little town, including all of the other interns and people my age. None of them really do anything on the weekends; they all seem to visit their families back home or just go fishing and hang out in the little town. My roommate and I would just hang out together, but we're pretty different. I'm a single guy, she's a girl in a long distance relationship with her long term boyfriend. The plant that we work at is 90% male so she's pretty popular and I'm just another dude.

Tonight, a guy from her department said he would be visiting our city and invited her to go out with him and his friends. I don't know any of them, they don't know me. My roommate invited me to come earlier in the week. I agreed to go, wanting to meet new people. Long story short, she ended up ditching me and my night was over before it began. I'm not really upset about that, we barely know each other and she doesn't have an obligation to introduce me to new people. I just feel weird knowing that she's doing so well socially without trying (she complains about the people she works with, including those who invited her out, and said she invited me to go with her to keep her sane around them) and I'm struggling so badly. The people in my department are nice but they all live in the small town and like to just hang out there.

The city I live in is a college town, but unfortunately it's summer time so not many young people are around. Also, I live on the opposite side of town from all of the bars, so going out requires a bit of planning and is very difficult to do alone (the city is infamous for its lack of taxis and public transit so I really can't drink without someone to DD). I've been here two weeks and I haven't been able to meet anyone outside of work. I know that this is a short term move and I'll be headed back home in 2 months, but it got me thinking: if I get into a similar situation after I graduate, how am I going to start a new social circle?

TL;DR: Got a job far from home, don't really know anyone. I live far away from everyone I work with. It's logistically almost impossible to go out to bars alone where I live. How can I meet new people my age?"
2848hl,1,2014-06-14,Brainstorming: Methods for Enforcing the EULA for Servers,WayGroovy,admincraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/2848hl/brainstorming_methods_for_enforcing_the_eula_for/,"I feel that servers adhering to the rules would be at a disadvantage to servers not willing to comply unless there is some consequence for servers that infringe.

Instead of looking for *loopholes* in the offered system, I intend on complying with both the letter of the law as well as the publicly discussed intent behind it. I get frustrated, though, with community members looking for loopholes, exploits, and other ways around the offered EULA. 

I imagine that there are already plenty of internal discussions within mojang regarding EULA enforcement, but I've always been a fan of community self-regulation. 

So, as a thought experiment, I've been brainstorming methods that Mojang could enforce the EULA. 

* **Tie servers to Minecraft/Mojang accounts** - Implement a method of tying a server to an individual minecraft account. 
 - Adds a layer of cost both in processing and network resources for the authentication servers
 - Defeats the argument that servers can be run without agreeing to the up-to-date EULA
 - Could be implemented with either public/private keys during setup, or https://minecraft.net/profile generated key file

* **Community Moderation** - Start a community driven group to police server posts. 
 - Could be a full or part-time position at mojang, or even internship. 
 - Possible to game system :(
 - Could be managed if server-list moderators (like /r/mcservers, etc) agreed
 - May be too manually invasive
 - Establish working relationships with buycraft and similar services. Engage in a licensing policy, similar to jinx. 

* **Deny infringing servers from player authentication services** - Either by IP range or by the above suggested tied account. 
 - Would not affect servers willing to bypass player authentication, but would be similar to the blind eye that mojang has traditionally treated piracy
 - Users would be at risk of losing their paid benefits to unscrupulous users that try to play as them

* **Add a layer of risk to Users** - Put something in the EULA/ToS to punish users for joining infringing servers
 - not really cool, not good style, but possible

* **Lawyer Up** - Actually send C&amp;D letters
 - Server owners legal information not typically easily available publicly
 - Process could take months
 - International laws may apply
 - Costly if goes to court for all parties involved

Anyways, these are just late night thoughts from myself. Wondering what other thoughts you may have towards this. "

285j45,1,2014-06-14,Buying a Nexus 5 off-contract (long)?,AndroidAdvice23,PickAnAndroidForMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/PickAnAndroidForMe/comments/285j45/buying_a_nexus_5_offcontract_long/,"A few months ago, I bought a Nexus 7 (2013) tablet, mostly to develop on since I didn't haven't an Android device before and smartphones are pretty pricey (compared with Tablets, usually)).

After developing on my Nexus 7, which I love, I noticed it's how much more annoying it is to use the emulator for testing (e.g. testing smaller devices, like phones), so I am considering getting an android phone to test on. I would also use it probably to replace my almost non-functional iPod Touch (my only smart device before my Nexus 7).

I am thinking about the Nexus 5 since it's new (so it's like an ""investment""), but I need to mention a few things.

I currently don't own a smart phone, just a really simple prepaid $10 phone, and I don't really have an interest in purchasing a contract, so I would likely buy the Nexus 5 off contract, which is pretty pricey.

I was also considering getting a Moto G instead, but I feel like I have would rather test everything on a Nexus (google) device, but that might just be irrational since I can't justify it. 

As I said, I am not currently considering getting a smartphone with a contract, if I do buy a Nexus 5 (off-contract), I should be able to, in principle, in the future get a contract for it?

I should also add that I just got an internship over this summer and it pays pretty well, so I have some more disposable income.

One downside to getting a Nexus 5, is that it would probably depreciate my Nexus 7, in that I would use it a lot less since it's much more convenient to carry around a phone vs. a tablet.

So I know that was sort of long and ramblely (probably not a word), but here are my questions:

Based on what I said, should a get a Nexus 5 (off-contract), to use mainly for developing, and to replace my iPod Touch? (In the future, I could always add a contract and since it's new, it probably wouldn't be obsolete when I do)

Also, would any instead suggest that I get an Nexus 5 (on-contract) instead? My only qualm is that it is like $80 a month (at least, with my little research), which seems really expensive, especially considering that I hardly call other people, and I am mostly in wifi.

I came out of it with something like a 2.5 GPA.  Took a few years off before finally getting my mind and priorities in order, and went into university.  Came out with a B.S. in Biomedical Science and a 3.62 GPA, scholarship, some club experience, and a professor who took me under his wing.

He helped me get into a highly-regarded internship program which I came out of with a Best Poster award.  Also been involved in research with him and am submitting my first publication in the next few weeks.

At first I was interested mainly in a Bio PhD but after taking a look at the career prospects I've decided that a MD-PhD would give me many more options.  And it would be great because I've always been a bit torn between the PhD and MD.

As for whether or not I would succeed in such a program -- I have zero doubts.  My mind is set on this more than anything and I know I could excel.

Problem is (aside from the low CC GPA), I never did any med school prep.  No community service, not much club experience, no shadowing.  And I'm really worried that I'm just not of the..""caliber"" that an MD-PhD program would be looking for.

I was hoping to apply for schools this fall.  But I'm realizing now that I may need to take an extra year off.  Even then, I feel like it's not enough time.

So I guess my question is this: what are the best things I can do to raise my chances of being accepted?  Also, would it even be worth it to apply this fall, or should I probably plan on taking an extra year off and applying in fall of '15?

While at school, my depression got much much better through the help of a therapist, and a new relationship (I now have a very supportive SO).  Since being home with my parents, I am slipping back into how I used to be - depressed and only having the desire to go to bed after work, and not wanting to leave my room on weekends.  While at school, I decided I was going to train for my first half and run it with my boyfriend, who is already a pretty seasoned distance runner.  My only goal was to be capable of running the whole time - no particular time or speed goal.  Since coming home, I have to yell at myself just to get out there and run 2 miles, sometimes as little as twice a week, then I feel angry with myself for being so behind on my training (the half is in October, but once the semester starts back up, I won't have much time to train, so I was hoping I would be able to run the full distance before going back, and just maintain the distance while I was there).  My dad is always making comments like, ""Are you actually going to run tonight?"" and that just makes me even more mad at myself.  Does anyone have any advice on how I could motivate myself to get out there and run, and make it a positive experience, even when I have no positive energy left?  (I do enjoy running, but I get very angry with myself for not being better at it - I only got really frustrated once while at school but now that I'm home, it is an every night thing.)

28618r,11,2014-06-14,Why was I fired?,[deleted],KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/28618r/why_was_i_fired/,"Okay, let me preface this by stating that I'm not pleading for sympathy or vindication. I'm just genuinely puzzled over the circumstances, and I would be appreciative of anyone seasoned in the kitchen environment who could either clarify what I had been told, or convince me that I've simply been rationalizing consistent practice of poor habits. I'm not out for blood, and I understand the relative insignificance of the situation, but I still am not quite satisfied with the explanations others have provided, nor with what I have mulled over.

So, two weeks ago I began my first job, at age 17, as restaurant dishwasher, working from ~5 - ~10:30, monday-thursday. The entire staff, from management down, was as welcoming and supportive as I could've wished. The boss understood perfectly well that I was only available for 3-4 months before I was to leave for college, and so he formulated a schedule that he referred to as something of an internship (because I had expressed interest in the possibility of pursuing culinary arts somewhere down the road), wherein he would assign me to various posts around the restaurant, inside the kitchen and out after the school year would be finished. If I wanted to focus on the dishwashing business, so be it, but I had these options.

The kitchen staff consisted of, naturally, three latinos who spoke about as much English as I do spanish...close to zilch (with the exception, of course, of menu items and kitchen jargon). This barrier, compounded with my natural timidity, and the fact that there was really no professional need to interact initially made communicating somewhat difficult. But within four or so days, I had begun to figure out how to convey messages visually, or in pidgin spanglish, such that we could share basic jokes and questions, and so forth. Of course, I also picked up on some helpful spanish vocabulary in the process.
**tl:dr** I got on friendly terms with the staff.

As for the dishwashing itself, I prioritized efficiency. This meant that I typically spent more time scrubbing down the dishes before placing them in the quick-washer, then I did waiting for the washing cycle to complete. I wanted to avoid double washing above all else, because one obnoxiously large dish could disrupt the washing of a new batch of dirty dishes that could occupy the space of that one dish, and at the busier hours, I could easily get overloaded this way.

So Wednesday, after less than two weeks of working there, I get pulled aside by the owner, who tells me that he has to let me go. He handed me my check. I ask him if he could explain what led him to this decision. Apparently, there are two reasons. Firstly, the kitchen staff feels like I'm acting coldly towards them, that I'm too aloof or something...Secondly, the pots and pans weren't being cleaned adequately, according to the staff. This second reason, while I won't call categorical bullshit on, seems to me a little suspicious. Knowing that this is my first time on the job, wouldn't it be a bit more reasonable to simply let me know that I need to handle these dishes better in the future? Maybe not. Maybe that's the cold way of the kitchen business. Anyway.
Of these two supposed factors, the first sounds more plausible to me. Perhaps my presence is a social and, I don't know, physical liability for the kitchen staff? For the most part, when there's a lull in business, they're either on their phones, chatting about their girlfriends or the world cup, from what I gather. Maybe I just don't fit in, and they're growing uncomfortable around me? If that's the case, then the owner realizes that the dissatisfaction of three chefs trumps the contentedness of a dishwasher, and who ought to go.
Is it possible that he just could no longer afford to keep me on the staff?
These are the bemusing questions that I'd like something approaching a definitive answer to. Hopefully you guys can help.

Thanks!

28685z,0,2014-06-14,Allocation of savings into taxable vs tax advantaged account,Retirementallocation,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/28685z/allocation_of_savings_into_taxable_vs_tax/,"I am a single 23 yo that has just gotten his first salaried position, start date this Monday. I am working as a financial analyst at a credit union, making $35,000 a year. I was doing a very low paid internship at the credit union for the last 6 months and was able to average $750 (mint.com) of monthly spending (rent, utilities, groceries, gas.. etc etc). I plan to continue with this frugal lifestyle, perhaps spending ~$900 a month.

I have no debt besides monthly credit card bills, paid off in full each month, and intend to save virtually all discretionary income for the future. I plan to retire fully in &lt;20 years (I hope to increase my income dramatically over the next ~5 years, which could reduce this 20 year figure considerably) and am wondering how I should allocate my savings across taxable and tax advantaged accounts.


As far as 401k goes... I have a 50% match on up to 6% on top of a base 3% match (basically a 6% match). 

So here are some calculations based on 35k income..

With 6% match:

Gross income: $32,900

Federal Income Tax: ~$2,959

VA State Income Tax: ~$1,410

Social Security Tax: $2,170

Medicare Tax: $507.5

Take Home: $25,835.5

401k contribution + match: $4,200

Spending: $10,800

Total Savings: 25,835.5 + 4,200 - 10,800 = $19,235.5

Of this, $4,200 or 21.8% is in traditional 401k

I will presumably put $5,500 or 28.6% into Roth IRA leaving $9,535.5 or 49.6% in my taxable accounts.

I currently have ~20k in my brokerage account (Dollar cost averaging into index funds with future income, perhaps having a small trading fund on the side) and ~5k cash in my checking/savings account. I do not have any funds in any retirement accounts at the moment.

Given my low marginal tax rate of 15% and expectations of higher future tax rates, should I only contribute 6% to my 401k? Also... I am not positive all my calculations are correct. Any additional advice is welcome!

2869nb,7,2014-06-14,"Summer is your time to shine, and lemme show you why! (M/21/230 -&gt; 180 in 3 years, with more to lose!)",DiverGuy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2869nb/summer_is_your_time_to_shine_and_lemme_show_you/,"Hey everyone! Summer has begun once again and, if you are anything like me, you're ready to take over the world in the heat of the Sun (or stay indoors because I'll be fried like an onion ring if I spend more than 30 seconds outdoors).

Let me tell you my story real quick. I was a really energetic and active...like....4 month old? I suppose? I mean, I was probably the fastest crawler this side of the Mississippi, but things suddenly took a turn for the worst when I learned how to walk.

Kidding! Or am I? Here's the deal: I can't remember a time in my relevant lifespan where I wasn't overweight. From the age of ""who knows"", to even today, I still label myself as overweight. Shit happens right? And food tastes awesome. I've been blessed with a mother who knows her way around a kitchen and I wouldn't trade away any of my juvenile extra pounds for her.

I'm a very interesting case in the fact that I was actually a pretty successful athlete during my time imitating a prepubescent Snorlax. Lets see...lets pick a sport where I can show off as much of my hideous body as possible doing intricate movements that require precision, flexibility, and strength, none of which I possess.

Yes, springboard diving it is! Indeed, I fell into springboard diving after my (much more athletic) older sister picked it up in high school and I was forced to attend all of her practices after school. At my heaviest (230), I became the 5th best diver in the state of North Carolina. Wait, what? That's cool! 

But there is something tiring about going up to the stands after the meet, wearing my hard-earned new medal, and having to hear ""wow, you're good.....for somebody your size!"". Boom, right in the heart. I'm sorry sir, did you not see me outscore your son by 100 points? Was it my giant stomach or gyrating man boobs that contributed to my minuscule splash? I scant have noticed. 


So naturally, I was always a fat kid...""fat"" as in untagging myself from grotesque Facebook pictures, sneaking food in the night, learning to channel my obesity into hilarious, yet self-deprecating comedy...THAT kind of fat. And I was never okay with that. Who is? If you say ""me"", then let me stop you right there.

I never intended to become someone that has lost 50 pounds. In many ways, I still don't see myself that way. I see myself in the exact same way that I did 50 pounds ago, and that is a burden that is so separate from the scale. You'll always look in the mirror and see your faults regardless of how big or small you become. You'll always grab your arm fat, stretch it to its maximum possible point, and say to yourself ""ugh, look at all of this"". 

My advice? Stop stretching it! 

This is the part where most people want to know what I did, and I have to say...I'm not sure I can claim that I did anything special other than the obvious ""balance calories in, calories out"". I cut my calories to around 1,200 a day and went to the gym every single day that I could. 30 minutes on the elliptical every day, then a hodge-podge of other strength/cardio exercises until I deluded myself into thinking I had accomplished enough.

But was I the most strict person about all of this? Hell no! Did I cut out soda? Well, I only drink diet sodas now, but I have a diet energy drink EVERY morning instead of coffee. Do I starve myself? Nope, if I want a cookie, goddammit I'm getting that cookie! Am I, at all, strong or muscular? Psh. I am the weakest person walking this Earth. I swear I will die in a zombie apocalpyse if it involves lifting more than 20 person. 

I'm a college student, for christ's sake! I can get a cup at a bar with the equivalent of 2 and a half beers cheaper than I can get a loaf of bread! If I don't eat a buffalo chicken wrap from my favorite local Chapel Hill wrap place at 3 AM shit-faced drunk then it was NOT a good night! This is the life I live.

My solutions? The summer. I'm a Business major, I travel across the country to internships and literally go 9 to 5. This lifestyle is GREAT for me. I just make the gym a routine stop and plan out my meals before hand. Boom, its not hard to think about calorie goals when you don't even have the food to cheat on anywhere in your house. The gym is just another stop on the ""to-do"" list, not something I have to convince myself to do. Sure, I've had some great milestones. I completed the C25K program (HIGHLY recommend, message me to learn more) and I'm running my first 5K in 2 weeks. (holy shit, I didn't realize how close it was. EEP)

What I'm trying to say is....the hardest thing about losing weight and getting to your goals is that it doesn't affect anybody else. Nobody is going to yell at you because you decided to sleep an extra hour instead of going for a run. Nobody cares that you ate an extra helping of mashed potatoes at dinner. Most importantly, nobody cares that you lost 10 pounds. Or 20. Or 30. They'll comment, pass their niceties to you, but they don't care. You do this for YOU. You're the only one who has total control over your situation, and you need to keep yourself between the lines. Any time you mess up, don't let it spiral down. Because thats the kind of behavior that got you to where you are today. If you're a white girl, you should just say that you ""literally cannot"" with that kind of behavior.

My journey started, honestly, at the age of 18 at 230 pounds. I just passed my 21st birthday and I hover around 180 for now. My summer goal is 10 more pounds lost to get to 170.  I'm in Austin, Texas which is so fitness-oriented, I think I'll get there! Here is my imgur album:

I've only been booked once. And it was cool and I killed it and the event producer said I was on fire. 

...then he moved to LA. 

So my one reputable contact in the area's market fell out of the market. 

I've been emailing production companies asking to come on as an intern and do shit work for them just so I can get to know the players in my town's industry. The problem is: none of them fucking reply (for internship opp or regular booking).. and I don't know why!! 

I have compared my Facebook page to other DJ's these companies frequently book as openers for big events or guest DJ's at clubs and I literally have twice as many fans as some of them... and I don't even have that many fans!! 

So we've established that my emailing to production companies just isn't working. So what's next? I can't go and network at the events for two months when I'll be 18, and even when I do go... how the hell do I even network there without coming on too strong?

Initially, I thought it was my age. However, there's a FIFTEEN year old in my town who gets booked regularly here and in Miami (MIAMI!) and he's an okay producer but a fucking awful DJ... somehow, he still gets booked. My theory? It's because he has a booking agent. 


Should I have a booking agent?

TL;DR: People in this industry never reply to anything, I can't seem to get booked even though people with less of a following are getting booked and I don't think it's my age that's the problem. What are some techniques I should be trying besides networking in the clubs?

Sorry for the bitchy post, I'm just really annoyed. "

I have the pleasure of being a student intern at a psychiatric ward. 

One day, I was sent in (under video supervision) to field a patient-to-doctor conversation. The woman I met was Ms. Judy Garner. Unbeknownst to me, our conversation would be more than I would ever bargain for.

And because of it, I may never find peaceful sleep again.

Me: Hello, Ms. Garner! What would you like to talk about today?

Garner: Doctor Pence?

Me: No, ma'am! I am a student intern. My name's Karim, and I am very glad to meet you! 

Garner: Karim... You remind me so much of my son.... 

Me: Oh, that's very nice! What was his name?

Garner: Parker... My sweet boy.

Me: That's a nice name! What is your son like?

Garner: I will tell you...

This was her story....
___________________________________________________________

My son is a smart, smart boy. Even as a child he mastered the art of walking and speaking in no-time at all. All the academies for gifted children I sent him to remarked at me that he was far beyond a skill level they had ever seen before.

My son was so smart. And I so proud.

As a single mother, I couldn't imagine how lucky I was that Parker was alright in the head. I kept hearing the horror stories about kids being involved in trouble as they grow older due to the lack of having both parents.

But not my Parker. 

He was inquisitive. Calculating. When he was surrounded by an assortment of Legos, he turned them into magnificent pieces of architecture. While other kids drew rainbows in school, my Parker had sketched diagrams of the light spectrum. He was only eight years old when he was able to solve the Rubik's cube within a minute. Parker frequently wrote blueprints of odd-ball inventions that would likely revolutionize the world if he could somehow figure out the logistics to bring them to reality. 

I tried giving him every outlet to express his creativity. I took him to art classes, early-learning algebra courses, and even a children's ""Future Doctors/Surgeons"" club. He was quite fond of the latter one. 

When he turned ten-years old, he came up to me with a very serious look on his face.

""Mother, I have something to speak with you about.""

""Yes Parker dear, what is it?""

""As you understand, I am a growing young boy, and as a result, I am going through internal changes. I expect you realize what I am referring to.""

I nodded. It had to be regarding sex.

""Anyway mother, the only thing I wish to bring up in this conversation is that you knock on my room's door from now on before entering.""

""Yes, Parker, you've got it..."" I knew something like this would eventually be brought to my attention one day, I just didn't expect it to happen so... bluntly. But Parker was quite a special child, so I decided he knew what was best for him.

For the first time in a long time, though, I longed for his father to be here.

Parker then went to his room to read his books. Or do other things. 

I respected his wishes, but decided that whenever his door was closed it was best not to disturb him at all.

All was well for a long time, until one day, an electrical outlet of ours caught fire and I found it impossible to put it out due to its swift spreading. 

Terrified, I quickly called the fire department and, coughing from the smoke, ran to retrieve Parker. 

His door was closed. I knocked vehemently, with every voice in my mind shouting at me to just burst in there, but another side of me wanting to respect his wishes.

*Knock, knock.* No sound. Only smoke in the air. 

""Parker, honey! We need to get out of the house now!"" No answer.

Parker could hate me if he wanted, I decided. At least he would be alive.

I swung open the door. Parker was sitting on his bed, hands riddled with blood and intestines, with the remains of animals scattered in front of him. And in the middle, something which unquestionably looked like a human skull.

____________________________________________________________________________

Ms. Garner concluded her story with that, smiling at me.

Garner: My Parker is so smart. He was finding a way to combine humans and animals in order to make us all smarter! My sweet, intelligent boy!

She started humming to herself and tracing invisible shapes on her palms.

Later that day I looked in Ms. Garner's files. She had been admitted following the death of her son, Parker Garner, who was killed in a house fire.

286xcu,70,2014-06-15,CMV: Unchecked capitalism in a democracy is worse overall than just having a monarchy,incruente,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/286xcu/cmv_unchecked_capitalism_in_a_democracy_is_worse/,"DISCLAIMER; This is not saying that democracy or capitalism or inheritance are fundamentally bad; just that, in certain configurations, monarchy would be better.


Think about the average person. What is their relation to royalty, if they live in a monarchy? They probably won't meet them, and if they do it will be a passing thing. The monarch makes all the rules and takes some of the peasants stuff so they can maintain their lavish lifestyle and military and so forth. The monarch protects the people so they can keep making more stuff to take. One day, the monarch will die, and their kid takes over the family business of being monarch.

Now consider capitalism, unchecked. It's all fine and well to say ""Well, this is America. Anyone can make it!"" And, without a doubt, there have been a lot of success stories. But they are the (extremely rare) exception, not the rule. Anyone that says persistence and hard work are all it takes to succeed is kidding themselves. Rich parents pass their wealth and advantage on to their children. Better schools, a better quality of life than other people, the ability to survive longer on the parents dime so they can take unpaid internships to get better training to get better jobs, everything a rich parent does can set their child up to become richer and more powerful still. As their wealth, and thus power, grows, they influence policy. Soon, they're lobbying to elect politicians and influence public opinion, altering foreign policy. See where this is headed? 

Effectively, monarchy. Capitalism teaches us that accumulation of wealth is the ultimate goal. Wealth, being variable but finite, must therefore be transferred or kept from someone else in order to get it; therefore, it tends to concentrate. And ""the rich get richer"", as they say; wealth accumulates and concentrates more and more, until you have fewer and fewer people making policy and controlling land, money, etc. The logical terminus is a single family controlling everything; effectively, monarchy. 

So how is this worse? Because they got there (albeit slowly) on the idea that profit is of paramount importance. At the very least, some historical monarchs believed that their job was to care for and protect the people. They felt an obligation to them. But a family, or even a dozen families, that effectively control a country because they care only about profit would have no such sense of loyalty.

You might easily say ""Well, capitalism allows for competition. We can get rid of bad companies, or families, by competition, or just not buy their stuff"". Well, not really. First, how many people actually know which companies own what, which families control what? Not many. For another, competition becomes impractical after a point; try starting an ISP, or a car company, or a petrochemical company. Not buying stuff? That's more valid. The people can collectively rise up and overthrow those with unjust power. Of course, we can do the same in a monarchy; it's called revolution.

286ysr,13,2014-06-15,Beggars can't be choosers? Entry Level salary,Impulse2Soar,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/286ysr/beggars_cant_be_choosers_entry_level_salary/,"I'm a recent marketing grad with two years worth of pretty intensive internships (including Microsoft and Amazon). My last internship turned into a part-time Social Media Coordinator role and I recently applied for several Marketing Coordinator positions. 

After four interviews for a B2B company, they extended me an offer for a Marketing Coordinator position (2-4 years experience required.) I feel pretty fortunate to have landed a job opportunity in my desired field but the salary was a slightly disappointing. 

$35k with full healthcare benefits but only 7 days of paid vacation. I researched the usual salaries for a Marketing Coordinator and the very lowest tier seems to be at the $38k-40k range. 

I'm located in Seattle suburbs where cost of living is pretty expensive. I'm currently living at home with my parents and have no student loans, so I can afford to hold out for the ""right opportunity."" Ideally, I want to move into the city from the suburbs for a shorter commute. $3k-5k salary loss would really hinder that plan as I won't be able to comfortably afford Seattle rent. But if I don't move into the city, I'm looking at a 20 mile one way commute to my potential place of work. At least a couple of thousand dollars in annual gas money. 

It's not exactly a company or industry I'm passionate about BUT the title and experience would provide a great step forward for my career. 

So my questions to fellow marketers:

Am I being too picky? Particularly for a person with a tiny bit of entry level experience...? 

I'd like to negotiate a slight salary increase, perhaps after a trial period of three months/employee evaluation, but I'm unsure of how to go about it and I'm afraid of losing this job opportunity!

At this point in my life, I can see what great things I have between a medium-high wealth living and amazing friends, but nothing makes me feel better in the end. I just need to put myself out.

**Over-detailed Context**

I'm 17 y/o, just finished my junior year of high school, and I feel like shit. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and whatever kind of PTSD I have due to trauma from sexual abuse as a kid (5 to 10 y/o). But there are two parts to my problems. The sexual abuse is actually the lesser issue for me, with the killer being the neglect, emotional abuse, and all-around shit raising I got from my mom.

While I was in elementary school, my mother often left me with her aunt to be taken care of. My grand aunt is a woman who I loved more than my mother or grandmother put together because she was old and kind and, as far as I could see at the time, she actually cared for and loved me. Her husband molested me whenever I was alone with him, even if my grand aunt or anyone else was just in the next room over. But I didn't know what it was, I didn't know what was going on or that it was wrong. As far as my child self was concerned, this was just a thing that Grand Uncle did. I must have been about 10 years old, in 5th grade or so, when I saw something on the news about molestation and I pointed out to my grand aunt that her husband had been doing that to me. By all appearances, she was distraught. She said if he ever came near me again, she'd kill him.
But nothing came of it. No one else in my family was notified (I didn't think I had to tell anyone else, especially not my mother who terrified me), and there was no police involvement. Though I don't remember seeing him much afterwards. I understand that sexual abuse of all kinds happens all the time without any justice, but the lack of action in my case came to disturb me because I would eventually find out *why* nothing happened.
What I didn't know as a kid was that my grand aunt was unemployed, and all of her income came from her husband's work. She never told anyone, or divorced him, because she was living off of his money. My grand aunt who I loved more than my mother sacrificed my body, the body of a child and moreover her sister's grandson, for her wealth.

But I got over the betrayal. My grand aunt was greedy and fucked up, and her husband was a sick piece of shit. They can burn in literal hell for all I care, but I don't go out of my way to imagine it anymore.

The issue that has always been apart of my life, the issue that I have lived with my entire life, that I *still* live with now, is my mother. She neglected me when I was a kid. She'd leave for days at a time without a word, and when she came home, I'd get yelled at because, in her words, I'm evil and there are starving kids in Africa who deserve more love and care than me.
When I was very young, I'd always thought she was just out working. As I got a little older, though, and family members were less able to babysit, she'd bring me along. Rarely did we go to office or some kind of work space. Where we would go was some house that belonged to what ever guy my mom was seeing at a time. I can still remember their faces, especially when they'd see me with my mom and wonder where in the hell I came. The long story aside, the worst of the many, many relationships my mom engaged in was with her drunken, abusive boss. He was filthy rich, but he'd often have drunken fits and he cheated regularly. They'd fornicate in the mornings and make me late for school, and the constant driving around meant I couldn't do homework and led to my eventual academic collapse.
I never understood anything my mother did, as at one point she sent me out of state for ""summer vacation"" with her sister and her sister's drunken husband. I ended up being away for the last six months of '09, until I was sent back after one of my uncle's drunken rages (he would eventually crack and beat me aunt half to death, kidnap their two kids for several days, and after a costly attempt at divorce, get back together with my aunt).

When I came back from my ""vacation,"" my mother said she'd ceased her destructive relationships and that she was working at a new office and that we had a new home. She'd moved in with an old friend of hers, who treated me like a son/nephew. But after a couple of months, she called me and said that she had to go to her old boss' house to use his printer. I told her no, and she said she'd go to jail. Faced with this, I caved. I wish I knew better. My mom and her boyfriend had a massive fight where she tried to kill herself with a knife in front of me.

The next few years would see my mom meeting and marrying my now-stepdad, despite daily verbal fights, and the birth of their kid.

**tl;dr: sexual abuse by grand uncle that went unresolved because my grand aunt, who i told about it, was collecting from his income; childhood with my mom (biological father insignificant in my life) was shit because she slutted around the city and either dragged me along or left me at home by myself or with my abuser.**

The rest of this is actually significant, I guess. It's how I feel now, about myself and my life.
Since I emotionally and mentally cracked 2 year ago, when I realized that I was sexually and emotionally abused, I haven't known how to act like a person. My peers and friends are people to me. They have fun, they interact with each other, they have problems and experience real emotions. They all seem so *full*. I don't feel that at all. I feel shaken and empty, like I'm nothing. I've lost almost 30 pounds this past month, I have rampant insomnia and constant health issues, and I feel so alone. I feel like I'm not connected to the world around me, no matter what I do. For fuck's sake, I'm a certified scuba diver, I went from intern to president of a student-volunteer organization in three years, I've been studying film and video production in my free time and I've gotten to check out Paramount Studios and I got to do a shoot at YouTube's office in LA. But none of it makes me feel any more connected to the world around me. I'm so fucking desensitized to love, to achievement, to care. I just distract myself by locking myself away in my room and playing video games. When I'm with my friends or volunteers, I watch them and think about how genuine they are, how genuinely happy or genuinely whatever.

But I feel like I have no part in this world. And I don't. If I died, the world would go on without me, obviously. And I wouldn't mind dying. Unless I distract myself from waking to sleeping, few days go by when I don't think about suicide, or dying in some freak accident. There's nothing for me, even if I have all these things. My friends and the people I work with, most of whom fit in both categories, are amazing, but there's a wall between me and them, between me and everything. So many of them care so much about school, but I don't anymore. I don't even care about myself where they do sports to keep themselves active or fit.

This got out of hand. I'm sorry. I just don't feel joy, or care, or love. But I'm so upset, I'm so sad, and I feel so disconnected. I've never taken to smoking or drugs or self harm or attempting suicide, but I don't want to deal anymore."

Me and this girl are both interning in a State that isn't our home state. I'm from California while she's from the NorthWest. We both have a year left of college. So far, we have completed 2 weeks of our 10 weeks internship and we share an office together, and we have already established a sexual relationship. 

During our first date, she informed me at college she had multiple sexual partners becuase she enjoys providing sexual favors to guys, because it makes her feel good about herself. After our first date we established our relationship would only be a fling since after the internship a long distance relationship wouldn't work for us. 

During our second date, we had sex, and when I was driving her home, she said she made a bad decision whilel drunk by sleeping with her roommate the day before, and she had plans with someone else (not her roommate) the following day, and there is a possibiity she will have sex with him.

This really upset me, and I abruptly called her a slut. 

This is the text conversation that I had with her shortly afterwards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
ME at 6:24pm: ""I'm sorry for what I called you. It was not right of me to say that. I'm just hurt that after our special moment today you might have sex with some one else tomorrow""
--------------------------------------------------------------------
HER at 6:25pm: "" Well maybe we should consider being sluts with other people then""

HER : 7:27pm ""I dont like it when you call me a slut. I was clear about my terms for the fling so you know what my intensions were. If you don't feel comfortable with our agreement then you have the right to back out but it is not okay to make me feel bad about myself when you made the choice to sleep w/ me. I don't need to be with someone who blames me for a situation where I kept my side of the deal. If you cant accept my terms then dont bother pursuing me because you will only be hurting yourself. I apologize if this fact is too harsh but at least now you know where I draw the line"" 
------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't responded because I don't know what to do. My emotions for her has grown significantly. I want to have a fling with her but only if it's between us two.

We both enjoy enjoy spending time with eachother, but I don't know if I will be able to have a sexual fling with her while she also having multiple sexual flings on the side.

I will take any advice. 
Thanks in advance for the help. If you need more info people let me know. 

Edit-------------------- After considering the replies, I decided to keep the terms of the fling. My first goal is to remove the emotional feelings I have for her. Then negotiate no kissing, holding hand, hugging, and flirting outside the bedroom. However, those actions will be appropriate within the bedroom. The reason I am going to set these terms is to help me from developing emotional feelings again."

As the title states I am almost ready to move out on my own within the coming months (December) and I need some perspective on how to best use my summer internship funds to help me on my journey to financial independence.

Here is my current situation:

- I will be saving close to 4k by august.

- I will have no debt upon college grad.

- I will likely have an entry level job that   pays approximately 40k a year.


Now here is the current issue I am facing.

- I will be starting with nothing when I rent my first apartment (this is why I am considering using my savings to furnish an apartment).

- My second issue is that the job I may be offered is not in line with my career goals. And I am debating on whether or not i should spend my summer funds on a technical certification that may cost upwards of 6K (this includes courses and certification testing). This would be done in order to get into my desired field of interest. It would also likely mean I would have to decline my job offer I would receive in August (this means no job out of college).

My options at this point would be accepting a job I don't want, just to have a job upon graduation (and use funds to start my life) / or spend this money to get a professional certification that MIGHT help me get into my desired field.

Condensed version:
I don't like the job offer I received. And I want to know if my 4k would be best spent moving out and taking the offer (just to have a job) or if I should use that money for additional technical certifications. 

Any input on the matter is greatly appreciated."

My current employer has a large population of ham planets, galaxies, and mini moons.

&gt;Be me - Overtime

&gt;Don't be hammy population, especially the ones around the Executive Assistants area.

&gt;Don't be- Hamtern - Intern that was selected because she wanted to be in Human Resources one day. And lets face it a young ham that wants to be in HR made our resident HR Ham all squishy inside. It also made for a ""entitled and protected"" ham that became a terror.

&gt;You can be Senior VP Lawyer. Back from doing Lawyer stuff and a vacation with his S/O. Hamtern has never met him

&gt;Lawyer's S/O. You would never guess that Lawyer is gay, however when S/O speaks its in stereotypical gay flamboyancy.


**Whale Hunting**


A few years back the we had the whole economy collapse, to big to fail, mortgage crap. My employer decided to cut a bunch of people from it's work force so that it wouldn't hemorrhage any money. In someone's infinite wisdom it was decided to throw several parties and free lunches to boost the moral. After I saw the bills for these lunches/parties I realized the cost of these things could have paid a few people's jobs instead. But what do I know I'm only part of the proletariat. 

Sometimes I do things. I don't know why. It's like a little gremlin telling me to do something and see what happens. Maybe its boredom, I don't know.

One day we were to have a free pizza lunch. Almost 100 pizza's showed up. The good kind from an actual pizza place, not a pizza chain. I got an idea to do something and to see what would happen. I went to where the pizzas were in out cafeteria. Queen Galaxy was lording over them like she was a [Hutt gangster](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100326200307/starwars/images/2/26/Nem'ro.jpg) guarding her personal treasure. 

I asked if I could grab several of the pizzas to store in a refrigerator in the back for the night shift. Queen Galaxy was not pleased at the prospect of pizza leaving her sight. But a VP thought it was a great idea and allowed me to grab several boxes. The first part of my plan was in motion.

I knew I had time because the VPs and Queen Galaxy would eat first before letting everyone else come and get anything. So I trudged up and down the hallways of my work. Passing by cubicles full of Hams and letting the aroma of pizza wash over them. I could here stomachs gurgling and complaints of being hungry. I even ducked into a maintenance hallway and stood by the air intake ducts hoping to spread the pizza smell.

I put the pizza's into the refrigerator and headed towards the security office. I passed by the cafeteria. The VP's finished off a pizza while Queen Galaxy had finished off her third extra large. When I got to the security office I sat on the edge of the seat and watched the cameras in anticipation. I had a feeling something would happen but wasn't sure what. 

I found out that Hams can sprint, really fast, when properly motivated. They however can't slow down and stop very fast. I watched as one person from the I.T. department got ran into. Another Ham ran into an entrance door and started yelling because she couldn't exit. It was amazing. 

I eventually went back into the cafeteria. At my most inner Hammy I can eat maybe 3/4 of a pizza, maybe a whole one given time. But these people were eating 3 or 4 to themselves. Queen Galaxy finished off 5. Us 'Fat-Free Muggles' just stood back, ate our 2 slices and went back to work. Mostly because anyone without any weight got shoved out of the way for greasy hands to grab another box.

&gt;Random Ham: (to me) If you ate more and gained some weight then you could get more pizza. You're too skinny and it's survival of the fittest here. 

Many of the Hams fought over the ""Supreme"" pizzas. I watched as Hams pressed their faces into cardboard boxes to eat the cheese that was stuck to it. It was chaos. I'm not sure how much of it was caused by me or if they would have acted this way with out my ""help"". 

**Hamtern's folly**

I was sitting in the reception area basking in my whale baiting chaos. There had been a few ham arguments over some of the last of the pizza. Usually two hams grabbing the same box and getting into a tug-o-war match. Lawyer had returned off his vacation with his S/O. He was signing him in as a visitor. We had not seen him in a long time because he was doing his lawyer thing in D.C.

So I sat there silently hating how great they were dressed, wishing they would take me out and give me some pointers. S/O had a bag with him. Some wine and fancy food. Lawyer and him were going to have a ""picnic"" in his office. 

Suddenly Hamtern showed up with 2 pizza boxes. One was open and she was stuffing her face. She noticed Lawyer and S/O. She had never met Lawyer before. As you could guess from anything I've written about her that she was getting real full of herself and thought she was untouchable. 

She stuffed a couple of slices of pizza in her mouth, chewed with it open. She eyeballed S/O's bag...

&gt;Hamtern: *NOM* *NOM* What's in *NOM* *NOM* there??? *NOMMY NOMMY*

&gt;Lawer: Oh some (such and such) cheeses, (fancy) wine, other fancy food. Going to have a picnic in my office

For those who haven't read: Hamptern is a white trash redneck bible thumper...(biblical stuff doesn't apply to her though).

&gt;Hamptern: That's not real food! I don't know how you can eat that stuff! Two guys on a picnic with Fag food.......you know that could be seen as gay right?! You can order some more pizza's and invite a real woman to join the two of you...(tried to be seductive with her mouth full of pizza. The sight would have turned me gay if I was in their place.)

[Me!](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbqr1xlQX71r2e4eh.gif) Realizing she just fucked up and this is going to get really good, really fast.

Lawyer just stood there looking at her surprised. You would never tell that Lawyer was gay unless you asked him. I didn't know for years until he mentioned his S/O to me one day. Not my business. However, S/O is a stereotypical flamboyant talker. As soon as he opens his mouth you instantly know.

&gt;S/O: Not aw honey, I don't know who you think you are but you had better watch yourself. I'm not going to tolerate any bigotry!

Wheels just clicked in Hamterns head. Mean while I'm trying to keep myself composed. Sorry flamboyant gay men talking are hilarious to me and him about to go off on Hamtern was about to be too much.

&gt;Hamtern: You're both FAGS!! OMG!! That's a sin! The bible says...!!!

&gt;S/O: Bitch! You don't know anything about no bible! Looks like you ate any bible you came across instead of reading it! Isn't your fat gluttony ass a sin? 

There were a few more exchanges like this. I had already went into a partial happy (not trying to laugh) coma and slid off the couch onto the floor. 

Lawyer had to jump in.

&gt;Lawyer: Who are you exactly? Which department do you work for and who is your boss?

&gt;Hamtern: I'm the year intern for HR (looking smug) if you don't like what I have to say then you should talk to her! (this normally would back someone down but she fucked with the wrong person)

&gt;Lawyer: Oh ok, count that your internship will be over tomorrow. I'll tell HR Ham that I don't want you here anymore. 

Hamtern looked confused. She knew all the VP's that she couldn't bully. Who was this guy?

&gt;Hamtern: Who are you? You just can't decide who can be here or not!

&gt;Lawyer: I'm the head senior VP lawyer, and you are a someone who shouldn't be working here.

Hamtern started chocking on 2 slices of pizza she was stuffing into her mouth. I forgot how to do the heimlich maneuver for a moment. 

The next day as promised Hamtern was no longer employed as an intern with us. We (especially me) [celebrated!](http://cdn.arwrath.com/2/227675.gif)

She stayed in PA last summer and this summer she came out for a month, until her job in PA started(related to her major, basically an internship). She was just sitting around the apartment here since she couldn't really have a job for only a month. 

She didn't really seem to think it was as awesome as I did that we didn't have to drive an hour to a movie theater or that we could walk to Chipotle.  She thought driving someplace this size was too stressful. On the other side she liked that she didn't know everyone she saw, the lack of rednecks driving around jacked up trucks, and the area actually being up kept.

I will have a job offer for when I finish school next year that is over 2000 miles from our hometown in one of the largest metros in America. I really want to move there, live a fun life getting paid almost 2x as I would make with my degree at home. She is worried about not knowing anyone and not having a job set up as she gets there(I'll be making enough that she won't have to really be stressed out about finding one ASAP). She is also worried about moving away from her family, she is a huge daddy's girl and spends a lot of time with her grandmother. This all seems like rational things to be worried about, but none of them really bother me. 

I plan on proposing in a few months, and know that she will say yes. I think she will move with me, but I'm really worried about forcing her to move someplace she isn't sold on. 

Any red flags I should look for before I move and essentially force her to also? Anyone have a good experience moving to a new far away city where you didn't know anyone?

However, I landed a great job out of college ($90k a year) and I'm on my own now in terms of managing all my own money. After some research, I've decided on this checkings acct with Charles Schwab: http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account
It is all online, has no fees, reimburses any 3rd party atm fees, etc. It seems like a good find. However, it requires me to open a brokerage account along with the checking account. The brokerage account requires $0 balance and is completely free. Should I use this brokerage account? Is this brokerage account supposed to be my savings account?

I have no idea where to open a savings account. When I research different banks, what should I look for in a savings account? Should I open a savings account or a CD? Considering my checking account is all online, should I be opening a savings account that has a lot of brick and mortar branches so I can deposit cash?

TIA for all of your help, any advice is much appreciated!

Edit:
I realize I could provide more info on my situation. My employer offers a a 401k that they match contributions to up to 6% of my total income. Since a 401k is tax free (right?), I will definitely be contributing 6% of my income to that.

However, I will still have a considerable amount of money left over. I already have a car so I want my large first purchase to be a condo/home, because I don't want to throw money into rent. Once I know I want to stay in the city/job where I am at (that will be in about 18-24 months), I plan on getting a mortgage on a place and paying off the mortgage instead of rent (that way I get some equity out of my payments). Is that a smart thing to do? Or am I being naive?"

When I started secondary school I was no longer sent to be taken care of and have dinner in someone else's house after school until my parents came to pic me up. My parents worked full time till late in the evening so bottom line is I had a lot of free time right as I entered puberty.

Someone introduced me to porn one of these days, a friend that was a few months older, I was so naive at the time that I didn't understand why they were humping. How far I've come eh? I started to Fap from soon after that.

Fast forward ten years to today, I find myself on an internship from college in a town about 160 miles away from any of my friends, family and girlfriend. I am a 21 yr old man who could, on a bad weekend day, fap up to 10 times in one day on and off.

I have a fetish that developed over the years that my girlfriend knows about and is supportive of. I am scared that it might dominate our sex life, that is one of the reasons I told myself it was ok to fap, because it kept my fetish out of our mutual sex life. That was a terrible idea, and a wonderful lie I could wrap around myself to avoid reality.

Back to present I find myself with far to much time and fapping is becoming my major time consumer, I find myself watching episodes I shows I like and stopping them putting on porn then edging while watching the latest GOT or SPN episodes.

This has to stop, not because its morally wrong, not because a religion tells me I should, but because I am damaging myself and my relationships. 

I fapped this morning and felt disgusted at myself for doing so, it made me ask: Why? Why did I do that, there was no porn around, nothing sexual at all. I fapped because this is what I. Have. Become. A creature of habit and lust and self loathing.

The bottom line is I am going to stop fapping, if I achieve nothing else before I die I am going to break this habit and regain control of my body and my sexuality.

With this decision in mind any advice for starting out on this road would be greatly appreciated. 

To everyone on this thread and all the other posts I've read, thank you for giving me the push to make a change"

I'm applying to internships currently, but I'm unsure how well versed I have to be in a language in order to put it on my resume.

I recently started working as a computer science engineer at my internship and my workout has been pretty bad lately. I cant workout during the morning because i have to go very early and due to various other reasons which involve transport and such i cant do it. So the only option is after 6. 

So again do you guys have some techniques to deal with this ? 

Thank you so much!

Friday, June 13 2014: As the night neared 10:15 I began to get ready for sleep while keeping an eye out for anything unusual. Nothing out of place, no windows or doors that had appeared to have been tampered with, nothing to be suspicious of. I shut down all of the lights in the house, double locked my doors, and closed the windows. Again, I felt a little silly huddled close to a window in the dark hiding from, well who knows, but at this point the threat was a little more personal. I checked the clock, 10:14, and waited... and waited... and waited. What felt like an eternity. I peered back at the clock on my microwave to read, nothing.

The clock was blank. The little light on the coffee maker was off. My power was out. I look across the street to a neighbor and see a small lamp on in the living room. The church had an outside flood lamp on. It appeared as though my house was the only one in the dark. Of course I had to check the nearest light switch, no result. What felt like sitting and waiting for ten minutes likely was just that. Knowing that this could potentially be a disastrous situation, I grabbed my cellphone and locked myself in the bathroom. I then phoned the local police. After explaining a brief recap of the story they kindly sent over a cruiser and the lovely lady on the other end was reassuring and polite. 

About ten minutes later I could hear the police officers pounding on the back door, to which I clumsily navigated through the kitchen and down my back stairs to unlock. I went to my car and locked the doors while they inspected the house. The source was something to do with the circuit breaker, I am nothing close to a handy man and the explanation was all Greek to me. Anyway, they had said that I should probably find a friend to bunk up with until tomorrow so that they could fix the problem and check the house a little better.

Without many options I drove across town to a friends. I was ultra paranoid driving to his house, constantly checking my rear view for any sort of vehicle following me, and I had seen nothing. I even went as far as to park my car a street over from the house... just to be safe. He was nice enough to lend me an old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comforter, a Thomas the Tank Engine pillow, and a lovely two-seater. After trying to sort the situation out in my head a bit more clearly I finally fell asleep.

Saturday June 14, 2014: I had woken up to an alarm on my phone reminding me that I had work this morning. I gave myself a decent sink shower and ran out of the house to my car where I found a blue index card under my windshield. It simply had a smiley face drawn on it, no time, nothing. I threw it in the back seat and went to start my car. Nothing. Engine wasn't turning over. Turning the key, no click, no sound. I popped the hood, my battery was gone. 

This meant that the person was able to get into my locked house and my locked vehicle (unless they can pop the hood without the button under my seat, its a 98 Toyota Camry if that helps?). They had eyes on me last night after I left my home. My friend was kind enough to bring me to work and said he would pick up a new battery for me at Sears Auto. 

Work was fine, I don't need to bore you with the details of my weekend job as you would surely exit this window if you haven't already. My friend picked me up around 2 with a brand new battery and brought me to his house. We decided that this was a situation he would like to avoid if possible, so I walked to the car by myself and put the new battery in. Started the car and began to drive it home. I had gotten maybe a quarter of a mile down the road and it started acting really strange. Reeeealllly strange, stop and go, no power, sounded terrible. I parked it on the side of the road, called my friend, and went down to the police station. 

I mentioned that my car was obviously tampered with in some way and that it was likely linked to whoever did whatever to my house the night before. I decided against paying for their absurd towing fees and used my AAA to get a tow to my mechanic in order to investigate the issue with the car. 

They had no news regarding my power outage, but my friend and I were curious enough to swing by the house. There was no one on the scene except for a line of police tape blocking my basement door. I used my key to go inside and grab some clothes, my computer, my textbooks and my briefcase. We made the grab and hightailed out of there. 

The rest of the night I had spent working on some school work at my friends, the police has assured me that they were ""on the case"" and that ""I would be in my home shortly."" 

Sunday June 15, 2014: My mechanic had called and said that the issue with my car involved some dishsoap in the gas tank and that the repair costs would likely double/triple the value of the car. I called the police and they said they would look into it, and that there was nothing new in regards to my home yet. 

Wanting to take a break from the nonsense and feeling pretty down about the whole situation my friend took me on a little day trip out of town. We went to breakfast with his father and then went on a hike. It was everything that I needed. When we returned to his car, however, there was a note under the windshield just like mine. Blue index card, reading ""You should stay away. This is your warning."" 

I tried my best to consider any sort of options I had for a temporary living situation, but nothing came to mind. My family was all out of state and I didn't have any close enough friends to my job/school/internship that would be willing to cart me around until I got a new vehicle. I could tell that my friend was supportive but didn't really want me around there anymore. I couldn't blame him really. We went to the police station, filed a report, and then picked up my stuff at his house. He then brought me to a hotel in town, where I am now, writing about this. It's been an exhausting weekend.

When I unpacked my computer from my briefcase I went to pull out the note I had found in there. Inside the pocket was a second note. I cannot tell if this was from a few weeks ago or more recent. I also can't read it, but I will post it here if anyone can. It appears to be a code or something, I don't know. Help if you could please.

**UPDATE:**
Monday, June 16 2014: I had received a call around 9:30 from the local police that they had wanted me to come down to the station to give a full report on the record. My boss has been incredibly understanding through all of this and was kind enough to give me the rest of the day to speak with the police. I was able to arrange a ride from a co-worker to the station and had been there for the better part of 3 hours getting everything ""on the record."" I had shown them all of the notes I had on me and mentioned the code that /u/SadCity was kind enough to crack for me last night. 

After getting all of this information down, they had informed me that whatever occurred in the basement of my home was far worse than I had thought. I haven't been down there since the incident on Friday evening, but they had told me that my power going out was the result of what had been a failed attempt to starting an electrical fire from the basement. The point of entry was the basement door where they had unscrewed the actual doorknob itself (I was shocked this was even possible).

The police also had some photographs of some pretty disturbing graffiti in the basement that I was unaware of: an upside down star with a zigzag in it (almost like the traditional pentagrams I have seen without the circle), an upside down cross, and a long word beginning with ""SHEM...."" upside down. These were painted on the floor and walls in the back of the basement, a section that I haven't been in since late last fall. In the winter it is cold and I simply haven't had a reason to be down there. The police seem to believe that these incidents are all related, but have opened up a separate case regarding the vandalism to my vehicle. They have offered to provide a police escort to work, school, and my internship until ""the dust settles."" Until then they have requested that I do not disclose too many of the working details with anybody (they are aware of this subreddit and have suggested that I keep the posts light to not attract any attention, as I had said I mentioned you all helping me crack the code) but I will still do my best to keep everyone updated as this story unfolds. 

I am now at a safe location that will likely change every day or so until I can determine that my home is safe and that I am not being followed. Unfortunately all of the index cards that I had were turned over so I can no longer post them as proof, however I will do my best to disclose any information in the future that will not interrupt the investigation as it stands. 

I appreciate all of the concern you have expressed and am still contemplating getting a weapon as a measure of protection. I have never shot a gun before, I have never even been in a fight. As embarrassing as it sounds I have led such a non-confrontational life that I am not even sure I would effectively punch somebody. I am still weighing the pro's and con's to having a weapon with me and will let you know how I decide to move forward with that. Never had I thought I would even consider resorting to purchasing a gun, but it seems more and more sensible as things unfold.

288v38,0,2014-06-15,My story and Looking for advice and Help,wolfpacsoldier,ExCons,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExCons/comments/288v38/my_story_and_looking_for_advice_and_help/,"Hi guys, I have been lurking on this sub since finding it a few months ago. I am looking for advice, but I will go over my story first. I am a male, 34 year old. I live on Long Island NY, Nassau County. On May 9th 2012, as I was getting ready for my last day of class I was arrested. Why? I had been using a program called Limewire ,which is a P2P file sharing program. I was downloading (which was stupid I know and I do not do anymore) music, movies, pictures, etc. One of the things I was downloading was porn (I know again stupid). Hidden in a few porn videos were a couple that were mislabeled because 5 videos turned out to have underage girls in them, mostly teenagers with one video having children. 

 I tried to delete without success the videos, sometimes with the P2P file sharing programs it was hard to do and I wasn't able to delete them. Now I am not a pedophile, I have been around baby's, children, I have to younger sisters, have a god niece who I love very much (her mother is one of my best friends) so I have never done anything harmful to a child before. Never been in trouble with the law before either. 

 I am however part of a small part of the population that has what is called Ephebophilia, which basically is an attraction to 15 to 19 year old girls. In my case I have never acted up it and the only reason I bring it up is because I looked at the other for videos a bunch of times, which I am very much ashamed about. I didn't seek out looking for that type of material but that doesn't take away the fact that I looked at some of it. And it kills me the videos were made because the girls were taken advantage of and films and I will always carry guilt over that. But since i had unknowingly downloaded the videos and watched all but one, i was arrested and charged with 5 counts of underage porn. 

My parents bailed me out, and got me an expensive lawyer. The lawyer then told be to plea guilty and throw myself at the mercy of the court. I then finshed my classes and degree after getting an extension by my school and got my second degree, which was a bachelors in graphic design and fine art.  My lawyer then told me to get into therapy as soon as possible (which I did but it took me 6 months to find someone willing to take me with my NY medicad insurance). I found a therapist dec 2012, and have made great progress. After being evaluated by my therapist and cleared, then evaluated by the NY Nassau County Health Services (that one I was never told the results of).  

Then In Jan of last year 2013, with my lawyer pushing me I toke a plea of 1 felony count of passion of child porn. Good news no jail time, but I was given 10 years probation. I was also made a level 1 sex offender. After I am done with my probation, I will thank god no longer be a registered sex offender. I started my probation April of 2013 and I was given a ankle electronic device that showed where I was at all times that I wore till October of 2013. The ankle device nonstop malfunctioned and beeped and was a nightmare with me being called constantly and being told I would be thrown back in jail. 

I have since been on probation for over a year and it has been a nightmare.  I check in once a week every Tuesday and have 3 visits to where I live (with parents) a month. My probation officer goes from friendly to a nightmare in a flick of a switch. I know that they give you a hard time to keep you out of trouble but It has gone beyond that.  I was almost attracted by my probation in my room and told she can shoot and kill me anytime she wants. Then when I meet with her the following Tuesday, her and her supervisor both said the same thing saying I could be shoot and killed at anytime for any reason they see fit and that I can be thrown in jail for any reason they see fit. 

I have to complete a sex offender therapy, which is not covered by insurance and its around 150 us dollars a session. But I do not work. I have been unable to find work and a few months ago screamed and yelled at me for not finding work. Telling me she has waited  “long enough” and is sick of my bullshit and told me she was going to throw me in jail in a week if I could not find work. 

I have no cell phone, just my parents house number for her and others to reach me at. Friday she called and I was sleeping after being up earlier doing laundry.  My sister picked up and my probation officer without identifying herself to my sister just asked for me. My sister who though my probation officer was a bill collector told her I don’t live here and hung up. My probation officer then called my fiancée on her cell phone telling to tell me to get in contact asap with her. Which I did, que screaming and cursing and threatened me. It ended with her telling me to report in at 12 noon tomorrow to be chew out by her and her supervisor.  Before she hung up she told be I would be court order to leave my house for the rest of my probation if I do not get a cell phone asap. I have no money to do so. I have not checking account. I have zero bucks to my name. I do several job applications every day and have had  5 interviews in a year and a half.  But I am still unemployed. I am sorry for what my sister did, she has biplor among other issues and I told my probation officer I was sorry about that whole issue but I got cursed out for that. 

I have been unable to use my degrees in graphic design due to the cops taking and destroying my laptop, which has my thesis and whole portfolio work. No portfolio, no internships or jobs.  I am redoing it on a beat up 2008 Mac which is working badly and is on it’s last legs so it is taking time.  

I am doing very well with therapy, my therapist feels I am not or was i ever a danger to anyone else esp children. But I cannot find work with my criminal record and have no cell phone or checking account or am able to complete the sex offender sessions because I lack funds. I know I cannot be jailed for these reasons nor are they allowed to threaten to shoot and kill me for no reason. However I fear I cannot do anything about the threats and other issues until I get a lawyer to maybe lesson my probation time and maybe stop the threats of violence by maybe getting another probation officer. I have no money however and cannot find a lawyer willing to help me for little to not money. 

I don't know what to do, I can't sleep (on medication to help sleep, only helps slightly), and I am scared, depressed and worried I am going to take my one life very soon. I don't expect probation to be a piece of cake. But it shouldn't be this bad, and the threats on my life are beyond the proper behavior of them (they could get into a lot of trouble but i need a lawyer most likely do do anything about it). 

I'm sorry  I rambled on so much and thank you to anyone who read all of that. And If anyone can offer any advice I would very much appreciate it.  Thank you.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that the files I downloaded were miss titled, meaning I thought they were legal porn and I was downloading a lot of it, but five turned out to me underage porn. I didn't go looking for those videos. Now that doesn't change the behavior of my PO and her supervisor and their threats of killing me and kicking me out of my home and dragging me to court and jail even when I haven not violated my terms of probation. Im only asking for advice, not to be attacked. Thank you."
288v90,0,2014-06-15,"age 23- New job, new wardrobe (business casual)",everybodysblind,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/288v90/age_23_new_job_new_wardrobe_business_casual/,"OK I hope I've read enough and will include enough info, please be forgiving if I miss something here. I am starting an engineering job, and am sick of looking like a dope in the business casual environment. In my internships, I generally wore somewhat baggy dockers, a baggy as hell button up shirt of solid color, a belt, and shiny black dress shoes used for suits. I wasn't at the point where I was willing to spend money on nice clothes, so what I had from H.S. made do.

The dress code- ""golf/polo shirts with collars, dress shirts... dress slacks."" That's it. 

I now am making a sustainable amount of money, and want to change this. I know business casual isn't really fashion (somehow?), but here goes- 

Physically- 23 years old, 6', 155-160lbs (depending), slim / athletic build. 33"" waist or so, I'm trying to shrink that a bit by working out that [small] beer gut from college. 

Personality/Style- outgoing, but somewhat old-fashioned. I was a punk-jock in high school, but more mature now. I don't want to look at all ""hipster"", or ""preppy"". Maybe not the best terms, but you know what I mean. I want to be have a dapper, elegant wardrobe to fit my personality. 

I started off buying new shoes before researching much (need them tomorrow) and apparently made a mistake with the squared off toes -

[Bostonian](http://www.amazon.com/Bostonian-Mens-Bolton-Dress-Slip-On/dp/B004FDRMZE) , in brown. 

Price wise, I generally feel that $50 is average for shoes, and the $20-30 for shirts or pants. My favorite shirt currently is a fitted shirt from Geoffrey Beene. It's a lighter purple color. I don't mind going for lots of color.

So where do I shop and what should I look for? I see a lot of current trends in bus/cas and they all seem to look very ""Hipster"" to me. Cardigans just don't seem me at all. 

I guess I generally used to dress like number five in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/27wqit/business_casual_inspiration_album/ci575b5) comment. 

To me, [this](http://i.imgur.com/Tf8ZakD.jpg) guy looks very yuppie to me (not my style), while [this](http://i.imgur.com/kYZQ0op.jpg) guy looks pretty hipster to me, which also isn't me.

It seems the ubiquitous [gosling](http://i.imgur.com/mA1ZIbv.jpg) bus/cas outfit looks ok to me. 

I generally seem to like straight legged pants, more tightly fitted but not too tight. 

Last tidbit- I stay quite warm and hot as is, so too many layers kill me. This hampers a lot of my options I think so far from what I've been looking at.

I know this is a bit of a jumble, but I hope it is descriptive enough. Anything else needed please ask. Also, I did not mean any of the terms such as ""hipster"" as offensive, just isn't my style. "

I got into a fight with a close friend of mine. I broke his trust in me, and it got ugly.  We stopped talking for a while, i did apologise and asked him what I could do to regain his friendship.  He said he was under a lot of stress, was in a bad mood in general.   He also said he had a lot on his plate and needed a month to think about things, he asked me to leave alone during that period. If i did that he would be willing to reconsider things.  Its been two weeks and things have been hard,  but I have managed to leave him alone.  I do have feelings for him that go beyond friends, and at one point he did too,  we never acted on them though (the timing was never right for either of us).  The past week has been very difficult for me because I know this is the end of his internship and he was at a major convention that was the culmination of years of hard work on his part.  I just feel awful being on the outside not being able to be there with him celebrating his accomplishments.  It was very difficult not to send something to congratulate him. I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next two weeks, but I must.  What can I do to keep my mind off him?"

I'm a computer science major going into my senior year of college. I've been wanting to work on a summer project towards the applications side of things since my internship is more related to hardware (so far I'm not a huge fan). I know the basics about programming and I'm technically savvy, I'm looking for advice from you about how I should approach my project.

I want to make a script/program which will search for recent articles containing certain keywords on a specific set of news sites and then return a list of all of the articles with their titles, number of times each keyword appeared and a link to each article. I'm not trying to make this into a consumer service or anything so there's no need for a slick GUI or anything, it's for a friend who does this weekly by hand at the non-profit he works at.

If there's a tool out there that does this already, let me know! I'd like to make it available to my friend now and then pick up a different project.

I'm wondering what technologies/languages should I start familiarizing myself with, are there any tutorials you'd recommend, how is this sort of thing done and what's my first step? 
Any advice you guys could give me would be really appreciated!

While I expected to relax, have fun, and make friends in Finland this past year, my mind has been churning and just in general causing me to, internally, be a mental wreck. I can't stop thinking about my future.

When I first came to Finland last year, I thought I wanted to become a computer programmer. Well, I lost interest in that after thinking about how boring it would be to sit around all day, typing. Then came the thought, maybe I could be a comedian? Well, not anymore, I'm not spontaneous enough, and I'm a horrible writer. After that, the cop-out: become a YouTube gamer/comedian. Yeah right.

I have not been raised with relevant skills to becoming a marine mammal trainer. I am a pretty crap swimmer, I have virtually no animal training experience, and I'm relatively timid.

Sounds great, no?

Well, I've started to plan after some research. I need to get a psychology degree. 4 years of my life. Probably ~$100K of debt (I'm Canadian). I need to get some experience with animals. I know I could probably intern at the local vet, but between university and a job, where would I find the time? I need to get SCUBA certified (which I wanted anyway), but that's $5K of equipment, and probably a couple hundred more for the course. And once again, the issue of time. Then, the biggest issue: my physical condition and swimming. I've tried, god knows I have, to get into shape multiple times. Every time I've quit due to my lack of self-confidence. The same goes for swimming. I want to get a personal trainer/swim coach that actually wants to teach me and push me. Despite how wimpy it sounds, I can't do it myself. However, swim coaches and personal trainers are expensive (for good reason), and despite the fact it would be a worthy investment, my mind has trouble dropping big money on things.

I have decided so far that I will be going to university in Vancouver, due to it being close to the ocean, an aquarium, and in Canada. This would be the first time in my life living alone. I'm not the best friend-maker (something I need to work on), so I'm worried about being alone and allowing myself to destroy myself. I will be trying to go to a marine mammal trainer training camp next summer, and perhaps the one after that as well. 

In the end, I look ahead of me, and see so many years of work. For a chance. That scares me. I want to be finished them as fast as possible, not waste time just for a chance that I could fail. I know, I'm only 19, and I shouldn't be worried about time. I know that, but I can't seem to get that thought out of my head. ""You're really going to spend the next 4-8 years chasing this? You're just going to be beat out by someone who is naturally better than you. You don't have the money to afford it anyway. You might as well just give up and drift aimlessly in society.""

289khl,1,2014-06-16,American with first full-time work/pay in Germany,paintboarder44,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/289khl/american_with_first_fulltime_workpay_in_germany/,"Hey guys! I've got a few questions regarding work in Europe as an American related to my financial stuff. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

**Background**

I've got a Masters in Engineering and am set to begin my first full-time job here in the next few months. I am from the US and studied in the US, but will be (98% sure) starting my first job here in Germany. I've got a standing offer with a company that I'm doing an internship with right now, and am deep in the application process for a International Graduate Program with a big multinational firm. So I've got options, and they both should turn out (financially) pretty well.

**Income**

The offer with my current company would put me at a starting salary of roughly €2000/month with all included benefits and the standard German Retirement fund. I was hoping for a little bit more, but it'll be a good start. I have not received any financial info on the other program, so I don't have anything to compare it to right now.

**Expenses &amp; Loans**

If I stay in Hamburg with my current company, my expenses would be pretty low. I would have rent of €200/month, wouldn't have or need a car, and food has been about another €100-150/month (I like food). So my fixed expenses would not be that high. 

For the other program, I do not yet know where I would live, and it would rotate every 4ish months. So the costs for that position would probably be higher and much more variable.

For sure though, I have my student loans to start paying off. That is going to suck, and being across the Atlantic might make it a little harder. Here's that rundown:

* Direct Subsidized - Sept. 2009 - $5471 - 5.6%
* Direct Subsidized - Sept. 2010 - $5490 - 4.5%
* Direct Subsidized - Sept. 2011 - $5500 - 3.4%
* Direct Unsubsidized - Sept. 2009 - $2506 - 6.8%
* Direct Unsubsidized - Sept. 2010 - $2479 - 6.8%
* Direct Unsubsidized - Sept. 2011 - $2344 - 6.8%
* Private, Bank - Sept. 2011 - $10000 - 4.73%
* Private, Bank - Jan. 2012 - $5000 - 3.48%
* Private, Bank - May 2012 - $6300 - 3.48%
* Private, School - May 2012 - $2000 - 0%

**Money Transfer** 

I have accounts with Chase, Charles Schwab, and Deutsche Bank (have the option to change banks after July, tips on good German banks/accounts also appreciated!). I have repeatedly tried to find a way to connect any combination of these accounts to allow easy or online transfers, and I don't think there is a way to do this. I want to be able to set up some sort of online transfer, so when I get paid through my German account, I can transfer it to one of my accounts in the US to allow me to pay off my student loans much easier/with less hassle.

Since it doesn't look like there's a way to do it online (I would LOVE to be proven wrong), I had the idea of setting up an account in Germany  that allows for international ATM withdrawals, and have someone back home that I trust do a monthly ATM withdrawal of a certain amount and  deposit that amount into one of my US accounts. I could then do online stuff to pay off my CCs and Student Loans. That's the current plan.

**Money Management** 

Back in the US I started up a Mint account, and really enjoyed having all of my financial ducks in a row, so to say. But, unfortunately, it is not easy to use over here in Europe. I wanted to be able to enter transactions as they come along (almost everything is cash based here, not much CC use), but there's no way to change the currency on the mobile app, and they don't allow the addition of accounts with foreign banks on your Mint account.

Is there a similar service/program like Mint that works here in Europe? Ideally one that allows for the use and connection of international accounts, such that I can see my US and German finances all on the same level? That would be ideal, but I don't know if something like that exists.


Thanks for all your help!!!

289qyk,0,2014-06-16,16 Year Old looking for a law firm attachment [3 weeks - 1 month],[deleted],singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/289qyk/16_year_old_looking_for_a_law_firm_attachment_3/,"Hi I'm 16 and studying in a local school that offers IP. Because of the time saved not having to take the O levels, our teachers have strongly encouraged us to go on small internships. 

I have a very strong interest in studying and practicing law in the future. Have good academic results (amongst top 10 in cohort) and a good CCA record ( exco position in leadership board, CCA leader ).

 Also made use of free time to learn about law from courses on Coursera (free online courses that last about 6-10 weeks offered by universities in the US, Japan, UK, etc. with certification ).

Besides law-related stuff, have also taken the time to learn more about sidelines that I'm interested in such as coding and programming, economics , nanotechnology etc. and have also put some of these skills to use by creating / refreshing websites of non-profit organizations and charities. 

With regards to any past experience, I went on a short attachment with the Attorney General Chambers just this month and got to see the kind of work public lawyers do in Singapore. 

I have heard that law is quite a stressful and unrewarding career path to choose, albeit a high paying one, and I would really like to find out more about what a lawyer's day to day routine is like. Does anyone know of any law firms that will be willing to host a student like me for about 3 weeks to a month? Hopefully, a law firm that is willing to attach me to a mentor to just shadow them throughout the attachment and talk to them about their career, and help out as much as I can in areas that a 16 year old can help in.

Thank you :)"
289x3u,2,2014-06-16,It was a close one.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/289x3u/it_was_a_close_one/,"Somebody ran away and I tried to follow the shadow of that person. My mom grabbed hold of my arm and told me, ""I love you Yna. Everything's going to be fine."" She said some more words that is usually reserved for someone who is dying in the hospital. It made me stop and yell at her. ""Stop making it sound like I'm going to die!"" Tears sprung to my eyes and I turned away. I ran into the darkness.

The first thing I noticed is that there is blood everywhere. The bark of the trees looked red as the sun sets. The crows cawed as I walk down the forest with the tall trees bathed in blood towering over me. It was night inside the forest but looking at the edge of the trees, the sun continues to set.

Sounds everywhere. All at once the crows cawed and a lot of people are whispering my name all at once.
Rina. Rina. Rina. Rina.

I ran through the forest but the darkness stretched. Suddenly a girl wearing white and has no eyes appeared in front of me.
I stopped and stared at her. She pointed to her left with a hand with no flesh and muscle. It was such a contrast with her plump face and body.

She suddenly opened her mouth and spiders swarmed out of her. The more spiders that comes out of her, the thinner she became.  Until the very last spider came out and she was nothing more but a husk. 

I ran to where she pointed and saw faces on the bark of the trees as I passed.  As if the bloody tree had swallowed them all except for their head. Faces of children, woman and man all alike. They opened their eyes as I passed and opened their mouths like they're screaming but nothing came out of them. A silent scream.

I passed a guy who is hung upside down, tied at his ankles. The crows pecked his open ribs while he screamed continuously. His eyes were sewed shut. His arms are tied on his back. He screamed and screamed until I noticed that he was not just screaming. He was screaming my name. His head followed my progress as I ran quickly to pass him.

I continued running and saw a break in the darkness. Mud clung to my boots but I tried to keep running until I noticed that it was not mud that hinders my progress. It was hands.

I kicked off the hands that tried to grasp me and ran. I broke through the darkness and saw a grassy hill in front of me. The sky has that color like it is going to storm. There is a single bare tree on the top of the hill and as I walked towards it, I noticed a guy wearing a dark leather jacket staring at something right below the tree.

As I approached, I glanced at what he was looking at and saw a gravestone. I cannot remember what it said but I remember that the name written is familiar and there is a crow cawing on top of it. I turned towards the guy but he is gone and so is the hill. It was instead replaced with a large four cornered windowless room. It is painted grey and on the middle of the room is a table and two steel chairs. One of the chairs is already occupied by a guy wearing a straight jacket. His head hung forward like he is asleep or drugged.

I approached the table and sat down in front of him. I noticed that there is a bowl of red chili soup on the middle of the table. I immediately stopped thinking of food when I saw an eyeball rise up to the surface. Its dark brown iris stared up dully.

I looked up and saw the guy examining me intensely. His dark brown hair stuck wildly like he just woke up from bed while his dark eyes stared at me almost hungrily. I noticed the that his eyes are crimson but it's so dark that it could be mistaken for black or dark brown. His skin is so pale that it looked porcelain and his lips frowned at me.

""Oh I feel honored. It's been a while since they let someone visit me."" He said. He smiled slowly to reveal his sharp predator-like teeth.
He said something more and I replied with a short sentence but I forgot what was said. He said something more and I remember him saying this, ""A kiss to seal the deal. Nothing less. Tell me, are you willing to do it for the sake of justice?""

I bit my lip and closed my eyes. When I opened it again, the windowless room is gone and is replaced by a dark dining room. Like the ones you see in hotels or high-class restaurant. The light is dim as I stared into his eyes. He is leaning towards me with both is hands on either side of my high-back chair.

All traces of the straight jacket is gone and is replaced by a really dark blue suit.
He touched my cheek with a gloved hand before sliding it and resting it over my heart.

""Nothing less."" He said something more but a scream pierced through the calm surrounding and I opened my eyes, I am standing in front of a mirror. A guy is hugging me from behind and his head is buried on my neck, sobbing. I stared at the mirror but it showed something else. The guy wearing the dark blue suit pressing his hand on the glass.

He is surrounded by darkness as he glared furiously at someone behind me. He traced a heart on the glass and gave me a long look before reaching down for a candelabra and raising it up. He walked away from the mirror and was quickly swallowed by darkness. I screamed and the mirror shattered.

My mom grabbed my arm and smiled at me, her face calm but she doesn't look like my mom. ""I love you, Yna.""

That's when I woke up crying. I sobbed into my pillow for a long time before I gathered the courage to stand up and start my day.

This dream struck me deeply and I don't understand why. I took your advice people of nosleep and this dream came out of nowhere. I'm going to be staying with my grandma for a few weeks since it's nearer to my internship. I'm just going to leave this dream here and hope that someone can help me shed a light on this story."
28a00r,1,2014-06-16,Need some advice for a really sticky situation,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/28a00r/need_some_advice_for_a_really_sticky_situation/,"I need your help and advice in a particular matter because I’m reaching the end of my rope here.  I’ll offer as much detail as possible but I will keep a certain level of anonymity, I hope you will understand me in this matter. 

I’m 29, I live in Western Europe and for the moment I’m severely unemployed (1 year 6 months since my last job). I do have a higher degree and experience in my field, but I have some gaps, due to some bad decisions from my side, career changes and from life just happening. I’ll explain the timeline here shortly. If you don’t have the patience to read all of it, below is a tl;dr version and you can skip the bullet points.

- **age 19-23**: college attended (4 years study = 2 yrs common trunk Economics + 2 yrs specialization in Management). Finished with 8.10/10 final grade.
- **age 19-22**: the first 3 years of college I volunteered in 2 NGOs just to get some experience.
- **age 22-23 ½**: in the last year of college I started my own company with a colleague. 5 employees total, including me and my partner. We closed the business because it wasn't working the way we hoped. (Mistake #1)
- **age 23 ½ - 25**: landed a job through a friend developing projects for companies that wanted to obtain financing from grant programs. Financial crisis appeared, clients left and my paycheck took a big hit, I left the company to find a better job (without securing the next one- mistake #2).
- **age 25 - 25 ½**: I started to freelance doing the same thing that I did in my previous position, just to make some money until I could find a new job. I failed at my job search, I got severely depressed and it started a vicious cycle. I couldn't secure a job because I looked like a desperate, sad puppy to employers and that led to my depression getting more severe . 
- **age 25 ½ - 27**: moved from Eastern Europe to Western Europe for better opportunities. (Mistake #3.) Badly paid, long hours, exhausting, no legal contract, I even had to buy my own tools in order to do my job (not joking).
- **age 27-28**: I decided that I needed more experience in my field and took an internship (despite the age) in HR working for a large company in Asia, where I was assigned some awesome tasks (think being responsible for 250 employees). Things finally changed for me and I thought that my bad luck was over.
- **age 28 - 29 ½**: After my internship was over and with my direct manager’s recommendation, I started to look for open jobs within the same company. I had some interviews, but nothing came out of it and all my leads / contacts went cold. I came back to my family and restarted the job applications again, but with no luck whatsoever. 


**tl;dr: 4 years College + 3 yrs. volunteer work + 1.5 yrs own company -&gt; 2 years Project Management -&gt; 2 years unemployment / jobs not relevant to my field -&gt; 1 year internship (paid) in HR at multinational -&gt; came back to same country, last job was 1.5 years ago, unemployed and beyond worried.**


97 targeted applications sent so far with custom CV/Cover Letter for each application. I applied in the whole Europe and even contacted friends from Latin America for jobs, no results. I’m registered on LinkedIn and every major job search engine in Europe, send my CV to countless work agencies + regular applications. zero, nothing.

If there are redditors who work in HR in a country in Europe, please tell me your opinion on these aspects that I’m worried about:

1. What I really have, is it considered relevant and competitive for at least entry-level jobs in HR/general business administration/project management or a support function?
How much should I be worried about the unemployment gaps in my experience? Will recruiters understand these gaps?
2. I’m average in the local language, but fluent in English. What are my chances to find a job, even if it means taking a lower pay in order to mitigate the risk?
3. Given the fact that I’m in a country that is a little fed up with immigrants (especially with my nationality), will this aspect hinder my efforts to find something? How can I make connections in this case?
4. Regarding my personality. I’m modest by nature, I don’t like to talk about myself, I just do my work. I’m not shy, but I don’t like to be in the center of attention. Do you think that it could be a factor in my inability to find something so far?

I hope there is someone that can offer me some kind of advice, because I’m in a really tight situation here. My job is my identity, I can’t view a job just as a means to get money (although it is necessary to survive) and without one, I feel worthless as a human being. I loved everything that I did so far, I love my field, it’s intellectually stimulating for me. I never got fired, I was always in a good relation with my previous bosses and I even have letters of recommendation from them. I helped my colleagues every single time I could and I tried to keep everyone within my area as happy as possible with me. I have given the results expected, no issues on this side.

What could go wrong?

I am a civil engineer struggling to get a job or intern as a frontend dev. To apply I had to do some basic JavaScript functions, the they sent me a PSD file that I had to code into html/css/javascript. It went ok and they invited me for the interview.

This is really important to me because I really want to change the industry that I work in. I predict that the questions will be about JavaScript, common cross browser problems and w3c standards. 

Anyone can give me a hint where should I learn about the last two? 

Also what are the most common JavaScript questions?

I'm really concerned about this because I am totally self taught and have no real job experience. I dont want to fall on some common questions that a newbie have to know.

28aaxm,12,2014-06-16,"My Post-Graduate PR Experience, for what it's worth.",Jglide25,PublicRelations,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicRelations/comments/28aaxm/my_postgraduate_pr_experience_for_what_its_worth/,"I'm posting this mainly because I feel people can learn from what I've been through, maybe sympathize with me and even maybe fuel a decent discussion.

I graduated in the Fall of 2009 with a Bachelors in Public Relations from Central Michigan University. While in college outside of your normal classes I was required to do two internships.  One I did with a community college in my hometown and the other with a local non-profit. 

Upon graduation I stayed in town and applied everywhere I could. Snagged like one interview in 3 months for a position well above entry level that I did not get.

I ran out of money and moved home with my parents and got a job at Menards which I had worked at the past 7 summers.  My old boss said he'd be glad to have me back working again. (LESSON: Don't burn bridges)

A few weeks after working there part-time 50 hours a week, I got an email from the community college I had interned at.  They wanted to hire me part time at a good hourly wage.  I of course said yes and held on to both jobs.  For the first 3 months of working two jobs I was literally working 7 days a week. it sucked but I was able to pay a good amount off on my loans from school.

I eventually steadily worked 40 hours a week between both jobs. Seeing no real possibility of a full-time position opening up at the college I started applying for PR/Marketing jobs everyday when I got out of work. 

I did this for basically 3 years. 300-350 job applications later I finally got an offer to work at a community college in Kansas for $30,000 a year and no help with moving costs. I had to say yes.

I spent a year working there and it was financially frustrating. I could save a little.  But a little wasn't helping fix normal everyday problems. (IE Car needs new tires, brakes need replacing, shoes are broke, that kinda shit.)

So after a year I thought I'd start applying again to see if I could do any better, Being around 1000 miles from home wasn't awful, but I got homesick and missed a lot of family holidays.

I managed to score a new job quite quickly that pays $42,000 in Ohio that's around 7 hours from home.

So that's where I am at now. I'm extremely bitter about the job market, I rarely have sympathy when I hear people say ""I've been applying to jobs for months."" I've become a tough skinned guy with a no-nonsense approach to life.

MY ADVICE:

- Get an internship in a area you would like to work in firms, non-profit, in-house. I never interviewed anywhere else except higher education. because Firms wanted firm experience.

- Be close to a large city.  Let me tell you trying to find a entry level job in a smallerish town 250 miles from a larger city was a fucking nightmare.  Entry Level jobs in smaller towns don't exist.

- Apply your ass off.  I did 350 applications all across the US for jobs at colleges.  I had skype interviews with colleges in Alaska, New York, Colorado, Utah, Kansas, Ohio and Georgia.

- Study the company you are interviewing with and make a point to bring up a fact during your interview.  I once said ""I see your enrollment in Graphic Design is one of the strongest in the nation."" Letting them know you looked into them goes a long way.

- Get experience in a variety of different areas. I have now learned Web Design and management, Graphic Design and currently I am developing a new department. 

- Make your resume keyword searchable. Meaning include words like ""marketing strategies"" and ""demographics"" just using those words like that will set you apart (THIS HELPED IMMENSELY) 

If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'd love to help anyone I can."
28abw0,3,2014-06-16,My boyfriend [19/M] has no time for me [19/F] and I'm not sure If I'm overreacting or should break it off,lovesbitch,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/28abw0/my_boyfriend_19m_has_no_time_for_me_19f_and_im/,"      Sorry for the length. Believe it or not I left a lot out.   

      Here's the story. I have been dating my boyfriend for 9, almost 10 months. I'd say for the past three we've been having issues. These issues started because my boyfriend is really bad at time management where I'm much more organized. Although being in college and in dormitories we got to see each other tons, the time we did spend together seemed weak since whenever I'd do homework he would play video games. Then when I would have free time he left so much to the last moment that he was doing homework then. This seems silly I know but this made me feel like I was being pushed to the side. Eventually we deemed the issue as cabin fever and once it was summer and we spent less time together he would appreciate our time together more.
        However, the opposite happened. My boyfriend is very involved with his family which is fine. My family isn't quite as loving and about togetherness as his, so I don't have that problem. I always figured the demand from his family was normal since my family is unusually apathetic. But I'm starting to think it's not as normal as I thought.
       In short, his mom, dad, and stepdad have high expectations for him. A bit too high. His mom wants him to have a retail job for ""experience"", his dad wants him to have an internship, and his stepdad really wants him to get a job to move out. Even though he has a 3.8 they all deemed him a bum.
       So he got an internship which shut his dad up. He didn't get a job but is working with his father to get gas money. His mom and stepdad do not except this as a job because it doesn't have that good ol' retail experience. He is also working at our school radio station for free and taking a class to graduate early. He is extremely busy.
       This leaves us little time to see each other, and the time we do see each other is rushed and we just are fighting anyway. The fighting is usually because I spend most of the day waiting for him to see him for two hours. I have to wait because I live 45 minutes away but have two jobs (one is the same radio station) at the school which is closer to him. I'd often go to work and then spend 2-8 hours waiting around for him. Not to mention that half our time is spent with his over demanding family. For about two weeks I saw his family more than I saw him. His family not only expects him to do all this crap but also spend his excess time helping/spending time with them. 
        Though I did the same thing for those two weeks. Waited for him and expected him to spend his excess time with me. In one argument he pointed this out and I realized this was a problem so I started going home more when I was off. He also pointed out how his family made him feel the same way but worse. I told him to talk to them about this. He didn't.
        So I back off and learned something. Even though being at home could be hard for me, I began to enjoy that more than being with my boyfriend. I actually dreaded to come meet him last Thursday for one of his shifts but went anyway because I promised I would be there. Going was the biggest waste of time. I had to wait for him all day Friday and when I did see him we fought. Then Saturday he booked himself all day unnecessarily but even if he didn't he would be babysitting for his father that he sees all week  for work and would be seeing the next day for father's day. He said it was to see his brothers but he would be seeing them too the very next day. 
       I haven't seen him since Friday under his suggestion. Apparently if we do not ""force"" time together it will be better. But he has no time that isn't short and somewhat forced. If this is how it will be I don't think he has the time for a relationship. 
      He also says that once his class is over we will have more time but I think this is an empty statement. Once his class is over my job at home picks up and won't settle down till he's on vacation for two weeks with his dad. Then after that it's back to school which seems like it'd make it easier but it won't. We're both really busy next semester and he's commuting. I feel this won't stop for the same reason I pointed out in the beginning. He can't manage his time and I'm starting to lose the patience for it. 
       I love him a lot but I don't want to keep this relationship going if we'll just still be like this in the future. His inability to say no to his family combined with this relationship is just not working for me. He hasn't been in a relationship before either and I don't really even know how to run a successful relationship myself. I really need to know if I should fix this or end this. 
        
TL;DR: My boyfriend can't say no to his family or manage his time well. In effect, he doesn't have time for me. "
28aepm,30,2014-06-16,Our work is just a bunch of buzzwords,NewAccountPlsRespond,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/28aepm/our_work_is_just_a_bunch_of_buzzwords/,"Seriously.

It doesn't even matter where you work - creative, media planning or buying, client-side marketing, you are always haunted by the damn buzzwords which mean nothing. Having worked in the field for some time you learn to use them like you do with swear words in a bar with friends after four to five beers discussing last night's game.

""Engaging target audience in a wide array of social media platforms using highly relevant call-to-action is a priority for our multimedia launch in Q3 2014"". What does it mean? ""We want likes"".

People gather, discuss and brainstorm, make conference calls, hold business meetings, travel, go to business lunches to spew the same shit we do all the time only to realise they have a budget for a small TV campaign and some banners on the internet. Well, guess why, because, honestly, two hard-working interns in my agency do more ""real"" and hard work than most of our account directors combined. I did twice as much to go from assistant to junior media planner than it took me to go from media planner to (soon-to-be, hopefully) senior media planner, and, what do you know, i'm being headhunted because my CV states that i have ""an unique array of insights"" and ""tremendous experience delivering maximum ROI to clients in both awareness-focused campaigns and trial-focused call-to-action flights"". Over the time you get used to all this shit, but it still baffles me how most of our work is presenting pretty pictures with long and inspiring words, CEO meetings, contracts and stuff but once it comes to real business and media plan approval, it all boils down to the same old basic shit, because agency doesn't want to spend manhours trying to think of something new, client wants maximum ROI your creative breakthroughs won't deliver, etc etc.

""Drive consideration through inspiring urban adventurers with highly affinivte placement of distinct and revolutionary visuals"". You're selling a fucking shitty pet food/soda/whatever, come ON. Reading client briefs is a pain in the ass, you can effectively cross out like 90% of the words, and even your client doesn't understand the idea behind 3 pages which state ""uh, we're, like, uh, interested in people who might buy our product, and, uh, we want them to buy our product using, um, mainly, advertising"" in an extremely buzzwordy and complicated way.

People come and people go, agency work feels like a dorm with all the time you spend there and all the sleepy people walking around with mugs, same people who are being replaced constantly, you can't even keep track, HRs are always on your ass, clients want more for less money, your briefs are getting dumber and dumber every day, you need to do more faster, but you realise that ""more"" is shit noone cares about, all that corporate bullshit is infuriating as well.

Like, say, our agency introduced a new SMART (simple measurable active robot training, something like that) training system. These systems? Bullshit! Just another way for people in other departments to show their superiors that they are doing work.

You say stupid buzzwords a lot = you are cool.

Sorry, i had to vent. I mean, really sorry and really thank you for reading my shitty english mixed with my shitty train(wreck) of thoughts, it's just that i'm tired and fed up. I feel like a rabbit in a wheel and money (which i don't have time to spend so i buy useless shit like a new HUGE TV i haven't turned on in 2 months in attempt to make myself feel better) is the only thing to keep me going till i'm 30 and insane. Or a corporate robot. Dunno which is worse.

Do you ever feel this way?

Good luck, advertisibros. "
28afba,7,2014-06-16,Things are looking up a bit,boomable,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/28afba/things_are_looking_up_a_bit/,"(Kind of a long, mildly gushy post about positives happening in my life. I ramble a lot.)

To start, I'm a 22 year old female, if that matters at all.

The summer season always seems to be a time with things get a bit better.  It's just that my mood is so improved during this time.  Colder months make me more depressed for whatever reason.  For the first time in over 5 years, though, this summer's looking good for more reasons than that and I'm so happy.  Relatively, anyway. 

I reconnected with my best friend through childhood and high school after several years (which was due in part to my hiding away from everyone/everything).  She's one of those people who, even as someone with social anxiety, was one who I instantly connected with, which happens so rarely.  To have her back in my life is going to be such a huge improvement and I'm looking forward to hanging out.  

Now I just need to reconnect with three other friends.  They're online, but we've talked for going on 7 years now.  The fact that I've never met them in person has never hindered the friendship.  This will be easier said than done because one is moving to Japan for intensive teaching work, the other started an internship, and the third just finished school, too.  They've all met up before during the time when I was whittling away my time alone and it kind of hurts.  Not that they should have not met up because of me, but I just wish I was able to join them.  The three seem to have gotten a great deal closer as a result and I'm kind of stuck in a self-imposed purgatory of sorts, slowing falling away from the group.  I just hope they'll accept me back or be willing to have a friendship as close as it was before.  If they didn't, I wouldn't blame them.  For the past two or so years I've let them down a lot and been really flakey, disappearing for months on end without a word.  Each time they accepted me back with open arms and words of encouragement, but it has to be emotionally draining, having me come in and out of their lives like I do.  Maybe this summer will be the start of that cycle breaking. Hopefully.

Next, I have an initial job interview tomorrow morning.  I've been applying for many jobs since I turned 16, like the usual places - fast food restaurants, stores, etc. which allow you to reapply every 6 months, as well as whatever other positions come up on craigslist and local job posting sites.  

In that time, I've only ever received 3 callbacks for interviews - including this one - and got hired for one temporary holiday position at minimum wage.  Even better, this job is a decent bit more than minimum wage, too at $11/hour.  Still not fantastic, but pretty good for an entry position not requiring a degree or certification in something, yeah?  Especially if I can manage to keep the job for an extended period.  I'm really worried about doing something to mess it up, like calling off too much.  Sometimes I think I'm better off not setting myself up for the disappointment of not being hired or being hired and then fired soon after for something stupid on my part.  

But still, a job interview after so long.  It feels great!  Especially since money = saving up for dental, for the life experiences I crave (travel, even just actually getting to dine out or go to amusement parks, etc.), getting back to school, paying off debts, and saving up to maybe finally get my own place.  Those things definitely stress me out a great deal and contribute to my down periods, so the possibility of being able to do more about them with a paycheck is awesome.

And on an even more personal front, hygiene things are improved, too! Definitely a victory there lol  My teeth have always been particularly bad and because of reliance on soda are pretty awful.  Not quite looking like meth mouth but similar.  It's always something that has made me feel terrible but I've been two months without soda now and brush/floss twice a day. Even though taking care of them now isn't going to bring back my missing teeth (and there are a lot or undo decay (...and there is a lot), it makes me feel better to know I'm taking care of the teeth I have left, however belatedly.  Hopefully that cheer keep up even as I stress out about saving up to eventually get full arch bridges. I'll likely be in complete dentures before I'm 30, maybe even 25 (I did say they're pretty awful) and my one hope dental-wise is to get the bridges implanted someday before I lose too much jaw bone. For now, though, it feels good to take care of them.

Also: a so-far-successful summer garden, getting back to other little bits of self-improvement like language-learning and such, finally making a new gyno appointment to work on my ovarian cysts/lack of menstruation/fertility, and eating healthier/less.  The latter is especially nice considering how much I've abused my body over the years with my weight and unhealthy diet.  I was even recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes because of it all so that definitely kicked me into gear.  It really made me realize that I wasn't just passively damage my body through neglect or indifference, but actively destroying it, which made all the difference for getting me to do better.  

These things seem so small/simple, especially compared to those who seem ""normal"" but it's done so much for introducing positives in my life the past month+.

Thanks for reading if you've made it this far!"

I graduated as a double major in economics and psychology from a prestigious four-year college.  I finished with a 3.5 GPA and a certificate in financial policy as well.  I believe I have learned a ton of valuable information at my college but unfortunately I realized too late that my passion is in the field of environmental engineering.  I know most of my classes have no weight toward a degree in engineering, but I really want to pursue this field.  I understand I am behind the 8-ball here, but I am only 22 and would rather switch now than in 10 years when I'm hating my job on Wall Street.  I am a smart individual and a hard worker.  I am 100% committed to making this change, I just do not know exactly where to start.  I come from a poor family and I was fortunate to earn scholarships for my initial bachelor's degree, giving me an opportunity I would not have had.  I can't afford to go right back to school as an engineer.  Many of the opportunities I have been thinking about are:

1. Getting hired by an engineering company with the assets I currently have.  I would work in the field they want me, such as human resources or finance.  While working in this field I would take night classes in the engineering field they specialized in.  It would be difficult but I am committed to working hard to achieve my dream (one I wish I had when I started college...). When I obtain enough credits for a Bachelor's/Master's, I would attempt to move over into the engineering division of their company.  They will have gotten to know me and see how hard of a worker I am in my current field that I'd hope the would give me the opportunity to switch.


2. I could obtain an internship in the engineering industry, even if it were unpaid.  I could have an internship M-F and work the weekends to pay for travel expenses.  I would explain to them my situation in my cover letter and hope they take a chance on me.  I would learn from the engineers in the company and hopefully they would help point me in the right direction with what to learn, how to better myself to employers, and ultimately how to enter the environmental engineering field.


3. Get an unrelated job and take classes at night to obtain a Master's in Environmental Engineering.  This path scares me only because if it is 4-5 years of unrelated experience I am falling way behind.  At least in scenario 1, the company will be getting to know me.  I would also be paying for my classes which could be expensive for a young graduate like myself who probably will not be making much as it is.  I am also afraid the opportunity cost of leaving an industry in which I will have climbed the ladder for 5 years might be too much of a risk to give up, making me drop my dream of environmental engineering.


4. I could go back to the school I recently graduated from (which specializes in engineering) and attempt to work with them, seeing if they would give me the opportunity to become an environmental engineer, since I have already completed all of the liberal arts requirements. This will also be difficult because it would be at least 3 years of study and would put me deep in debt that I have miraculously avoided so far.


5. Teach the advanced math to myself through online resources, and find as many free engineering courses/textbooks that I can online to learn all of the required material. Earn certificates from coursera that won't benefit my resume but may at least show proof of how I'm working toward engineering.  I could then pass all of the tests required of me, but I still won't have the degree.  Therefore, employers would still be taking a big risk on me.


Currently, I am working a job three days a week that is not particularly beneficial to my resume..  I have been applying to many jobs and have been looking for internships in engineering, hoping the .001% chance they take a chance on me works out.  I am a resilient person who tends to not stress out too much; however I am freaking out everyday because I believe I am at a dead end.  I want this career path so badly, but I am afraid there will be nothing for me and I will be forced into a job I will be unhappy with for the rest of my life.  I want to better society, and sustainability is how I believe I can help.  Thank you all so much for your help, any advice or opportunities you might have for me will be greatly appreciated.  I am sorry for taking up a post with an emotional rambling about myself, I promise I will be more constructive and helpful to everyone in future posts."

I'm a college intern at the Nike World Headquarters this summer, and have been given the project of doing research on the high intensity trainer athlete. I've visited multiple gyms around the area and talked to coaches and athletes, but wanted to extend my research outside of my region. 

I want to learn about what kind of gear (shoes, shorts, shirts, anything) you like, don't like, what is missing from the market, etc.

I will then do a comprehensive presentation to my superiors in the Athletic Training department on what all you guys want to see out of Nike.

Feel free to post any thoughts on:
What brands you like, and why.
Your age, gender, and how often you work out. 
What motivates/inspires you to do CrossFit. 
Where you shop. 
What types of product, (as specific as you can get) you would like to see out of Nike. 

Any comments you can give me would be awesome, and it will definitely go to some eager ears here at Nike. 

Thank you!

Edit: Thanks everyone, this is really great input. I will put all this stuff into my report, along with the information I've gotten from local gyms. You guys have a great community. "

* I've talked to some ""developer evangelists"" at Twitter, Twilio, and Mozilla and have arranged for tours/information sessions on each. I figured this was a good way to get info on the company as well as potentially find some contacts to network with. 

* Facebook Group: ""2014 Bay Area Summer Interns"" (the group is closed now, but you might be able to request access? https://facebook.com/groups/1378139645766413) I know there is a sister Facebook Group for Seattle interns, too. There are likely ones for NYC or other large metro areas.

28b8op,1,2014-06-16,Business fraud?,itsmejoshuaD,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/28b8op/business_fraud/,"A friend and myself had a blog started and it started to get bigger. A friend of that first friend who also wrote on the blog started helping us out in the PR dept. Let's call him S.

S was in NYC and was left an inheritance from his mother after she passed as well as her company. S said he would half her office up and provide us an office headquarters for when we were up there. everything seemed too good to be true, and it was. 

When we ""hired"" interns, we found out none of their numbers worked. S handled the hiring and we trusted him too much. Several other red flags went up causing us to make this post. We allegedly received money from advertisers that S made an account for-an account that does not have mine or my friend's signature. Keep in mind, my friend and i are about 800 miles away from NYC. 

We're worried he is feeding us stories and excuses all while pocketing the money. We do not want our blog tarnished nor do we want to go down for fraud with him. 

Can anyone help?"

28bcb4,2,2014-06-16,Can I get into good CS PhD programs without a CS degree?,Sekrim,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/28bcb4/can_i_get_into_good_cs_phd_programs_without_a_cs/,"I'm currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering/Math double major at UT Austin. I just finished my first year here with a 3.97 GPA. I wanted to major in CS, but didn't get into the CS program. I always planned on going on to graduate school to get a CS PhD in AI (ML and Computer Vision stuff). But I also wanted to go to a really good graduate school like Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech, Princeton, MIT, Carnegie, Michigan, Texas, etc.

Would I be overlooked because I don't have a CS degree at these grad programs? Also as a side note, how difficult would it be to get internships at places like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, NASA JPL, SpaceX as a software developer in the majors I'm in? Those are kind of my dream jobs, so I'm hoping I can land an internship next summer. After grad school, I'd love to be a research scientist at any one of those places."

If you could donate any amount, however big or small, that would very much be appreciated! 

I've set up a GoFundMe page and here is the link http://www.gofundme.com/acexp4 
There is a video embedded in the page that has full details about everything and a break down of the costs :)

This is an experience of a lifetime and I really want to be able to go! Thanks!!!

28bfxo,1,2014-06-16,Me 21M having jealousy issues with 20F girlfriend of a few months,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28bfxo/me_21m_having_jealousy_issues_with_20f_girlfriend/,"I have been dating a girl for the last few months and it has been great. But I have started to get really jealous of someone she works with and it is starting to sour the relationship. She has started to hang out with a new employee at her work this last month who is this handsome, cocky, frat, football player.

She tells me about how she started talking to him, how they eat lunch together, he gives her rides, and he texts her throughout the day. Eventually she could tell I wasn't as happy around her as I normally am and she asked what I was upset about. I told her I felt that her and the intern had a thing for eachother and she said something along the lines of ""He wishes, he is not my type at all. We are just assholes to eachother all the time. You have nothing to worry about babe.""

But to me mutual assholeness is just flirting. And I am still not comfortable with it at all. It has put me in a really bad mood day to day to the point where I am realizing this relationship is no longer making me happy, but instead making me really depressed. I really like the girl, but I don't know how to bring it up again without being a controlling asshole that I don't want to be. So I don't know if I should break it off, or bring it up more, or just suck it up and try to ignore it the best I can.

Any advice is appreciated.

TL:DR GF has been hanging out with guy I am jealous of, don't know how to handle it."

28bk3e,1,2014-06-16,What looks better on a resume: 18 month internship at a company or 12 month internship + 5 months full time at 2 different companies?,BigPlasticSubmarine,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28bk3e/what_looks_better_on_a_resume_18_month_internship/,"Hey guys, I have a question regarding the best path to follow during the next few months.

I've been working as an intern in Brazil at a pretty prestigious company for about a year now and they have shown interest in hiring me. In August, I'll be eligible to graduate and complete my B.Sc. in Computer Science. However, the company wants to extend my internship contract, from anywhere between 2 to 6 months, before they offer me a job. In order for me to continue as an intern, I would have to not graduate until December and take another elective. 

This wouldn't be a big issue for me if I planned to stay in the company, but my plans are to move to Spain in January. From the point of view of a Spanish employer, what would look better on a resume:

* A 18 month internship at a prestigious company
* A 12 month internship at a prestigious company + ~5 months as a full time employee at another company (I would have to look for one).

I must say that I feel a little under appreciated as an intern because I do the same job as full time employees. On the other hand I also really enjoy what I do and the people I work with. Thanks guys."
28blbj,5,2014-06-16,"Recent Accident, Old Car",[deleted],askcarsales,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/28blbj/recent_accident_old_car/,"I purchased my car in 2010 for $2500. It's a 2000 Buick Century. I've been thinking about getting a new car and I was recently hit from behind.

It will cost me $200 to fix, with an additional $2000, approximately, from the insurance company. 

If I were to pocket the money from the insurance, how much could I get for a damaged car(bumper and trunk), with no mechanical problems, selling it to a dealer, presumably for parts.

Would it be worth it to just fix it? I'm leaning that way, because I'm in college and used cars are currently too expensive in my area. I'd have to buy new.

However, I might end up buying a new car next year anyway, in January/December, as I'll hopefully be traveling for an internship, and my parents don't want me driving such an old car.

So I'm torn. On the one hand, I like the car just fine. But it may not make financial sense.

Any opinions?"

There are no development companies here. Nowhere to intern at. No summer coding events. Few, if any, other coders in the area, and I haven't come up with a way to meet said people. 

I'd like to get a job as an entry level coder. Ideally, I'd like to move out of this area and go somewhere else. I've taken the intro to Computer Science courses at a university (studied Java, got a very basic introduction to object oriented programming and using generics). Right now I'm learning more out of a book, and I've been considering the Java Associate Certification test. I'm at about the level, not an accomplished programmer by any means. But I have some skills. 

When I search for programming jobs, I find places that are looking for Sr. level programmers who have masters and bachelors in computer science. Where do I find the illusive jobs that I keep hearing about that hires programmers without said degree? Where can I find a remote internship so I can keep working my minimum wage job, and learn how to work in the industry? 

I have an application that I wrote recently, I like it very much and I'd like to get some feedback on it. I'd like to show it off, and find out if it's something I can leverage into a job. What is the best place to do that?

I am 25 years old and I had my T levels checked after a family friend with back problems suggested it. Lately, I have been completely EXHAUSTED. By lately, I mean the last six months. I have had no energy, and I feel like I am taking my Adderall just to stay awake - seriously. Yesterday, my family rented a pontoon boat and I slept through the last 30 minutes of the boat ride and felt like an asshole. I just keep falling asleep at inopportune times.

My T level was 323 out of a 300-1080 normal range. For age 25, this is definitely a very low level. They have a wide assortment of treatment options and all of them have their positives and negatives. Everyday I feel like this:
- Exhausted
- No sex drive... haven't banged my gf in two weeks and she is very attractive.
- Very hard to get out of bed - no drive. 


I am seeing him soon. I worry that I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome from all the stuff that happened this year. In the last 8 months, I have had:


-Learned that I have 3 bulging discs in my neck to accompany my already 3 ruptured discs in my low back.


-Had a crazy chick from the startup I consulted then resigned from since they were going under. They wouldn't listen to my advice and needed an adult. After two attempts at getting the money I put in from them taking money out each month (unemployment tax, and the 3 other taxes) she filed me as independent contractor but made me come to work every day and it was torture on my neck and low back. I got the bulging discs from this bitch trying to have me fired then the owners telling her no. She hated me because I was the only one there who has sold 3 companies, all web based. Anyway, I resigned from a $100k job because it was causing so much pain and depression. I ended up paying another guys salary but when my accountant mentioned that I would consult an attorney unless she didn't stop employment fraud, she filed for a restraining order against me. I had a mandatory court appearance and in WI the judge cannot throw these cases out, he has to see me regardless of how bogus it is. She did it to defame me and lost quickly. My lawyer said in 25 years, he's never had to not say a single word in court. The judge literally kicked her out. Regardless, it's on my record that someone filed for it and it kept me from getting a new condo I hat my heart set on. 


- Started from scratch on two domains I owned. In 2 months I had them making $15,000 after expenses a month. After 3 months, $36,4000 in December. 


- Cyber terrorism group from Morocco stole my site files and emptied my bank accounts, stealing my identity. They did this in the beginning of March, around the 12th. They deleted my site files (after it was making $2k a day with 2 sites) and held them for ransom in return for $250k cash  from my ""rich american parents"" and they had also drained every bank account I had for myself and my parents.


- My best friend quit after he found out that I saw he'd never written a single site article or spent time with the interns (what I paid him $4k a month to do). I was so upset and insulted... that sucked. The next day I was going to be issuing him equity... glad I looked hard.


- Programmer my girlfriend recommended, a close friend of hers, didn't finish the job and fucked me with the 1/2 upfront ($2k) I gave him.


- Last week thursday I launched my sites again. 340% ROI - woo!

- Today I finished finally closing all the credit card and Paypal ""Pay Me Later"" type accounts he opened.


- Collected $68,000 from just 1 1/2 months of having my site live. 


So I think I'm burned out, literally. I spent so many all-nighters in first getting the business going the FIRST time, then again the SECOND time. I had 4 people I thought were good business associates turn into dirtbags. I think the stress + my pain = Low T and chronic exhaustion syndrome.


Lastly, my doctor has me on 15mg oxycodone IR. It hasn't been working much anymore since he has me on a Fenatyl 100mcg patch. He told me to look for alternatives. I have 120 of them a month but don't use them all since they barely work / change the way I feel. My family (grandma) had a history of needing higher powered pain meds and having high tolerance to them. The first time I took Vicodin, I couldn't feel it at all and subsquently gave it all to my neigbhor in her 40's. I was too young an naive to know she had a drug problem.


As of late I have just been exhausted and in lots of pain. "

I was wondering if you could provide your opinion on the letter below. I am going to start looking for an internship / Co - Op for the Fall of 2014 soon so I have made a letter to send out to recruiters in order to spark their initial interest in me and my resume. This letter will likely be sent over LinkedIn and email as I have a lot of recruiters in my network. If you have the chance, can you please provide me with feedback to the letter below?

Thank you very much!





Hello (Name),

I am very interested in pursuing an internship / Co - Op opportunity with (company name) for the Fall of 2014. Currently, I am working a full - time internship as a summer software engineering intern at Raytheon and with a start-up called Fee Catcher during nights and weekends. As a software development intern, I have built many complex projects in Java, Scala, Python and C/C++. Along with my professional work, I have a couple cool side projects I am building in Python and Java!
 

Outside of programming, I have founded my college’s Black Male Leadership Initiative in order to empower black males to be mentors and examples for the youths in our community. I also took the initiative to create and lead a volunteering team to the Children’s Shelter. While I love my hands on experience, technology is my key to have a more significant impact on people’s lives. 

I look forward to hearing back from you in order to explore opportunities with (company name) and to further discuss my qualifications and diverse background. Please provide me with an email address if you would like to see my resume and more information.

Thanks for your time,"
28byzw,10,2014-06-16,Should I quit this internship?,QuittingAdvice12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28byzw/should_i_quit_this_internship/,"Quick Background:
-Computer Science major
-Starting my senior year of undergraduate in August

So I started my first internship about two weeks ago and since I started I wanted to quit because:
-Incredibly boring
-Not teaching me anything useful/technical (unless you consider Microsoft Office technical...)
-Very time consuming since it's full time plus there is 2 hour commute both ways

When I applied for the internship, I was hoping it would be more technical, but literally the most technical skill that I have used are Excel spreadsheet formulas (and they were simple at that).

After working two weeks, these feelings have only become instilled more. Additionally, my boss/supervisor is not in the almost half of the week (based on the calendar, this will be the case for the coming months as well) so communication is strained and makes it more difficult for me to find things to do.

For instance, today, for my entire 8 hour shift, the only thing that I did was print/staple a few packets for a meeting tomorrow. (It isn't like I am avoiding work either, I even him if there is anything else that I can do).

I posted this on another subreddit a while back (after the first day that I started) and most people scolded me and said I am naive for wanting to quit, but I see very few benefits to this internship.

Here are the *only* good things about the internship:
-Pay is actually pretty good
-It's my only internship I ever had, so if I quit, I won't have an internship on my resume (which would probably look bad)

However, as I said, it is incredibly time consuming and it's until I start back school in August so it's wasting most of my summer. I should mention that I have been developing/learning more about Android Development (I already have a decent foundation) but it's difficult to find the time to develop/learn more when I have to wake up before 4:30 AM and get home at after 6:00 PM every weekday (I work 8-4, but bus commute sucks). If I quit this job, I will most likely devote most of my time to Android Development since I love it and I believe that it is something that I want to learn as much as I can. I have even started trying to reading more about it during the bus rides to save some wasted time, but it is still not working out. (I have just started an app or two on the side, but it's difficult to find the time to work on much).

Sorry for the long rant, but here is what I would like do know:

Based on my experience, does quitting seem like a good idea? (bear in mind, if I quit, I will dedicate my free time to learning/working on applications, which is a multitude more relevant than anything this internship will provide)

How detrimental is it to not have an internship as a Computer Science undergraduate, which respect to jobs after graduation?

On another note, obviously this internship is in IT, but it is not at all related to anything that I would like to do (probably application/software development), so could it be argued that this internship would look bad if I apply for unrelated jobs (like it would imply that I don't know what I want to do?)?

If I do quit, how should I go about quitting, does it defer from a job since an internship is short-term?

28c29t,0,2014-06-16,Some musings on why I think the scramble keypad for two-factor authentication gives no additional security over simply using the keyboard to type in the code.,ethidium_,WildStar,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/28c29t/some_musings_on_why_i_think_the_scramble_keypad/,"I wanted to weigh in on the subject of account security with authenticators, and the particular implementation that Carbine has chosen. I welcome my fellow redditors to point out flaws in my analysis.

I think that securing your account with an authenticator is an absolut must, in addition to other common sense security measures, like setting up a unique email account for each game, securing those with 2-factor authentication as well, and in general a sensible password policy; this has been covered extensively, both in threads here as well as in external advisories (see e.g. Carbine’s recent [post](https://forums.wildstar-online.com/forums/index.php?/topic/77290-account-compromise-and-re-securing-your-account/), ArenaNet’s [suggestions](https://help.guildwars2.com/entries/66122673-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Security) for GW2, or this [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/936/) ).

I believe, however, that the scramble keypad presented as the 2-factor authentication interface is not adding anything to security over manually typing in numbers from your keyboard, but *is* apparently of enough annoyance that many players will simply choose to not use their authenticator at all (gathered from several discussion threads on this subreddit).

To see why, imagine a setup that I would consider fairly secure: A separate gmail address is used exclusively for Wildstar’s account, protected with Google’s two-factor authentication, and its password is strong and not used anywhere else. Again, this email address is not employed for any other Wildstar related sites. Let us also imagine for a second that Wildstar’s authenticator input works like that in gmail, GW2, WoW and plenty of other sites, namely you just punch in your n-digits with your keyboard.

Now imagine that you catch a key logger on your system. While that is probably no going to happen to the majority of users, let us assume it here anyways, because apparently Carbine considers it a real threat. However, a simple collecting key logger won't be of any use: just logging the one-time passwords gives no advantage (as explained [here](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42671/is-oath-totp-and-or-google-authenticator-vulnerable-if-an-attacker-has-n-pre) ), this key logger would have to be extra devious and actually transmit the one-time password to the attacker, who then would have to hack the account before the next time-step (actually, I don’t even see how that could be done, but I am sure some redditors can speculate).

But why bother. This key logger can do so much more damage - it is logging all of your activities after all. Think email logins, e-banking, etc. And apart from the fact that an attacker would probably care very little about a puny Wildstar account at that point, he could still just get to that via the compromised game email.

My conjecture is thus that - as already mentioned above - having users enter their authentication code with a scramble keypad gives no additional security, but apparently plenty of additional irritation for the impatient types.

Finally, your system is only as secure as its weakest part. So if you have a less secure setup than described above, e.g. shared email between Wildstar’s account and other sites, or even using your primary email, or no 2-factor authentication on your email, or weak passwords, or shared passwords, than there is even less reason to have a scramble keypad.

Please note that this post is not a recommendation or opinion on how to secure your system or how to choose your passwords. It is simply my reasoning why it is perfectly safe for Carbine to just allow keyboard entries for the two-factor authentication, without conceding any security. 

On the lighter side, maybe 90% of the reason they added the scramble keypad is because it is fancy and geeky (perhaps a cute intern project), and only 10% because somebody thought (perhaps of pointy-haired inclination) it would make authentication more secure.

What non-obvious things should I plan on doing in order to have a decent shot at a CS Masters program? Many of the tips seemed to have dealt exclusively with PhD programs, and emphasized research. Would this be as important for a Masters program at an institution like Stanford?

As for undergraduate research, when should I begin looking for on-campus research projects? Would it be more advantageous to do research at another institution during the summer? Does the research I work on have to be particularly notable (as in, outside press attention) for me to be a decent shot at especially selective graduate programs?

Additionally, would doing internships and co-ops still be advisable, or would the time/effort be best concentrated in research? I still want to keep the option of working in industry open, in case I change my mind at the last minute. 

Lastly, how could I minimize the ""damage"" of going to a not-terribly-well-ranked institution? I doubt it makes a considerable impact on my application, but its always possible.  

I'm already planning on taking steps to maintain a decent GPA, and obtain a decent GRE score.

28cijf,0,2014-06-17,Online engineering school?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/28cijf/online_engineering_school/,"I work for starbucks, and recently they announced that they are going to start providing their employees with free tuition to Arizona State University **online**. This includes around 40 degree plans to choose from apparently, with only two of them being engineering related (EE, and software engineering). Ideally I would like to major in CompE, but if my tuition was 100% paid for, i'm sure EE or SE would suffice. 

I have about four classes left of community college/basics (diff eq, linear algebra, literature, chemistry if my uni requires it) before I decide which university to transfer to. 

There's been tons of positive things said about starbucks doing this, but my initial reaction was ""i don't want to have to finish my upper level courses online, that sounds awful"". I've taken two online courses before and my personal experience was that it kinda sucked. I like hearing someone talk about the material, and I enjoy having the option of going by office hours in person to talk to the professor to sort out issues, not to mention the friends and study groups that you get to benefit from taking classes IRL. 

I also feel like some of the upper level engineering courses will require labs/projects and other things that I'm not confident an online BS degree would cover successfully. I also feel like I would miss out on job fairs and internship opportunities by doing all of my college online.

What do you guys think?

28cjp0,3,2014-06-17,Advice for first break-up,[deleted],lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/28cjp0/advice_for_first_breakup/,"Hey reddit :) I've never posted anything on here and, to be honest, I've never even bodered to read any kind of this personal stories. So, if anyone is so kind to give some advice I would be infintely greatful. I don't know if this is relevant and I think it shouldn't, but just so you know I'm a gay 19-years-old guy. So if anyone straight can give me advice too it would be great too, just so you know. I will try to make the story as short as I can.

So it all goes back 2 years ago when I was studying abroad in Oxford, England, I'm mexican by the way. I met this guy over grindr from Chile, and we spent pretty much 2 months just talking and haging around. It was great that we both spoke spanish, and we talked about a lot about pretty much everything, specially about the whole being gay thing, since I was still struggling to come out at the time. I slowly fell in love with him as I saw he was a really nice and sensitive person, and had a really noble heart. On our last day in Oxford we had a really romatic night walking there for the last time, I confessed that I really liked him, we kissed and held hands for hours under the stars in the bench of a park. It was really something out of a romantic movie.

Over the next months, in our respective countries, we would spend up to 4 hours talking and laughing throght skype every couple of days and discussing if maybe I would ever go see him. I applied for an internship in Chile for a month in summer (so I had an excuse for my parents to finance the trip),  which was very unlikely that I got it since I was still in my first year in college. I managed to get it and, over the next weeks, we kept talking, very expectant of my visit to Chile. I was really anxious to see him, and to be honest it was all I could think of. I even discussed with him, just to be sure, that we would not just be seeing each other as ""just friends"" during that time.

I finally got here two weeks ago. At the begining it was very nice, we went out very often, had sex (my first time), and did everything pretty much as if we where a couple. I was very very happy, maybe the best I had been in all my life, but just one week ago he told me he didn't feel anything for me beyond being friends. I asked him if he had met someone, or if he didn't like something about me, but he told me it was just that, he dindn't feel anything inside.

I know it might look stupid since I'm leaving soon anyway, but I was devasted by what he said. I can't seem to get together how I was going to have the best month of my live and now I'm suffering like never before. I remember how I had been so expectant for months to be here, and we have talked so much and so many times and now he just cut it on me just a week in. He has been nice to me at least, since then he has gone out with me just so I'm not alone. And this also bothers me, I started looking at grindr again and I can't just imagine finding another guy as nice, gentle and with such a good hearth as him.

Anyway I'm extremly depressed. I really love him with all my hearth, and I've cried myself to sleep everyday just thinking about him, about how I was so expectant and so happy, for just a little while. It really haunts me that I will never sleep with him again or kiss or even hold his hand, and I just wonder every second of the day if I could have done something different or if I could do something right now to get him back (which I'm scared to do too because I'm afraid it will screw up even our friendship)

My question is, how do I get over it? I can't handle being here, in the same city as he is, maybe for the last time ever,  and knowing I can't even hold his hand or kiss him. I can't be next to him knowing this. I get really angry knowing I came all the way here to see him and that he wouldn't even try keeping it on for more than the 5 days we hung out as a coupole. And lastly, I can't contain the hope that, maybe, I will do something to get him back. Again, I know this whole story will sound silly to many because of the short time. But right know I just can't sleep, I cry everynight, I hit the walls with all my streghth out of anger, and it has been a living hell what was supposed to be a month of being with the person I love  most in the world.

So, please, if anyone empathizes and has some advice, I would be really greatful to get it. I have seen, some around about being with your friends and the ones you love but, again, I don't know anyone here but him.

Thank you for reading :)"

Even though I'm taking several classes at Wharton and I have a BA in Computer Science, with minors in math, physics, and economics I am pretty nervous.

The main reason is that I am an international student , so I need to find a company willing to sponsor me with an OPT( Optional Practical Training). I have been sending applications for summer internships and I got rejected from several large and medium sized companies, so I definitely need to change my approach for my next applications.  I think my main issue is that I did my undergrad in a small liberal at school in Arkansas (Lyon College), which makes interviews a bit awkward when I try to explain how I ended up there, and what a big change it was to move to Philadelphia. 

I was thinking of applying to positions like systems analysts, quantitative analysts, programmer.

Bucking convention, you had shot off examples of your work and letters of recommendation to 3 of the most prestigious news papers in the country. A girl can dream can't she? It was a moment of suspense as you carefully opened the letter - and let out a joyous scream when you saw the news. It's not often a girl barely out of her freshman year  landed such a position and you were determined not to let it go to waste. 

You arrived with a mild degree of culture shock, landing in the large airport with your mind still adjusting to big city vs. the sleepy college town you just left. The work was your typical wage slave intern position: lot's of gopher and caddy work for the real journalist, lot's of research in the dungeon of the paper office and the vague promise that you might, MIGHT, be able to contribute on a minuscule piece. 

But that wasn't enough...you wanted to be the overachiever and prove you were more than just a flunky good for a coffee run. As you settled into the city you began throwing caution to the wind, eager to chase down a rumor or story wherever you could and hopefully land a prize winning by-line. And you did. In the seedier places you visited you began hearing of young girls taken off the street - runaways and prostitutes - tricked and coerced by the lure of money only to find themselves deep in a corrupt and horrific underground porn scene. 

And you got too close, prying a little too much. They found you, followed you and as you wind your way down the back alley looking for another lead, another rumor to follow you hear heavy footsteps behind you. Your world goes black as a sharp pain cascades through your head. 

You wake, the cold air hitting your skin hard as you realize you've been stripped bare. The metal chain bites hard into your wrists, holding you up so you can barely touch the ground. 

""You wanted to know about our little operation? How about a first hand look..."" a deep voice echoes from the shadows, sending shivers down your spine..."
28d4ke,8,2014-06-17,"We [me F, he M, both 27] both want to go travelling but our timescales and circumstances are totally different - how to resolve this?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28d4ke/we_me_f_he_m_both_27_both_want_to_go_travelling/,"We have long agreed that one of our big goals is to do a big travelling expedition together. It's a goal I've had since before meeting him, and is very important to me. But lots of things are now getting in the way and we can't agree a way forward.

The facts:

**1.	Urgency:** I have been wanting to do a big travelling trip for many years. I skipped the traditional pre-university gap year thinking I would do one after getting my degree, then I was offered a job straight after graduating and didn’t feel I could turn it down. I’ve worked constantly since then, dreaming of taking a year out and never having the courage to do so. Now I think I might have been wrong to postpone it for so long and feel I am running out of chances.

By contrast, my boyfriend took a gap year before university and did a lot of travelling while at university. He’s already been to places all over the world and doesn’t feel the same urgency. If this trip doesn’t ever happen, he has less to lose.

**2.	Career timing:** Having worked solidly since university, I have 5 years of good career experience and pension contributions under my belt, and feel able to take some time out to travel without worrying too much about finding work again afterward – in fact, I dream of going freelance and think that returning home unemployed could exactly be the push I need to try doing that. 

By contrast, my boyfriend was unemployed for over a year, did a few internships and ‘bitty’ pieces of work, and has only worked solidly in a salaried job for the last year and a half. He feels insecure about his career, wants to keep working now that he’s finally settled into a job, and worries about finding himself unemployed again.

**3.	Age:** I am very conscious that I’m already 27 and that the dreaded fertility deadline of age 35 is looming. I want to marry and have (maybe two?) children, and I feel that if I’m going to realise my dream of travelling I need to do so before starting this ‘settling down’ process – for both logistical and financial reasons. This is especially true if I want to try my hand at freelancing, because that will require me to be financially insecure for a while. How can I take on that instability while planning a wedding or becoming a mother? Therefore, realistically, I feel I do need to plan and execute my travelling within the next year or two. 

By contrast, my boyfriend – although we often talk about marriage and babies and he is emphatic that he wants to do those things with me – is much less conscious of biological deadlines, feels that all that stuff is still many years away and definitely does not intend to marry any time soon. This is perhaps another issue in itself, but as it relates to this immediate issue of travelling, it means he feels there is plenty of time yet to do it and we don’t need to rush.

**4.	Responsibility:** I am pretty much totally unencumbered by responsibilities to other people and could easily swan off for a few months without impacting upon anyone else. 

By contrast, my boyfriend’s father has health issues and relies on him to help out with certain tasks (although there are other family members nearby who should theoretically be able to help out more for a few months if he went away).

So, essentially, he and I are in different ‘places’ in many ways, and I can’t see how to resolve this disparity. 

One logical solution could be for me to go away on my own, with him just coming out to join me along the way for a week-long holiday once or twice. This would allow him to keep working and helping his dad, while still doing a bit of travelling with me. Meanwhile, it would allow me to get the big travelling experience I yearn for without feeling I’ve pushed him into anything. Also, I would arguably experience more personal growth from doing a bit of travelling alone instead of being with him the whole time (although it would almost certainly be more fun together and safety would be less of a worry). However, he doesn’t seem to like this idea because he says he does want to come with me for the whole thing. I also have concerns about whether this would be harmful to our relationship. After 5 years together things between us are very solid, but I wouldn’t like to make the mistake of thinking we’re invincible – surely such a long period apart would be difficult?

I'd be really grateful for any advice or shared experiences.

---   
**tl;dr**: I feel time is running out to achieve my/our dream of going travelling. He isn't ready and feels there's plenty of time. Both of us are frustrated. Don't know how to resolve this."

I never finished my degree, and have no certifications. In about a year, I will be needing to move and find a new job. My fiance will be starting a residency next July and I will be moving to where she is going. She is living long distance this year for an internship, and I am helping support her financially so that puts a pretty hard limit on the amount of money I can spend. What can I do in the next year to improve my chances of finding a well paying job wherever she ends up?"
28df2j,1,2014-06-17,Odd time of my life. Feeling defeated.,DJBlay,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/28df2j/odd_time_of_my_life_feeling_defeated/,"Hey GetMotivated!  I hope you are all doing well today.  I don't post here often but I do have something that is completely taking me surprise and I am feeling very defeated.  I've been planning a trip to Europe for the past 8 months.  That is going great, I'm going and it's going to be fun. As the stress rises before we leave because we have a handful of things we need to get done before we leave the country, I have a meeting with my boss.

Before I get to the meeting I would like to explain something I told my boss upon being hired.  I told him that I had a trip to go to Europe for 4-5 weeks in the Summer of 2014.  He said that it was okay and he would work with me.  I would also like to preemptively state that this is a paid internship that is part time while I'm taking classes, which I currently am.  


So back to the meeting.  My boss explains to me that my request for this extended leave cannot be approved and I have two choices.  

1.  Leave the company (resign) and go on my trip.


2. Stay and work.


OBVIOUSLY I'm going to go on my trip that I dropped about 2 grand on already.  This being forced to resign from my job has me feeling defeated.  Yes, I suppose it's my decision, and I'm dealing with it the best I can.


I also got some unfortunate news yesterday that 2 people I work with in the military got arrested for kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder, so I was a little out of sorts.


Then my brother told me that he made the decision to get married to a girl that he has been dating for 2 months and hasn't even met in real life yet.


I could just keep going on and on and on about the random crap that is piling on but it doesn't matter.   I'll end up writing it all down and then addressing my problems one at a time in an efficient manner.  


I was defeated yesterday.  Other than feeling great for the US win, all of this other crap gave me mixed feelings.  




This is such an unorganized post.  I'm just throwing it all out there.  This morning I woke up and mentally told myself this:

""Okay, DJBlay.  You had a rough day yesterday.  You're financial security is at stake.  You're living situation is at stake (Brother is roommate).  You're health is at stake.  

You took the time yesterday to absorb the situation.  It's there.  It's real.  It's not easy.  Don't trust anyone to help you through this situation.  You need to be proactive and search for the solutions and make them happen.

Start handling the situation now.  Your most important priority is to have a job when you get back from your trip.  Get on it.""

So far I've looked over my resume and I'm about to send it to others in the IT industry locally.  Now I have connections, so hopefully getting a job won't be too difficult.

The best possible situation would be I interview for a job before I leave on my trip, then start my job upon my arrival back to the states.  That's my goal.  That's what I'm going to do.

World 1-1.  I'm fuckin' ready."

[What was your favourite moment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9t9ro?context=5)|This is hands down my favorite moment and will stay with me the rest of my life. My first day was an old man's last day. I was told that I needed to help him pack up his boxes. No idea who this guy was. I was told he did the music. As I'm packing up his boxes (Literally took from 10 am to about 4 oclock non stop with no lunch), I learned everything about this man's life. He gave me lessons on ""How to not give a ***"" and ""Enjoy life"". This man was an intense Brooklyn 80 year old man. He really did feel like Carl from Up. As I was going through the boxes. I found a script for ""Follow That Bird"" with some notes on it. The handwriting was very scratchy. I asked whose notes were they. He says ""Oh, those are Steven's."" Then it dawned on me. I'm holding in my hands the notes of my favorite director of all time, Steven Spielberg. Soon, I learned this man was the creator of my favorite animated movies growing up. His name was Tony Geiss and he was the creator of ""An American Tail"", ""The Land Before Time"", and ""Fievel Goes West"". He also wrote all of the Sesame Street movies in the 80s and 90s. He gave me this script and told me to follow my dreams. This old man truly inspired me and changed my life that day. He told me a couple conversations that him and Steven had and apparently they were close but then age happened. He also told me that he never had any children with his wife. They weren't able to have children but they had no regrets. Both of them entertained and wrote the music for Sesame Street for most of the show and viewed every child viewer as one of there own. His wife died earlier that year. He also wrote ""Don't eat the pictures"" which was a favorite child hood tune of mine. Sadly the day ran out and he had to leave. Nobody really made a big fuss of him leaving and retiring. This saddened me. Tony died a few months later and I don't think a lot of people went to his funeral. He made such a huge impact on my life. I hope to one day ask Steven about Tony. 
[I wonder what happened to all his stuff.  Surely some of it would be of interest to a Smithsonian style museum or performing arts school collection. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9wvys?context=5)|Completely agree. I've tried finding more information on this guy over the years. But I can't find anything but books he's written.
 |[Link to www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/arts/television/31geiss.html?_r=) ^^ Here is his obit. Such a long great career.
 |I just remembered another favorite moment of mine. It doesn't top the story with Tony but I would always sneak onto the roof just before the day was over. The view from Kaufmann Studios was a breathtaking view of the city. Almost always before the end of my day, I would watch the sunset. I had this feeling of ""I made it"" and it was one of the best feelings in the world. 
[WE NEED PICTURES.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ciakiiq?context=5)|I will gladly take some pictures of the script if you would like to see them. The script is in a box in my garage of personal stuff. I'll try and open the box this weekend some time for you all. It's not the full script, just the first 10 or 15 pages. He didn't have the rest of the script for some reason. 
[How is Elmo off set? Is he really as humorous as he is on TV? What is Cookie Monster's favorite cookie brand? Is Oscar really a grouch or is it just for the cameras? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ciam9yx?context=5)|I know there are a lot of rumors about Kevin Clash. From what I saw at work, he was nothing like the way the media played him out to be. I never saw anything that was remotely like that. During my time there, he was as professional and wonderful as the others. I was really sad when I heard he quit Sesame Street because of these allegations. I really hope all of that isn't true but I'll never know. He was very funny on set and would charm everybody with his humor.
 |Cookie Monster's favorite brand is Cookies. That's what was on the prop department in Hooper's store!
 |Oscar is a grouch. The actor, Caroll Spinney, is not. 
[HI!I seriously hope you had a great experience- I work for a PBS Station and joke ""Big Bird is my boss!"" Public Broadcasting and Sesame Street are basically the antithesis of the Cable Companies.  Congrats on a great opportunity, how did you dovetail with your studies and what you're doing now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9vi7y?context=5)|I really did have a wonderful experience! If I could work for PBS or Sesame Street again, I would be extremely grateful. That semester of college was probably my hardest semester. I was taking 18 credits along with my internship so I never had any free time. The experience taught me how to perform well under pressure and it also taught me how to be a better writer. The writers that I worked with were simply wonderful. Currently, I work for the department of defense making army training videos for soldiers. It's definitely fulfilling and I do feel like I make a difference with the videos that complement there training. That's so cool you work for a PBS Station. How do you like your experience?
[Also, which is your favorite character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9spaa?context=5)|I worked on the 41st season. Every day I worked usually had somebody famous. We were told we can never interact with them sadly. I did see Jude Law (who is incredibly shorter than I've ever imagined). I did have a bad run-in with Ryan Reynolds. He wasn't very nice and didn't seem happy to be there. My favorite characters are Big Bird, Gordon, and Super Grover!
[Grover4life.  Sucks that you can't talk to the celebrities.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9szbo?context=5)|Not really. I understood that you needed to be professional around them so it didn't bother me much. My Ryan Reynolds experience completely killed my mood for meeting celebrities tho. There is one long hallway from the dressing rooms to the set. I was running some errand for somebody. Ryan Reynolds is at one end and I am at the other. It's a long hallway with no other doors so neither of us can escape running into each other. So as we walked passed, I nodded and said ""Enjoy the day and Good Luck!"". He gave a ""PFT"" and completely ignored me. Ever since then, he has not had a good movie. Kharma is a great thing. 
[He does seem like the person to do that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9t891?context=5)|I wasn't even trying to talk to him! He seriously hasn't made a good movie since! And Green Lantern was one of my favorite superheroes at the time! And he ruined that for me too!
[Don't feel bad. Apparently, Ryan Reynolds has a history of being rude to people. A quick google search can confirm that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cibhljl?context=5)|Yeah, I just wish he was nicer. I don't feel bad at all. Like I said, no good movies since I saw him!
[How weird is it to get a behind-the-scenes look at something that is so iconic? Anything really surprise you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sstg?context=5)|It was really bizarre. I would spend any chance I had on the set. Whenever I had downtime, I would immediately go down to the set and just watch them do takes. I learned so much from everybody involved! It really surprised me how the puppeteers stayed in character most of the time (even when talking to the directors). A whole episode would take a whole day to shoot so that surprised me how fast they would be. Also, I never realized how often they put out military specials for military families. So so cool.
[What was your last day working there like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9u7ma?context=5)|I was really upset my last day. I had my college formal that night so I had to leave early. There was a wrap party that I couldn't go to and I really regret not going to it. They gave me a gift basket (baby books, stuffed animals, an alarm clark) and a couple on screen props which was really nice. I loved working for the writing department and that was the nicest surprise when I was leaving. 
[What do you want to do after your internship is over? What career are you looking at? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9tdzu?context=5)|Currently, I make army training videos for the government. I have a wonderful girlfriend who means the world to me (no, that's not career related but felt like sharing that). I like my job a lot but I really really want to get back into television in some capacity. It's just too hard and none of my contacts have panned out. I'm still trying tho and not giving up!
[Whats Grover like in person? I heard he is a real fun guy to hang around with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ciab3p5?context=5)|Grover has had a lot of performers over the years. I think when I worked there, Grover was a ""she"". She's was a wonderful older woman who was really sweet and caring. There was a 40th Anniversary celebration and I briefly saw her interacting with children on the streets of NYC. She was very nice and I hope she still performs as Grover.
[Did you get tickled by Elmo?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9t0k1?context=5)|I had a very awkward encounter with Elmo on my first day. I was walking into the bathroom and out comes Kevin Clash (who I bump into) and he goes ""EXCUSE ME"" in the Elmo voice. Completely shattered my childhood. Had no idea Elmo was a big black man (not being racist, it just really surprised me)
[When I saw him on the Netflix doc it totally threw me for a loop too.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9vami?context=5)|Right!
[Was the season you worked before or after the randoms from dating websites created that whole controversy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9wss2?context=5)|Before.
[Was he creepy on set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9umfn?context=5)|Not at all. He was really friendly and outgoing! 
[Who was your favorite actor on the set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ciaiv45?context=5)|Caroll Spinney, Roscoe Orman, Bob McGrath, and Alan Muraoka. All of them were super friendly and out going. Watching any of them work was unbelievable. Caroll hones into his craft of puppetry well. Roscoe and Bob are just such professionals now. All of them just laugh and have a great time on set.
[What was your most difficult moment on the job? Was there ever a tough situation or did it go pretty smoothly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9toan?context=5)|Most difficult was keeping track of everyone's names. About 40 different people came and needed scripts. Each script had that person's name on it. I confused some people with others so it would be embarassing if I gave the wrong scripts (which happened often). No real tough situations except that happening.
[Do you agree that Elmo ruined the show? Oscar 4lyfe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia0adx?context=5)|No. I think Elmo came in at the right time to help the show out. I think with a show that's been on as long as Sesame Street, you need to add in things to keep the show fresh. Adding a character like Elmo did just that. I don't think he ruined it at all. I'm hoping the new Elmo works out great.
[Do you think there is too much Elmo though?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia83rv?context=5)|Maybe. I think there's been too much Baby Bear personally.
[What did you actually do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia2gb9?context=5)|My main job was delivering scripts to the actors and producers. The other parts of my job were delivering packages from the office to the set. Also I transcribed currently airing episodes from the previous season, and my transcriptions would eventually be the DVD subtitles. 
[Any fun facts about the show you learned while working there that you would care to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9ulcj?context=5)|There is a wall where all the celeb guests sign in crayon. Not sure if people know about this wall, but it was really cool to see! I haven't seen pictures of it. All of the props in Hoopers store are fictional brands that the design team came up with. Behind the door on the famous stoop, is a wall. 
[Any favorite bloopers you can share during filming when either a celebrity, cast member, or puppet goofed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9vo8i?context=5)|Yes! If a puppet messed up there line they wouldn't curse but they would say something like ""Oh rasberries!"" Instead of shit or another curse word. Michael McKean kept messing up his lines when he was a guest star but would just laugh it off. Most never goofed tho and were always spot on with lines. 
[What was your favorite part of the job (ie set design/set up or interacting with kids\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9t3xc?context=5)|I didn't get to interact with the kids that much but when I did, it was wonderful. The kids were so excited to be there and couldn't believe it. It was really nice seeing how happy they were. My favorite part of the job was probably getting to watch the performers work. They were amazing. 
[Do the kids get to see the set like you do? Or do they play it up while they're there and try not to break the illusion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9zqy2?context=5)|They see the set like I do. They see everything they can. Instead of looking down at the puppeteers, the parents and director would just keep saying ""Look up!"". And they would just get captured in the moment and stare at the Muppet or Puppet. Illusion for some reason never broke around kids.
[Were you and your co-workers familiar with the Broadway show Avenue Q?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9swns?context=5)|I've always wanted to see Avenue Q! Just haven't had the chance yet to see it.
 |The big thing that my coworkers and I discussed a lot was Spike Jonze's new movie (Where the Wild Things Are). We all LOVED it. I wish that movie got nominated for some Oscars. 
[Do you know Chris and Will? Actually, Chris isn't there anymore, I think.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia207k?context=5)|I met Chris and he was a really nice guy. I believe you're referring to Chris Knowings. He would do anything needed for the scene and was always committed to whatever the skit was. Not sure if he'd remember me tho. Which Will are you referring to?
[Haha, no. I was just thinking about the guys I know that make the scenes and the puppets and stuff. Don't want to say their last names on the interwebs!  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia48t1?context=5)|OHHH!! Yes, I believe I know who you are talking about. Are they heavily involved in the prop department? If so, then I know who you are talking about.
[On the nerdist podcast,  Moby claimed people have sex inside a snuffalupagus outfit as a rite of passage. I believe he heard this while partying with Brian Henson in the early 90s. What sort of culture is there now? What are the rites and rituals?  Do you know any other apocryphal tales of the past? Is the snuffy thing true? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9wj1h?context=5)|Nerdist podcast is my favorite podcast out there. I love Chris Hardwick and I can't wait to see what happens next to him. @midnight is great. I can definitely see him being a Jimmy Fallon/Conan one day. I remember the podcast your speaking of. There weren't really any rites or rituals that I know of. I don't think the snuffy thing is true lol.
[Did you get to keep any souvenirs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia8sqk?context=5)|I did. There was an episode where it was Baby Bear's birthday. I got to keep the banner they sewed together and I still have the banner! It's in my garage. Might hang it over my future child's bedroom one day. 
[Does everyone enjoy it as much as they seem to, or is it just a job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9smry?context=5)|Mixed feelings. Most people really enjoyed working there a lot! I could tell that a few people didn't enjoy it but most of them looked like they were having the time of their lives. You could easily tell who weren't into it.
[Were you there when Michelle Obama was there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9spwl?context=5)|I was very briefly. That day was my second day at the studio. They were in the middle of changing offices so most of the time that day I was moving boxes for people. I did not see her but I did see the President make a video call to every one on staff. He was saying how important it is that the show is still on and how it still appeals to young children and wished us luck that season! Hell of a way to start off. 
[What is you biggest tip for someone who wants to write their own skits and things for youtube? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia0hnz?context=5)|My tips would be to be creative and have fun. I used to write skits on youtube a long time ago and would love to bounce back into it. Keep writing and don't stop creating. I know that sounds really cheesy but that's what you have to do.
[Any chance you could link to some youtube work? I would love to watch/ Study it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia0nyn?context=5)|I wish I could. They aren't on youtube anymore. They wore from high school days. Perhaps I'll start writing again tonight.
[Would you consider reading something of mine, and criticizing it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cia0zki?context=5)|Absolutely! I love giving notes on things. Feel free to send me anything. Follow me on twitter @dalybear and send me a DM.
[Which character do you like the most on sesame Street? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9snd5?context=5)|Big Bird. Watching Carol Spinney perform in costume really was a work of art. I'm also a huge fan of Roscoe Orman's (Gordon) work. He really gave the most energy to everyone on set and was so nice. 
[Hey there. Please join us at /r/museumpros.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/cibarub?context=5)|I'll check it out! Also, heads up people: Cornell is going to look into finding his papers! Unbelievable what reddit can do, thank you all so much for making this a successful AMA!
[Is Big Bird a diva? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9spea?context=5)|Not at all. He was the sweetest old man. He has so much wisdom. Can't wait to see his documentary coming out this year (I AM BIG BIRD)
[Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sq2q?context=5)|Astoria in Queens! Take the 1 train downtown and get off in Astoria. Walk 2 blocks North (past the TGI Fridays) and the studio is right there!
[Is the joint full of pedophiles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sfvu?context=5)|Nope. Everyone was really nice and professional! Shame what happened with Kevin Clash. Did not see that one coming at all. 
[Is this AMA brought to us by the letter V? For Verification?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sf2w?context=5)|Do you know how to use verification? I'm not sure how to submit proof.
[Read the comment above from the moderator.  You need to submit some sort of proof (usually in picture form\).  Maybe like a picture of your work ID for Sesame Street (with your name blacked out\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9sh0y?context=5)|Thank you! I don't have my ID on me (it's at home) but I just showed an old Facebook status and a youtube video with me in it.
[Hello! May I ask you how does one end up as an intern for Sesame Street. I would love to be in part of something like that. How did you do it? Please do tell. Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9xq0s?context=5)|I literally just applied from a college email my school put it out. I would check Sesame Workshop careers. I think it was July I got hired and then started that August. Good luck!
[What did you major in college? And what position did you apply for? Thank you again for your answer :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9yt4e?context=5)|Double majored in Media Studies and Communications! I believe the position was just Season Media Intern. My official title after I hired was Script Intern. Check out some of there stuff!

[What an awesome experience! How did you end up being an intern there? Were you a big Sesame Street fan as a kid? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9tgjj?context=5)|Sorry, thought I answered this! Just a simple email from my college job board. I loved the Street as a kid and still do!
[You ever wander into other sets at Kaufman (on purpose or by mistake\)?

Walked onto the set of Nurse Jackie accidentally. Also tried walking into Kevin Smith's new movie at the time (Cop Out) but I could never get through.
[Funny, Nurse Jackie is exactly the wrong set I walked to when I was first there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9tu1s?context=5)|Haha! When were you there? That's a great coincidence!

I love that show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28d9bs/i_was_an_intern_at_sesame_street_ama/ci9wws4?context=5)|So, just last year I had one of those ""How May I help You Signs"" at New York Jets games. Another internship that I had last year and I am coming back for it again this year. I might do another AMA this week and talk about that. Really fun time! Anyways, Poussey and Tastee came in and needed to pick up there tickets. I said where to pick them up (not realizing it was them) and they went to go pick up there game day tickets. Then I realized who they were and I went ""Oh shoot"". They were supposed to enter into the celeb cliental entrance gate at Metlife. I didn't know what to do so I tweeted at them! They favorited it and got the message. Not really a funny story but I'm glad I was able to give them the right directions after.

I was very sad when he passed away. In my season, he would perform with an oxygen mask on! He never let his age or sickness bothered him. I really admired how he would go the extra mile and just always want to perform. I really admired his strength to keep going. 
[Did he have good movies before then? He seems like a real bad actor, so it doesn't bother me that he is kind of an ass.

28dmk5,1,2014-06-17,some life story,ta_2014,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/28dmk5/some_life_story/,"Up until the third grade I had a fairly normal life. I had friends, a loving family, enough to eat, warm water, all the stuff I kind of took for granted. I developed this habit of picking my nose and eating it, but I usually kept it away from school because even though I thought it wasn't too bad I knew people would be grossed out. One time there was this particularly large booger that was bothering the fuck out of me so I picked it. I didn't eat it. Someone saw, and immediately told everyone they knew. However, instead of blowing over after a week or so, the rumors became more and more twisted. It surpassed anything I could have even hoped to achieve. By the time I was in fifth grade, I was a considered a virulent and disgusting monster who ate out of the trash. It got to the point where nobody would touch anything after I touched it. I lost all my friends except for two, but could never talk to them because of conflicting school schedules.

In the sixth grade, my loneliness had gotten to a point where I think I became a little twisted myself. I took pleasure in the fact that I was considered some beast, and made a game out of touching as many things as I could just so I could watch people avoid touching it in disgust. I became so desperate for any sort of comradeship that I considered any attention good attention. There was one event where we were in a dance class, and the big strong bully started ""fooling around"". What he would do is grab me when I wasn't looking, then pretend to dance with me. When I say ""pretend to dance"" I mean he would swing me around and throw me to the ground. I wasn't mad or sad about it, I was actually happy. I laughed that somebody was giving me this attention. I remember this one time where I got in trouble for turning off the cafeteria lights briefly, and I got kept after school. I was told by my teacher to write a 3 page paper on how sorry I was. I was scared and panicking about what my parents would think, and I started writing a bunch of crap about how I was the worst kind of person that didn't deserve the life I had, all in tears. My teacher took one look at this horrible ""I'm sorry"" paper and sent me home. Soon after, I was put in a program where I was assigned a guardian that would isolate me from the other kids and we would just watch movies or play toys together. I started avoiding him because my classmates would make fun of me for that too.

In my seventh year, there were three groups of people that clearly hated me and perpetuated my awful reputation. There was the big strong bully that carried the threat of physical violence. There was the conniving mentally abusive girl who would talk shit about me behind my back and let the rumors spread, and there was an up-in-your-face girl who would say awful things to my face, then if I decided to tell the teachers about it her posse would just back her story up and I'd look like a liar. My grades began slipping and I went to bed hating myself. I deliberately failed a test to get into a nice high school because I knew that if I didn't pass it, we'd move out. If I had stayed in that town with those classmates for any longer, I am sure that I would have killed myself.

So, I moved. I went to a nice town where the school and kids were nice. I never got over the horrible elementary school life I had, the loneliness had left me a social retard. I made friends, but never any close friends. In high school things got a lot better. Rumors of my elementary school life would somehow come back to haunt me through questions, but I stomped them out. I made up my past to cover up any way that those incidents could be linked to me. My situation started to get a little better, I had friends and I was doing well in school. I got accepted into a college. I still felt like shit most of the time. I never had the drive to join clubs, I thought they were boring. I didn't have any passions, all I wanted to do was sleep and maybe play video games. 

Then when I got into college, I realized that I was not just socially impaired and probably depressed, but I was stupid as well. I was pretty high up in my class, my grades were ranked within the top 30 out of the 150 or so of my peers. I wasn't smart. My grades were all inflated, and I tried harder for them than any of my classmates ever did. I realized that the jock that seemed like a huge idiot to me, was actually smarter than I could ever hope to be. When I got to college and took the courses and realized how hard they were, I saw my peers who were handling them way easier than I did. To me, a C was a godsend. To them, a C+ was a close call. I am on the borderline of failing out. 

It hasn't really gotten any better. I'm about to enter my third year of college, and I feel like I've learned and earned nothing out of all the opportunities I've given (and squandered). I got an amazing internship thanks to my uncle, but I've failed my studies so hard that they couldn't use me at all and all I'm getting out of it is a letter of recommendation. My dad has sacrificed almost everything to put me through college, working himself to the point where he's skin and bones and older than his years. I am a piece of shit. I have never had any intimacy (i.e I'm a kissless hand-holdless virgin). The worst part is that I have no reason to be feeling like this. I have great friends in college. But, to me, I cannot envision myself doing anything in the future. I can't see myself growing old, all I can think about is how I'd love to be in some tragic accident so I don't have to torture my parents about suicide. I know I can't hurt my family like that. I'd hate to hurt my family like that. I've distanced myself from my three cousins because I didn't want them to feel anything too much if I went away. The only reason I feel like I'm still alive, is because I know how much it would kill my mom, dad, and sister if I were to die. I think, that if someone were to tell me that my mom and dad died, I'd probably kill myself after- partly out of grief, but mostly because they won't feel the pain of me dying.

I don't know what I want to do. I think that if I fail out of college, I'm going to kill myself. If I graduate, and I can't land a job that lets me be independent within two years, I'll kill myself. All I really want to do is live out the rest of my miserable life in some apartment playing video games and drinking vodka.

I guess I'm a little bit incoherent and my thoughts are unorganized, but like this subreddits title, I needed to get this off my chest. I'll probably wake up tomorrow feeling no different, but at least I can go to sleep tonight."
28drp2,174,2014-06-17,The Tweedle-Dumb and Whippy-Woo Saga: Episode 1 - An introduction,azonicstix,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/28drp2/the_tweedledumb_and_whippywoo_saga_episode_1_an/,"&gt;And this is our IT department. Um... This is where... These are the guys who, um. Make sure everything is running, and that our emails work, and that the internet stays on in the building, and... Azonicstix, can you tell our new interns a little more about what you and ITDir do here?

The tour guide, FrontDeskLady ([Click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/267jjx/from_the_front_desk_lady_ep2_could_not_shut_down/)) understood IT in her own way, she knew that there were computers here and that if it weren't for IT, they would all be pasting sticky notes to each others desk with dried spit. What she didn't know was ANYTHING ELSE about IT. 

&gt;Sure. 

I said with a smile. 

&gt;Hello interns, I'm azonicstix, the resident IT Specialist. This is ITDir, my boss. 

ITDir said hello from his office without bothering to get up. He's seen so many of these tours come through it's become a kind of challenge to him to see how quickly he can get them to leave the IT Dept.

&gt;Together we administer and support IT operations and equipment for 5 of our international offices, all the way from end user complaints to disaster recovery. Nice to meet you...?

I stared expectantly, waiting for someone to initiate the other side of a standard formal introduction.

&gt;Oh, sorry, hi, I'm Tweedle-Dumb, and this is my friend Whippy-Woo. We're big fans of LARGENONPROFIT. Your office is really neat. Is that a computer?

He was motioning towards a growing pile of ornamental/destroyed dead hard drives I had been collecting for years.

&gt;No...

I said

&gt;That's where data lives inside of a computer. Everything you do and create is stored on a hard drive, and these are dead hard drives.

I tried not to be demeaning, it was a fair question.

&gt;Wow

gasp-sighed Tweedle-Dumb, completely in awe.

&gt;I wonder if there's anything good on those drives.

This was not a fair question.

&gt;Actually... Never-Mind, nice to meet you. 

I said, still smiling, but for a different reason now. This would be fun.

&gt;Thanks man! 

Tweedle was very happy to have... learned something?, and Whippy never spoke a word. They left and continued on their way, and I sighed knowingly. 

These two were going to be trouble.

I spend my freshman and sophomore year as a bioinformatics major and switched for my junior year. During my bioinformatics time I took a bunch of sciences, but also compsci 1,2 and calc+discrete mathematics. I do well in my computer science classes 3-3.3 GPA, but with my sciences my overall is around a 2.6. I'm pretty proficient in Java with some experience in assembly and SQL. But i'm currently learning python and html/java script in hopes to be well rounded in each by the end of the summer.



After applying to way too many places for an internship this summer, I have come up empty. I applied to internships in the field of cyber security and information assurance (Northrup Grumman, AIS type places). What can I do this summer so that when I graduate next year, I won't look unfocused in my path. 

I'm getting the feeling that my first two years were now a waste and that even when I graduate I will not have any marketable qualities for a job in the field I want (cyber/network security or information assurance). 


I apologize for the wall of text, I just don't really know where to go from here. Any advice form people in the field or anything at all would be super helpful.

**TL;DR: Need advice for summer activities to advance myself in the cyber/network security field.**

28e28q,27,2014-06-17,Tips on handling debilitating social anxiety?,[deleted],TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/28e28q/tips_on_handling_debilitating_social_anxiety/,"Hello ladies, I'm new to to this sub (and to reddit in general) but you all seem so lovely and I just feel like instead of bottling up my problems I should ask for some help.

So a bit of a background, I'm 22 and have just started law school. Prior to that, I had a brief 3-month non-paid internship at a law firm. Everyone was lovely, but as is/was my experience with new places/people/situations, I just couldn't handle the anxiety I got going there everyday and had to quit prematurely. The first day, I was so nervous I didn't stand from my chair the entire 8 hours save for bathroom trips. I didn't talk unless spoken to, I didn't want to ""bother"" anyone either so I didn't ask where I could get water and didn't eat or drink the whole day. Although I eventually managed to force myself to eat with my co-workers (who were really nice!), every morning I dreaded going to work. I felt nauseous; sometimes I'd start shaking. The only thing I liked doing was actually working. I couldn't handle the company culture - the dinners, the chatting, the authority figures (I was always so anxious around them, even though they were wonderful to me). 

I realise now that I'm back in school, I am equally unhappy and anxious. Maybe it's the fact that the only motivation I have in studying is not humiliating myself in a dramatic example of a failed Socratic recitation - I don't know. The situations are different, but my feelings are still the same. I walk across campus and I feel like vomiting. I wake up in the morning and feel dread when I think about going to see other people. I think about having to talk to the admin, to the professors, to upperclassmen and I feel like crawling into a cave and never leaving. I feel like I'm barely holding on here. I'm so sorry for the tl;dr, but I don't know what to do any more. Does anyone have advice for overcoming anxiety like this? It's affecting my ability to function on a daily basis and I have no clue how to help myself. Please help. "

(studied IT/hardware)

I was offered this chance from a friend who works in the local employment center, who knows the boss of the company. I had a interview with the boss and all looked fine, he asked me to start 2 months before the scheduled start time to adapt, and i was fine with it, since he said he would pay normally for my time as if i was a employee.

Thing is, i really enjoy working computers... and the job is to be trainned to be a communications/electronic tech (not that there is any problem... i was actually excited about it). I just finished my first week and i feel horrible, i never thought of hating a job like this... i don't know how to explain. The people working there aren't the problem, and i didnt had any relevant dificulty... i just don't like working on phones/phone-stations, or assembling communication lines, i just feel depressed I don't want to quit right away, even before it actually ""starts"" because i feel i would betray my friends trust, and lose a chance of a guaranteed paying job.

I dont want to seem picky or something like that, because it actually excited me at first, but i dont know how to handle 9months, while hating every second of it, any helpful advice would be very appreciated."
28ecss,27,2014-06-17,A girl that I really dislike (27/f) got hired at the same small company as me (26/f),GoAwayLifeStalker,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28ecss/a_girl_that_i_really_dislike_27f_got_hired_at_the/,"In May I started a new job that I already love. It's for a small photography company and involves traveling with their equipment to different events in the area. There are less than 10 employees and so far I get along very well with everyone I've met, especially the two owners.


A girl that has been notorious for copying me just got hired there. We went to the same college and ever since she met me, she has been trying to copy my professional and personal life. She applied to and got the same internship as me. I began doing photography for free for a local blog ran by a friend of mine. She met that friend, started working for him for free as well, and even would show up to the same events as me to try to shoot for the same blog! It seemed like she started trying to undermine me. She tried to insert herself into my group of friends. She successfully started dating a close male friend of mine. Now they are both pretty isolated from my larger group of friends because no one really clicked with her. She also copied my camera, lens, and flash choices. She dyed her hair the same color as mine only a few weeks after I dyed mine. She bought almost the same coat as me. She started listening to the same bands as me. It goes on and on to the point where it's not just a case of someone with similar interests. I half jokingly call her my ""life stalker"". She also inserted herself into some personal drama between me and a few other people that she knew. She had nothing to do with it, but she talked behind everyone's backs about everyone else and was just generally nasty about the situation.


All of that happened a few years ago. We now barely see each other. I took steps to stop seeing her as much and I think she finally took the hint that I wasn't really a fan of her's. It's been great being away from her! Her negativity just really bothered me.


I am almost certain that she heard about this new job through the fact that I just started working there. 


I know of at least two instances in which she has been extremely unprofessional. She was fired from a serving job for getting a ton of complaints from customers. At this new job, about 80% of the job is interacting with customers/people at events. The rest is understanding the equipment and hauling it around.


She also was working as a second shooter for a wedding photographer that I also know. He couldn't keep up with his workload because of medical reasons. When he was in need of her help as a business partner the most, she left him in the dust. He is now about to be sued by some of his clients and she didn't even try to help him.


A huge part of me wants to tell my new bosses about her unprofessional behavior. I would leave the personal stuff out of it. But I really don't want to seem petty or like I'm throwing her under the bus. Though, maybe I am being petty? I feel like if I knew they hired anyone with such a record of being unprofessional I would want to tell them. I really care about the company and don't want that kind of behavior to bring them down! But also, I'm still fairly new myself and am unsure if it's really my place to say anything.


What should I do? Not say anything? We work pretty independently at this company, but there is a chance we will have to be partnered together at some point. I would also like to start taking on more roles in the office and be more involved in the company in general. I just really, really don't want to work with her and am angry that she copied me once again! I wouldn't mind never seeing her ever again. But would it be super petty to bring any of this up to the bosses? Of course, I'd be as professional as possible if I ever do have to work with her. I would just be cringing on the inside. A lot.


TL;DR: There is a girl that I really don't like and who has made it a habit of her's to copy my personal and professional life. She just got hired at my awesome new job. Should I mention her unprofessional behavior to the bosses, or let it go and suffer through knowing I may have to work with her?

I have been watching some videos as suggested and am much more comfortable learning self defensive tactics with keys and pens than equipping a weapon. It's just an element that I don't feel comfortable bringing into my life if I can avoid it. Thank you for all of the tips, the support I have been getting throughout all of this experience has been far greater than anything I could have imagined!

Tuesday June 17, 2014: After work the police had called me and offered to let me go through my home to collect some more of my belongings. Fortunately I have a shortened schedule this week with my internship, which gave me a window between work and school long enough to collect my things. They were accommodating enough to arrange a ride for me to get into my house and the officer even offered to also go inside with me, however I took this as an opportunity to gather any evidence before the police confiscated it.

Admittedly I was a bit weary of entering my house even with a police officer in the driveway and the daylight but I was assured that the house was inspected for any foul activity once the power was restored. I was even given the option to return home though I am certainly no where near ready for that.

Don't need to bore you with the wardrobe items that made the cut or the nonperishable food items that were worthy of taking, but everything seemed in place as I had left it. I am a fairly neat person by nature that would readily pick up on anything blatantly out of place. That is, until I entered the bathroom.

The smell was unusual. I would love to describe it in greater detail but my vocabulary isn't equipped with the proper adjectives. The best way to describe the odor was that of metal, mud, and stuffiness. It was incredibly stuffy. I knew something was awry upon entering. I placed what toiletries I felt too cheap to repurchase and stored them in my backpack, grabbed my razor and tiptoed to the shower. I drew the curtain, half expecting to use the razor on some assailant stupid enough to pick the most predictable hiding spot known to anyone that was seen a horror movie, but was instead greeted by a very different scene. The tub has served as some sort of slaughtering area, with thick coagulated blood lining the basin. Inside the remain of what appeared to be a lamb. Totally revolting, I am sorry for the absence of the picture but understandably so this was not an image I wanted to stick around to analyze or revisit. I slammed the curtain shut, grabbed my bag and made a swift jog out to the cruiser. Written on the wall above was a time, 6 something, maybe 6:12 or 6:14 I can't recall now.

I told the officer and he phoned it in to the station. I haven't heard anything more concerning this, I feel it's pretty face value gore tactics to eek me out. It worked, I was disgusted. Clearly someone has access to my house at their will, so the police will be changing all of the locks this evening. 

Tangent: I would like to say that the police have been very helpful in all of this. I know the general opinion towards cops, even I had some pretty hard feelings seeing some of the articles, but they're not all evil.

Afterwards we went to empty the remaining belongings from my vehicle. The mechanic kindly offered some cash/trade in value for the useless car that was, from my understanding, utterly destroyed. 

As I had gotten the last of the important things out of my car I checked all the nooks and crannies for last minute items and found my King James bible under the driver's seat. This was certainly not there before. I threw it in my bag to scan at the hotel before I bring it to the police. I found another coded message inside. This time I was smart enough to snap a picture before turning it over (I check in with the police regularly as they still offer an escort to work and school and will give it to them tomorrow). It should be noted that this note was taped right under the passage Matthew 4:10, which seemed almost too ironic to be random. It reads: Jesus said to him ""Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'""

This was a bible I had received when I was confirmed into a church over 10 years ago. I had carried it with me as I moved, even read it as literature, but never left it in my car. It was removed from my home at some point and placed in my car. I hadn't scanned my bookshelves in the time I spent in my home but I am 100% certain this is mine. My name is engraved on the cover.

It was difficult to remain focused in class with even more questions circulating in my head than before. I feel like a useless player in a game. Someone is calling all of the shots from afar, predicting our moves and staying a step ahead of me and the police. Furthermore, who ever is doing this is taking pleasure in all of it. I cannot understand why anyone would choose to communicate in code. I think they want all of this to consume me.

I know a lot of you suggest that this person(s) is trying to harm or kill me but it seems just the opposite. I feel they have had ample opportunity to do so and take more pleasure in the torture of the unknown than inflicting physical pain. I am still puzzled as to why I am the target of all of this, among other complexities, but am sure that many of these questions will remain mysteries without really thinking outside of the box. I need all of your help.

What can I do to stop this? What have I unwillingly gotten myself into? 

I will try my best to update but as the semester ends my time will be even more divided. Hopefully there will be nothing to report in the coming days although that is just wishful thinking. 

[index card](http://imgur.com/vqKAvIG)

UPDATE: As of late last night the code was deciphered to reveal the address of the hotel in which I was staying. I contacted the police and changed locations to a much safer address where I will have a higher level of protection until some sort of end is brought to this investigation. I have agreed with law enforcement to continually post information to the subreddit with their permission, all updates will be reviewed before being submitted. All clues seem to be proactive threats, not reactive to any information that has been discussed on the thread and even if these assailant(s) are using aware of this posting there has been no reason to believe that is will have any interference with the investigation at this time. Most updates have been recaps of the day, not insight into what the police are doing or how the investigation is coming along, and the nature of these posts will obviously remain as such. 

I will try and update again tonight or tomorrow if anything unfolds. "

I like a lot of different kind of music but tend to prefer electronic, metal and rock. I like talking about random things (maths, physics, electronics, philosophy, etc.).

However, the thread below is scaring me (along with people I contacted via facebook who are in the program) into thinking I should call off the internship and instead brush up on my 8 year old calculus and get started on probability and mathematical stats textbooks. I've only taken intro stats and linear algebra recently through community colleges and they were kind of a joke (really easy). Undergrad degree was bio. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/275plk/going_for_an_ms_in_stats_with_almost_no_stats/

But of course, that would mean coming out of my MS with zero experience (I'm a clinical trial coordinator right now). 

Should I 
a) do the internship and then struggle like crazy/possibly have to retake an exam and stay in Europe longer? 
or
b) ditch the internship and study for a couple months prior to leaving for school?

Doing both is not an option for me. It's finally summer here and I need a life."

I'm also working a full-time finance internship that ends in August, in which after that I plan on doing fall recruiting for a Big 4 summer internship.

I had heard that grad students were ineligible for the summer leadership programs and that you had to have taken certain accounting courses to be eligible. Seeing that I just started taking Intermediate 1 this summer, I didn't apply. Now I heard otherwise and wonder if I missed out on a major opportunity to increase my chances of an internship offer come Fall, especially because I'll be doing it as grad student and not a junior/senior. 

My questions are:

* What can I do at this point to make myself stand out? 
* For those who didn't attend/were rejected for SLPs: were you still able to receive an offer from a big 4 firm?

I'm asking the first question because recruiting opportunities at my undergrad seem WAY stronger than where I go to school now (I don't even think EY recruits on my campus). Should I make the drive to my undergrad and attend everything even though I go to grad school somewhere else? I held leadership positions throughout my undergrad but haven't been involved in anything since grad school because of my internship, although I do want to join BAP in the fall. If it helps, my GPA in undergrad was 3.7 and currently it's 3.8.

Thanks guys!

28ey2d,2,2014-06-17,Getting a Product Management internship or going for software development?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28ey2d/getting_a_product_management_internship_or_going/,"Hey guys, so I'm really interested in doing product management and I feel like I have very little of an idea of how to get there.  

I guess I'll give a little backstory, I was a business major for 3 years, and had various internships during the summer along the way, as I assumed I was getting into either marketing or finance when I graduated.  As time went on, I realized that I really hated all my business classes and had pretty much a 2.5 going into my Junior year.  I took a codecademy course over the summer after my Junior year while at an internship I had, and realized that I was absolutely doing the wrong thing with my life.  I went ahead and quit that internship immediately and decided to double major with Computer Science/Business.  

Now I'm basically going into my 5th year of college (finished with business degree, done with almost all my CS classes and basically doing a year of EE, Calculus, and Physics so I can get the CS degree)

Right now I'm trying to get everything prepared for the upcoming recruiting season but I'm not really sure how PM internships work, or if I should even go for them, because I hear many PMs come from being software developers.  I am not really predisposed to doing either, as I really think I would like PM, but I also like coding and would not be opposed to doing software development for a few years (not sure if I could do it permanently though).

Anyways, here are my questions:

1. Is it a better idea to go straight for product management via internships or try to get an internship as a developer, work for a few years, and then make the switch?

2. Should I have separate resumes for PM/Developer positions?  And if so what should be the difference?  

Here's my current resume, I'm not sure if this is against the rules to post outside of the resume thread, I will remove it if asked to: http://i.imgur.com/aZVaSSb.png

I also still have my older resume from when I was pure business that has the same positions with more detailed bullet points, and another sales job I used to have. Should I use that when applying for PM or should I use the newer one?  In regards to the newer resume, should I try to add more projects?  I have a lot of data structures written in C++ (lists, sets RBTree insertion, etc) from classes, along with other projects but no personal projects yet.  I plan to change that over the next year but I don't think any of this will be in time for fall recruiting.

3. How important is GPA for product management?  I've managed to get a 3.4 as a senior with mostly CS classes, but that still puts my overall GPA at about a 2.94, and I'm sure the EE and math classes are not going to do me any favors.  I foresee graduating below a 3.0 as a distinct possibility, and I would like to go for whatever I have the best chance in, so which choice has less of an emphasis on GPA?

Thanks guys, sorry this is kind of long.  I really appreciate anything you guys know about this.

Now I have 100 credits and I'm three semesters from completing a B.S. in Computer Science, though most of the important CS classes are contained in those last three semesters.  

I had an internship last summer with a software developer where I think I learned a lot and did a reasonable job at contributing, given my skills. Now I'm working a miserable manual labor job and I'm feeling quite bitter about having paid for four years of education and spent over four years of my life working towards a degree only to end up in this situation.

I am concerned that four-year colleges will not admit me given my track record, so I'm looking for alternatives. I've considered doing some disciplined self-teaching to round out my knowledge, but I'm not sure about the job prospects for someone without a degree. I'd also be open to getting an associates degree if that will help me.  

I'm looking for some suggestions, some reassurance, and perhaps someone who has seen or been in a similar situation. I've heard lots of conflicting opinions, I can't quite get my thoughts straight, and I'm trying to come up with a concrete game plan to get back on track.

28eyyx,1,2014-06-17,IRSC POWER PLANT INSTITUTE NAMED ONE OF NATION’S TOP TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS,rainbownerdsgirl,IRSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/IRSC/comments/28eyyx/irsc_power_plant_institute_named_one_of_nations/,"With urgent national demand for college programs that lead directly to good-paying jobs, the Power Plant Technology Institute at Indian River State College has been recognized by the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) as one of the Top Five College and Corporate Training Partnerships in the U.S.   Developed by IRSC with Florida Power and Light (FPL) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the Power Plant Technology Institute was honored April 23 at the AACC Conference in San Francisco as a top Award of Excellence finalist out of more than 1,500 community colleges nationwide.  The award recognizes innovation, collaboration and best practices in higher education that merit replication by other colleges and universities. 

Recognition as one of the most effective College and Corporate Training Partnerships in the U.S. is the latest in a series of recent accolades for IRSC’s Power Plant Technology Institute, which has emerged as a highly respected industry leader in the nuclear and alternative energy sector.  The Power Plant Technology Institute was instrumental in IRSC’s success in attracting a $3.1 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to form an extensive training network involving 46 colleges and university and 35 industry partners, as well as a recent scholarship initiative with the United Negro College Fund to provide financial assistance for minority students who wish to prepare for careers in the energy industry.

“The Power Plant Technology Institute exemplifies IRSC’s commitment to education that directly links to industry needs and prepares students for high-skill, high-wage jobs,” said Dr. Edwin R. Massey, IRSC President.  “We are honored and proud to be recognized with Florida Power &amp; Light at the national level for this outstanding partnership.”

Since many nuclear energy technicians began their careers in the 1970’s and 80’s and are now approaching retirement, FPL and other energy firms are focused on preparing the next generation of  energy professionals.  Over 100 graduates of IRSC’s Power Plant Technology Institute have been hired by FPL at salaries averaging $55,000 and benefits.  Students have also been hired by other energy firms, with over 90% of graduates placed in highly paid energy-related positions.

The Power Plant Technology Institute is designed to create a pipeline of graduates who have not only received extensive hands-on training in IRSC’s state-of-the-art Brown Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the Main Campus in Fort Pierce, but have also participated in  intensive paid internships at FPL’s St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant.  The IRSC Brown Center houses a dynamic flow loop, a highly-sophisticated two-story simulator that replicates key aspects of power plant operations.  Graduates of the Power Plant Institute, now employed as journeymen at FPL, are back on-site at IRSC completing final stages of construction of the flow loop, which features an industry-standard control room, two training stations and an external water injection station.

The highly successful Power Plant Technology Institute also serves as the core of the Regional Center for Nuclear Education and Training (RCNET), an NSF-funded training network headquartered at the Brown Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.  A consortium of higher education and industry partners, RCNET utilizes the Power Plant Technology Institute as the foundation for curriculum, training methods, and student internships.

Over 120 nuclear energy industry, education and agency experts from throughout the U.S. and several other countries met at the RCNET National Conference at IRSC on April 19 and 20 to share best practices that standardize, enhance and expand training of nuclear energy technicians in response to the nation’s shortage of these highly skilled workers.  The event engaged representatives from the US State Department, US Navy, Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), CASEnergy, Florida Power &amp; Light, and Center for Energy Workforce Development, as well as representatives from the United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom and colleges throughout the nation.

“Our goal is to meet the industry’s workforce demand in a consistent, reliable, safe and systematic manner,” said Dr. Kevin Cooper, Principal Investigator and Director of RCNET and IRSC Director of Advanced Technology.  

During the RCNET meeting, Sherry Paramore of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) announced a partnership between RCNET and UNCF to raise $120,000 for yearly scholarships to increase the number of African-Americans trained for nuclear technician jobs.  FPL launched the fundraiser by committing $5,000 towards the scholarships.

RCNET is funded through a $3.1 million National Science Foundation grant in response to the nation’s need for over 40,000 skilled nuclear workers in the next decade.

I have read the FAQ through many times, but am never confident in my ability to fully interpret the information regarding roth vs traditional.

21 years old here, working on a second summer internship in oil and gas.

It seems like people treat traditional IRAs as no-brainers, but maybe I'm just getting the wrong impression.

My gross income is ~ $17,000-$20,000. This is all I will earn this year. I definitely have enough left over to contribute $5500 to an IRA.

Whether its tax deducted or not, I can put $5500 in one or the other, or both (split). Money withdrawn from traditional IRAs is counted as income by the IRS, and I will definitely live off more than ~$20,000 annually in retirement. So the Roth IRA is the obvious choice here right? It seems like most posters here advocate the traditional for the deductions, but maybe they're just in a higher bracket?

We have built a small render rig that’s almost cooking our meals heh, and it’s been a tough time to get everything in place, but I can promise you we have made something bigger!

**Jim (Romfarer):** Made the KSP balls bounce, fixed up some new graphics for the resource display. And then in between, a lot of bugfixing and tweaking small issues.

**Miguel (Maxmaps):** Worked on everything related to getting the Kerbin Cup mod up and running on Curse. Even figured out how to update it when we threw in the source code (I know, I know, breaking our own rules). Other than that thrilled to lend hands all around as QA for 0.24 starts and making sure people interested in our affiliate program get in.

**Jesus (Chuchito):** Working on the client-server synchronization.

**Bob (Calisker):** Recovering from a week in LA at E3 - always a great show and opportunity to see what the industry is excited about. Can’t say I was surprised to see co-op getting a lot of love with new games. Nassault is working on a video but I don’t have much to say about it just yet. Last but not least, if you’re interested in participating in our affiliate program to support your amazing video content for KSP, you can sign up [HERE](http://goo.gl/WKHE8X).

**Ted (Ted):** This past week has been finishing up some of the documentation, refining the topic for a future Dev Blog so that it dives further into its topic and writing some of it up. And additionally, since Monday afternoon, the QA Team and I have been knee-deep in testing the impressive and immense changes that the Developers have added.

**Anthony (Rowsdower):** The Kerbin Cup competition is off to a roaring start. I can't wait to see what everyone comes up with. I reckon there's been some confusion over some of the guidelines, so I'll make sure to tighten some of them up as the weeks go by. There's still plenty of contest to go! Speaking of contests, it's time I start planning some future ones. I'm also finally sitting down to make some revisions to the forum rules. Is there anything you'd specifically like to have addressed in them? Things are looking good so far.

**Eduardo (Lalo):** Keep calm and play Kerbal, we are working as hard and fast as possible, we will have the next release soon ☺

**Rogelio (Roger):** Still working on the final render, playing with light settings and modifying textures to get better results. I'm also modeling extra assets to dress the scene.

**Hugo (The Intern):** Worked on the Kerbin Cup mod. Polished some of the pieces I’ve been working on. Getting their programing to work and testing them inside the game. Also started the work of improving some of the aesthetics of already existing pieces."
28f1nv,5,2014-06-17,Rafaa,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/28f1nv/rafaa/,"I created an account after years of lurking because I'm just so frustrated and honestly a little scared. 

So about a month ago my roommate up and left without giving a reason why. It's ok though, we weren't very close anyway. However, because we had no warning about his plans to leave and because he left at the end of the month we were left with an empty room and another $600 in rent to make up for. I work part-time in retail and my roommate is doing an internship this summer. We are both full time students and are taking summer courses. So, in other words, we are completely broke. 
We created an ad advertising for the spare bedroom. Honestly, its a steal. The room is very large and everything is new. The previous tenants had wrecked the place so my landlord had remodeled the entire house before we moved in. The carpet is a spotless off-white, the walls are freshly painted, the windows are large and we get so much airflow that A/C isn't even necessary. We live in a suburb in the middle of the downtown near campus so our rent is comparatively much cheaper than other houses. All in all, our house is perfect. Naturally, we got a flood of interested prospective roommates and found one person that we really liked. He moved in a few days later and we were able to give in the rent without having to pay the extra $600.
Now the website we used to advertise the room with is a little funny. You can't remove your ad after you have listed it. It just gets circulated off the site after 30 days and then you're given an option of whether or not you want to renew your ad. We had found our new roommate only after three days of posting the ad and so we still got quite the number of interested renters. I read all of them. Most were older people looking for a cheap place to crash at while they worked in the city during the summers. Others were students like us taking summer courses in the later semester. A couple of older people replied and we even had a few soldiers reply. Most of them were respectful, others were more demanding and some were rude but there was only one reply that got me feeling uneasy.
A man or woman, I'm not quite sure, by the the name of Rafaa had emailed. His/her reply was different from all the rest because unlike those that were polite, funny, written in broken English and horrific grammar -Rafaa was erratic and desperate. 

My name if Rafaa I am looking for a place now now now. PLEASE PleaSE please please email or call me back! Please i need a place NOW I am ready to move in Tomorrow! Please please please email me back~!

I had chuckled and instantly deleted the message. There was no way I was going to respond to some crazy lunatic. A few days had gone by and I received a second e-mail from him/her. I won't repeat it since it is practically the same as the first. Still I didnt reply thinking he/she would get the hint after two unreplied e-mails. He/she didnt. More and more of the same e-mails kept popping up. I listed the sender as junk but I still received e-mail notifications on my phone so it was harder to ignore when Rafaa's name would pop up. It happened so frequently that I just kinda became accustomed to it. I didnt tell my roommates because I didnt think there was anything really to tell...its not like anything happened. But today I told them.
We were reviewing for our exam in my International business class when I noticed my phone flash. I unlocked my screen and saw that Rafaa had e-mailed me again. I opened it up out of boredom and found the receiving message:

hi i came there several times i recognize your house and i guess i know your street and anyway I came again today and looked around the house. You left your blinds open and i could see nobody was home so i LEFFT YOU A MESSAGE UNDER YOUR MAT. Please cal me back when you see this. i need to move in NOW. 
I called my roommate after my class and told her everything. She was freaked out and refused to go outside. She did, however, close the blinds and made sure all the doors and windows were locked. She was waiting for me inside by the front door when I walked up the driveway. Even before I got to the front door I could see a slip of paper under our welcome mat. 
I wish I could say the note itself was scary but it simply had his name written on it and his phone number was crudely scribbled down in red crayon. I called the landlord and he told us to call the police so I called the non-emergency hotline and after a few minutes of explaining everything to the police officer he just told me that since nothing had actually happened and no threats were made that we would just have to live with the harassment. I was resigned and thanked him curtly.

But see, here's the thing...we didn't post a photo of the outside of our house, we didn't list our address and we didn't even give out any landmarks so how did Rafaa know which house was ours? "

28fb8t,0,2014-06-17,Vacationing struggles. I [22 M] have to choose between GF [22 F] of 3 years or cruise. Plot twists ahead.,needsomehelpbadly,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28fb8t/vacationing_struggles_i_22_m_have_to_choose/,"Thank you for taking the time to read this and I'll try my best to keep a long story short. Basically 3 months ago my two extremely good friends invited me to go on a cruise with them. I was preparing to graduate college and thought that would be an awesome way to top off all my hard work. 




Little did I know they had invited two other mutual friends who happen to be girls. We have know these girls for 8+ years now so there is some history there, but I happen to have dated (although never formally) and hooked up with one of the girls coming on the cruise. 



So I mention in passing to my GF that I am thinking about going on a cruise with my two guy friends and that was that. A few days later they let me know that the cruise is booked and that is when they decided it was a great time to tell me the girls are coming as well. Now, I'm free spirited and easy going guy so I didn't mind that they were coming and we are all cordial friends, but I knew it would be uncomfortable for my GF and that made me a bit uneasy.



I hesitated to tell her about the cruise for a few days thinking of how to bring it up easy, when I get tagged in a Facebook post with the girls saying ""x# of days until cruise"" ... needless to say, my GF is furious I didn't tell her I was going and freaks on me so I didn't know how to react other then say I'll cancel it. 



Mistake #1 for me. 



Flash forward to one month ago, she asks if I cancelled it. I said I've been busy with school, my new job and my internship so I haven't had time to really think about it which is completely true, but to be honest I was also a bit reluctant to cancel it. 



We fight over whether I should be allowed to go, finally she cracks and says it's O.K. she was wrong for telling me not to go and I can go if I want. I'm an idiot and responded by saying ""wow, thanks babe, that's so awesome of you for finally saying that, I'm not going to go for you."" Seemed like a great gesture, but I couldn't follow through with it, I wanted to go so bad and it was all planned! 



Mistake #2.



Fast Forward to this week. 



Girl that I have some history with starts with my GF at a party. She starts with subtle little bumps/nudges and saying things like I'm going on a cruise with your BF with a smirk. I leave for a few minutes and shit hits the fan, she gets in my GF's face and screaming some crazy stuff like ""go home!"" and ""Fuck you"". Then a few minutes later, before she leaves she yells my GF's name in front of the entire party and flips her off. I missed the whole thing and I get back to a dead party and a pissed off GF.



I'm not a confrontational guy so I thought its over, fuck her, lets just let it go. My GF insisted I curse her out through text and sent me the text to send. I never said anything so she got pissed that I didn't defend her.



Next day, the girl apologizes to me I show my GF. GF says screw her.



Two days later GF goes through my phone to see if I responded, sees texts planning for the cruise with my other friends and sees that I'm going. Proceeds to cancel our plans to hangout and breaks up with me. 



We talk, she says she can't do it if I go on the cruise anymore. I love this girl and I want to be with her so I say I'll cancel. 



Mistakes #3 for not updating her on my cruise status.
Mistake #4 for saying I'll cancel again.



Currently she thinks I'm canceling the cruise, but I truthfully feel like that is unfair and definitely not right for me to have to do. I completely understand where she is coming from, I know I lied saying I'll cancel and went behind her back; yet, I said it with the full intention too I just couldn't go through with it at all. I know I wouldn't do anything to disrespect her on the cruise, the only negative side-effect of my going on the cruise would be her having anxiety attacks and feeling uncomfortable.



But now, I am forced to basically choose between her or the cruise. I lose 50% of my payment and miss out on 8 amazing days of adventure out on the open seas with great friends or a GF who is really great and beautiful other than the fact that she is super restrictive about what I do and who I do it with.




 I desperately need some perspective and guidance on whether I am making the right decision or an impulsive mistake by going on the cruise. I do love this girl and I want to be with her, but I feel like she is being unreasonable by giving me this ultimatum simply for fear of this girl being there. I feel like it is selfish of her and makes me feel like she doesn't trust me. But, is holding my ground on this worth losing the relationship? Honestly, I'm going to be super upset either way for a few days, but I know I'll be ok no matter what. I just don't want to resent her for not letting me go and holding me back. 



---   
**tl;dr**: Planned cruise with 2 guy friends, girl (S) I used to hook up with unfortunately going with a friend, GF pissed said I couldn't go, I said I wouldn't. GF changes mind says I can go. I say I wont anyway. S pisses GF off at party. GF looks through texts, finds out I was planning to go again, breaks up with me, gives me ultimatum her or cruise. I'm thinking cruise because I feel she is being selfish and unreasonable. 



Lots of fun stuff in between if you read. Thanks for your time and please help!"

I'm going to be a freshman studying computer engineering and I'm just not that excited about the college. I'm getting nervous. 

Everyone talks about how much they love their college and I'm not that enthralled. I got a 29 on the ACT and I've taken 7 AP classes. Student council, a couple other activities, no sports. Could I have done better than UC? Should I have done better? 

I only went here because the campus was nice and it wasn't too far away, but should I have picked differently? I know the coop program is great, but does that even mean much? Couldn't I have gotten an internship on my own anyway?

I guess I'm nervous because I honestly didn't put that much thought into picking a college and I'm regretting that. I'm not proud to be a bearcat. I'm not sure if I made the right choice and I'm scared of what my future will be like with the choice I've made."
28fjyp,3,2014-06-17,"[support] [trigger warning] [rant] I'm tired, uninspired and running on empty.",hannahcyanide,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/28fjyp/support_trigger_warning_rant_im_tired_uninspired/,"On my mother's side of the family, everyone's relatively curvy. I'm the anomaly - at 21, weighing in at 43kg and standing at 5'3 at most. I've been diagnosed as anemic recently and discovered that my thyroid's working too slow - I know these things are a side effect of some medical issues I had earlier in the year and the thyroid sluggishness is because I forget to eat sometimes. I've had this long standing battle with food, and I'm okay now - but I don't know how to deal with this.

I come home everyday to getting yelled at by my grandmother. She's in a weirder mood than usual, so much pessimism and anger and in a typically N-way, she seems to resent me. I'm already juggling work, an internship and a full college schedule, on top of my existing health issues but she feels the need to scream at me: **You're too skinny, are you anorexic again? You need to cut down on your smoking! Why are you so exhausted, it's not as if you're married or have actual problems!** And the list goes on. I am both SG and GC, the youngest in this household after moving out of my FLEAS-ridden mother's house and I hate everything about being at home, potentially.

How am I supposed to be okay with eating when I sometimes don't have time to even stop working? When I have 8 deadlines in a week, when I work 8am - 11pm days? I don't sleep until 3 - 4am sometimes. I can't be okay with eating when every time I eat at home, you scrutinize my food choices and portions and always feel the need to lecture me about how if I eat too much, I'll end up 'a fat cow'. I barely spend time at home but between getting yelled at for everything I do and getting yelled at for everything I am - I'll take the former.

Heaven forbid that she sees me without my makeup. Makeup is my coping mechanism, letting me pretend to be the princess I don't get to be at home. The moment she sees me without it and she sees the acne and the scarring and the eye bags - she screams about me being 'ugly' or the best one: **what the hell happened to your face?** She reminds me about my self-inflicted scars, about my substance abuse, about my depression. She's deliberately caused panic and anxiety attacks because she was bored. 

I went into substance abuse because I was depressed. Yes, I spent a good period of time in completely non-sobriety. Yes, I used to drink every hour of every day. Yes, I used to cut and the only reason you wanted me to stop was because it was shameful to have a mentally ill granddaughter, let alone the eldest one. So I just started in places you couldn't see.

To scream: **She doesn't deserve comfort, she doesn't deserve any of it because she was just born pretty enough. She has a boyfriend, she has friends and she has everything - don't comfort her!** at my aunt who was trying to calm my hyperventilating, crying self down from a panic attack.

Her favorite topic though? Cheating. She likes commenting on couples, particularly older men and younger women. She gossips about everything, but if you don't do what she tells you to? She turns on you. I keep myself private to save my own sanity, but she knows about my boyfriend. She always tells me that he's going to leave me and find some 'office slut' to bang because he'll be working and I'll still be in college until April next year. She always plays on the fact that I'm a 'useless college student' when she doesn't understand a single facet of what I'm doing. She's only proud of me when it suits her and other times, she calls my profession being nothing but a 'glorified, soulless socialite'. 

**Other people's children are doing the same course and yet they don't do what you do. You're obviously lying.**

No. I'm not. My hard work got me internships, brand sponsorships, half the little jobs I do to get money. I don't go out and spend all my time making goo-goo eyes at my boyfriend like half the girls my age do, and at least I haven't committed suicide from all the grief she gives me. 

I give up, I'm done. I have to wait at least another year before moving out. I wish it wasn't unethical to punch old people. I'm going to go cry now."
28fr0u,1,2014-06-18,Don't want someone to make my mistakes,ChelSD5,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/28fr0u/dont_want_someone_to_make_my_mistakes/,"Today was the final straw for me to really evaluate where my life has ended up. Four years ago I was engaged to what I thought was the man of my dreams, until I found out he was cheating... again. He had done so in the first few months of our relationship, and convinced me it wouldn't have been done again. I always had my doubts, but only was able to confirm after the ring was on my finger, the wedding dress was picked out and ordered, and the venue and date were chosen. 
The first of my many mistakes was to invest my entire existence to our relationship. He had received his Masters Degree in business, and I only had my BS in Exercise Science, not the most promising of degrees. I had recently finished a prestigious internship on the other side of the country, and could have had plenty of opportunities for jobs that I would fair well in. He was looking and receiving hits on numerous opportunities as well, but we both knew that his would pay much more than whatever job offer I would receive. My job searching would be put on hold until we knew what area he would be accepting one in. 
He had yet to fully be offered a job before catching him, and that night was ugly. I didn't know what to do, but I knew we were done. I gave him the ring back, and we still lived together for the following two weeks until he moved up to Chicago. Those two weeks I spent trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life now. We planned on a family, and we would both work until he could support us both while I became a stay at home mom. I know that sounds unrealistic, but there was no doubt in my mind with his background and experience that this was possible. As far as I know of, he now is very close to that destination with his new fiance. Now I was by myself with not a clue what to do. I knew I couldn't stay in the area where we had resided. I'm originally from Chicago, but since he was there with all of our mutual friends, I knew I had to get out. Within four weeks, I had decided and packed up my things to move to San Diego with a college friend.
San Diego seemed perfect for me because not only had I wanted to move to California since the age of 8, but my degree focused on fitness. Southern California has perfect weather 99% of the time, so I knew fitness was extremely prevalent here. I looked for ""wellness"" jobs because as far as I had been told, ""wellness centers"" were workout facilities where they had consultants to help you change your bad habits. In SD, I come to find a new type of ""wellness"" which is the holistic type. I'm not bashing on that way of life whatsoever, but it isn't quite what I was trained in or had experience with.
I took up a job at a for-profit college, and quickly had to resign as I did not morally agree with their views. My roommate heard of a job as a cart girl at a golf course, and I took that as it was full-time with benefits and I enjoy golf.
I had my good friend from college, and that was it. I met people quickly, but it seemed easier to meet other singles that enjoyed going out and partying. It's very easy to fall into the Peter Pan lifestyle out here when the service industry is large. Eventually to make ends meet, I acquired a second job as a marketing manager for a golf training facility. That became my full time job, and I kept my beverage cart job for two days a week. I worked everyday for four months straight, and it started to take a toll on me. All my friends would ask to hang out, but I would be working. I could always meet them out around 11pm and play catch up, and then hate my life the next morning. One night, I met them out and was left by my roommate. She had my wallet, and I had her phone. In my drunken state, I decided I was okay to drive since I didn't think a cab was an option without money. That is how I received my DUI, the second most life altering thing to happen to me. 
I've spent the last two years dealing with classes and payments, all while not having a license. During this time, my golf training center had a shady owner that gave all his employees a two week notice that he was selling his equipment to a golf course, and we wouldn't exactly have jobs. Luckily I was still employed by my original beverage cart job, and they took me back on full-time. We eventually got a new manager that had been lower on the totem pole, but promoted after our head of department left. It was known that she didn't like women her age, and four other females had been let go at her hand. It was finally my turn after accepting a second job working on the golf side (two different companies so it was okay). She purposely scheduled me to work on days I was working for golf, even though her schedule was completed after and was given mine before she made hers. They called me into the office and said I was no longer a fit for the company. I've now been working for them since November, and while I love what I do, I do not make a lot of money.
The registration on my car expired in February, and I was still without a license or insurance. I've received a couple of tickets, but never had enough money to pay them off. I completely cut down on my spending. No internet at home, broken phone, no haircuts, eating twice a day, and many other things. My parents have been as supportive as one could hope or expect. I made these horrible life choices to put myself in these situations. I couldn't afford my horrendous student loan payments on top of the DUI payments, so those went into default and put my mother's credit on a downward spiral. My credit isn't something I want to even think about. I've been trying to save to eventually get my registration and license back to apply for jobs that pay and I'm qualified for, but many of them require a ""reliable form of transportation"". I've convinced myself I'm in hole that I can't dig myself out of. I can't find a job because I don't have the money to get my license back, but I can't get my license back because I don't have the money. 
This morning I wake up to my car being towed. I have finally been caught. In order to get it back, I need to come up with the money and late fees for the tickets, insurance, registration and license, on top of the towing fees. I'm sitting here on my co-workers computer attempting to figure out what I can do to get out of this hole. I let myself spiral down a horrible path ever since finding that text to confirm I wouldn't be marrying the man of my dreams. I don't want anyone else make my mistakes. My parents were kind enough to loan me what money they have to help get my car back, but that still leaves me more broke and with a job that won't allow me to save up. I'm 27 years old, and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Thanks for listening...

28furq,2,2014-06-18,Hello! I am a student seeking your advice and feedback.,consultingeric,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/28furq/hello_i_am_a_student_seeking_your_advice_and/,"Hi!

I am currently a rising junior at UC Berkeley pursuing a degree in business administration. (I was recently accepted to the Haas School of Business for the class of 2016!) 

My career aspirations are to become a management consultant and I thought through this subreddit, I can be genuine about my concerns and ask for advice for my future.
My biggest dilemma and my main purpose for writing this post is because I was unsuccessful in securing any summer internship. Being the clueless sophomore I was, I spent the entire three months (March - May) blindly applying to online job posting on sites such as indeed.com hoping that at least one would reply (it did not happen). I also became an INROADS candidate but I was also unsuccessful in securing an internship through that process. So my questions are-

From this day on, how should I spend my summer to prepare myself to become successful when on-campus recruiting begins in the fall? (other than case practices, which I have been doing religiously)

Should I continue to apply to internships that are posted daily on indeed.com or am I just wasting my time?

If internships are out of the question at this point (totally my fault for not preparing myself), should I look for volunteering opportunities?

What and where is my best chance in securing an internship? (paid or unpaid, I just really want use this summer to be able to grow myself professionally, build my communication skills, and also build relationships with management consultants - a mentor I can talk to about my career aspiration)

Are there any management consulting book recommendations you have for a student such as myself? 


Also, I am a volunteer coordinator for a nonprofit organization on campus that pairs university students with 1st - 8th grade mentees and through this experience, I was able to realize how big of an impact mentors can make for their mentees. So I was wondering if there are any management consultants in the Los Angeles area with some free time, I can treat you out to some great German hotdogs in Little Tokyo or some Tom-n-Tom coffee in Koreatown! Such a coffee chat would be a tremendous help for my career aspirations and it would be fully appreciated.

Thank you in advance!


any constructive criticism to how I approached this subreddit would also be fully appreciated!

Joe slumped back into his chair, not like he needed a cup of coffee anyway. He folded his legs in his chair and typed away. Joe was an intern at the Six Company, his job was to patch the kernels on the web servers, upgrade web software, and to respond to any technical issues or requirements in the building.

Being the young man he was, he figured that instead of finishing the report, it would now be the best time to chat up with the pretty receptionist.

“Oh hey...Molly!” Reading off the name tag on the table.

“Yeah? Daniels right? I hear you're the new intern. Can I help you?”

“Well, uh.”

Joe walks away from the desk and heads into his cubicle. God, you blew it man. Why didn't you say anything to her? Well enough of that! You've got to finish up the report. 

Joe remembered that he had to face another obstacle before getting the report to the boss's office, he had to face the horribily slow printer that's adjacent to the receptionist's desk. Walking in a nonchalant matter, he looked past Molly and waited for the document to be printed. All reports were to be printed and placed on the boss's table every noon on Wednesday and Friday.

Oh hurry up you dumb machine. Though you're probably not dumb, you've got all that processing power and that. Hurry up though, I haven't got much time you know, that receptionist is giving me the eye and oh my god you are getting louder by the second, people are leaving their air-conditioned toilets just to see me potentially break this thing.

My family lived in a council estate, nice medium sized house but with lots of bad people around the neighbourhood.

I’m the 5th of seven children my whole family has been struggling with my mother for as long as I remember.
 My mother is amazing with baby's and absolutely adores them but doesn’t like them anymore when they grow a bit older, which we sadly realised is why there was so many of us, she would just disguard the older child and have a new baby.

 my eldest brother raised the first 4 of us then when he left home I was left to mind my younger brother and sister, from the age of 11 I had my brother and sister with me night and day, baby sitting long hours, cleaning and feeding them while cleaning the house from top to bottom and taking them with me to do the family food shopping, on weekends I would wake them up in the morning, make them their breakfast and bring them to the playground etc instead of going out with friends.

every morning I was treated to a slap in the face off my loving mother and before the slap had even woken me up she would always be screaming about something, every morning when I walked to school I would be crying then within 5 minutes of being home from school I would be crying again, they would keep me up late making dinner or cleaning and I would never get time to do my homework, I would always be late for school and was constantly in trouble in because of it.

as I grew older I always had a back bone thanks to my daddy always telling me how perfect I was and encouraging me with my hobbies when my mam wasn’t around.

Despite the fact that every day my dad laughed at the fact that my mam would call me fat, goofy, ugly a whore etc and he would beat me and torment me constantly without question because she told him to, all my good memories where of him so I didn’t even realise until this year that he had done something wrong to me

I was bullied out of my parent’s house at the ripe old age of 17, but before I left they got the whole family over so I could say in front of them that I was leaving of my own accord. I moved in with two men that I didn’t know and ended up in a short abusive relationship with one of the men, my parents dropped me off and never looked back, never visited, never contacted me. I had no money and my friend used to feed me while my SO (not abusive relationship guy) had to buy me essentials to survive, then when I lost my job I was homeless and my mam said I couldn’t come back home. Thankfully my friend’s mam took me in while I got back on my feet; I did an internship and started working in offices earning good money.

Over a year and a half ago my parents and I had an explosive fight that led to me not talking to them, I was confronted my every single member of our family and tried everything they told me to do, sit down and talk, only visit sometimes, just ignore what they say even though their being cruel. No matter what I tried it ended up in a huge fight or my parents completely denied everything, this went on for months which resulted in me getting a stomach ulcer (which no one in my family gave a fuck about) my mother rang me to say that if I was pregnant I should move back in with her and she would mind the baby, she was disappointed to find out that it was only the lining of my stomach being eroded by stress -_-

Then I found the raised by narcissists sub and cried for 2 days straight! I finally found out what was wrong with them, my mom is an abusive narc and my dad a pathetic enabler . . . . . the weight of the world had been lifted off my shoulders! 
A couple of days later I sent them my official NC message explaining everything and I blocked their numbers, I also wrote out a message as to why I had cut them out and sent it to all my siblings which for the most part they understood (every now and then the decide to give me shit again)

Ive been so happy since I went NC, I have now realise that one day I do in fact want my own children and the only reason I thought I didn’t was because I was deathly scared of turning into her, me and my SO have no more stress in our lives since I went NC, I’m getting on better with my sibling and have a WHOLE new perspective on how I treat people and on mental health. 

All in all I’m extremely proud of myself for how far ive come , I knew all along I needed to protect myself from these people and the RBN sub just gave me the push to confirm that I wasn’t crazy and that even though it was going to be hard I was going to get through. I hope I can give someone else the same support you have all given me over the last 2 years. This is an ongoing battle until the day either myself or my parents die but I know the whole way through it I have you lot to help me out


I love you all and I check in on my RBNibbling’s(what I call you ) everyday, you’ve helped me through the worst part of my life which is so weird to say because I don’t even know you. . . . I love you!

28gbp2,5,2014-06-18,"Got very sick, have no internship arranged for the summer. Too late? Should I freelance? Where to start? (repost from last week, didn't get any answers)",AladdinP,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28gbp2/got_very_sick_have_no_internship_arranged_for_the/,"The title basically says it all. I would like some kind of CS job experience this summer. Because I was ill for about 2 months, the plans I had before fell through, so now it's early summer and I am still without an internship. Is freelancing/working remotely a realistic option for someone without any work experience? For the record, I do have some impressive-sounding school projects to put on my resume, I'm strong in a number of practical programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, MIPS assembly, Javascript w/ other web technologies) and have learned the basics of a number of others. I have dedicated a lot of my own time to learning development best practices along with several technologies. After working with others, I would rank myself as in the top 10% of programmers in my class, although there is no way to communicate that on a resume.

I have a friend who dropped out of college to start a company that is willing to have me work with him for a few months, but

- The company has been around for 2 years and has been held afloat by funding from a startup accelerator in Cleveland. I know the initial funding was $20,000. They are probably provided free housing as well, since they live in a fairly swanky yet nearly completely empty apartment.

- There are only 3 employees, including my friend

- I suspect there will be low/no pay. When I asked him if there would be pay, he said ""Kind of? I think we could pay you, yeah."" His tone of voice didn't give me much confidence.

- The company is at a critical time in its lifecycle, as they only just demo'd their product after 2 years of work. This is a make-or-break moment, and I don't want to deal with the possibility of my internship being interrupted prematurely

As such, I would rather make money and save that connection as a last resort. I like the idea of working in a startup environment, but the simple truth is that I need cash right now."
28gi3d,4,2014-06-18,Looking to learn C++ on my own. My internship isn't helping like I'd hoped.,darkiron112,cpp_questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/28gi3d/looking_to_learn_c_on_my_own_my_internship_isnt/,"Hey everyone,

I'm a computer engineering student with an internship at a simulation company. Somehow, despite its ubiquity and necessity, my engineering classes teach no C++ and my employer demands its knowledge as all of our work is done with it.

Additionally, due to my lack of C++ prowess, my employer has me working almost exclusively in HTML/scriptwork for their program, leaving me with no real-world experience in the language itself.

I'm trying to learn, but with only a modest Java background and mostly scripting languages under my belt, I'm having trouble getting started. In addition, I work best under a guided environment such as a classroom with a professor to help me straighten out my mistakes.

An example of a guided tutorial that has helped me in the past, however basic it is, is [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com). I'm trying to find guided tutorials like it for compiled languages like C++, but I'm obviously having trouble. 

If I could only find one and learn in-depth what C++ is about and how it works (example, what the hell is a pointer and why does no other language mention them? and what is an Interface?), I could really boost my own ability to get work done at my job.

Does anyone here have a good resource for someone who is just getting started in C++ and compiled languages in general, wants to master the language, and benefits most from a (loosely) guided environment?

**TLDR;** Is there a *good* Codecademy/guided tutorial for C++ noobs? My internship isn't helping me at *all*.

Thank you very much, everyone!"

Recruiters go there every semester and hire students to work at the big 4 plus some startups.

The thing is, what can you do to get an internship when tou don't regularly have access to these recruiters? I don't think I go to a bad school, in fact it is a pretty good school for its software engineering program (also has clubs that win yearly engineering competitions in california), but I feel like the main barrier is the language (french), even though mostly everyone speaks english on a regular basis.

I know the school has partnerships with over 100 organizations/companies around the globe, especially in the US, for internships and studying abroad, but nothing in the valley. I also know Google (from their Montreal offices) and Microsoft (more rarely) come to the school for networking events, but it's not that common.

So, how can I get in contact with the appropriate people to make myself known? I have good marks in the program and I am part of multiple extracurricular projects, but I just need to know where to begin because it seems so unattainable. I really want to know what it's like to live up down there and an internship would be a good opportunity."

Y'all seem to enjoy my tales of woe (and/or WHOAH!) from my little Midwest cable company internship.

Little background: I'm working here for the summer to make a little money between semesters at college, and to build my resume. Typical internship stuff. We're located in a town about 15 miles away from my hometown, and this place is known for having *VERY* high-achieving citizens who have many discussions about books and such. And by that, I mean it's a buncha rednecks who wouldn't understand a late notice on their bill if it smacked them in the face.

We're not tech support per se, but we handle billing and work with tech support closely. We fob tickets off on each other, complain about management, and hang out in the breakroom avoiding work together.

We recently hired a new supervisor. Now, I can understand having a bit of a hard time getting used to things at a new office. However, she's been here about a month longer than I have, I've learned how to do everything she does and more, and I'm the intern. This is a story not about a dumb customer, but our dumb supervisor. We'll call her DS.

When a customer moves, we have to update a couple databases. And really, what that entails is you opening their account, clicking ""update"" on the service and billing addresses, and typing in the new address. It's a little more complicated than that, but for the most part, that's all we have to do.

DS went on vacation this week. However, last month, she took a phone call from a customer who wanted to move their service/billing address. Simple enough, right?

Ha! Don't make me laugh.

She told them that we'd take care of it, opened a ticket, then closed it, saying she'd fixed everything. Not even close.

Yesterday, the techs were supposed to go out and do an activation for this customer, and, tools in hand, bravery in their hearts, and, quite possibly, whiskey in their water bottles (we deal with VERY dumb customers), they went to the service address on the customer's account. That's where I and my brave ~~sidekick~~ coworker who trained me come in. Well, mostly her, I just sat to one side and died of laughter. We'll call her B.

The scene: INT CABLE_COMPANY FRONT OFFICE, DAY.

A TUMBLEWEED DRIFTS THROUGH, WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE A) WE'RE INSIDE, AND B) THIS IS IOWA.

TWO INTREPID CUSTOMER SUPPORT EMPLOYEES SIT AT THEIR DESKS, SIFTING THROUGH TICKETS DILIGENTLY.

AN EAGLE SCREECHES IN THE DISTANCE. THE PHONE RINGS.

&gt;""Thank you for calling Cable_Company, this is B!""

&gt;""Yeah, this is T (one of our techs).""

&gt;""What's up?""

&gt;""The activation we're doing? Yeah, that house burned down. As in, it is a pile of rubble. And it's not terribly recent.""

[confused_nathan_fillion.gif](https://imgur.com/2VzmC)

all_of_my_wat.jpg

We're slightly confused by this. Why would the techs get sent to a burned down house...? Then, B realizes what's going on, and I see a vein start throbbing in her forehead. She opens up the customer's ticket list, and finds the closed ticket from DS, which states that the customer's address has been updated, and that their old address had BURNED DOWN. She then opens the account. No changes have been made to their address since they became a customer. So, we've known for forever that their house burned down, but she didn't feel that that would be, you know, relevant information for the techs to know. And because of the mix-up, we can't do the install for a long time. WONDERFUL.

We got it sorted out, but that's another thing to put in our file of ""Stuff That DS Can't Do Without Screwing Up"". Also in that file: Running our credit card machine, locking doors, and counting money.

TL;DR: You'd make a terrible Dale Carnegie.

I've also been an intern at a company, since January 2014. This current employer of mine has average to above average ratings on salary&amp;benefits. Plus, I've always gotten good reviews from my supervisor on my work, so I was expecting an above average offer for a full-time position. 

However, I was only offered 50K, while others whom I've helped with (what I consider) simple CS concepts got slightly better offers at different companies. 

Thus, this offer feels like a slap to the face for me, cause I know I'm worth more since I already have 1.5 years of experience and a good GPA. Plus, I've only started my CS major/career not even 3 years ago, and am already in a position to graduate. 


My current plan is to accept this offer because I have one week to respond. But I also have interviews coming up with Amazon, and a couple of other CS firms. Plus, after such an offer, I will put more effort into actively looking for better jobs. Thus, my questions are below. 

Questions:

1. If I get a better offer, would it be okay to ""burn the bridge"" and leave my current situation?

2. How soon is too soon to leave a company?
I still have a few months on my lease, so staying put for a few months is the plan, but after that I want to go go go!


Thank you in advance, and I look forward to reading your replies as I really need the advice of others with a lot more experience than me. 
Best of luck in your endeavors as well!"

So this past Friday A invites me over to a small party. I bring my 5 or so people with me and when we get there it totals not quite 20 people, which is totally my scene. I started doing a nightly ritual before I go out to try and get out of introvert mode, 3 sets of pushups while blasting Iron Maiden then a cup of coffee, have friends coming show up to my place first for an hour or so, get the the party early so there isn't an overwhelming amount of people and you can greet people as they come in.


I did all of these things, I was in the zone, I was having fun. Girl B I had met a few times before, she'd been to big house parties at my house but I'd never really talked to her. When we switched from playing flip cup to drinking Jenga (things you have to do written on the blocks) I started talking to her a bit. She was flirting with the dude who lived there and he was being an AFC, but whatever. I flirted with A a bit too. B was responding well to kino and wasn't being a tease which she's known to do hard.


Eventually my friends wanted to leave, but A and B and I wanted to keep playing Jenga so I told them to leave me there, and then it was only 6 of us, including the 3 guys that lived there. AFC guy gave up on B and went to sleep, so did another, so it was just 4 of us playing Jenga having a great time.


After we finished the 5th game or so A and B decided to leave.

**What I should have done:** *""I don't know these guys so I'll leave with you. No, my house is out of the way I'll just crash with one of you.""*

**What I did:** *""My house is out of your way I'll just stay here.""*

As soon as I said it I realized I was an idiot. I slept there and one of the guys who lived there drove me home in the morning.
Overall I had a great time but made one little mistake.


Be careful guys, outcome independence helps a lot but you can't forget to ABC.

I am a current University Student seeking a STEM major, and I got off the phone with a potential employer. Initially the company called me to set up an interview about another position I applied to last week.

I've been seeking an internship since before the Spring semester ended, and I'm happy someone is finally interested in me. Now the thing is; the pay isn't too great, and the commute to this place would be about 30-40 mins one way for me. That being said I'm not sure if I should accept for $8.50/hr if the interview (which is tomorrow) goes well. 

Do you guys think I would be able to negotiate salary on this kind of thing? And even if I accept I'm not sure if the experience is worth the pay. I used to make anywhere from $9.50-$15 per hour at previous jobs."

[Hey Sean, I'm starting from zero in the graphic novel world, meaning I've read nothing. Where would you steer me out of the titles you've worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/ciaf86d?context=5)|It really depends on what type of stories you go for. Walking Dead is our most popular, and it's fucking great, but by now you probably now whether it's for you or not. We got a couple flavors of crime: Thief of Thieves (heists), Dead Body Road (revenge), &amp; Ghosted (supernatural). Manifest Destiny is our newest hit; pure action/adventure and monster hunting across America. Invincible is by Robert Kirkman, the creator of The Walking Dead, and it's really the only superhero book you ever need to read. Poke around www.skybound.com to check them out, and maybe you'll find something else that peaks your interest.
[Hey Sean! Love the work you do. I'm a big fan of having multiple points of view in the letter section. AND the fact that you still make a point of even having a letter section. So thanks for that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia8bst?context=5)|As long as we get letters, we'll have letters pages. That interaction is hugely important for us b/c a) we're blowhards and b) we all get to know each other better. I'm actually supposed to be doing Letter Hacks now, shit.
[Question #2: With a new comic book movie coming out every week or so how come there are no Image books on the big screen? Or even direct to video? I think Invincible would work wonderfully in an animated fashion like DC's animated movies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia8bst?context=5)|2) I honestly don't know, but I think most Image books would be better suited to television anyways; that's certainly a place you'll see more of Skybound. A defunct Invincible screenplay exists somewhere... and an animated movie would be dope.
[What do you typically do as a comic book editor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2q07?context=5)|Develop new titles. Work with the creative teams to assemble the book, which covers everything from story notes to setting schedules. Work with the fine folks at Image for production/marketing/friendship purposes. Tell Jonathan Chan at Image that I will buy him beers for his help and never do it. There's more, but this is what's coming to mind first.
[Umm, I put together a company newsletter, can I intern? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3ey6?context=5)|Current intern Stephen aka ""The Little Rooster"" would be upset if you displaced him.
[How did you become a comic book editor and do you have any advice for people interested in being one as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3ttj?context=5)|I used to edit romance novels and applied for a job in collected editions at DC. Bob Harras hired me, and when he was promoted, he suggested I apply for mainline editorial, which was during the development of the New 52.
 |Advice... living in either LA or NYC helps. Check that Warner Bros career website. They'll be hiring plenty of folks in the next 10 months. 
[I'm from New York actually so this advice helps me a great deal. Thank you so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia6fkq?context=5)|Good luck! Marvel didn't hire me before I even worked for DC, so be persistent. People say it helps to know someone, but I had no connections to anyone in comics, so anything's possible.
[What was the most difficult arc of The Walking Dead to edit? And has there ever been anything in the story you have felt particularly strong about editing out or changing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia39cj?context=5)|All Out War, but only b/c of the accelerated schedule. Charlie and Stefano and Cliff are champs and really none of the issues came down to the wire. Hardest part was doing Letter Hacks b/c you'd be responding to an issue that just came out, and seriously guys, so many letters.
 |Guys names Bernie, always try to edit them out. 
[Hey Sean -Thanks for the AMA!- more for your romance and urban fantasy editing- Best thing about working with authors and worst? Have you ever hated a book you've edited and if so, how do you deal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2pw8?context=5)|Exchanging ideas to help fulfill a writer's vision, that's the best. The collaboration. The worst... when you're not synched up. You gotta be on the same page.
 |Hated... sure. You try to figure out what about the project appeals to its intended audience and make that work. But you have to treat it as professionally as any other project.
[If you could change one thing that has happened in the walking dead comics, what would it be? also favorite character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/ciaalvj?context=5)|I like what they did with Shane on the TV show, so that dynamic could've been played out further in the book. But his death gave that first arc a helluva finish, so I'm not inclined to mess with anything.
 |Favorite character... Jesus. He's got a certain je nais se quoi.
[How are you? Quick question, What's your favorite comic series that you have read/reading?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia30yu?context=5)|My favorite series ever is Preacher, with a lot of Vertigo from that period coming up close behind (Transmet, 100 Bullets, Deadenders). Planetary's pretty perfect as well. Love &amp; Rockets for sure. 
[I hear Preacher is being made into a TV series as well...will you watch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3cl7?context=5)|With Seth Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg &amp; Sam Catlin involved, for sure. You hire the right talent, then set them loose.
[Hey Sean, just wanna say that the books being published by Skybound and Image Comics are some of the highest caliber comics ever to be published!  I was wondering, how has the increasing digital market affected how you edit? Are you more conciouss now of the restrictions of digital comics, and as such edit works to fit that medium?  Thanks so much for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2jn8?context=5)|Digital hasn't really affected my editing process. We did try out releasing our TECH JACKET DIGITAL miniseries digitally--which is why we called it DIGITAL, I guess--and that worked so well, we're launching a new regular series by the same creators next month... but right now print still makes up the majority of our sales.
[What comic do you enjoy getting to edit before it comes out from Skybound? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia66lw?context=5)|My current favorite book to edit is the one we'll be announcing next month. I'm biased towards the shiny new object b/c you're always wondering how they'll be received once they're in readers' hands.
[Out of everyone in the Invincible Universe, why Tech Jacket for a reboot??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2n5i?context=5)|He's got the most potential. Really opens up this incredible world of science adventure... which Joe Keatinge and Khary Randolph and Dave and Emilio are realizing perfectly.
[Follow up question: what has been the most disturbing book/issue you have edited?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia7an1?context=5)|Hmmm... Clone traffics in some pretty disturbing characters/imagery. In Clone #13 an electronic bull ejaculator is used on a human. Also, pretty much all of the DC Flashpoint miniseries. Lo siento.
[Wait, so the Tech Jacket who fought in the Viltriumite War isn't the same Tech Jacket going now?  Where can I find more information on this?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia4kuh?context=5)|It's TOTALLY the same Tech Jacket. NOT a reboot. TECH JACKET DIGITAL picks up during the Viltrumite War (where Zack's fighting those Invincibles). The new ongoing tells a brand new story, with new villains and lots of other new stuff. Out July 2nd.
[As an editor you must get really immersed in the series' that you are involved with, that being said; who was the hardest character that you had to see die in the walking dead comics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia5f8o?context=5)|TWD &amp; MY LIFE SPOILERS.
 |It was from before I was editor, but Glenn. The length and intensity of that sequence... so much dread. And within a month I got the job offer from Skybound, so it all feels like part of the same thing.
[Good afternoon! My question is in regards to Clone. I am LOVING this book but want to know if there is going to be a chance for any spin-off titles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3g12?context=5)|We don't really approach any of our titles looking for spin-offs. We're more interested in continuing our relationships with David &amp; Wade &amp; Aaron &amp; Juanjo, and developing more projects with all those guys.
[Was there any particular storyline in The Walking Dead that you didn't really like and felt like you had to steer in another direction?  What was the original storyline?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia352b?context=5)|For Robert's titles, I act more as first reader, and  sounding board. And for when he names a character Bernie when he just killed off another character name Bernie. 
[What's the weirdest letter you've received from a fan of TWD (or any other book\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2m82?context=5)|I try to print the weirdest ones... except when people TRY to be weird. I can smoke those fools out, mostly because of their strange persistence.
[How much of season 5 of walking dead have crossed the editing room floor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/ciaf5pb?context=5)|Honestly, I have no idea. I work on the comics. But I'm guessing they've probably filmed the first couple episodes by now.
[In the most recent letters to the editor (is this what they're still called?\), it seemed there was some reprimanding for revealing how long exactly had passed between #126 and #127. Is this because Kirkman wants it to be vague on purpose or doesn't want to reveal it just yet? Can you tell us how long has actually passed :\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/ciauins?context=5)|Letter Hacks! Not reprimanding, more a reminder that anything said in Hacks is not continuity. And that Robert should read the letters page more carefully. :)
 |How much time has passed? A while. It's for sure been a while.
[What was is like coming on at the beginning of Outcast, versus editing something already established like Invincible and The Walking Dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3h6f?context=5)|Main difference was starting up that working relationship with Paul Azaceta. He's an incredible talent, so that wasn't that hard at all.
[Your head must be full of amazing comic book secrets that you hold in until the comic is released. What's that like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2gud?context=5)|We're moving so fast over here that I don't get to delight in the full amazingness. But my secrets can be purchased for beer.
[I will buy you many beers! What's your favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2q1j?context=5)|Since I've moved out west, I really enjoy beer by Ballast Point and Modern Times. So many great breweries out here.
[As a Texan I had no idea what these beers were. I have since googled. I'm gonna need a Bourbon Barrel Aged Piper Down Scottish Ale. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia367m?context=5)|Too many words for a beer. And hey, I like Lone Star and Shiner as well!
[Seriously, how much of your day is ""work"" and how much is ""play""??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3nmj?context=5)|The good thing is that most of it feels like play, even when it's work. 
[Have you met any of the stars from The Walking Dead? If so, were they friendly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia457a?context=5)|Yes, they were on their best behavior. Stars: they're just like us.
[Cool. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia4c6z?context=5)|I just saw Edge of Tomorrow last night, and that was pretty great. Was not a fan of Godzilla or X-Men. I refuse to have any more conversations about why I didn't like them though. Boring characters make boring movies.
[Do you have any favorite movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia4c6z?context=5)|Blue Velvet is a longtime favorite. The Thing. Alien. Aliens. What about YOU? 
[Hi, Sean. Nate Costa here from Fanboy Planet. Will you be at SDCC and can I get an interview with you for our podcast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia32js?context=5)|Let's talk offline and figure something out. Send an email to thewalkingdead@skybound.com and I'll get it.
[Now that Mark/Invincible is single and vulnerable, how long until Amber is back in the picture? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2y0u?context=5)|Let's worry about Robot first, and see who survives that before we consider romance.
[Someone should tell Robot he's being kind of a dick.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3g0b?context=5)|Plenty of folks will TRY to.
 |And also, is he really being a dick?
[Much like Walter McCarty, I'd like to take a moment for love.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3i0d?context=5)|[Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbEQfmwh-fg)
[How far ahead do you know what's going to happen in Walking Dead? Like what issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cib3oai?context=5)|When the script hits my inbox. So #130 right now.
[Hi Sean. Brian from Skybound here. I heard you used to work at Harlequin (popular romance publisher\). Do you know what a bodice is? Are you adept at tearing them off? Should we get a PS4 or an XBOX One for the office?  Big fan!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3iun?context=5)|I know what a bodice is. I've never dated anyone that's worn one. PS4 all the way. Get back to work!
[Which of your writers is the hardest to work with? Easiest to work with :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2m9g?context=5)|Robert Kirkman. Everyone but Robert Kirkman. 
[Do you dislike Survival Instinct as much as nearly everyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia5y2b?context=5)|I think that goes without saying.
[I love how open and frank that was. I know some people would cower and pander to a product just because it's slightly of the same brand, or comes under the same umbrella, as what they work on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia77qi?context=5)|Skybound had nothing to do with that game. Any games coming from Skybound Interactive partnerships will be games we enjoy playing. Like the Telltale game. And they just released a TWD digital pinball that's very fun to play. 
[How often do you get friends or random people asking you to make comic versions of themselves? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2g3c?context=5)|Is this your way of trying to get in a book?
[Invincible is one of my all time favourite series. I see it mentioned here all the time as well. Can you please kindly yell at Kirkman and ask him to release some Invincible toys. or some more statues, or any kind of merchandise. Invincible needs some love too! Unless you know if there are some things already planned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2vdz?context=5)|We'll have some new Invincible merch for release at SDCC (announcements next week!). And that will be a tease for things to come later this year.
[Please provide your thoughts on this casting idea: Gilbert Gottfried as the Joker in a Batman film. Before you answer, consider the fact that Gottfried IS the Joker without the murder, crime, and criminal insanity. Is there any way that wouldn't work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3l2b?context=5)|I have no problem with that. Someone needs to photoshop that and make it so.
[Hey Sean,  Avid reader of Image books and otherwise - I'm glad you're doing this AMA, because I've always been curious about Skybound's branding - or lackthereof.  Many of my friends, avid comic readers, don't even know the name Skybound - and some of them read TWD. I've had several friends just assume ""Skybound"" was a merchandising company. Even with the success of AMC's TWD and the TWD book, the Skybound logo is rarely seen or the name heard. For one of the most successful comic publishers out there (and definitely the most successful of the Image companies\), this seems really strange.  When people talk about TWD, or even Manifest Destiny, people don't say ""Skybound"" - they say ""Image.""  With such a slew of successful books, why does Skybound care so little about name-branding - and, on the heels of that, with the success of Manifest Destiny and Invincible and the Invincible Universe, why does it seem like you just rally around TWD?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia2nwr?context=5)|We care about our branding a lot. We've put in a lot of work to individualize the trade dress across all our titles; before it was a more standard look. Over the next couple of years, you'll see the logo in new places, for instance, our movie AIR, or the video games our Interactive division is working on. But we also depend on fans like you to set these folks straight :) 
[Rereading, I think I may have come off a little antagonistic - I just love the Invincible Universe and get irked when people don't understand that it's not ""just another Image book.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28e92i/iama_sean_mackiewicz_editor_of_the_walking/cia3186?context=5)|There is no such thing as ""just another Image book""! That's what makes Image so great. That's Marvel/DC's corner.

28h73y,0,2014-06-18,"Very fortunate recent graduate, considering implications of CPO BMW purchase",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/28h73y/very_fortunate_recent_graduate_considering/,"I recently graduated from college. I have zero debt. I had full ride scholarships (merit) because I went to lesser known schools when I could have gone to top schools.  I also worked for my whole college career, sometimes I had two engineering internships at the same time, so I could have weeks during the school year where I made good money. I also had some pretty good summer internships. This means I graduated with about $45k in assets ($5k roth, $40k savings account).  I didn't do much investing, that was probably a mistake. In college I had a cheap car, cheap rent, and I didn't buy a lot of stuff, but I did spend a lot of money on eating out. 

I also got a pretty good job in part because I had a ton of work experience, did well in school and had a bunch of research, and I majored in a lucrative field. 

My incomes are as below:
1) After tax take home pay: $5300

2) 401K Contributions (mine and employer included): $1600 (I'm at the max contribution).

3) Performance Bonus (nominal, if its lower I may not have a job, it can be higher)  and Stock (Stock, not options) divided by 12 over the year: $1000 (after tax). 

Total Income: $7900 a month after tax. 

Total Monthly Spending Budget
Note: All expenses include taxes and some are ""budgets"" i.e. I spend no more then that amount. 

1) Rent and all Utilities: $1050 (this is with room mates, the area where I live subsidized university housing is $950 a month). I could have had cheaper rent if I lived farther away from work.

2) Phone: $46 a month 

3) Netflix/Spotify: $20 a month

4) Car Gas: $100 a month

5) Car Insurance for a BMW I was quoted $140 a month. This can be less depending on the car. 2011 BMW was about $25 more a month then a 2011 civic.

6) Travel: $300. I visit a friend or a family once per month. 

7) Clothes: $50

8) Misc Expenses: $400 (depends on month, this is for gifts, new electronics, video games etc). I have a yearly budget of $4800 and since these expenses are not required I won't spend a dime after that.

9) Renters Insurance: $15 per month (Required by contract) 

10) Entertainment: $200 a month (Bars, movies, concerts etc). 

11) Food: $500 a month (includes eating out). 

This means my monthly expenses are: $2800 a month. My ""required"" monthly expenses are about $1900 a month (minus travel, misc expenses, and entertainment. Obviously I could eat out less too and cut that down to like $1600 or so). So a six month emergency fund would be $12,000. My total savings is about $5100 a month. 

My previous vehicle is under my parents name. It is a 20 year old Japanese car that is dented, scratched, rusted, (one head light is taped on), the head lights are shorted to the speakers (no music at night), there is no longer any suspension (its been gone for 2 years), and it probably needs new brakes. There are a bunch of other minor problems, the power locks don't work on one side, the antenna is gone etc. The car also makes funny noises when you turn the steering wheel too hard and when you drive it. I would guess to repair it would cost about $2K to $3k. I would also need to ship it to my current location which is about $1K. My parents would gift me the vehicle if I wanted it, but they think I should get a new car. The car was great in college though, the ""core"" of the car was reliable (engine, transmission etc). Also the car's been in my family for 20 years so I have sentimental attachment to it. It also just got too damaged when somebody hit and ran, compressing the hood, putting two giant scratches through it, and also knocking out a head light. 

I'm kind of comparing two options here. Option A is I get a fully loaded 2011 civic with about 50k miles on it for $15K after tax. Option B is I get a CPO BMW 3 series with 20k miles on it for about $25k to $30k (after taxes). The civic has no warranty, the BMW I was looking at was made in 2012 so it has 2 years of ""zero maintenance"" and two more years of CPO warranty. I really like nice cars. Like I've been drawing cars and knew a lot about them since I was 5 years old. I also like the e90 BMW, the straight six engine, and the exterior design. I also love driving the BMW. I would also consider a WRX, but I kind of like some luxury which is why I was going BMW. My original plan was to keep my current car for six months to 2 years longer and then get a new car. However....since the suspension repair was $900 I didn't want to buy that and I didn't want to drive 25 hours with no suspension in a car of questionable reliability.  Now I'm debating a lot between a loaded civic and a BMW. My personal justification is I had money saved up for a trip to Europe, but I decided to hang out with my college friends and my family instead, and that I started working a month before a lot of other new hires at my place of work. So that adds about $10k to my savings. 

Anyways I know buying an expensive car is a bad idea from a finance decision. I'm just trying to gauge how bad of an idea it is. I'm keeping the BMW under 25% of my gross pre-tax income. I can buy the car straight cash (however this would leave me with just an emergency fund, and it might be too low to be an emergency fund), but with a CPO BMW specifically, they were offering me 3% interest through a "" new college grad"" type of deal, so I could build credit, in which case I was considering a $5k to $10k loan to build credit. I would have preferred to buy the BMW six months from now with $30k more in savings, but that didn't work out. If I got a civic I feel like I'd be wanting to upgrade to the BMW soon. 

For short term goals, I would like to buy a condo and rent it out to other people (with me living in one of the rooms) after 3 years. This would cut rent out of my budget. For long term goals, I would like to save $1million in 13 years. I'm in my early to mid 20s. With a 5% interest rate I exceed this goal with $5100 a month in savings. I would also like to be financially independent. So from that end it seems like I'm on track even if I buy a BMW. My heart says yes, but my brain is wary. Basically I'm trying to gauge the magnitude of my stupidity if I buy a CPO BMW. "
28hcpz,1,2014-06-18,Do US companies recognize Chinese internship experiences as valid?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28hcpz/do_us_companies_recognize_chinese_internship/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm an undergraduate student studying math and CS, and I'm trying to find a better internship opportunity for the summer of 2015. I'm especially interested in working with cyber security or national defense someday-- companies like Boeing or the the government are ideal.

Currently, I'm only interning as a web developer for a startup, so I'd really like to enhance my resume by interning during the winter this year. My uncle happens to own a company in China that works with cloud computing, so I thought that this would be a great opportunity for me to learn a few things over winter break. However, my dad (who works for Boeing), mentioned that some US companies don't even recognize experiences in China as valid. Is this true, and if so, which kinds of companies do this? I'm trying to get some more information on this so I can decide if I should take on the opportunity in China for the winter break. 

Thank you!"
28hd6e,0,2014-06-18,34M4F Enough is enough.,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/28hd6e/34m4f_enough_is_enough/,"You're a middle management employee at our firm, a steady corporate ladder climber.  At the moment, your career has stalled out, and the only one ahead of you right now is the vice-president, aka me.

To make matters worse, I'm the CEO's son.  I'm an alright guy, but a bit of a douchebag.  I take my fatherly security net to the extreme and push my boundaries more than I should.  The last few years have been quite successful for the firm.  Bonuses are up and we have more and more company parties.  After posting our biggest quarter ever, my Dad decided to throw a real bash, and the whole company has been invited.  

Booking out the nicest hotel in town, as well as covering employee rooms plus their food and drinks, made sure everyone showed up.  There were rumors of my unwanted sexual advances, and even some whispers of rape.  As you enjoyed the evening with your co-workers, you saw it happen out of the corner of your eye.

While chatting up one of the company interns, I diverted her attention and slipped something into her drink.  

The anger boiled up inside you.  You obviously resented me from an career perspective, as you were twice the employee I was.  But to see my preying on women like that was the last straw.  Making your way to our table, you began chatting both of us up, and managed to divert our attention toward a fellow co-worker acting a fool.  You swapped the drinks, where I would get a taste of my own medicine.  Little did I know.  A smug grin plastered across your face as you made your way back to your table. 

A couple of hours later, the party was winding down and most everyone had gone back to their rooms.  You finished up the last free drink of the evening and headed back toward your room.  Stepping off the elevator, you kick your heels off as you stroll down the hallway.  As you pull your room key out of your purse you catch an open hotel door out of the corner of your eye.  Something about open hotel doors lead to curiosity, just like a car wreck, it's hard not to look.  

As you peek in, you chuckle to yourself.  Apparently your little switcheroo worked.  I'm half undressed, flopped onto the bed, with my legs still dangling onto the floor.  Suit jacket discarded into a heap on the floor, one shoe by the door, the other still on my foot.

As you continue walking down the hall, you stop for a moment.  ""This is too good to pass up"" as you turn and head back.  You pull out your camera phone, to take an embarrassing shot to text to your co-workers.  As you tip toe in the room, you notice an assorted array of items on the dresser.  Various sex toys, cuffs, a blindfold, whips, even what looks like a cattle prod.  Your humor moves to rage.  This sadistic fuck was going to use this on the intern.  

You started to leave, but something stopped you.  Not this time.  Enough is enough.  You turn around and shut the door behind you.

If this sounds up your alley, feel free to pick up from here and we'll move along.  :)  "
28hdrf,3,2014-06-18,I failed out of college- twice. What colleges would consider a transfer student like me?,Hopeful_Transfer,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/28hdrf/i_failed_out_of_college_twice_what_colleges_would/,"
My story is quite long, so please bear with me. When I was 17, I went to a large state university and performed very poorly. To be clear, I didn't get kicked out, but I was put on academic warning during my second semester and I left shortly thereafter. I moved back home and signed up at the local community college where I did ok the first fall semester because my family was on my back, but pretty much failed spring semester. Unfortunately, at the time, I did not have the maturity or the motivation to complete my degree. 

After this, I got a full time job where I worked for two years. During that two year period, I completed an internship that changed my life and gave me a firm idea of what I want to do career wise. I also received treatment for the depression that was, in part, crippling me. At 21, I went back to community college. Since then, I've been on the Dean's List every semester while continuing to work full time.

In December, I will be graduating from my local college with an Associates degree. I am supposed to start looking at colleges to transfer to and I'm terrified that no school will accept me due to my less than stellar academic record. I am a member of several organizations at my local college and I've managed to raise my cumulative GPA to 3.1, but I am haunted by the mistakes I made when I was younger. I was very immature, and I suffered from severe depression, and I did not take my education seriously-- I take full responsibility for that. After working a menial job full time, I fully understand just how important higher education is, and I would even like to pursue a masters degree in the future.

Are there any colleges out there who would consider a student like me? I'm now 22 and in Fl, if that helps. If you managed to read the whole thing, thank you.

I am currently a Sophomore at Boise State University, majoring in IT Management.  I hold entry level certs such as Comptia A+, Net+(Taking the test soon), Sec+, IT Strata, and a bunch of low level Microsoft certs.  Computer Networking sparked a lot of interest for me when I went to a technical four year high school, and I decided that I want to head into Networking once I finished college and earned my degree.

I did an internship as a IT Technician for a candle company when I was a junior in high school and I was an IT support student when I was a junior and senior as well.  Currently, I am a Student QA Specialist for my university, learning about the different sides of the IT world.  I am thinking of grabbing the CCENT by the end of my sophomore year or better yet, CCNA since I am coming off fresh Net+ knowledge.  

However, at the same time, I've been reading that certs with no experience means nothing.  In other words, a CCNA would be nothing on my resume.  That's why I was wondering if I could get some tips from Network Admins and Network Engineers on how I should proceed.

TL;DR Currently a Sophomore at Boise State studying IT Management, as well holding entry level certs.  I am thinking of studying my CCENT/CCNA after I take my Net+, but I have little experience working with Cisco equipment and medium size businesses.  Wondering how to proceed from here."

My coworker has to write a script so that it turns off hibernate and standby on a desktop, but leaves it on for a desktop when run through multiple machines. When he asked me, I originally said a battery, but apparently the Windows OS will mistake a UPS for a battery, so we can't use that to differentiate. How can a program tell the difference between a laptop and a desktop, so he can incorporate it into a script?

EDIT: So far we've considered AC vs. DC but a UPS throws that off. We (as well as /u/sking301) suggested wireless, but we're dealing with just short of 1000 machines, and there are probably more than a handful of wireless cards in desktops. I also suggested 2.5"" vs. 3.5"" HDDs and RPM but SSDs and green HDs throw that off also.

SECOND EDIT: I also suggested DIMM vs. SO DIMM but apparently ITX motherboards throw that out the window along with everything else. We're starting to think software is the way to go, as opposed to hardware

THIRD FUCKING EDIT: A lot of our customers use docking stations, so resolution/external monitors and speakers won't work. We're considering touchpad drivers, but it will be hard to differentiate without writing a pretty big script.

Thank you all for looking at this by the way. I'm just a lowly intern and would really like to bring a solution to my bosses"

28ho80,0,2014-06-18,Restructuring 4 Years of Credit Card Debt,2014Student,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/28ho80/restructuring_4_years_of_credit_card_debt/,"Hi all,

I graduated from college this year with ~$8000 of credit card debt. Despite having a credit score of &gt;700, I'm dealing with really high APR's (~20%). 

I'm starting a stable job in NYC in August. I'll be making $65,000 with a $5000 signing bonus, and living at home for the first 5 months. I had an internship with this company last summer, and I know that with Federal, social security, medicare, state, and local, I'll only be bringing home about 65% of that $65,000, which leaves me with roughly $3500/mo. 

My current plan is to pay off most of the debt, maybe ~$7000 by the time I move out. I anticipate on spending about $1000/mo on personal. This means that I'll be paying ~$1500/mo on debt, leaving me with only $1000/mo in savings. I would really like to have ~$10,000 saved up by the time I move out so that I can better negotiate with landlords in NYC (with no guarantor, I'll have to put up a few months rent at lease signing). 

Here's my question, is there any easy way of restructuring this debt to more favorable terms with a bank? Paying it off in the long run is really the most attractive option for me, as this job has huge, and guaranteed, income potential. This is also why I'm insisting on spending so much on personal.

TLDR:
*$1250/mo in expenses
*$3500/mo pay
*$5000 starting bonus
*$8000 in credit card debt with high APR
Can I restructure this debt through a bank?

Edit: I'll be contributing about $240/mo to my parents for letting me stay at home.
Edit 2: I have well over double the 8k in my combined credit limit. Keeping a balance will not hurt my credit, and I'm planning on closing 2 of my 5 cards after I pay it down."

*Nine months later*

The months stuck in Los Alamos had been cruel. The aging AC, designed to cool experiments, not people, lead to a rack of winter coats by the entrance. Anne was increasingly deliberated by her swollen belly: her child, Yusuf’s child, the bastard. *I can’t believe he got me pregnant*, she thought when the disposable tester, taken for safe measure, beeped and lit up with a green light. 

Langton had met them at the elevator with with handcuffs in one hand and a bandaged, blinded Howard Moon in the other. They were whisked away to New Mexico in a blacked-out jet, threatened with death should they leak the details of the Higgs drive’s acquirement. Yusuf was smeared as an experiment gone mad and a terrorist. The official story was that the drive was recovered from a derelict Nurhuil ship conveniently drifting in Terran space. 

As soon as Langton learned that Anne was pregnant, he changed death to abortion. Anne was planning to abort anyway, but some geneticists were brought in by Langley to make sure she didn’t. They made her an experiment. They were stumped at how this happened. The genetic meddling of Yusuf’s kind somehow made them genetically compatible. Anne was given the worst torture possible: carrying the hybrid to term. If there was an abomination, a Minotaur, it would be riding in Anne’s womb.

That’s all they called it. The hybrid, the bastard. She often took off days to just lie in bed, looking up at the ceiling, hoping Yusuf could hear her silent screams of her hate for him. She also walked around the mountains surrounding the lab when she could, looking to get in touch with his spirit to give him a piece of her mind or a cliff to jump off of. At the end of each crisis, however, she could only be angry at herself, skulking back to her quarters.

One day, she found the strength to work again. The administrators were kind enough to coop her up in a desk. Wrinkles had appeared on her eyelids some weeks before. She gained a few pounds. Looking over the latest results from the super-heavy-element-vs-Higgs-field tests, she suddenly felt her stomach jump. She double-checked the results: nothing out of the ordinary. The jumping happened again, but it wasn’t a jump, it was a shove. She reached over to the phone and instinctively called Patel.

“The child, Sam. It’s *here*.”

---

The next few hours were the most painful in her life. Just pain being ratcheted higher and higher, blood curdling screaming. She hated this *thing*, stuck in her body. She wanted it out. It came out with surprising ease after she screamed at how much she hated it. The doctors at the foot of her bed were the ones to get the first look.

“Well, it looks human enough.”

“Is it a boy or girl?” The doctor decided to pop quiz the intern.

“It’d be pretty hard, female hyenas have –""

The doctor almost swung the bundle at the intern. “That’s *spotted* hyenas, doofus. It’s probably a girl, anyway.”

The doctor snipped the umbilical cord and brought the crying, pink, blood-soaked infant over to Anne’s arms. She was very much human, but the nose was slightly more pronounced along with the mouth, had a slightly sloping forehead and the ears were more pointed like an elf. The doctor also noted that her feet were larger than usual, and the calves shorter. There was also a fine layer of short dirty-blond hairs appearing sparsely in some spots. It was normal for babies to have that, he said.

Anne became rocking her child slowly. Patel walked over to the bedside and sat on a stool. The baby girl stopped its crying, looking deep into its mother’s eyes with its big, brown ones. Anne smiled and the baby smiled back. There was more satisfaction in this little moment than receiving a PHD, or helping humanity advance as a whole. This was her little piece of humanity, her greatest work, even if she half-assed it.

The doctor shed his gloves, washed his hands and picked up a clipboard. “Eight pounds flat, sixteen inches. Very healthy one.” He scribbled some notes on the hybrid features on a second sheet. Patel put his signature as the witness. “All I need now is a name, Mrs. Hathaway. You and I don’t want to refer to it as the 'hybrid', or 'it'.”

Anne thought for a second, then remembered Yusuf’s last question and her answer. It was so out-of-the-blue back then. How could he have known? “Edith.”

“An Ed. That’s a nice name.”

“It is.”

I met a girl last week and I can't reach her 'normally', I could use some advice.

Short story incoming: I'm doing an internship at a small video production company. One of the projects they're working on is a cultural project, part of the project was interviewing a girl that's almost graduating at a university for the video, let's call her Anna for now. Anyway, I met a different girl that was in the same classroom (different class, 2 years lower, but she seemed to know Anna (the girl we interviewed) and I chatted very nice with her for about 10 minutes. After the interview I didn't have the chance to ask the name of the girl I liked because we had to leave sadly...

I'd love to get in contact with the girl I chatted with and ask her for a drink or so (I have no idea if she has a boyfriend, but it's worth a chance I guess?). The problem is I don't know her name. However, I do have the name (and found the Facebook) of Anna (contact details for the project, fyi: she's around the same age as me, so perhaps she can relate lol). I could message Anna and ask if she knows the name and / or Facebook of the girl I'm after. I have nothing to lose I guess and besides I'm just an intern of the company, however it feels a little bit creepy and weird :/. Age = 22'ish, she's about the same.

Any tips how to tackle this situation?

Thanks in advance!"

(detailed writers only, please)",[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/28huqr/28f4m_an_office_christmas_party_for_chloe_grace/,"Alan Peterson was the newest rising star of Spielman, Kravitz, and Wiesenthal. The cutthroat junior partner was a few years removed from law school, and already starting to lead some of the bigger cases at the downtown law firm. He had a reputation for being extremely cocky and a bit of an asshole, but that was about par for most of the attorneys with his ability. They were in the business of winning cases and bravado won cases.

[Chloe Grace](http://i.imgur.com/SHvptz8.jpg) was a high school senior and an intern at SK&amp;W. The only child of a single mother, Chloe had worked very hard to get such a prestigious internship and in her eyes, deserved every bit of it. She might not have possessed the cockiness to make a great attorney, but Chloe was intelligent and outgoing, and was well liked by all the staff. It also helped that in the male dominated legal world, she was easy to talk to, and even easier on the eyes. 

As the months passed it became clear to Chloe that she didn't really have what it took to be a great attorney, and she was quickly learning that she didn't really want to be either, but as she went through her internship, she thought that being a legal secretary might not be all that bad.

---------------------------------------------------

At the Christmas party Alan set his sights on her. A sweet girl like that.. in this day and age, he doubted she was still a virgin, but he would still have her do things that she had never done before. He wouldn't be her first, but he would be the oldest, and he would be the one she would never forget. Alan on the other hand, he might not even remember her in a month. If she was going to be a one night stand, she would fade from his memory just like all the others. But maybe, just maybe, he would keep this one coming back for more. She was so sweet and innocent looking... that would certainly be a first for Alan.

-------------------------------------------

What I'm looking for from this scene is quite a bit different than my other posts. I'm looking for a player that doesn't mind getting a little *darker* than the typical vanilla roleplay. I'm looking for someone that can play a character with an arrogance and cockiness about him, but who can be sweet enough to get what he wants from a girl like Chloe. The only child of a single mother, Chloe is secretly desperate for attention and a father figure... and if the right (or maybe in this case wrong) man came alone, he could have her wrapped around his selfish little finger.

---------------------------------------------

Due to the amount of absolutely wonderful orange letters that I usually recieve, I'm going to ask that if you want to play this out, please give me an idea of where you'd like to take this scene, but also, please type out a few paragraphs of intro, so I can pick up from where you left off.

And last but not least, if you're coming across this post a few hours or even days after it's been posted, don't think that you've lost your chance! I'm always looking for new roleplayers to play with and I never mind going back to revisit one of my old ideas!

    Country of purchase: USA

    Budget range: $200-$700 (the lower the better)

    Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): taking notes in class, some DJ’ing, use for data transfers (I work in IT support at my school) connecting remotely to my desktop to video edit, maybe some minecraft if possible.

    Screen size preference: 12.5-15.6

    OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows

    Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): being able to run minecraft above 30fps would be nice

    Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): maybe a video card for CUDA or Open CL so I would not have to connect remotely to my desktop all the time to edit

    Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): supplier &amp; self support

    Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): Any

    Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Looks are not a big deal

    Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

    Long battery life -vs- Low weight: Low weight

    Build quality -vs- Low price: Build Quality

    Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance

Would you pay a premium for something that has: Nothing

    High resolution screen: It would be a plus

    A great keyboard: As long as it works and has a decent feel, that’s all that matters

    A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Same as above

    Great audio: no, I’ll be using headphones and external speakers 99% percent of the time

List any features that are critical: (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.) 

-USB 3.0 is a must 
-Touch Screen is a must
-I would love a backlit keyboard
-any dual band/5GHz/AC wireless would be a huge plus
-and an SSD or SDD Cache would also be great
-the longer the battery life the better


In short I would like a lightweight laptop that has a touchscreen, backlit keyboard, and at least one USB 3.0 port all for as cheap as possible while still being a decent laptop that will last me the next 2 years through college, internships, and traveling for work

28imcp,1,2014-06-18,Anxiety interfering with my internship -- I want to quit?,Nyxness,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/28imcp/anxiety_interfering_with_my_internship_i_want_to/,"In around the last month of this past semester, the second semester of my freshman year of college, I was hit pretty badly with anxiety and depression that left me basically incapable of completing my work (it was not slacking; I seriously wanted to work and couldn't) and pretty seriously affected my GPA. 

One result of my anxiety is pushing myself too hard to succeed, feeling like a failure when I don't meet my expectations, and then pushing myself even harder to make up for feeling like a failure. So rather than allowing myself to take a bit of a break for the summer, relax, and try to figure out my issues so I could be ready for next semester, which probably would have been the best course of action, I instead spent the beginning of my summer break searching for last-minute internship opportunities in my field of summer (I had applied to a bunch earlier in the year but didn't get one).

So now I'm working full-time 6 or 7 days a week in a scene shop for a summer stock theatre company, doing carpentry and painting and running shows, about a 6-hour drive away from home and without any means of transportation beyond my bicycle. I've only been here 4 days so far, and I don't mind the work (I wouldn't say I enjoy it, but I'm having trouble enjoying much of anything at the moment). 

But I'm still just so stressed. I had hoped that by working hard all summer I could just distract myself from the anxiety, but instead it's just giving me more to worry about, away from anyone I've ever met before in a completely unfamiliar environment without any support system living in a house full of strangers and feeling really isolated. The hours haven't been bad at all yet (they will be starting a week from tomorrow, when the shows actually start), but I still just feel completely overwhelmed. After feeling so exhausted at the end of the semester, I feel like I've given up on any chance I had of a break, and with it any chance of resolving any of my anxiety issues this summer and being able to make next semester better than the last one. I don't have enough mental energy left to both work all summer and work on my issues. I'm already coming into this completely worn out. And there's no psychologist within 50 miles who takes my insurance, and no psychologist at all within biking distance, so I don't have any chance of even trying to get counseling or something on my days off. I just feel completely isolated and overwhelmed just being here, even without the work being too bad.

This internship lasts until right before I go back to school, so I won't have any chance to get my shit together before then. And I don't know how much longer I can take feeling like this without a break. I know that as it stands now, I have little chance of being successful at school next semester, and doing this internship this summer, I have no possibility of resolving these feelings before I have to go back. It's like I have this huge weight pressing on my mind, making every little thing so much more difficult and leaving absolutely no energy left to focus on actually getting rid of the weight so I can actually enjoy my life.

But I've already committed to doing this for the whole summer (although I still haven't received a freaking contract). I don't want to back out of my obligations, regardless of how misguided I was when I committed to them. I don't even know if I could bring myself to quit. This is great experience for my career, and it's work that I really want to learn how to do. And I know I'd feel extremely guilty and ashamed about it if I quit. But it simply feels like too much right now. I'm definitely not in a good mental place right now, and I know it'll only continue to get worse from here if my mind doesn't get a rest. I know 4 days really isn't a long enough time to form an adequate impression in my internship, but it is long enough for me to recognize these debilitating mental patterns that I've experienced in the past and which I know will ruin this experience for me even if I stay.

So I guess I'm looking for some advice here?

TL;DR: I'm torn between my mental health and my obligations/career. Which do I choose, why, and how?"

**Day 1**


Initially I started my day off by working on some tunes in the park. In my free time I'll bring my guitar to a public park, work on some songs, talk to some girls, etc. I posed to the Groupme that I would be there for most of the day if anyone wanted to daygame. Lo and behold my usual daygame wing Contro hit me up and said he'd be over in an hour or two. One and a half finished songs later and I met up with him and we daygamed in and between Washington Sq. Park and Union Sq. Park. I was having a relatively unlucky day, I'm a little bit rusty at daygame after having a pretty reclusive Winter. I don't remember getting any numbers that day, but I saw this girl sitting on the steps at Union Sq. It's funny what a reputation among girls that place has for housing bad pickup artists, and then there's a reputation among us for it being the easiest place to daygame.

**""I like the dress you're wearing, but those sneakers are just awful.""**

I don't remember if this is what I opened with, but it must've been my opener or the second thing I said to her. I was being honest. She was wearing a pretty pink dress and then some athletic Nike shoes. 

Perhaps she appreciated my honesty or my joke about her working out in a dress, but we got to talking about how we're both fashion majors of some sort, I asked her on a scale from 1-7 how Fobby she is (fresh off the boat), I implored her to guess what kind of Asian I am though she couldn't cause I'm mixed, I tried to guess her Asian nationality. She tells me she's from the Midwest (redneck, but not really) and she's only in NY for the Summer for a fashion internship. We talk about our internships. I tried to make her sound like she was acting superior because she wasn't a mixed Asian. The Harry Potter term mudblood was used. I teased her for her poor eye contact, and tried to get her to stare me in the eyes on three, but I just gave her a cross-eyed face on 3. 


I don't recall a lot of the conversation, it was a lot of banter and comfort building. She had to go, but offered me her number in the form of a business card, which I teased her for. 

All in all, a very solid way to end mediocre daygaming session.


**Day 2**

After I met her, I was giving her calls on my lunchbreaks to see if she wanted to meet up. I'm glad I gave calls instead of texts, I think this really set me apart and showed I was serious about seeing her (naked). 

I invited her out to lunch, dinner with another friend of mine, a bbq party I was having in Brooklyn, but I didn't get my Day 2 until she said I was invited to the movies. A fucking movie date. A fucking movie double date, with her roommate and roommate's boyfriend.

Xmen Origins, nosebleed seats, fullhouse of little kids and shit, sitting next to her roommate and bf. 

*Never again.*

Seriously, never go on a movie date for a first date no matter how much you think you can turn it in your favor. There's hardly a chance to kino, hardly a chance to talk, and worst of all there's kids (usually). 

I did what I could, made jokes during the trailers, light kino, but pretty much had to shut up for most of the movie. 

The movie was in Jersey city and I ended up getting there even earlier than them after getting out of work around Midtown. They showed up with minutes to spare, all of which were used to get tickets and concessions. I talked to the other bf as the girls got the tickets and snacks. We connected over having lived around the same part of Brooklyn and other stuff. I made a joke to them all that I was in the CIA because I've moved around north jersey so much.

At the end of the movie the bf stormed out of the theatre and the roommate followed close behind. Apparently he was really upset because the school he graduated from had been calling him incessantly about his student loans. This gave me and the girl some time together during the credits before the end of credits teaser. This would have been the best opportunity during the movie for a k-close (which still isn't opportune) if it weren't for all the kids.

When we left the theater I asked if she could walk me to the Path real quick which wasn't far off. But the upset bf was impatiently waiting in the car apparently and the roommate said that meant they should really be going. No dutch.

Acting like an AFC, I texted her ""That was interesting, being your third wheel insurance lol.""'

I wanted to convey I wasn't interested in just being her friend and how shitty a movie date is to her. She didn't say anything to that though.

**Day 3**

Not for lack of trying, but our Day 3 wasn't for another two weeks roughly. She made plans for lunch with me that I had to flake on, she couldn't make it to my bbq party, she had Friday night plans, etc. I decided to stop talking to her for a bit cause I was trying to hang out with her a lot, I've got other things to do and people to see. Gave it 5 days until I asked if she was a city living redneck yet. 

She told me she was moving soon from Jersey City, which in retrospect probably took up a lot of her time. Now she is, and she lives in Hell's Kitchen, and there's a great curry place I should take you to in Hell's Kitchen on Monday.

Scratch that, I'm playing an open mic Monday. Oh, you're playing an open mic, that sounds fun? I bet it does, and sounds really attractive too, so let's get curry on Tuesday.

Hey I met this awesome guy at my open mic tonight, he's playing a show tomorrow here, let's check it out after curry. 

She meets me after my internship for curry. I tease her for being bad at finding 36th and 8th from Herald Sq. I try to get her to hold my hand when crossing the street, cause I'm a baby. But she has sweaty hands.


*This girl isn't a redneck, but damn it are her palms sweaty! I've probably teased her about them every time I've seen her.*

I sat next to her at the curry place, not across. Light kino, talked about music, joked that she should smell me since NYC smells so awful. Told her I'm the reason her palms are sweaty (as if I'm making her nervous). We bounce to this guys show in Alphabet city, I talk with him at the bar while she goes to the bathroom, I talk with the bartender, I talk with another dude at the bar. I try to assert my independence and social value which she sees when she comes out to the bar. She gets a beer. Brooklyn Lager isn't as good as she remembers it the other night. We go in to watch this guys show. She gets me a beer that I sip when the waiter isn't looking (20). I tease her for assisting someone underage get alcohol even though her parents own a liquor store. We laugh at some of my friends lyrics. Btw, [he's](https://soundcloud.com/iamjuli_us/sets/demos-big-group/s-EZtFJ) really talented everyone. It was just him on piano, so it sounded a lot more like Coldplay, and bitches love Coldplay. She gave the waiter $5 for my Guinness, but I only have $2, so I tell her I'm going to get her some ice cream afterwards.

When we get out from the show she says ""what next?"" I set up this venue hopping just right so in terms of Manhattan, we were as close as we could be to my pad in Brooklyn. I tell her we could go to my place and I'll play her some of my stuff. No dice, she'd rather get ice cream. Damn, I tried.

We stop in a CD store I wanted to check out and I dig this guys collection of CDs and VHS. When we get the ice cream I'm purposefully a messy eater and make these sexual noises while eating it. Ice cream can be really sexy when you're with me. I stop her and tell her she's got a little bit on her, then go in for the k-close.

Success. Lips landed. It was a small peck, but it wasn't rejected. I'm thoroughly happy and feeling accomplished. That is until we stop in front of some live act in a bar and I go for it again, but she turns away this time.

I'm thinking, shit how am I supposed to escalate if I can't get past the first kiss? I don't let this ruin my night though. I've gone for enough kisses in my life to enjoy even the ones that get rejected. She doesn't say anything about it or act weird, so I don't either. We sit in a park and enjoy ice cream. I continue to be weird with my ice cream. She sees a rat and I tease her cause she won't even put her feet back on the ground for a few minutes. When we leave I tell her we're gonna go to this place called Fat Cat (of which Marbles from the groupme told me about). So we walk across town from Alphabet city to the west village, while I tell her about the places and neighborhoods we're passing through. I snapchat a building that's relevant to me to a friend, and then go for another kiss here. She resists again, but I'm persistent this time, persistent enough for it to be something of attention.

""I'm sorry""
""It's cool, do you have a boyfriend""

She doesn't answer this question with a yes or no. 

She tells me she's just being a girl, and being complicated. Sounds like she's being fickle, and I take it. Whatever reason she has is good enough, for now. She apologizes for making things awkward, but I tell her that's bullshit. I tell her I do this shit all the time, I might get rejected from a kiss sometimes, but occasionally it's really rewarding and not awkward. None of this is awkward to me. She can tell me she's just being a woman, but I tell her I'm just being a guy and she happens to be very pretty. It's my way of saying, this doesn't change a thing. She says thank you for calling her pretty. 

On our walk to Fat Cat I ease up for a bit on the escalation and try to build some rapport. I talk about common Asian experiences, racial dysphoria, times we were shitfaced, crazy stuff that's happened to me in the city. I ask her questions. I ask if she does drugs, tell her about concerts I've been to. Etc.

We get to Fat Cat and sit on opposite end of a couch when waiting for our pool table. Shit, that's not good. Talk a little bit about old TV shows while I'm constantly checking if our number is up for pool

28izxd,10,2014-06-19,Christians of Reddit: I humbly request your audience and value your input.,philn68,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/28izxd/christians_of_reddit_i_humbly_request_your/,"This is something I had been mulling over for a long time and I wanted to hear what some of you think.

I just ask that you please read everything before you make any comments or judgements.

So I lied to my mother. It was a big lie.... Some years ago I admitted to myself that I did not believe in God. I wanted to believe so very bad but never truly did. I would stay up nights and pray to God, asking for help as I could feel my faith slipping. Well when these prayers were ignored long enough, I finally brought myself to admit that I didn't believe in Him to begin with. That was a quick way to sum up about 9 years of my life because why I am Atheist and what I actually believe are totally irrelevant to the story.

I hated myself for a while. I was ashamed. Being raised in a Christian home, I never even considered Atheism a real option. I thought I was a terrible person just for believing such things. That all changed when I went to college, when I finally left the little bubble that I was raised in and found that not to be the case. I felt enriched when I embraced it and even truly happy with myself for the first time in my life.

Months went by before I could bring myself to tell anybody. I told one of my friends at college first, and he (Atheist), another friend (Catholic), and I stayed up talking about our beliefs until the sun came up. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. After this, I finally thought I could tell some of my family.

The first person I told was my older brother who, in all honesty, is also one of my closest friends. He was also the only family member who, at the time, lived within a reasonable distance. He admitted that he was agnostic, although his views were considerably more jaded than my own.

Finally I went home for the first time since I had admitted it. I wasn't ready to tell my parents yet... but apparently that decision was out of my hands. It went something like this: we (my mother, my oldest brother's girlfriend, and I) were driving home and a squirrel ran out in front of the car and my brother's girlfriend (driving) swerved and nearly wrecked the car missing it, so I said something like ""Don't kill us all swerving to miss a dang squirrel!"" and then my mom said, scathingly, ""You don't have to be that way just because you're Atheist!"" Apparently, in a moment of weakness, my brother told her. To this day, I cannot forgive him for that.

You may think I am a bad person for wanting to hide that from my mother, but I had my reasons. My mom is one of the nicest people I know. She also has (apparently) strong conviction in her faith in God. This one thing she said says it all: ""You're breaking my heart [philn68], I want my baby to get into Heaven with me."" Point being, she now made me feel guilty for believing what I did. The whole situation stinks, especially because I didn't even get to be the one to tell her after how hard it was for me to even admit it to myself.

I wanted to tell you all of that so that you would understand the way I feel going into this. Since then, all my mother did was make little comments (things like calling Jesus a fairy tale creature to mock me or tell me about how she prays for me every night) or try to convince me that my lack of faith was due to a lack of knowledge (trust me... it's not) and things like that. I asked many people about what I should do but I don't think any of them truly understand how much it hurts me to know that I upset my mom like this.

True, her comments would make most people angry and they would feel that they shouldn't have to change for their mother to accept them. But... well I chose another route. Even though her comments were the way they were, I knew she was only doing them because it's what she believes is right. She believes that she has to save me from eternal misery. Her heart is still in the right place.

Don't think that my mom is always like this. In every other way, she is very proud of me. I am in college for engineering, I have a great internship and am currently supporting myself all on my own, I am responsible, and she always tell me how proud she is of me. That's the kind of mom she is and always has been... I couldn't ask for much better. I never saw this new side of her before she found out I wasn't Christian.

She remained convinced that it was just a phase that I was going through, so I let her believe that the phase was over. I let her believe that I am once again a Christian... I lied to her.

I know that lying is wrong but I didn't choose to be an Atheist, that's just what I believe. I strongly urge you to consider the idea that belief is not a choice when you read this. I don't believe in any form of afterlife, so I see no harm in letting her go on with her life blissfully unaware. This way, we can both rest easy.

If I could just flip a switch and go back to believing, I would do it. I would like to believe again, not for my sake, but for my mother's. But I can't. Please don't respond to this by trying to make me believe in God again, because I promise you such efforts will be in vain. I am an Atheist and proud to be.

You probably do not agree with what I believe, but that's why I came here. I never really got a Christian view on this matter. People of /r/Christianity here is my question for you: in light of all I have just told you, how do you think my actions should be judged? Do you think I did the right thing? Do you think God would see it as the right thing to do? I value any and all input and ask for your understanding.

28j1f2,4,2014-06-19,Left in the dust.,Binary-Random,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/28j1f2/left_in_the_dust/,"Hello,

I’ll try and make this short and sweet. In addition, I know for a fact that many people have it much worse off than I do. Even typing this I feel like I’m just shooting the breeze. But, after a long while I’ve decided I need to type this out…

I’m a 22 year old male. I intern at a nice local network. I’m not rich, but I’m not poor. I work out and remain fit as I can. I get good grades. Even though I live with my parents for financial and college reasons, I do retain a large deal of independence. I’m social, outgoing, and enjoy going out with friends when I can. Heck, I even find myself handsome and physically fit!

The problem is I haven’t had a relationship in the past five years, and on top of that, those before never ended well. In every single relationship I’ve been on I’ve ended up being cheated on for lord knows what reason. But, as time went on I forgave those people and continued on. I’m not too fond of remaining “in the dumps” publically. Although I can’t deny being utterly lonely on the inside…

It sounds funny when I type this out, but I have had any *legitimate* affectionate touch from anyone in many years. No kiss, no cuddle, nothing…The only true affection-ish touch I get is from my family and my cat. But I think you guys know what I’m talking about.

Yeah, I’ve tried a couple times like anyone else, but yet nothing works out. I enjoy my life, have fun, go out with friends, even enjoy my time alone and relax. But yet, nothing…

Everyone around me if getting into relationships, getting married, and looking to me as if “what do you have?”

I know I can’t rush such things. They take time obviously, but after five years, when I see everyone else trucking down the dirt road of life, I find myself kicking the can and walking alone in the dust.

Forgive me, I attempted to make this short and sweet. I hope someone can buck me up a bit.

Few formal programs seem willing to take freshman (I'm Canadian, so fewer options) and the ones that do are highly competitive, so I am looking to create some of my own opportunities. I am very unsure about which field I am interested in (leaning towards Engineering Physics currently which is basically an honours physics degree along with a degree in either mech, elec, materials, or computer engineering. It is a full engineering program and because of the Canadian licensing system transfer agreement is fully accepted by ABET/other licensing organizations. It is not like the unaccredited engineering science programs in the USA.)

I was thinking of trying with some of the smaller engineering companies in my city as I have heard that the programs of the larger companies are just cheap labour/coffee grabbing/good for government grants with regard to freshmen. These are also very competitive and while I am very dedicated to getting good grades, those are by no means guaranteed. I also think that I might learn more at a smaller firm because it will be less structured. Unfortunately those companies do not seem to have any formal internship programs. Is there any way around this? Should I just walk in one day and ask for one? 

I do have some skills already, mostly in terms of programming (C++, C, Java). I also worked as a political strategist and volunteer for a candidate (I helped him prep for debates, determined where he should place his signage based on traffic flow and wait times, and spoke to some 750 people door to door about him. This was just a city council campaign, so no major media.) I have a decent SAT score (2130), will likely be an AP National Scholar (Canada), and have won several essay competitions, one at the national level. This summer I will have an internship at a small financial services company, to learn about stock markets and investing. 

How do you advise that I proceed? Thanks for the help. "

28j81b,9,2014-06-19,My [23F] boyfriend[23M] of 3 years has future plans of permanently living in an RV and it's making me feel unwanted and distanced.,littlehouseoh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28j81b/my_23f_boyfriend23m_of_3_years_has_future_plans/,"This might sound silly but he actually wants to live in a tiny, mobile house and I feel like I'm not be considered during these long-term housing plans of his.

Last year (while still in college), we had a short discussion about the future of our relationship and it didn't go too well. We both realized we wanted different things: I want a nice apartment in the city, he wants a tiny, mobile RV home thingie. He'd recently become obsessed with the idea and I was hoping it was just a phase.

Fast forward to this year, everything with us is pretty great. We decided to try to make the relationship work despite our differences (thoughts about money being the main one). Things are going great, and we just started doing long distance for the summer since he's interning in another city. We just graduated college so we're also starting to face some 'real world' relationship problems.

Until yesterday, I'd forgotten about his RV dream. He's working in SF next year and planning on living with a roommate, Mike-- they've been apartment hunting and everything sounds great/ normal. I'll be 2 hours away and he even suggested me moving in with him this summer (had my internship not panned out). Yesterday, he texted me saying he had a long discussion with his father about living in an RV, and his father found it strange. Since this was all over text, I just replied asking when he planned to do so (I also mentioned that I hadn't realized he still wanted to live in an RV at some point). He replied, ""Hehe yeah, for after I live with Mike.""

Maybe the problem seems minor, but it reminds me of all the ways in which we're not very compatible-- he's more idealistic and cares less about material things. I'd like to think I'm not very shallow or superficial but I would like to own a nice apartment with him in a fun city, one where we can entertain friends and such. A one-person mobile home is not really part of my plan.

Here's my question: how do I bring this up with him? During our first discussion last year, he didn't seem open to changing his mind. His ideal scenario is for us to keep dating but for him to own a mobile home, but I think the next natural step in a 3-year relationship is moving in or at least having similar ideas the topic.

TLDR: Long term boyfriend and I have different ideas of living together and housing. Namely, he wants a tiny, mobile home for one, and I want to live together like a normal couple in a normal apartment. :/"

I order juice once a month, and until there, I almost only ordered from the US because juice is cheaper (even with $15 shipping), the dollar is cheaper, and it does taste a thousand time better. 
I'm currently doing an internship away from home, and I didn't want to pay the equivalent of a bottle of juice for shipping, and then having to wait two weeks to be able to vape it (although I must say I received my bombies 7 days after the order).
I therefore decided to order from Cloudhouse Vapor. Because they're retailing American juice to a fair price for us, european vapers.
My order was around €50, for which I got 5*20ml of MBV, 15ml of Indigo, and 15ml of Gremlin. Which is damn cheap in comparaison to the european standards (€7 for 10ml of 70/30 single flavor juice).

My order was everything in 6mg, 20/80 and 2 flavor shots for the MBV sampler.

And I was really impressed by the quality of the MBV juice. I already ordered once at MBV in the US, but the Hawk Sauce I received needed a good month before being awesome (it was only menthol the first two weeks). CHV's Hawk Sauce was as good on arrival as the MBV one after a good month of steeping.
I don't know if it's due to Nathan's amazing brewing skills or the fact that the flavoring bottle was already open for a while, but I got all the awesomness of Hawk Sauce without having waited a month for it and already vaped half of the bottle. 
The rest of the order is also great; I just wish CHV was offering Raspberry Lemonade.

So, CHV, thank you for the juice and good luck with the business. I'll definitely order more!

You wrote on the invoice that you also included a sample of Dutch apple pie, which you have forgotten to put into the envelope. But that's no big deal, just put it with my next order!

TL;DR: CHV so good for europe vapor. Much good number 1 liquid tremendous smoke very cheapest price."

When we do see each other, we have sex at least once a day and have a really satisfying sex life and relationship in general.

However, for some reason that I can't seem to understand, she is incredibly uncomfortable sending me dirty pictures or videos. I know that this is really common to do in long-distance relationships and I am very turned on by my girlfriend to the point where I don't even watch other porn. Given that I'm so used to having sex and obviously miss having it with her, along with the fact that she'll randomly text me about how much she misses it too, I might be a bit pushy when it comes to asking for pictures or videos.

We have a really close relationship and we know pretty much everything about each other. Whenever I ask her about it, she just says she's uncomfortable with her body. Is there any way I can make her feel more comfortable or get her to understand why I want this? Everytime I try to explain I feel like the bad guy to the point where I'm starting to think that it will just never happen.

TL;DR: Want nudies, girlfriend too shy."
28jknx,1,2014-06-19,Is an industrial placement abroad worth it? I need some advice,initioterum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28jknx/is_an_industrial_placement_abroad_worth_it_i_need/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions! I promise I did my best to read through the FAQ and previous postings, but didn't find answers quite as specific as I'd like. 

I am a first year CS student in the UK, and in the third year of our course we undertake an industrial placement for twelve months. I am considering looking for placements overseas and am wondering what the long term career benefit of this would be. I am flexible on the field, but would ideally like varied, client-facing work. 

To give you a background on my situation, I am on track for a first in this first year at a top-ten ranked university and will be starting a three month IT Consulting internship in a few weeks. I can speak some French, but otherwise I am limited to English-speaking offices. As the company I am doing an internship with has offices in the USA, Scandinavia and Switzerland I thought I might try and see if I can use my network to organise a placement in one of their other offices (if all goes well and I like it of course!). I'd also be interested in working in Canada.


So specifically, my questions are:

1. Assuming a similar job, will a placement taken overseas boost my employability significantly more than one taken domestically? And in general would it be more beneficial in the US than Scandinavia for example?

2. Are year-long placements in American, Canadian and Scandinavian offices common? 

3. Does anyone have any experiences they could share which may be relevant?


I apologise for the broadness and, most likely, uneducated nature of my questions; I would really appreciate any relevant information and experiences from the community. Thanks!"

I'm going to be graduating this fall, after 5 1/2 years, with a 2.5 GPA in CS. I was undecided until my 3rd year in college. I do pretty well in my programming assignments but fall short on the theory and mathematics.

I have no internship experience, no personal projects, and don't know much past making console applications. I've done a bit of programming using GUIs with Qt for simple games like the 15 puzzle.

I've gone to the engineering career fairs and I've visited a fair amount of companies. I've been rejected by all (assuming no response == reject) and I've posted my resume on my college's career center. The next fair will be in fall and I'm already feeling down about it.

I'm scared that I would not be able to obtain a job in my field because of how much I'm lacking and how poorly I'm doing in college.

I have two months before school starts again and after browsing, I know I'm way too late but I want to get back on track. What steps should I take to bring me back on track? What should I do so that after I graduate, I can at least get a job in my field?"

______________________
Day three came and went without incident or mention of the duo. CCB seemed to get the hint that I wasn't happy about being left in the dark about new staff and probably advised them against approaching me about anything. 

Shortly after Tweedle left my office on day two, I heard level1 answer his phone next door and confirm that he would build two machines. He seemed so happy to be needed, with a sense of urgency that exists only within the confines of naivety and inexperience. He had yet to be broken.

The machines were built. Generations old machines that had gone onto our spare shelf for requests like these. I offered to help deliver and set up the machines. For fun, or so I thought. 

Tweedle and Whippy were positioned in a re-purposed office space that had been used for volunteer mail sorting. 

&gt;Me: Good morning interns!

&gt;Tweedle+Whippy: Good morning Mr. Stix

*They were sitting there. Just sitting and waiting. Had they done anything else yet? Did they go home at night?*

&gt;level1: Hi, I'm level1, I take care of all of the computers and printers and stuff in the building.

&gt;Whippy: Hello level1, it's a pleasure to meet you. Are you who I call if I have computer questions?

Whippy had a higher voice than I had expected, and was well spoken. I was surprised on both points. His question was loaded and I knew it, but level1 was young, driven by the need to be needed... and stupid.

&gt;level1: That's me!

He almost sounded surprised.

There were two old cubicle style desks that came with the building, one facing the other with a partition on each side, blocking the user's view of the neighboring workstation, which was a bit depressing considering that the partitions also blocked the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the parking lot and lake. 

We set up the machines and phones quickly while they stood in the doorway and watched. They didn't speak to each other, just stood there and watched. Something I was starting to get uncomfortably used to.

Now it's training time. The machines are fired up and working and they are both super excited to have phones with their own extensions and even their names on the display. Yay!

I let level1 take care of Whippy while I gave Tweedle his credentials and informed him of our policies. This is where it became apparent just how interesting this internship would be. 

&gt;Me: Blahblahblah policy, email etiquette, blahblah, username password, blahblah.

&gt;Tweedle: Um, so, okay. Great. How do I make an email?

&gt;Me: Outlook blahblah, new email, blahblah formatting, blah, don't reply to all it annoys people, blah.

&gt;Tweedle: Er, okay. So Outlook is email?

*Dun dun dunnnnnnn*

&gt;Me: Oh, sorry, have you never used a PC with outlook before?

&gt;Tweedle: Well...

*He looked at his shoes through the desk*

&gt;Tweedle: I've never used a computer before. We weren't allowed.

*Now I'm taken back. Way back.*

&gt;Me: Who wasn't allowed? 

&gt;Tweedle: Me and Whippy. Our parents didn't let us have computers. They said we didn't need to use computers.

*Um...*

&gt;Me: Oh, okay, well I'm sorry to hear that, had I known I would have started with some basics.

*Crappppp. I'm starting to feel bad for them.* - This feeling would eventually fade. Tweedle looked up from his shoes with hope behind his glasses.

&gt;Tweedle: So... You'll teach me?

level1 looked over the neighboring partition and met eyes with me.

&gt;Level1'sEyes: No. Please. Don't do it. Don't Do It!

&gt;MyEyes: You have to learn. And besides, you told them you're the one to call with computer questions. You practically signed yourself up for this.

&gt;Level1'sEyes: Crap. You're totally right. Why did I run my stupid mouth. Stupid Stupid Stupid.

I turned my attention back to Tweedle with a brand new smile on my face.

&gt;Me: I'll talk to level1 about developing some training and materials for the two of you. We'll have you up to speed in no time.

TL;DR - You should read it. 

EDIT: Wow, never thought I see some of these responses in TFTS. You people are amazing (in a good way).

I am in a very awkward situation, probably especially one among us desis, but am not trolling (I honestly wish I was trolling as I write this) and would appreciate any help or advice. I am not sure this was the right place to ask but I will give it a try.

Ok.. to start from the beginning. When I was 18, I got an internship at a good company the summer before college. It was my first real ""job"" and I was excited. While I was there, one of the managers was an Indian woman who looked to be in her late 30s (I am bad at pinpointing ages so 30s/40s is a good guess). I will call her Mrs. S. She was a nice lady (very pretty too), and totally Americanized, she had come from India at a young age and basically grew up here in the USA. She looked out for me from the beginning and really helped me ease into the internship. 

Anyway.. I do not want to go into too much detail here because I am so embarrassed and mortified by this... but one day we had a company party at work and me being the rebellious kid about to go the college, had a few drinks (no one seemed to notice or cared I was underage). Near the end of the party Mrs. S asked if I could come into her office to go over some work I had done so I did. One thing lead to another and before I knew it we were kissing. At this point everyone in the office was gone. I didn't know what I was doing, I knew it was wrong but I also was a little nervous and a small part of me excited to see where this was going. Mrs. S asked me if I was a virgin and I nodded. Then she whispered ""well would you like to learn a few tricks you can pass on to your future girlfriends and wife?"" And we ended up having sex in her office. I would like to say it stops there but... we did it a few more times over the summer, this sounds so wrong but she was really good and it was a huge turn on compared to all the other ""aunties"" I knew. After my internship ended, I went off to college and didn't keep in touch with her.

Fast forward 10 years... I've done some dating (none of which I told my parents about because nothing ever became serious), but my parents think that it is about time and a good age for me to get married... They want to try to find some girls for me to meet, the same religion and culture as ours. I am skeptical but decide to try it, since I don't think anything bad can come of it. So it is all set up, my parents know someone through a family friend contact of ours and we go to meet them. Well... wow. The girl I'm getting set up with is amazing. We meet her brother and her dad that day, but the mom is out on a business trip and will be back in a few days. The girl is cute, well educated and smart, and down to earth. I very much enjoy talking to her, and later when my parents ask me what I thought, they are pleased to see how much I liked her. They decide to set up another meeting in 2 days so we can talk some more. 

So we meet again, and the meeting goes even better... the mom is still out on her business trip, but my dad and her dad are already getting along, not to mention of course me and the girl as well. We go for a walk and as I learn more about her and hear her talk, I start to like her more and more. Later when I talk to my parents, they are thrilled to see how well we get along and though they say they don't want to rush us too much, I can tell they are already thinking about marriage plans.

Sounds too good to be true? Yes, you've probably guessed the key part of the story missing so far. Well, the next weekend we decide to meet again so that my parents can also meet the mom who is back from her business trip. They visit us and... you guessed it. The mom is none other than the very Mrs. S I lost my virginity to 10 years ago. She looks similar, a bit more aged of course but I recognize her in an instant. We make eye contact and she plays the perfect auntie, no flash of recognition at me, smiles and shakes my hand. Now that I think about it she may have known it was me... I did not know because the daughter and her mother don't have the same last name (I am guessing Mrs. S did not take her husband's name). There is a huge pit in my stomach. I sit there and try to make forced conversation with the daughter, Mrs. S is chatting with my parents so we don't interact much. I don't know if anyone can tell something is off, I try to keep my voice down when I talk to the daughter, I feel so awkward feeling as if Mrs. S can hear us. They finally leave, my parents are happy because Mrs. S and her husband are ""good people and a good family"", and my mom hints about making marriage arrangements soon. 

And that is where I am right now. The daughter asked if I want to hang out (I have not been in touch with her too much since the meeting, I told her I was very busy with work) and then the parents want to meet the family again and introduce the family to some of our relatives. I have no idea what to do. Mrs. S has not been in contact and we only talked very briefly, and I have been too scared to try to contact her. At the same time, it terrifies me to tell my family, the daughter, and everyone what happened in the past. I like the daughter, but it all feels so wrong now with this big, dark secret hovering over me. 

I would appreciate any advice, suggestions, comments etc on what I should or could do. The whole situation is just so messed up and I have been sick to my stomach for the last few days thinking about it. I made a throwaway for obvious reasons and I know I am going to get judged big time but I probably totally deserve it. So let me know what you think.. 

**Adding a edit to my post, I wrote this in comments too:**

Ok everyone so I've thought about it and I think I am going to try to talk to Mrs. S. I am not sure how I should contact her because obviously I do not want anyone else to know about the meeting but I will figure something out.

I am not sure what to say... should I start off by saying that our past is something that we have to discuss?

In a strange way I sympathize a little with Mrs. S. She did not talk to me about her personal life much but I got the feeling that she was forced to do an arranged marriage (not a modern one like dating that we have now) and this was a way for her to escape the life she was in. I see it even now with my sisters but I think there is an expectation for the women especially to be submissive, I think Mrs. S enjoyed teaching me and being the more ""dominant"" one.

**edit #2**: I know a lot of you are saying to not talk to Mrs. S but I think I am going to try to meet her tomorrow and at least discuss this. I think we are both mature enough to do that. A lot of you are saying Mrs. S was a predator, should be fired, etc but I honestly never got that feeling from her. She was always a kind and fair lady. What I felt was that she was a woman forced to marry someone and forced to stay submissive and in line with our desi societal expectations. Everything we did was consensual. I would like to at least acknowledge this and talk to her now that we have been thrown into a situation like this. 

I do not know where it will go, yes I am of course not set on the whole marriage. The daughter however is a very sweet girl, and there are many girls out there but I have never clicked with someone so quickly. I am not going to try to dwell on it though, I will first see where things go. "
28khht,2,2014-06-19,"Me [20 M] with a girl I just met [21 F], would like to start seeing each other, but our mutual friend (who introduced us) is interested in her as well.",AtlasV01D,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28khht/me_20_m_with_a_girl_i_just_met_21_f_would_like_to/,"So I have been a long-time lurker, but I've gotten myself into a bit of a rough spot and could use some help.

A little bit of back-story: we're both students from the US in London for the summer. I've gotten a job here at a university and she's in town on a study abroad trip. I traveled over here alone and have been feeling pretty lonely (in a friendless sense) for a while now. I've got a really good group of friends back home, but it's been tough since I'm not technically enrolled as a student at my university here.

I've been here for about a month or so, and this past weekend I posted some pictures on my Facebook, and an old friend of mine messaged me because he noticed I was in London and he had arrived a few days ago with a school group. I haven't seen this guy in ages. We played on a hockey team together about five years ago and haven't really kept in touch. Either way, he's a nice enough guy, and I've been looking for people to hang out with, so I was happy to meet up with him. 

We went out to the pub, and with him came about six girls from the study abroad trip he is on (all from my home university back in the US). I started talking to one of them quite a bit and we really hit it off. Seemed like we had similar interests and just genuinely felt comfortable with each other. Her and the other girls took off for the restroom, and while it was just my friend and I, I mentioned that I thought she was cute and wanted to get to know her better. At that time he made it pretty clear he was interested as well. No worries - I hardly knew the girl, and even though he'd only known her for a few days longer, I didn't want to get in the middle of it. 

The girls came back from the restroom and we all walked home - the whole time she was clearly changing speed/direction to keep near me, and I really enjoyed talking to her.

So fast forward a few days, I've been thinking a lot about this girl (which is really abnormal for me). I decide that I'd really like to spend some time with her and just get to know her. Naturally, I want to run it by my buddy first, but when I went to talk to him, he was in a really bad mood from a rough day at his internship and it clearly wasn't the time. So (and here's where I screw up...) I ask her to get coffee anyway, and figure he and I will talk later. We go out the next day and have a *fantastic* time. We talked for almost three hours, have so many mutual friends back home it's unbelievable, and had a lot of fun. It became very clear very quickly we were both really interested.

So this is great news! She'll be here until Mid-July so we'll still have plenty of time to spend together, and we've got a whole new city to explore while we do it. She seemed just as excited about it as me, and I think there's a lot of potential here.  As soon as she gets back to their housing complex (I live a ways away and they all live together in a dorm) she naturally tells her friends about what happened and sure enough the story finds its way back to my friend before I have a chance to tell him myself. 

Understandably, he's upset. He messages me right away and asks about it. I told him exactly what had happened, made sure to apologize for handling it so badly, and tried to own up to how lame a thing I had done, going behind his back like that, considering he introduced us and told me he was interested. I really don't have a good excuse for acting the way I did, and I feel awful about putting him in the spot I did.

So now I'm not too sure what to do. Here's a guy (a friend I really needed) I haven't heard from in years and hardly know, that reaches out to me and tries to make me feel welcome. I stab him in the back within the first week of starting to see each other again, and now he's rightfully upset. At the same time, this girl and I really like each other now. We've been talking about making more plans since the moment we left the coffee house. Unfortunately, I can't really tell her about the situation with him, because not only does it make me look like an ass, she doesn't know that he was interested and I don't want to make their trip get weird. After all, they do live, take classes, and have an internship together, even if she's not interested in him that way.

So, reddit, my question is this: what's my next move? I feel terrible about the way I've handled things so far, but I really like this girl and definitely want to keep seeing her. How do I move forward with this without upsetting my buddy too much more, and without putting her (or him) in the middle of a dramatic study abroad mess? I don't know how or if I should try to make it up to the guy, but I know this girl is worth the effort and I want to make sure we can do this on good terms for all involved.

Help would be greatly appreciated. 

Their group is headed out of town for the weekend, but we're planning to have a second date when she's back sometime between Monday-Wednesday. It'll be a good time for them to cool off, but I need to know what I'm going to do when they're back. Also, I'm a bit afraid she finds out about all this in the wrong way and it messes up my chances with her. I don't think my buddy would purposefully tell her just to cause trouble, but I also didn't think I'd go behind his back and do what I did...

I just want all three of us to be happy, is that too much to ask for?

---   
**tl;dr**: A buddy of mine and I are interested in the same girl, but she's interested in me - I asked her out behind his back and now he's upset. I still want to keep seeing her, spare his feelings, and look less like a jerk after I betrayed a friend. "

* Graduating from college in a year (May 2015) with mechanical engineering major/engineering management minor. (In honors program, lots of student leadership, etc.) 
* Took Spanish in high school. Studying to take a B2 or C1 CEFL language test since it couldn't hurt to have that.
* Previous intern and research experience with engineering. 
* Mostly looking for design/prototyping engineering work. 
* Also have a lot IT/technology experience with current computer service job as school. (Open to jobs in that market as well.)
* Countries/areas of interest: Spain (Barcelona best, Madrid area good too), France (Paris), Germany (Bielefeld area in particular), Italy (Venice), or UK (really anywhere but London since very pricey). 
* Other countries that I'm open to: Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada (yes, not Europe), Norway, Poland. 
* S.O. is also trying to get his masters abroad. 

My questions: 

* I'm trying to trim down the countries I'm interested in. Are any of the other countries I'm open to really bad for expats? Are there any cons to these countries right of the bat? 
* Any recommendations for engineering companies in these countries, especially for the ones I'm most interested in? Any contacts/help in that area is much appreciated.
* Honestly, what are my chances here? I know engineering is a plus, but is it a big enough one?
* Any suggestions for how to best contact companies in other countries? I don't want to be offensive off the bat or anything. I've found companies with LinkedIn pages and was wondering of the appropriateness of reaching out to them there. 
* Is it worth the effort of getting a CEFL certification? 
* Any helpful advice or suggestions are very much appreciated. I've been reading the posts here a lot but figured I'd reach out and see what specific advice I could get for myself. 

Thank you! :)

So this summer, I got in a program with DAAD to come do an 8-week research internship at the University of Freiburg. I've been in Freiburg for two weeks now and as of yet, still haven't found a place to stay for July. Right now, I'm living in a WG with some great people I found on wg-gesucht.de (They've been very helpful, too, in asking friends and giving advice). However, their roommate is moving back in soon, and I'm either socially incompetent or too slow because I've been obsessively refreshing wg-gesucht.de for two weeks now to no avail. Anyway, I'm pulling all the stops now cause I got to get my shit together. If anyone knows a place I can crash for a month and would like to let me know, that'd be awesome! 

I'm a nice Kentucky kid, studying Comp Sci. and Math at the University of Kentucky. I enjoy running, bouldering (got a month pass at BoulderKitchen if anyone would like to join me sometime!), craft beer/homebrewing, and indie music. I think I'm simple and I really enjoy meeting new people. I don't need much: a not expensive place with a shower and couch or mattress on the floor will do. Oh and nice people! 

Anyway, thanks for reading!"

28ky7x,14,2014-06-19,"My story so far: the beginnings of a realization [MTF]. Long, I know, but I'd love some feedback.",Dear-Ambellina,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/28ky7x/my_story_so_far_the_beginnings_of_a_realization/,"Wall of text incoming:

In 2010, I started wearing my girlfriend's clothes while she wasn't home.  We would do our laundry together, and often times a pile containing both of our clothes would end up on the unused futon in my room.  This, coupled with the fact that she worked 12 hour days at the time, made it extremely easy.  I remember the first shirt I wore - it was a green, long sleeve shirt with a rounded cut around the neck.  I had to wear my own pants because hers wouldn't fit me, but they were relatively skinny and tight-fitting so it felt feminine enough.  I don't remember a lot of what was going through my mind, other than excitement since it was one of the first times I tried it.

Immediately, I was obsessed with looking like a girl.  Her clothes were routinely left in my room for me to wear at my leisure.  I put them on and took pictures, a lot of which I don't have any more because I ended up deleting them out of shame.  Only a few survived, the ones I saved that looked particularly convincing.

I didn't just want to wear her clothes - I wanted to *look* like a woman.  I was obsessed with doing anything I could that would allow me to do it.  My hairstyle at the time was way too short to pass, but I tried to make it work with glasses.  I looked like kind of a bookish girl, but it still *kind of* worked.  I was a lot skinnier then as well.  I would take pictures, specifically angling them to try and make me look feminine, and I'd be upset with the ones that were obvious - which were pretty much all of them.  For some reason, looking in the mirror was always more satisfying than the pictures - I don't think I'm very photogenic.  But in the mirror, I could almost always make out a semblance of a woman looking back at me, and I liked it but was supremely disappointing when the pictures rarely delivered that kind of image.

I joined a crossdressing forum after the first couple of times I did it, thinking perhaps I was just a crossdresser and that I should get a feel for the community.  It was short-lived and I hardly posted anything there at all.  I was a frequent blogger at the time on Xanga.  I remember creating a new account and uploading one of the best ""girlmode"" pics I had, with the intention of blogging as a female.  I picked a pretty, flowery design and made a few posts, but in time I became terrified of being ""outed,"" as at the time there were a lot of users creating multiple accounts for trolling purposes, and some users figured out an algorithm for determining when a user was doing such a thing, probably involving IP addresses or something.  I wasn't doing it to troll, but had someone found out that I was doing it at all, I would have been embarrassed and devastated.  So I didn't take that very far, either.

I continued crossdressing in my girlfriend's absence on and off.  It was by no means a frequent thing, but every once in a while I'd think, ""Hey, I should do it again.""  I took a few pics excluding my face and uploaded them to GW, sometimes indicating that I was CD, other times not, just to see what happened.  Either way, people were pretty convinced by the pictures, either if I didn't specify or if they just didn't pay attention to the [CD] tag or didn't know what it meant.  Of coarse it ended up sparking controversy when an angry user started flaming me in the comments for posting the pictures, in a thread that *was* tagged no less.  Didn't bother me much, and not many agreed with him, so it was a minor thing to me.  There was a pretty positive reaction to the pictures in general, some dudes even going far enough to send me dick pics.. I don't know if they knew I was really a man or not, but to me it was flattering - it meant I probably passed, or at least my body did anyway.  I didn't post many pictures, it was kind of like crossdressing, it was a periodic *I should do this* type of thing.  I can only think of two times I did it even.  

After that followed a continuous string of random crossdressing sessions, some of them drunken and some of them sober.  Sometimes I'd go on Omegle dressed as a girl, just hoping to chat with some people, but of coarse that doesn't work because hardly anyone wants to just chat with a girl.. they wanted me to show my ""boobs"" which would obviously out me as a dude dressed up as a girl.  Even the girls I met online seemed to want to play.  I went through a phase where I'd be mean to the guys jacking off on cam, teasing them and acting like I was going to show and then nexting before I did.  It was mean-spirited, but it was the only thing I could really do on the site that brought me any real satisfaction.  It meant that I - at least the parts of me I should them, usually from the lips down - was passable, that they believed I was woman. So, I at least got to take that away from it.  At this point I began to view my random urges to crossdress as being visited by my female alter-ego, who I began to name Tessa.  To this day I have no idea where I gleaned the name from, but I fell in love with it and from that point on I identified by that name in my female form, in private or on the internet or whatever.  I remember one night, I had pulled an all-nighter for an exam, and decided to do a little crossdressing/Omegle session, and I slipped on a nightgown that had been left in my room.  I looked in the mirror, and that's one of the first times I remember feeling like there was actually a girl looking back at me.

The next major happening would be when I went into an internet chatroom based around sexuality/nudity dressed as a girl.  The GF was gone for the summer on internship, so I had a lot of free reign to experiment with crossdressing/going on the internet and whatnot.  I wore a bra and a spaghetti strap top, and I had long hair at the time that I let rest upon my shoulders. I had recently lost a lot of weight, so I had a very prominent, feminine looking collar bone.  All in all, for what I showed it looked damn convincing.  This chatroom was somewhere you could go and get naked, or not - and I didn't.  There were about 15 camslots, some of guys jerking it, some of guys or girls just sitting idly in front of the cam, some of girls showing off.  I just sat there, with the camera pointed toward my shoulders/""breasts"" and chatted with the odd guy who would PM me.  It was actually pretty thrilling, and I loved it.  I loved getting the attention.  I loved not having to try to converse with people for once, the conversation just came to me.  Maybe that's pathetic, but I loved it nonetheless.  I talked to anyone who seemed respectful/tactful, anyone who just wanted to talk and didn't demand I send them naked pictures.  If anyone asked why I didn't show my face, I told them it was for privacy reasons - which was actually a legit reason, as I had once been identified in the same room when I was in boymode and had my face on cam.  Freaked my shit out and I never did that again, and I still have no idea who the person was who recognized me.  Anyway.. That whole thing went successfully and no one ever really suspected a thing, until I finally told one guy I'd been chatting it up with pretty heavily.  He was in disbelief at first, but was cool about it.  We then talked about my problems with masculinity and how I hate the social aspects of being a male, especially a slightly below average-looking, socially anxious and socially awkward male.  We talked about what I could do to get over it all and be a male in society - maybe it wasn't what I needed to hear, maybe it was, I don't really know.  In any case, he meant well.  After that, I never went back to that chatroom pretending to be a girl again, and I felt ashamed that I had done so.

After that I want to say things died down a bit.. The GF was back from her internship and was only going to school, so no more job with long hours.  Her being home more meant me crossdressing less.  However, I did start drinking a lot more during this time, and looking at a *lot* of porn.  That doesn't really have much to do with the whole trans thing, but it's a phase I went through so I thought I'd mention it at least.  I would only crossdress on the odd weekend that she would spend with her parents or be out of town for whatever reason.  Not a lot happened during this period.. Just the usual, random urge to crossdress and pretend to be a woman on the internet, be it Omegle or whatever.

Fast-foward to the fall of 2013.  I had been linked to r/asktransgender from another sub where we were discussing gender identity issues.  I begin browsing around, and there's the almost obligatory ""how do I know I'm trans?"" post on the front page.  Someone mentions something along the lines of, ""CIS people don't typically dwell on being the opposite gender.  The idea doesn't haunt them like it probably will a trans person.""  And when I read that, something clicked that I had never, ever considered before.. Maybe I'm trans.  Maybe that would explain my odd behaviors over the coarse of the past few years, and even a couple of things in my childhood, like how when I was alone in my bathroom sometimes I'd roll up my sleeves and tie my shirt in a knot above my bellybutton, because I loved how girls could do that and how sexy it looked.  The hormonal teenager in me wanted to be sexy like that too, but didn't know how.   And I struggled with that well into my adult years.. How can I be sexy?  Why do I *feel* sexy when I look in the mirror, but not in a *masculine* way?

This has grown too long, so I'll finish up in the comments."

He is cool, his manager is cool. We talk music, they respect me, are grateful for the work I do for them.

I should also say that I am 42 years old. I come off as assertive, my sister told me I can be intimidating so I have been trying to dial it back. 

I have a fellow intern. He is 18, a mere babe. He doesn't have a car, so I take him home from events, lives with his Mom, fancies himself a musician. He asked me to help him figure out wikipedia pages and wanted to know if he was notable enough to have one.

So we have been texting about his wikipedia, he sent me his resume, I have asked questions. Been kind, compassionate. He attempts to get flirty sometimes but I blow it off and redirect him. 

Last night he started blowing up my phone, texting every minute things of a very sexual nature. At first I was 'haha' and then as he got lewder I straight up told him that I was 42 years old and that wasn't cool. He would not fucking stop. Telling me that ""he knew I was funn"" (spelled wrong) and ""you can show me something ;)"" 

I am grossed out, pissed off and I want to put my fist down this fuckers throat. I repeatedly told him no! Did he really think that ending his disgusting texts with a winking smile made it okay?

Today he started going on about my looks and how we should get together to talk about his wiki page. I told him to keep it professional. After a few more inappropriate texts his last text said, 'Okay I'm professional.'

My goal is to work in tour management, to get into this business it all has to do with who you know, I am a bottom feeder currently. I am making contacts and I don't want to burn bridges but I can't imagine letting this pass. However, I know this will most likely be burning bridges.

Working in the music business has been my dream for years, only last year after getting out a long term marriage to a emotionally abusive ex did I have the courage to step up and make this happen.

I feel so gross, I got up today and bleached the hell out of the floors and bathtub. Ugh.

28l4d4,2,2014-06-19,Newbie looking for help,firemage22,PowerShell,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/28l4d4/newbie_looking_for_help/,"  So I am both new and not so new to coding/scripting, I started college in my school’s engineering department but fate would pull me over to history and political science degrees. After 5 years of job hunting, I finally found a government internship to get my foot in the door, but I find myself helping out with computers in the office I am helping out in, as even without the engineering degree I had once sought I am still a “computer guy”. 

  So here is the project I’ve been slamming my head against for awhile now. The department I am interning in has an in house access database that they have been using for years to keep track of the status of their cases. What I am trying to do is create a script that will check the database and update the user’s outlook calendar with upcoming case dates.  A friend of mine suggested I use powershell to do this. 

  I have broken the project into three mental parts, First calling to the database for the info, Second writing the data to the calendar, Third the clean up code that removes older appointments so they don’t clutter up the user’s calendar.  The 2nd and 3rd items took a quick Google search and a bit of tweaking so I have a well working clean up code (which is helpful given the number of times I keep writing to the calendar) and a semi working write to calendar code (lacking the variable calls and loops to write more than one test entry at a time). So I am stuck with the code to access the Access database.

  The database itself is an Access 2000 database and I am working with an Office 2007 system, from my understanding the database has been around since the time I last honestly worked on coding (2003). So I come to this sub to see if I can find help, while my friend who suggested powershell knows some he is mostly an expert of web based stuff, and due to resource limitations I need to make sure anything I make is based locally.

  So my first bit of code is based off http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2009/08/13/hey-scripting-guy-can-i-query-a-microsoft-access-database-with-a-windows-powershell-script.aspx and after some tweaks came out looking like this.

    $strQuery = ""SELECT TOP 1 [PATU CASES].[Next Date], [PATU CASES].[APA]
    FROM [PATU CASES]
    ORDER BY [Next Date] DESC ;""
    
    $strConn = ""Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0; Data Source=$PWD\desktop\patudatabase.mdb""
    $oConn = new-object system.data.oledb.oledbconnection $strConn
    $oCmd = new-object system.data.oledb.oledbcommand($strQuery, $oConn)
    $oConn.open()
    $oReader = $oCmd.executeReader()
    [void]$oReader.Read()
       $oJumper = New-object PSObject
       $oJumper | Add-member noteproperty Next_Date     $oReader[0]
       $oJumper | Add-member noteproperty APA           $oReader[1]
    $oReader.Close()
    $oConn.Close()

This code gets no errors but also doesn’t spit out any info. My friend suggested changing the query to something like this.

    $strQuery = ""SELECT Next_Date, APA FROM PATUCases WHERE Next_Date &gt;= DATE() ORDER BY Next_Date desc ;""

    $strConn = ""Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0; Data Source=c:\users\interns\desktop\patudatabase.mdb""
    $oConn = new-object system.data.oledb.oledbconnection $strConn
    $oCmd = new-object system.data.oledb.oledbcommand($strQuery, $oConn)
    $oConn.open()
    $oReader = $oCmd.executeReader()
    [void]$oReader.Read()
      $oJumper = New-object PSObject
      $oJumper | Add-member noteproperty Next_Date     $oReader[0]
      $oJumper | Add-member noteproperty APA           $oReader[1]
    $oReader.Close()
    $oConn.Close()

The idea here being a script that takes and sorts the items by date and then only grabs the ones that are today and beyond.  Yet it reports a No value given for one or more required parameters."" Error right between the “r” and first “(“ in the 4oReader=$0Cmd.executeReader() line. The other error seems to stem from the “reader” not being open which I assume cascades from the first error.

My ultimate goal to pull data and use them to fill in this code. 

    $olappointmentitem = 1 
    $o = new-object -comobject outlook.application

    $a = $o.createitem($olappointmentitem)

    $a.start = ""6/13/2014 9:00 AM""
    $a.subject = ""test""
    $a.body = ""only a test""

    $result = $a.save()

  With the APA as the subject and a number of other traits as the body.

  I really want to learn how to do this myself, but I find my Google-fu far too weak, is anyone around here able to aid my quest?

My goals being.
*Get the database call working
*Get the info from the database into the add to calender script
*Find some way to both check for dups and to delete items that get moved

Thanks in advance for any help."

I brought my brand new, twice before ridden bike (Cube Agree GTC Carbon) with the intention of cycling to work every day.

So today, I cycled for the first time. With a mile left to go, an articulated lorry (truck) approached me from behind at roughly 40mph. He didn't slow down and overtook me extremely close. Once the lorry had cleared me, a strong gust of wind from the trailer blew me onto the kerb and I fell quite roughly onto the footpath.

Fortunately, there was a witness at the time who was heading the opposite direction. He u-turned and came to see if I was OK and if the lorry had stopped. The lorry did stop about 200m up the road and the driver was walking towards me. The witness said he seen the lorry behind me with the indicators on and didn't understand how he was going to pass me with him approaching on the opposite lane. He said that the lorrys' wheels didn't even cross the white lines in the middle of the road. 

The witness helped me and talked to the lorry driver. The lorry driver was arguing that he left me 2 foot which was plenty of room! I know obviously that is ridiculous. I managed to get all his details and he started to become more sympathetic before we parted. The witness took plenty of pictures of the area and the lorry before bringing me to work with the bike in the boot (trunk).

In terms of injury, I landed on the palm of my hand and grazed it really badly. I also grazed my knee badly but can still walk and bend it. Luckily it wasn't serious and I got away lightly. I couldn't touch my little finger with my thumb, which was swollen. The company brought me to A&amp;E to get it checked out. They diagnosed what bone was affected but were unable to see if it was broken from X-ray. I can use my hand fine, but without moving my thumbs inwards. A splint was placed over my wrist. I am able to continue working.

The bike is pretty scuffed. It was in pristine condition prior to the incident as it was only a week old. The chain dropped onto the frame which has left deep slice marks. Both wheel brake rims are scuffed, and the rear wheel is slightly buckled. The bike landed on the left brake which is really scratched. The seat, handlebars, pedals, quick release lever, forks and crank arm are all scuffed. 

I've been told by colleagues that I should claim for the damage done to the bike. Would I be able to do this? Has anyone had an experience like this? I have an interview with the police tomorrow (company policy) and I'm going ask them too. But I would like some suggestions on what options I have.  

Thanks!

Now I've been trying to play catch up and get a job. I've applied for *everything*. From help desk to repairs to technical writing jobs to unpaid internships. Paid internships. Software support. You name it. 

I haven't gotten a single callback.

Here's my [resume](http://i.imgur.com/GjsMBTV.png). 

The final blow was when a peer of mine and I applied for the same company. They're hiring multiple customer service/repairs people at the moment. He got the callback and the job within the day. I've heard nothing. We are both in the same year/level of school and know exactly the same technical information. 

What am I fucking up? I have 2 years at a coffee shop as a barista, 2 years at a machine shop as a CNC assistant, and 1 year working for a T-Mobile call center that aren't included on my resume because I wanted to focus on what I think are more important employment experiences. 

Thanks for the help in advance!"
28l9so,0,2014-06-19,"Me [18 F] with my long-distance boyfriend [19 M] 1.5 years, is it always just teenage love?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28l9so/me_18_f_with_my_longdistance_boyfriend_19_m_15/,"I met my boyfriend in February last year. He told me immediately that he would have to leave the state in April/May for an internship, but we continued to date because we couldn't stay away from each other. I had never really pictured myself falling in love any time soon, or even at all. I had a habit of keeping people at a distance emotionally.


I had dated a decent amount of guys before I met him, and I went through a rough phase where I was experimenting with my sexuality with another decent amount of people, and I had felt things before. With one guy in particular, I felt pure attraction. The sex was great and that was all I wanted from him. Our physical chemistry was spot on. There was another who I dated for over a year, and I grew to love him, but I had never fallen in love with him. There was never any chemistry or strong feelings of any sort. Aside from that, any guy I had any sort of relations with had never really caused me to feel anything.


So I met him, got all giddy and shit every time I even thought about him, and had more and stronger feelings for him than I ever even imagined myself being able to feel. We had the physical chemistry, the mental/emotional compatibility, the same stupid sense of humor, similar interests, and a rush of euphoria every time we were together. Aside from all the feelings I have for him, he's my best friend. I didn't really feel anything outside of the feelings I had for him--no hunger, sleepiness, or the craving for any basic human needs. 


It happened fast. It sort of had to; we both knew we could only see each other for that given amount of time before he had to start his internship in New York. He's been living across the country for over a year now. We haven't physically been with each other since before he left, but we've been working on the long-distance thing. I still feel just as strongly for him--I think about him all the time, it seems like the only thing I want in the world is to be with him, the usual stuff--but now I actually eat and sleep and live my life. 


I've never imagined myself having a future with anyone, but when I picture my future, he's part of it. If anyone my age ever asks if I'm single, I immediately reply I have a boyfriend. When family members ask, however, I'm a little hesitant. My mom's afraid I'm going to uproot my life to be with him (which I'm already sort of tempted to do) just to get divorced in my 40's because I married someone I fell in love with as a teenager and was too stuck after moving across the country to be with him to leave. Everyone seems to be against the idea of getting tied down as early as I seem to have been. They'll say, ""There'll be more guys for you"" and ""It's just a teenage puppy love thing, you'll be over that soon enough and onto the next thing."" So, I guess what I'm asking is, are they right? 


I have a logically-driven mind, and I've tried to find scientific knowledge of the subject to aid my reasoning. There are things like Helen Fisher's studies on the brain in love that I've come across, and that's helped a little, if only to convince me that love at least has some sort of (very loose) biological basis. I also read that these really strong feelings typically wear off around a year after falling in love with the person. So I guess I could wait a little longer and see if anything changes, but it also feels a little silly to base something as irrational and crazy as love on scientific findings.


I know a lot can change in a year, and I plan on seeing him sometime in the next few months. I'll be able to see if anything between us has changed when we're actually physically in front of each other. But seeing as I almost cried because I was so happy the first time I Skype'd with him a few weeks ago, and he couldn't stop smiling the entire time, or the next few days after that, I can't imagine our feelings have changed that much.


My issue is I can't see the future and I have no other experience to go off of, so I don't know how realistic our relationship actually is. (Then again, it's love. How realistic is love, ever?) ... Maybe my actual issue is over-analyzing something I should really just go with. But it's hard to just go with the flow when I'm sort of planning my future around it.


Would it be stupid/naive of me to tie myself down to my first love? Do these feelings always fade away? 



**TL;DR;**: I'm young, in a long-distance relationship (after actually dating for a few months), and in love. We've had these feelings for each other for over a year. Are they inevitably temporary?"

28lnon,1,2014-06-19,"Confusion: On Teenagers, Millennials, and typical student mindset",SolemnFlippancy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/28lnon/confusion_on_teenagers_millennials_and_typical/,"As a senior graduating from high school this year, I am currently experiencing new feelings and thinking new thoughts which every senior (or so I thought) goes through at this time: ""What am I going to do in life?"" ""How am I going to make money?"" ""Damn, it is hard to make money."" ""Where am I going to go to school this fall?"" etc. I got three different jobs doing landscaping, handywork, painting, and errands for people after school ended, and began getting up at 5 AM, working 12 hour days, 4-5 days a week, and making good money (for a seventeen year-old). I am currently researching banks to find the best one in which to open a savings account, and am being productive most of the time. However, so many people I know are not. Several friends of mine aren't sure if they're going to get jobs this summer, aren't sure if they're going to do work-study at college, have 4 or 5 day weekend plans at each others' houses, go to see movies, buy drinks, buy snacks, cigarettes, cigars, alcohol, etc. They buy furniture for their rooms, airsoft guns, get excited about sales at certain stores, BUT THEY HAVE NO MONEY. 

How can people want to spend money but not work to have it? How can they be okay with wasting their money on shit they don't need (that new mag for their M-16, that Red Bull from the store, etc.)? Money is hard to earn, and it's hard to get a good job. The whole point of going to college is to spend a lot of money now in order to unlock higher earning power later. Why am I the only one who is starting to save now? I want to be comfortably off later in life; how am I going to do that if I don't start now? 

The typical mindset of my friends is ""My parents will pay for that,"" or ""Well when I die the money I make now won't matter,"" or ""I'll remember the good times, not the money"". But the fact remains that money helps out in life. None of our parents are ""rich,"" but neither are they ""poor"". They're average. I don't understand how people are okay with relaxing and enjoying being mediocre. I hate mediocrity. I wake up in the morning and I hate looking in the mirror because all I see is mediocrity. I am not ugly, but neither am I handsome. I'm mediocre. I'm not stupid, but neither am I the smartest person I know. I am not uncoordinated, but neither am I the most athletic person I know. But I am working very hard to overcome this; why don't other people try as well? They are okay working one easy, minimum-wage job per summer and then not working that year at school.

Speaking of school, why do people study weird subjects? Philosophy is only applicable if you're going to become a pastor somewhere or a philosophy teacher. Art history is only applicable if you're a trust fund baby who's going to travel Europe. Women's studies is only applicable if you're going to work at a left-wing group. WHY ARE YOU STUDYING THIS. Not everyone has to go into science or technical fields (despite the stereotype); I want to go into a salesman job and business. I am a firm believer in hard work; despite my limitations, I am going to become a millionaire by thirty. The actual college degree doesn't matter as such, but the hard work you put in (both in and out of the classroom) during your four years of school do. If you want to study philosophy, great. But to study it LACKADAISICALLY and without working and pushing yourself to the top of your field? WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL?

Can anyone tell me why people don't feel bad for relying on their parents for money? Or for not working? Or for wasting money? Or for lazily pursuing college degrees (which will not help them; they seem to think a college degree will get them a job)? Or for not getting summer jobs in college or applying for internships? "

Please help.,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/28lwd0/i_feel_like_i_have_no_time_for_healthy_food/,"Hi all a little back story first! So this summer I'm committed to losing all this extra weight i have before my senior year of college which starts in September. I work literally all day Wed- Saturday(wake up at 4 am for work do a 12-13 hour shift and get home at 9pm). Sunday, monday, and tuesdays are my only days off until I start my internship then my mondays and tuesdays will be full. Safe to say I don't have time for much. While I don't mind going to the gym on my days off or working out a bit after it work I find it hard to incorporate a healthy diet when I get home starving at 9pm and I'd rather eat junk that I can just buy in 2 minutes rather then actually eating a meal. Diet has always been the hardest part of losing weight for me. I'm about 20 lbs overweight which isn't terrible but I'm short at 5'1 so it doesn't look too great. I've always been active though I dance, play tennis, volleyball, go to the gym on chest day with my guy friends because I love bench pressing, love to run, but I have never been able to look the way I feel I should simply put because of my diet. Growing up in a spanish household our food tends to be packed with salt and oil and in my house we eat A LOT of rice.
So at the end of the day I have no problem with the exercise its the most important part, the food. We don't get a lunch break at my job (since I'm on a boat and its hard to get someone to relieve you) and I'm literally standing for my whole 12 hour shift so I'm burning calories anyways (I carry 24packs of water and soda up to the second deck about 5 times a day so theres my weight lifting) problem is when I get home I just want to scarf down everything in site.

I was thinking of preparing my meals for the week probably on tuesday but I have no idea what to make (I don't really cook much) and I get anxious just thinking about making breakfast lunch and dinner for a whole week for myself. So I was then thinking of possibly trying something like Jenny Craig where the meals are already prepared that way I can just grab those and not worry about not having something healthy for lunch (I have no shame eating while taking care of customers haha)  but fuck that they're too expensive.  

Does anyone have any tips for how I can incorporate healthy food throughout my day when I'm stuck on a boat surrounded by chips candy and soda?"

So I've been into Web Design for a few years now. I learned to code on dreamweaver almost exclusively, and have only fairly recently gotten into really learning what the web design community thinks is good and not good. Seems the de facto go to when it comes to IDE's is Sublime 2 (or Sublime 3, but its in beta so lets just stick to Sublime 2 for now).

I recently started an internship with a small business, where I work directly under one other person in creating a new site and migrating the existing site to the new design. It's a fairly large site, so its a bit of a task. My boss uses Sublime, and I figured it would be a lot easier to learn it too. But, so far, I'm lost. No idea how to even stop, So I was wondering if you guys have any advice for how to get started, plugins, maybe tutorial videos. Anything would help. I know my code, it's just this new software that's daunting. Thanks!"
28lys1,0,2014-06-19,[Help] Need some guidance,zoidbergLOL,gainit,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/28lys1/help_need_some_guidance/,"**Some Background**: I've been off and on on the SL program, mainly because of school, but I've been off school for about a month or so so I got back into bulking and SL.

I've gotten to:

* Bar -&gt; 210lb Squat
* Bar -&gt; 130lb Bench
* 195lb Deadlift
* 145lb Rows
* Bar -&gt; 95lb OHP

I went from 170lb -&gt;180lb since I've started recently. I'm 6 foot 1, 20 years of age, and eating around 2800 calories a day.

**The Problem**: Anyways, recently, I've been getting some pain and discomfort on my left leg around where the knee and shin meet. It always comes when I squat. It usually goes away, however yesterday while I was squatting it got a little unbearable that I couldn't complete any sets for squat.

I was wondering if this just meant I need knee wraps since I can still walk afterwards perfectly fine, its just the small but of pain and discomfort continues for a couple of hours afterwards. I'm not sure if this means I shouldn't squat at the 200lb weight (the discomfort doesn't come until around 170lb)


So, as to not further injure myself, I need to get on a new strength program, maybe some more focus on hypertrophy as that was my main goal at the beginning.

I've looked into other strength programs and they all seem to focus a lot on the squat. I think I'd be able to do it once a week rather than 3 times, but they all seem to be every day squat programs. I've also looked into PHAT but I don't think I'm at that level. 

**So my main question is, should I bear the pain with some kneewraps and continue SL, or can I find a less squat heavy program that still focuses on strength and includes hypertrophy.** 


Sorry for the wall of text. If I should post this somewhere else, let me know. First time posting in this subreddit.

Edit: Grammar 
Edit2: As per reply to MyReligionIsPhysics, I thought I would put this in the OP

I went to my doctor earlier (2 months ago) regarding my knee and he went through the range of motion stuff and said everything seemed normal, but he wanted to check an X-Ray. Unfortunately, I had to leave for my internship in San Francisco so I couldn't get the X-Ray done. I'm Canadian, so currently living in San Francisco on my school's health insurance only entitles me to emergency situations. I'm not certain how the health system works in the US, and since I won't be back in Canada for another 2 months, I thought I could just wait it out while doing other lifts that don't focus on the legs too much."

There are only about 5 people on the infrastructure team, 5 on the client support(with a level 1 and 2 below them), and 4 SharePoint App Developers for a company of over 65,000 people, with most of the intranet running on SharePoint sites, although people all throughout the company worry about their own sites. I get that it is work, but they all always seem super busy. What does an average SharePoint team look like?

I interned in the company last year doing Java testing automation and was thinking about staying with the company, but I feel like this summer I am learning a lot about SharePoint and wouldn't mind doing that, and I could pick where I want to live.

Is is safe to say that SharePoint will be around for a while longer? If I applied for a full time job at another company looking for a SharePoint person will I be at a large advantage over new hires, or is 11 weeks not enough time for you to care if someone has worked with SharePoint before? Also, how do SharePoint infrastructure and development salaries compare to other common jobs like Java developer? Is it in a large enough of a demand that they pay a premium?"

My girlfriend and i have been together for 3.5 years.


A little backstory. This all began fall of 2010. I had a friend through high school (lets call her hannah) that when we went to comm college together i began to have feelings for her but that ended up ruining our friendship. During the time this went on i had become close to hannah’s best friend who a while after hannahs and my friendship ended became my now girlfriend (lets call her lisa). Lisa also went to the same comm college as hannah and i.


We started off great! The first year was fantastic. We fell in love. After the fall Lisa had gone to a four year university out of our state and was a significant traveling distance. Something that was more than a car ride away. Regardless she eventually came back and went back to comm college.


At a point i ended our relationship because of difficulty with trusting her. I could trust her around other men, but she had issues with lying to me about things that occurred during the time i was pursuing hannah.


Lisa had been encouraging me to go after Hannah and had been feeding me information about how hannah was feeling about me. Inflating my ego and perspective, as well as giving me the encouragement to take certain actions. Yes they are my actions, but when i came to know this i felt that the past year was based upon me being manipulated. 


After which i had broken up with her for the summer but we got back together after i forgave her. I never bring this up anymore because she gets upset about it. 


-End Year 1


Eventually one semester later (Winter 2012) when i transferred to a 4 year school things started getting difficult. My univ was only 40 minutes away and i was commuting from my parents place so i was still only 15 minutes away from lisa. But the commute and time commitment as well as my 36+ hour job was draining my time. It was different from seeing each other all day at comm college. But i was making it work as best as we could. 


She constantly made me feel like crap about the fact that i was away. She would constantly want my attention and want me to leave school to see her. I never had time to myself in between school and work. And this began to give us fights over and over based on the fact that i didn’t spend enough time with her or text her enough. 


We constantly made up but it would constantly repeat. 


-End Year 2


Fast forward to the summer of 2013 when i was offered an internship in silicon valley for five months. Lisa spent the month before me leaving making me feel absolutely horrible. At my going away party she made a huge drunk scene making my friend and her friends embarrassed. She was constantly saying that i would break up with her when i wouldn’t. I almost gave up on the internship and wanted to turn it down. She never apologized. And when i left for CA i was served with a crying voicemail.


While there i was dealt even more issues with her saying there was not enough communication, not enough texting and stuff like that in which my internship sucked up my time and we had a three hour time difference. In the time that i was in CA she had also transferred to the same 4 year univ that i attend. When i came back i was dealt even worse. She wanted me to go with her to a local big ten university to visit friends the weekend after i came back. And i didn’t want to because i wished to spend time with friends. But when i told her that she threw a huge fit and we had another fight over that as well. This led to the last break up we had which lasted until january. 


End Year 3


We are now back together but the talk between us has led to talking about me proposing to her within a year. I just graduated and have a job at a startup but she has a year left. And she has given me ultimatums for engagement by the end of next school year.


On top of that i am from an east asian ethnicity and she is caucasian and her demands for a wedding would not respect my parents religious endeavors. (She doesn’t want anything but a christian wedding. Nothing in the middle)


After dealing with this i don’t even know if i ever want to be married. I also feel like my goals for a relationship aren’t understood by her. She is in a sorority and all of her friends are getting engaged and she seems to want the same even though financially marriage would be a horrible prospect right now.


Yes i am a logical freak. I think logically but this relationship makes me think less logically.


Tell me am i thinking too much? Am i wrong? Apparently according to her my thoughts on certain parts of a relationship are crazy.

**tl;dr**: Either I’m crazy, she’s crazy, relationships are crazy, or my dog waffles is crazy….

In the time that i was in CA she had also transferred to the same 4 year univ that i attend. When i came back i was dealt even worse. She wanted me to go with her to a local big ten university to visit friends the weekend after i came back. And i didn’t want to because i wished to spend time with friends. But when i told her that she threw a huge fit and we had another fight over that as well. This led to the last break up we had which lasted until january. 


End Year 3


We are now back together but the talk between us has led to talking about me proposing to her within a year. I just graduated and have a job at a startup but she has a year left. And she has given me ultimatums for engagement by the end of next school year.


On top of that i am from an east asian ethnicity and she is caucasian and her demands for a wedding would not respect my parents religious endeavors. (She doesn’t want anything but a christian wedding. Nothing in the middle)


After dealing with this i don’t even know if i ever want to be married. I also feel like my goals for a relationship aren’t understood by her. She is in a sorority and all of her friends are getting engaged and she seems to want the same even though financially marriage would be a horrible prospect right now.


Yes i am a logical freak. I think logically but this relationship makes me think less logically.


Tell me am i thinking too much? Am i wrong? Apparently according to her my thoughts on certain parts of a relationship are crazy.

**tl;dr**: Either I’m crazy, she’s crazy, relationships are crazy, or my dog waffles is crazy….

28m3cq,4,2014-06-19,When to apply for summer internships,Samuelgut,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/28m3cq/when_to_apply_for_summer_internships/,"I plan on doing my first internship next summer (of 2015). Until this point, my plan was to take the first exam in September. However, with some recent setbacks, I am thinking of taking it in November. If I have to apply for an internship by that time, I will not yet have an exam.

My question is: When do students usually apply for these internships? November? December? January?"
28m514,3,2014-06-20,A plea for guidance and advice by an eager young almost-PFY looking to find his way.,phroa,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/28m514/a_plea_for_guidance_and_advice_by_an_eager_young/,"Howdy. So let me preface this post by saying that embarrassing typos or random words are probably a result of my iPhone and the fact I wrote all of this one one. Next, by saying I have probably something near 0.5% of the knowledge and experience of half of you, but am actively seeking more; I will explain a bit below as this by itself is pretty worthless. Anyway:

So I'm a young teenager (probably even by standards of local tech shop internship standards) looking for some guidance in the realm of IT and systems administration, essentially; in the form of suggestions on where and how to begin. So here's what I've got so far:

* Background: I've been interested in the internals of computers and software for quite some time now, more so I'm the past 2 years. I've been spending a lot of my time recently working on java applications, building web sites with the usual markup and scripting languages, and dabbling with Python web apps along with getting vps servers to communicate with one-another in my testing/bot dev irc network (I got, and still am, quite obsessed with irc and irc bots recently). I also like to just throw random programs on them that I think are neat, and try as hard as I can to get them to compile properly and configured decently. The usual lampp stuff, bits and pieces of bash here and there, server programs n'stuff. Anyway, next bullet point.
* I'm hoping to work my way up some corporate ladder or career path to become a system administrator someday. Which is why I'm here. I'm a kid with no idea of the job market, this career in general, and would love some advice or really just thoughts on any of this.
* Ideally,I'd land an internship with the local tech shop just for that teeny entrance into the IT field, and cash, that's always good too, hopefully enough to learn further/specialise which'll be my next bullet point.
* Certs/schooling/learning. So far, I've been actively perusing random /r/sysadmin, tfts, and other techy subreddits and administration websites. That's pretty much it, besides the research I do for fixing my broken programs. (Which, albeit, is probably a lot. I'm proud to say that my only tech support calls were manufacturers' hardware defects!) I've heard from multiple sources, read:comment threads, of people saying certs aren't really all that useful in the long run. I'm inclined to agree that experience is probably Betty than papers, but I think getting at least the first level cert in most fields would be a great way for me to get introduced to everything and then work further in specific fields. I've really got no idea what I want to specialise in, if I do end up not going the way of a jack of all trades. Just not something in a data centre, that'd be great. Thoughts?
* Next, degrees? Something IT/networky, but again, would it be worth sacrificing what could be a few years on the job for a paper? I'm on the fence.
* If you could pick five to ten applications that are vital to an admins career that I should start getting familiar with, I'd love to see the list.

Glad to get that off my chest. Hopefully it's not too disorganised and stream-of-consciousness-y.

I'm completely open to suggestions or guidance on any of this, if here's any wizened sysadmins lurking about willing to share their mind. Or, even better, people in the Seattle area looking to hire an eager-to-learn PFY in a year or three ^_^

If any of this is unclear or you're really interested, by all means, pm or ask me some questions in the comments :)

28m52x,1,2014-06-20,Me [23/M] wondering if I should let new relationship influence my job search.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28m52x/me_23m_wondering_if_i_should_let_new_relationship/,"I recently started seeing a girl [22] about a month and a half ago. So far I really like her and I see a lot of future potential for a longer-term relationship with her. She has expressed interest in continuing to see me. It can be difficult for me to find women that I really connect with, so when I started to sense that she and I might be compatible I was very excited.

I recently graduated college and still live in the city where I went to school. I've begun my job search in earnest. I'm originally from an area located about 2 hours north of the city I live in now. Though I don't dislike this area, I miss my family and friends and am feeling drawn back to my hometown. The lease on my current apartment runs out at the end of July and I currently only have a part-time job, so I did not have any plans to sign a new lease, instead I intended on going back to look for work near home.

Now, aforementioned girl is originally from a city about 6 hours from here, but still has another semester (Fall) left in school in the city where I currently reside. She is currently living about 2 hours north of here for a Summer internship, meaning I can only see her occasionally, but she will be back at the end of the season.

As I mentioned above, I'm very excited about this girl and she has told me that she would like to continue seeing me over a longer period. I told her there was a chance I could end up working in this city and if that were the case would she be interested in continuing our relationship, she said yes. However, if I move back home at the end of July, that will effectively ruin any chance at a relationship with her because she will never be closer than two hours at any point during the year. Another issue I have is that she has no idea what her post-graduation plans are. For all I know she could move back to her hometown 6 hours away after she graduated. The thing is, I think maybe if I had a full 6 months to spend with her  and something developed it's possible we could make some decisions near her graduation that would allow us to live closer together.

Like I said, I don't dislike this area and it's close enough that I could visit my family and friends relatively easily, but without her here I would probably move away.

So, my problem is that I only have about a month to decide if I really want to consider staying in this area to work in order to pursue a relationship with her. In all honesty, my curiosity in seeing how we work together is the only thing that would make me seriously look for work here. Without that I would just head back to my hometown. I like her quite a bit but our relationship is still very new and I'm not sure if it would be a good decision to let future potential impact my job search so heavily. Additionally, I am torn about whether or not I should consider resigning a lease (maybe even a shorter one) if I only have my part-time job. This would essentially commit me to finding full-time work here.


---   
**tl;dr**: Met new girl with great potential 1.5 months ago but my lease in our city is running out soon. Considering moving my job search to this area to see how this pans out, though without her here I would likely just move back home. Is it a bad idea to let a promising but very young relationship impact my decision like this?"
28mc8o,3,2014-06-20,Internship Advice Needed - Backend vs. Mobile+Some backend,mathieconf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28mc8o/internship_advice_needed_backend_vs_mobilesome/,"I have received an offer at two companies, Citigroup in ON, Canada and a startup in Michigan. ( I live in Ontario )

I have heard that working at a startup is much better because I will be exposed to various roles and I will get to do more. A bank on the other hand might be more structured and might have to be a ""code monkey"" since I will only be an intern. Also, employees at banking companies might be busy so they might be too busy to give me work or help me out (according to friends who have worked at banks). However, Citigroup is internationally recognized, whereas a startup in Michigan might not have the name to it when others see it.

At the startup, I would basically be doing mobile development. I will work on their mobile application and implement features. I have minimal experience with a fullscale mobile project, so it might be a good experience for me.

At Citigroup, I will be programming in Java for the backend. I will work on ""Distributed Data Framework"". Not exactly sure what that means but from my understanding it deals with the big data financial transactions. I feel that I would definitely learn some important/cool things from this job. It doesn't seem so simple.

The startup in Michigan pays a bit more than Citi (Canadian software jobs don't pay high!). And also, the startup would get me some American experience so in the future, it might be easier for me to get Silicon Valley jobs (not exactly if it would).

I would like to hear your opinions on the two positions. What would be better in terms of future job prospects. I know mobile is really booming right now but who knows what might happen to it.

Thank you!"

28mkgq,6,2014-06-20,I've been having the same nightmare since I was a 5 year old kid.,SixProudWalkers,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/28mkgq/ive_been_having_the_same_nightmare_since_i_was_a/,"It only happens once a year average usually, sometimes more sometimes less; and I can't figure it out. Usually it happens when I'm sick or don't have much sleep, but it has come up on a normal night too. 
I could never remember details of the dream, but I always wake up feeling very trapped. I remember one dream I had to do this certain math equation (it made no sense) for my life or something of the sort.. Once it led to a panic attack thinking I was dying, but usually I catch myself and calm down once I awake.

I guess I'm not really asking for specific advice (what do I have to ask...), I just feel like I need to post this. I had one of these nightmares a night ago and it has lingered with me since. Perhaps this one could have been because of stress (I departed the next day to India for an internship), but I don't know. I just don't understand how it could be the EXACT dream that gives me the same damn feeling every time I wake up from it. 

I wouldn't be posting if it were a different dream, but I don't get how I've been getting the same one for 14 years. Nothing harsh happened in my childhood and I live a pretty damn good and stress free life. Literally the only bad thing on my mind right now is this dream that seemingly comes out of nowhere. I shouldn't get it for a while but I hate knowing that I'll probably get it again. Usually it only takes a few minutes to shake off the worst of the nightmare when I wake up, but those few minutes are terrible. I'm always on the edge when I catch myself from having a panic attack, I feel that it COULD happen but I usually (except once) hold myself from it. Either I'll splash water on my face or play the Grateful dead or something comforting when it does happen..

Yeah like I said I don't know if this is asking for advice or what. Just wanted to type this somewhere. Perhaps somebody else gets the same thing and could give me their advice/methods.."

I want to one day have my own business repairing computers and other hardware (or software if it so happens).

The problem is that I want to go to college and earn a double degree in computer and electrical engineering, but when I say that, people say it is too much and that I could earn my Cert and have at it from there. The reason I want the degree is because I will be the first person from my family to graduate from college and high school, and I really enjoy math (even when I suck sometimes) and science. But I was thinking with the experience I would earn from all of those classes and the internships I would earn, I would know a lot more than just receiving a Cert. "

I'll post mine.  As an intern at the company I currently work for, there was a customer that had a critical service running on an older server, no HA, no redundancy.  We had just finished rebuilding it from a double drive failure, so the logical thing to do now that we have it rebuilt is take a snapshot right? 

Oh I was (still am) green as hell from my college days, where everything was running on bitching hardware, and mid-day snapshots weren't a big deal. 

I took the snapshot, and promptly fucked up the RAID card.  Now while hardware failure isn't something I could have predicted, I should have known better than to do a snapshot on a touchy server during the day.

28n3qw,1,2014-06-20,How can I find my own identity?,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/28n3qw/how_can_i_find_my_own_identity/,"My mom is not really a narcissist, she just acted like one when she abused drugs and still has some narcissistic traits today. She was an alcoholic and got sober when I was 12, then she abused antidepressants until a few years ago. It sounds silly to say abused, but she would only take her very high doses several times a week,  which resulted in crazy mood swings and acting more out of it then when she was drunk.

She really is not a narcissist, but I can relate so much to the stories told here. I feel like the gatekeeper of her emotions. She always talks to me about her problems and gets angry if I say it is inappropriate to tell me certain things. I always had to make sure she was taking her pills. For so much of my life, I have felt like the only adult in my household. I have never had someone who acted like a parent. 

Her mood is stable these days, but she has come to rely on me too much. She expects me to go everywhere with her and doesn't want me to go out on my own. She doesn't want me to get an internship or job. She wants to be stuck here and be miserable like her. 

I have a really hard time just saying no and leaving. I really don't feel like I have my own identity. I'm 23, I have no friends and I rarely leave the house. It is really upsetting to finally realize that she doesn't actually care about me. I don't have the self worth or motivation to just say fuck it and do whatever I want.

How can I get my own identity and desire to live my own life?"
28negm,1,2014-06-20,"**Tips for Superpowers**, and no I'm not wearing a Superman costume or go after villains when it gets dark:D",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/28negm/tips_for_superpowers_and_no_im_not_wearing_a/,"Hi all, first of all let me start to congratulate all of you,  with conquering the most difficult part of PMO addiction our any kind of addiction, and that’s recognize that there is a problem and you all did that so well done :)  
Remember; If it was easy to become a astronaut everyone would do it…. It’s the same for our Fapstronaut; if it was easy everyone would join:D  

So as you can see in my name I begon this journey on 10 March, more than 100 days ago! And around day 80 I felt some superpowers, 
no I’m not wearing a Superman costume our go after villains when it gets dark. But it feels that I finally came out of this cocoon, where I always was trapt in. (Not sure if cocoon is the right word because English is not my native language) So in this cocoon I was a shy, ugly, nervous and a lonely person. But I don’t want to make this a post on how great everything now is, I will just give you a change to learn how I was able to made it this far, and what kind of changes I made that helpt me out so far on this awesome journey.  

**quick personal info**  24 years old; Moved this year to a new city, about 1 million inhabitants, My last internship finished sooner than expected so I had 1,5 month free time where I gave it everything and put hardmode to a new dimension.  

So let me call this; **My personal guide to superpowers** :-) I wil tell you what changes I made in the last 100 days.  Side note, we have all different backgrounds so if something works for me there is no guarantee it will work for you, if you’r not a big reader I **highlighted** the key words so you will get the point.  

The first thing you need to do is, **ANALYZE YOURSELF!!**  
*What are you goals? For me it was 100 days/ and now im going for 1 year PMO free. 
*What do you really wanna change about yourself? For me, having friends, confident inner and outer, Talking to people without being afraid, No more blush when I talk to people, losing weight. 
*What are your fairs? For me it was dogs. Almost nothing as good as conquer a fair :)
* Ask people what they really think about you, ask for the negative things; I asked my brother and it was a big wake up call, side note; be ready for some criticism.  

** Electronic changes** When I saw my computer+ phone + hard drivers it thought about PMO  So I had to change that first. 
This are the electronic changes I made in the last 100 days;  
*Change pasword to something positive: 100daychallenge every time you log in on your computer your are reminded of this challenge.
*Change background to something that gives you motivation. 
*Install a eye defender for your computer: This is a program that put your screen on black after for example 40 minutes and tells you to take a 10 minute walk. So you will not get sucked in random internet search, and we all know where this will lead to. 
*Make a countdown calendar and print it out (let me say 100 days) : Just go to word write on every  pages Days….. to go  (with 72 letter size and print the 100 pages out) Put it on you wall/ door handle etc. And if someone ask you for what it’s for you can just make something up like, school project, have to finishing this project in 100 days etc. You also have countdown apps to use. 
*Make motivation video for you self: This really helped me out late at night when I had my phone in my hands. I made a movie with windows moviemaker, with all kind of bad ass scenes, and speeches from the movies gladiator/kingdom of heaven/Sharpe/lord of the rings/star wars. to a personally badd ass movie.  
*  Shut down your WIFI ( all your internet connection when you go to bed): saves you also money and you protect yourself from internet PMO
* Use Youtube for positive things: look up motivation speakers like, Eric Thomas, Less brown. Just google it for more results. And if u want to lose weight I watched a lot of ; I used to be fat form MTV for Motivation. look up the episodes with Joe Gloor he is a awesome personal trainer an gives good motivation. 

** Personally changes form the outside** 
*  Get a new look: You will be a new person so you will have a different look. I got ride of my long hair, I had hair like a drummer form a heavy metal band. I didn't walked in a hair saloon for ages. So when I did the people inside judge me on my looks but when I talked to the hairdresser and told her she could do with my hair what ever she want and I would trust in here experience, suddenly she started to giggle and I became the center of attention in the room. When se was done and I looked into the mirror and saw my new short hair look, she said that it looked so good on me and that this was one of the biggest positive changes she ever made in the saloon. 
*Grow a beard: was part of my new look, and you look so more manly 
*Get ride of your old clothes: I dumped almost all my depressing dark clothes in a charity box, and bought new clothes with bright colors
* Get ride of my glasses: got some contactlens now, something I said before I would never do because I found it freaky. 
*Working out in gym; first I was a bit scared to go to the gym but now I love it and I can see some progress, the fat on my belly has degrade =P and I’m getting some arm mussel now :) 
*Make sure you’r tired before you go to bed: I found out that if I’m tired I fall faster asleep so you don't  time about PMO. So I started to do puss ups before I go to bed. Now I’m at 65 every night. Hoping to reach 100 decent push up in the near future   

**Change Inner self** (our whatever you call this)  
*Record yourself: a.k.a analyze yourself. I made a personal vlog with my phone everyday for 5 minutes (no intension of putting it online) I only use it to see my self back and analyze it. my goal was to talk non stop for 5 minutes it didn't matter about what. You will grow more confident with talking. The first time i stopped after 1 minutes because I had notting more to say, and when I watched the recording back I deleted it after 10 sec because I couldn’t watch myself back. Now after 100 days I can talk non stop for 20 minutes and love myself if I look it back.
* Imitate someone you admire: after you feel good with recording yourself and looking back to it, start to imitate speeches of people you admire (not sure if it’s the right word) I printed out Samuel l jackson pulp fiction speech and Gladiator speech from Russle Crow. And I started to analyze and imitate there vocal projection on the words, I can now imitate there speeches word for word haha:)
*Meditate I wrote this on this forum and yes it’s works for me I got more relaxed and was able to control feelings, you can look up for some good meditate apps. 
 
**Go outside**  I know that this will sound a bit strange, but it’s the key to your succes! Stop wasting your time before your computer/ t.v. and go outside meet new people and do things that you thought you would never do. I told you I moved to a new city where I didn’t now anyone. So in this 100 days I did those things.
 *New Sport: I found a good gym, and do a self defense sport. 
*Start playing a instrument: I bought a guitar and begon to do guitar lessons on youtube.
* Go to sport bar: I found out it’s one of the easiest places to start a conversation and meet new people, it’s no problem that you come there by your self, just order a drink and start talking about the Football match on the screen, go try this out now the world cup is still taking place.
*Language school; Learn a new language, you will meet new cool people and it’s always good to keep learning. 
*Practice your social skills; almost everyday I have to travel by train, so i found out that a train station is also a easy place to get over you shy of talk to people you don’t. Just ask for directions, to a platform, coffee bar, etc. I try to talk with at least 5 different people before I leave the train station, this will look maybe silly but it worked out in the end.
* Get a library card: Go to the library and start reading books of people that can motivate you like Wilson Churchill, Mandela our famous sport there are books for all kind of people so have a look.
* Look up sites that teach you the art of pickup.  If you feel confident with your self its time to show that to the ladies :D I look on youtube for some pickup tactics,and social improved projects, So from simplepickup. I did a 30 day challenge, called project Go. I did some part of it because I didn't was confident enough to do all of there challenges but it really helped me out. But I’m going to do it again and try to do all of there mad 30 challenges. If u don’t like there style no worries there are many more channels so just have a look.

I have so much more thing to tell you guys! but because English is not my native language it takes me a lot of time to write this all down. And soon I have to meet up with some new friends for a Friday drink. Yes this is something that wouldn't happen 100 days ago!!  

I'm wondering if I get any reactions, but if at least 1 person founds this story helpful, Then it was worth spending my afternoon writing this,  

*All the best my fellow Fapstronauts*, 

  Stay strong! :-)"

28nj4w,2,2014-06-20,Huge Problem At My Internship,panda_bro,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/28nj4w/huge_problem_at_my_internship/,"I got assigned to redesign our website at my internship so that we would be able to change some things around that we recently created. The main problem I am having is that the guy who had recently done this years ago got fired, and he does not remember his password to the CMS or anything for that matter. To add to this problem, he locked the CMS so that only his account could edit it.

We called the people who designed our website, and they said they could reset the website back to where THEY originally designed it so I could be granted the ability to edit things. They gave me the FTP so I could have access to the .html files and images located on our site.

What I told my boss was that we reset everything and just start fresh. I found a nice theme that we could plug in and go from there. Unfortunately we did not see eye to eye and he wants to keep the website as is, but with the ability to change things around. I told him this was not feasible as the code is a MESS and it would take a lot of time to accomplish opposed to starting fresh with a better, more recently designed website. The old website looks like shit btw.

How do I approach this? I told him I could make duplicates of all the .html files so when it gets reset we could just put them all back in to where they started, but I explained to him it would be such a hassle to update deciphering lines and lines of messy code. I wish he just let me start fresh but that simply is not an option."
28nk6i,30,2014-06-20,A comedy of communication errors,cptadder,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/28nk6i/a_comedy_of_communication_errors/,"Had a very simple of time consuming ticket come in that turned into something else entirely the other day.

Client email: Need account set up Ms New Employee and her exchange account created


We have policy on that and remote access to their exchange server so this should be a ten minute job but lets call the client to double check the last name since they use first initial last name as all of their logins and at least once a month we have to redo it because it turns out Doublepopulas was in fact Doundle and they sent us an email with the wrong name.

Cpt:Hello this is CptAdder calling from COMPANY I'm just double checking TICKET has the correct spelling of the new 
employees name here is NAME is that correct?

Intern:Yes it is that's how you spell my name

Cpt:Oh it's your account? (Red Flag) I'll set that up and call you right back


So I create the account, call them right back and I get a little red flag when the intern or whoever they have answering the phones says they will tell BOSSNAME that the accounts created.  But I shrug my shoulders and go on with my day.  fast forward a week we get an angry email from BOSSNAME asking why DIFFERENTNAME does not have an account set up for them.  So I get the email I contact her and forward over the original email.  And this is where the second part of the miscommunication occurs.  See if you can guess the first mistake I did not double check with her.  Because the SECOND mistake is that NAME is the name of the person she asked to call us to put in a ticket.

So I put in DIFFERENTNAME create the account, call back get BOSSNAME and tell her we are sorry and what she asked for is done.  Since she takes 3 hour lunches I have to leave a message.  But she does call back thanks me and we re-close the ticket.

The next day another angry email ""Why did Cpt lie and say he did what I asked that you all do for DIFFERENTNAME?""  My boss comes in and asks me what's going on.  I remote into their server, show him the account setup, I show him the two emails and the thank you call.  As we are both confused we try (And fail) to get BOSSNAME.


Fast forward three days, we send three unanswered emails and about eight calls.  BOSSNAME is back in the office and even madder than we did not call her when she left on her trip because she told us to call her on her cell phone.  I'll note it took us playing the messages back over speaker phone to get her to believe she sad nothing of the sort.  Nor do we have her self phone... nor does her office staff have her self phone because it's private.  


At this point it's been five days for a ten minute job and now at last we find out the first error.  We did not need to set up an account for NAME (Who was the intern who emailed us with his own name for some reason) or DIFFERETNAME (Who worked from home) what BOSSNAME wanted us to do was set up remote access for DIFFERENTNAME.  We both stopped, grabbed every email exchange and looked through them all.  No mention of anything but exchange account, set up an exchange account ect...  Come to find out when she asked Intern what it was called when you access the server from home he told her it was ""Setting up an exchange account""

The confusion all cleared up we all were backslaps and high fives because her Boss did not want remote access to the server from home for anyone but himself and when we asked him he told us No.

So we closed the ticket. "
28nmjo,7,2014-06-20,How to get internships / experience?,drgngrl,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28nmjo/how_to_get_internships_experience/,"I'm between undergrad and applying to grad school for computer science, and have taken a handful of computer science courses (C++, Visual Basic, Java I &amp; II) at my local CC to fulfill prerequisites.

Right now I'm freelancing in mobile UI design as I majored in visual media as an undergrad.

1) How can I make myself competitive for internships -- mostly portfolio?
2) Is there an awesome resource out there for finding internships?

I don't know what the best next step is to get experience working on real projects, or how much experience I would need to do so. Thanks so much for any help."

28nzgb,1,2014-06-20,Question about unpaid internships. What should I do if I think the company is violating the requirements for volunteer internships?,musicalpets,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/28nzgb/question_about_unpaid_internships_what_should_i/,"Hey guys, I'm a high schooler and this summer I've begun volunteering at a local hospital that's quite large and has about ~500-700 interns. We are required to do four hour shifts once a week for three months (minimum commitment). Now searching through here, I saw a post about the legality of unpaid internships:

&gt;
1. The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a vocational school;
2. The training is for the benefit of the trainee;
3. The trainees do not displace regular employees, but work under close observation;
4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees and on occasion the employer’s operations may actually be impeded;
5. The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the completion of the training period; and
6. The employer and the trainee understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training. 

In the program I'm in, high schoolers must at all times be with either a college intern who is also unpaid and is usually studying to become a doctor or nurse, or another high schooler. If the college intern is going to nursing school, he or she is required to do at least a three month rotation of volunteering at the hospital. (I'm providing this information because I'm not sure if that changes the legality of the situation I'm presenting.)

Rule 4 of the above requirements says that the employer can't have any immediate advantage. I believe the program I'm in is violating that rule: the interns at all times during their shift have company phones (not our own because HIPAA) that the patients or the nurses call when something is needed, for example: 

1. changing bed sheets
2. helping patients use the restroom, giving them baths/showers
3. bringing food and water, sometimes helping feed them, taking away trays
4. Changing adult diapers or providing bedpans when the patient needs them, and then measuring amount of urine and recording it
5. Changing their clothes as necessary
6. Discharging patients (bringing them down to their cars, helping them in, carrying their belongings)
7. Helping the cleaning ladies/janitors/custodians empty out trash bags, taking linen out to bins where they are to be cleaned, and restocking paper towels and gloves

Referring to Rule 3- we don't work under ""close supervision."" Nurses are there but we usually do everything on our own (nurses don't help us bathe, discharge, or feed patients, etc).

My mother also works in the hospital and she has questioned the appropriateness of the type of work we do, but we've never heard of any laws regarding ""volunteer internships."" While she was in ER, she has seen female high school interns be ordered by nurses to help men pee into portable urinals (really just bottles with measurement numbers). They have felt uncomfortable doing it because some have received inappropriate comments from patients before; however, nursing is a field dominated by women. The interns have asked the few male nurses to take care of these types of situations, but they are usually busy tending to other work. 

The hospital is understaffed, as proven by this scenario, which leads me to believe that interns may be ""[displacing] regular employees,"" as stated by Rule 3. And the fact that we have hundreds of unpaid interns also supports this theory.

I'm not sure what to do or who to contact. I myself have never faced any extremely uncomfortable situations, and I don't personally know anyone who has either. During our training, we were told that we were going to do tasks like this and may face unusual scenarios that may push us out of our comfort zone, so it's not like we didn't expect any of this. Also, because it's a hospital setting, I'm not sure if there are different standards that we adhere to.

Thanks for the input, any advice is welcome, and sorry for the long read!

My current vehicle is a 2000 Volvo S80 T6 with a bit over 150k miles. The past 3 years, it has cost me at least $2000, per year, in maintenance and repairs. Independent shops have been able to fix some of my issues but the dealer is often the only shop who can (or is willing) to take on major issues I've had with it. I'm spending nearly $3000 a year in fuel, in addition to that. It only averages 18mpg in the city. It is in great condition but, I'm beginning to think it doesn't make sense to keep dumping money into it. I do enjoy the car otherwise and insurance is cheap, being a Volvo.

Financially, I think I am pretty sound but I will be transitioning out of my internship into a ""real"" full time position after gradation. On the conditions of my internship, I will have 6 months after graduation to find such a position. This does make me slightly uneasy getting a new car. I'm eyeing a new, base model Prius C, for the fuel economy (50mpg+). "

My name is Jay, but I’m better known as GrandPyromania. I run a semi-popular Let’s Play channel on YouTube, which ultimately focuses on fun single player games. I began my Dota journey back in mid-2012, and while the game was certainly interesting and fun it was not able to keep my interest for long, as I didn’t really know many people playing it. A few months later, a few friends had finally received beta invites, and the game sunk its hooks into me, leaving me utterly obsessed. Since then, I’ve amassed over 1400 hours in Dota 2 with little over 1600 games played. I love Dota to bits, and have not had a game leaving me utterly obsessed while losing so often. Of course, I am definitely not as well-defined as other community members, and I don’t have a long grandstanding history with the genre, nor do I purport myself to be an expert or analyst of any sort. I’m simply a huge fan of Dota and the scene around it, and hope to help contribute something. So, I’ve come here today to get feedback, advice, and a potential partner with an idea I would love to bring forward that will hopefully benefit the Dota 2 community.  


I am hoping to host a talk show/podcast sort of thing, focused on all things Dota. I have noticed that there is a great lack of such a show in the community, as many of the other shows are either inconsistent with their schedule and content or hidden. Of course that is not to knock on the other shows/podcasts that focus on Dota, but all the same I think that an extremely consistent show would be helpful and beneficial to the community, in not only informing people who would otherwise miss out on the information when it first hits or many of the amazing professional players/casters/personalities that have a limited window to showcase the fact that they too are people and to have us learn about them. I want to focus on showcasing Dota 2 in an informational, positive way. For example if there is drama afoot in the community, I would not present any of the parties involved (be it a pro player, a caster, or Reddit itself) in a negative light, but instead, focus on the situation itself, getting all the facts across, and letting the viewer/listener make their own decision that hopefully would not be influenced by my personal opinion, only by my presentation of it. However, news is not the only thing we’ll discuss of course. As I stated earlier, I would absolutely be delighted to have on pro players, casters, personalities, and the like. Episodes that have guests like that would likely be less “newsy” and more about the guest, engaging them in an interview, discussion, and in general shooting the breeze with them. 


I hope I’ve made myself clear with what I’m trying to accomplish. I do believe that because I have heavy experience with YouTube and a lot of knowledge with streaming, that I would be able to handle something like this. Currently, I am planning on doing the show either once a week or once every two weeks, depending on how I feel the show would be best suited, with special episodes for things like balance patches and new heroes. Ideally, I would love to livestream every episode, but I understand that most of my guests would probably not be available around the time I would be (I do work a 9-5, M-F internship right now), and so I will make the effort to stream every episode I can, but if the time conflict is too great between a guest and I, then I will simply record it as is, and upload it. Of course I hope that these types of show will be the exception and not the norm. I will update my twitter if such a show occurs.    


If the episode ends up being streamed, I will stream on TwitchTV, and will upload the VOD to YouTube after the show is done. Furthermore I know many people love to listen to shows like these when doing other tasks or at work, so I will also be making an audio-only version of each show, for people who want to use it with their mp3 player. 


What I’m hoping for: First and foremost, I would like a partner in crime so to speak. Although I do have friends that play Dota, not many of them are really interested in broadcasting like this, or they simply don’t want to put the work into it. Ideally, I would be looking for someone who speaks English well, would be comfortable speaking with people, and has more game knowledge than me (which if I’ve got to be honest here- probably not hard to achieve.) I would also want a partner that would be dedicated to the show and help me research and plan the show out. However, above all else, I would want a partner that loves Dota as much as I do, and has a passion for the game that simply can’t be extinguished.


Again, I really do hope I’ve made myself clear. I love this game, this community, this scene and I’ve been searching for a way to give back, and help contribute, so I really hope this will help to grow and nurture the scene. If you have any questions, advice, comments, hate, please do post away! If you’re interested in possibly starting this project with me, then feel free to post away or PM me on Reddit. If you’re someone who would love to be on the show as a guest, then definitely message me! :D Thanks for reading this huge wall of text. &lt;3


tl;dr: dota 2 fan wants to get into making a podcast/talk show, could use a partner and advice.

28oeob,8,2014-06-20,Failed two technical interviews and it wasn't because I couldn't get the correct answer.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28oeob/failed_two_technical_interviews_and_it_wasnt/,"At least I don't think. My interviewers wouldn't give me feedback so I don't know for sure. These are internships by the way. 

Earlier this year, I had an interview with Microsoft and I failed first round. It wasn't because I couldn't arrive at the correct solution because I solved the problems pretty easily. My solution to the problem worked and the recruiter told me so. I'm assuming it was because my solution wasn't optimal. 

The question that I - believe - got me was a classic ""determine if two strings are anagrams"" problem. My response was to count the frequency of each character in the array and compare the two, if they're unequal return false if they're equal return true. The interviewer said this works. The classic solution is to sort the strings and then do a linear comparison. My solution was quicker but took up more space. I didn't know the classic answer at the time but live and learn.

This was before my data structures course and I was happy to get the interview at least so I kinda brushed it off and moved on. But I just failed my Amazon interview. Both engineers asked me technical questions and *every* answer I gave the engineers told me I was correct. Looking back, I could of made my solutions better but solutions can always be made better. Even then, my added code wouldn't of changed the Big O of my overall solution so it's more optimizations instead of major changes.

They're a million different ways to tackle a problem, there's no way interviewers are looking for just one particular solution, can they?

The reason I ask this is because I'm a bit discouraged. I thought the major goal with interviews were to answer the questions correctly and as efficiently as possible, but me answering questions and being told I'm correct, just to not get the job later has me confused. Obviously I'm missing something.

I talked through my thought process, maybe I should just shut up and only answer when I have a fully optimized solution? Any advice would help. Thanks. "

28oiap,2,2014-06-20,US-&gt;Poland,CassandraFoghorn,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/28oiap/uspoland/,"Hi,

I'm looking into teaching ESL abroad and from what I'm reading on this board, CELTA is the way to go. I did some research and the British Council has the most highly ranked programs (plus it would be awesome to get a foot in the door with a UK organization). They have courses in Krakow and Warsaw pretty much year round, and since I have an EU passport I could stay and work afterwards. I'm not too familiar with either city but they both look incredible. (Leaning towards Warsaw just because it seems like it might be an easier transition from abroad)

Coming from the US, the exchange rate would be easier on me than the Euro or the Pound, which is pretty critical since I have roughly $2,000 to my name. I graduated last year with an English degree from one of the top schools in the States without loans, but I pretty much drained what little savings I had to live in NYC for a publishing internship and am now back at home in CA. Internship was well worth it, but I'm a woman in my twenties and I want to explore the world while I'm still young/single.

tl;dr 

Want to go to Poland for CELTA, only have $2,000 

How much should I save to live in Warsaw unpaid for four weeks?
(Course= $ 2,000/Flight= $1,000) 

How is the job market in Poland for English teachers/tutors?

Out of curiosity, would being an American English speaker put me at a disadvantage (or vice versa)? Every non-native speaker I know from Europe learned British English, but I'd always assumed that was because Americans couldn't get long-term work as ESL teachers. 

Thanks!!

I typically have pretty calm skin, with the occasional breakout when I get stressed. 

[Here's](http://imgur.com/a/XvB32) a link to the zit in question. It started forming around Friday, June 13th. Although the pain has slightly decreased, it still hurts to the touch and feels very raised. I think it could be the result of stress, as I recently started an internship in the healthcare field. I am on minocycline, as I was having pretty bad breakouts before being put on the medication. 

My skincare regiment was previously awful, before I started reading skincare addiction after this breakout.

AM: 10% benzyl peroxide Panoxyl wash, maybe some Cerave PM moisturizer if my skin was dry.
PM: 10% benzyl peroxide wash, 10% AcneFree benzyl peroxide spot treatment

Since Tuesday, my routine has been as follows:
AM: Wash face with water in shower before work, Cerave PM moisturizer
PM: 10% Panoxyl benzyl peroxide wash, 15 min break, Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Pads, Cerave PM Moisturizer, and Nuance 10% Sulfure spot treatment

Please let me know what I can do to my routine, or anything I can do now to help calm this zit. I've considered going to the derm for cortizone shot, but they are heavily booked, and don't know if it's one of those things they can just squeeze in."

28osna,2,2014-06-20,"Can't get a job, anxious about career path, first generation college student, just don't know how to navigate life.",throwawayyy998877,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/28osna/cant_get_a_job_anxious_about_career_path_first/,"I'm a 19 year old college student. I've been looking for jobs since February. Getting interviews is doable - not easy, but doable. At most of the interviews I've gone to, people have told me that I'm very likable, interview really well, give great answers and say the things they're looking for that many interviewees don't even think of. I never end up getting the job. I try to follow up afterwards and, on the rare occasion that I'm able to speak to a hiring manager, they give me vague answers and won't tell me why I didn't get the job in spite of the good interview. I'm just trying to get a restaurant or retail job. I'm a 19 year old student, I just want a part time job, I'm not reaching for the stars. I see people working these same jobs who are inarticulate, sloppy, and unprofessional. I am the opposite of that. I am clean-cut, friendly, well-spoken, a dedicated worker with a  4.0 GPA all my life, and apparently have really good interview skills. Why are those people so much better than me?

I did finally get a job at a grocery store last month, but had to quit  because they wouldn't schedule around my summer class. They also wouldn't train me at all. I would have tried to learn how to do the job myself, but the fact that they wouldn't let me go to class means that I had to quit. That's an obvious dealbreaker.

So now I'm almost 20 years old and have basically never had a paying job. I've only ever done volunteer work. I wish I could pay at least a portion of my tuition so that I wouldn't have to rely on student loans, but I can't seem to get a job that meets my only stipulation (must be able to schedule around school). I'm still applying to jobs, but there are far fewer openings now that it's the second half of June, most jobs that students work during the summer are filled now. I have one interview next week. If I don't get that job, my only prospect for this summer is volunteering again.

I'm so scared that it will be harder and harder to get a job the longer I go without having one. People won't want to hire a 20 year old who has hardly worked a day in her life. Worse, I'm afraid that lacking work experience will hurt my future applications for internships and summer research positions (when the time comes to apply to those). I have good grades, but so does everyone else who applies to those sorts of things. Never having had a paying job just makes me look lazy and irresponsible, even though I'm not.

I spoke to someone in the career services department at my university. While I'm sure some people - namely graduating seniors at the very beginning of their search for a professional job - could have benefited from her advice, it didn't help me at all. She showed me resources that I already knew about and gave me advice to do things I'm already doing. I actually left the appointment feeling worse, like a solution was even further out of reach. I can't even get an on-campus job because those are reserved for people with a certain amount of unmet financial need.

Also, I spent a year as a nursing major before switching to biochemistry. I am much more passionate about chemistry, but it's also a much less straightforward career path and a tougher field to break into, which aggravates my anxiety. I'm scared that I won't be smart enough, scared that I won't get internships (due to lack of previous employment), scared that I won't get into graduate school and get a decent job in the field. Thinking about the future makes me feel sick. 

I'm almost a first generation college student. Most adults in my family never went to college. My dad never went. My mom has a 2-year degree that she doesn't use (her job only requires a HS diploma). And she knows so little about college that it's almost like she never went.  My parents have never been able to provide any guidance when it comes to any aspect of college. I don't have a support system to help me navigate academic life.

I'm so sick of feeling lost. In fact, I feel left behind. I don't know anyone my age who has never worked. Some of my classmates come from out of town and don't work during the semester, but they still have jobs back home that they return to over breaks. I'm afraid that it'll be this way all my life - that I'll be doing less with my life than my peers and never able to catch up to the level I should be at at my age. I honestly won't be shocked if I end up living in my parents' attic when I'm 30. I vaguely know what I want to do with my life (pharmacist or research scientist) but every step towards getting there seems insurmountable."

He responded that he needed time to think and now was not the best time for him.  He was going into the end of his internship, and had a major convention coming up.   He needed space to think and he asked me to leave him alone for a few weeks to consider being friends again.  

Before the fight we had been very close, and our friendship was something I valued.  Right now I am feeling very anxious about this whole situation because I seriously screwed up.  I am very worried he won't give me a chance to make amends.  I feel completely helpless right now.

If he does come back, I am unsure exactly how to take steps to strengthen the friendship again.  I know I will do everything in my power to ensure that I won't cross those boundaries, but I don't know if that is enough

28pgr6,1,2014-06-21,I feel completely alone,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/28pgr6/i_feel_completely_alone/,"I feel backed into an inescapable corner where I have no friends because I have no social skills because I have no friends because I have no friends...

I was raised in an extremely religious house and sent to an all boys boarding school. I never questioned any of it and felt ""sorry for the sinners in the secular world"". Make a long story short, I went to college and opened my eyes. Now I consider myself an atheist after going through a breakup and a period where I felt like life had no purpose since there was no god, got over that in a few months after realizing that there may not be a god, but I could live MY life now, not some imaginary sky man's idea of my life. I had only one friend the whole time but he was a bit of a sociopath with no concept of what was socially acceptable or just flat out did stuff to make people feel uncomfortable to see them squirm. My parents don't exactly approve of this so we have a rather rocky relationship so for a while he was the only person I had any human interaction with.

Unfortunately I failed the two semester's during which this was happening. Afterwards I started going to school clubs and meeting people, most of them were understandably unwilling to do anything with my socio-pal but due to a kind of loyalty I hung out with him instead of getting closer to the people I met. Started going on ""dates"" with one girl who I'd see everywhere and we had a lot of fun. Had to keep socio-pal from being around her since she REALLY didn't like him. I put dates in quotes since I was pretty straight forward that they were dates and she said ""you're cute, i'll give you a chance"", but any time I would try to do anything, like put my arm around her, she'd ""playfully"" scratch me hard enough to give me scabs, keep in mind this was several months into us ""dating"". Anyway after about a year (yeah I was really into this girl) her friend died (shot by police after attacking an officer) and she found out about it while hanging out with me. Well we haven't spoken since and after a few months of just getting ignored in person and a few txts she txts me ""oh sorry i just needed time"". Continued to receive the cold shoulder act and eventually went off on her at a party accusing her of leading me on and wasting my time when I'd been straightforward and upfront from the beginning and that if she was ""a blunt person"" as she claimed she would have just said she wasn't interested (with swearing since I was upset and drunk). I stopped getting invited to stuff since they'd rather invite her and gradually lost most of my friends again, leaving me with only socio-pal. 

I recently did what I'd wanted to in the back of my mind for a long time and just told him to gtfo my life. I can count on one hand the number of people I can even ask to hang out, most of my former friends will give me ""busy"" excuses or just ignore me. Several months later I've only left my apartment maybe 2-3 times for cheap bulk food, I've lost weight despite being quite skinny and all I do dawn to dusk is play DotA, Warframe, and EVE. I've half heatedly filled out some job applications but I won't have the money to pay rent even if one hired me today at anything other than $30-40/hr full time. I feel like I've lost all my friends, past, present and will probably quickly lose any I make in the future, and the only people I even have conversations with now are disembodied voices on teamspeak and in-game chat. I deeply resent my parents for the ridiculously sheltered upbringing I received. My GPA is beyond repair in a field where you need an internship to get a job and you need a 3+ GPA to even be considered for one. 

After telling socio-pal to f-off I've taken precautions to protect myself just in case. I've never had any suicidal thoughts before yesterday, but lying in bed after doing nothing but play games for almost 48 hrs, I thought ""I could end my failure of an existence right now"". I was, and am, frightened (upset/confused/disappointed/repulsed I don't know how to describe this feeling) that after never thinking suicide was ever a valid answer this would suddenly pop into, and remain, in my head. This morning I woke up and cleaned my entire apartment which took literally all day. Now here I am, at 2am on a Friday night, not a friend in the world, alone on my computer. At least posting this gives me some sort of outlet as I have no one else I can talk to about this. I don't think I'm to the point where I could actually off myself, but I have zero desire of reaching that point, so thanks for reading something a stranger had to put on the internet because he can't tell anyone in person.

tl;dr no friends, failing college, no job, playing video games all day long. total failure, considered ending it, and that scares me."
28q11i,2,2014-06-21,22 M4F - Choose your own scene,4thistime,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/28q11i/22_m4f_choose_your_own_scene/,"I've already come twice in the last 30 minutes but I can't get enough right now - so I 'm hoping to find a girl who wants to get deeper into a scene. Not just fucking right away but building up to the moment of entry.

Here are some scenes I've been having fun with lately:

**1. Impregnation, ageplay**

Rich, powerful men no longer want a ""trophy"" wife to raise their children. These men look for certain characteristics that could pass to their heirs - intelligence, health, and beauty to name a few.

Women in their early teens have been kidnapped from all around the world, forced into a refined sexual slavery. Hand picked, these women represent some of the most intelligent and beautiful people from across the globe, ensuring that clients are satisfied in the gene pool their child will receive.
At a young age, these girls are trained in the many ways of extracting a man's seed. They dedicate every day to refining their craft, with the knowledge that they are free to go once the mother has given birth to the child. A trust fund will be set up for each mother, allowing them to live luxuriously once the child is born. After four years, the girls are presented to prospective clients.

Men of all types come in to choose who they will breed, and each man has different taste, allowing him to choose from the hundreds of women available in the catalog.

**2. age play and can go any direction**

You had been around for years and years. You were always my older sister's most trustworthy friend - from when you guys were in elementary school, to visiting her at college, until today.

I had moved out of town when I hit 18 and hadn't much visited, so you never saw me and rarely heard stories of me. You always like to pretend I was a little sibling, as you had none of your own, and were sad at my disappearance.

You happened to travel to New York for a Friday meeting, and decided to spend the weekend and explore the city. You're friends recommend a bar in Brooklyn so you head there with your hottest dress and those heels you've been waiting to wear for what seems like months now.

That's where you see me at the other side of the wooden bar. In the dark smoke you can make out your personally adopted little brother, in a tailored suit and more handsome than you remember him being. His hair is wavy and dirty blonde, and he has that five o'clock shadow. His hazel eyes are the same as they were as a kid though, and they draw you to him.

I see somebody approaching out of the corner of my eye and turn towards you. ""Holy shit, you're the last person I expected to see here."" I say, looking you up and down.

**3. Work place, domination**

Every fucking day these interns come in late and basically do shit for whatever strange-hour shift they've scheduled. I've only recently graduated college and started my career, so of course I'm the one who has to manage these interns only two or three years younger than me.

None of them are here because of their skill. It's K St in DC - their parents have some level of wealth and power and were able to get their trust-fund babies into a resume-building internship. 

I've had enough of baby sitting, so I call you in, prepared to fire you. I don't care what kind of backlash there is from the top; I can't stand another second of your laziness. 

That's when I see you walk in in a tight, short pencil skirt, a half open blouse, and heels that shouldn't ever be appropriate at the work place. My eyes climb your stockings, past your curvy hips and busting out tits, and land on your eyes attempting to seduce me. *You have got to be fucking kidding me. This little whore thinks she can win me over with a slutty outfit?*

I stand up and close the door behind you, locking it. You look at me, opening your mouth to start working your magic - but that idea stops fast once I slap your face and have you bent over my desk, pushing your head against the wood.

**So** let me know what you think of these three, and if you'd want to play any of them. If you wanna talk about it first that's great, or you can hop right into it.

This might be a little intense for the morning, but I'm hoping it lasts a bit! Detailed and responsive writers get bonus points!

So, last week around closing time this lady shows up at the desk. And she's apparently had a bad day just from her attitude, but she decides to take it out on our summer high school intern at the desk.

* Lady: ""I hate this place!""
* Intern: ""Uhh... Hello ma'am, is there something I can help you with?""
* Lady: ""I don't want to talk to you. I want to speak to the park superintendent!""
* Intern: ""He's not here ma'am, can I help you sort out your problem?""
* Lady: ""No! I hate this place, it's a disgrace to our country. I'm telling all the news stations this is a horrible place, and making you guys shut down!! My husband is a fantastic writer you know. He'll write an article to national papers that shuts you down!!""
* Intern: ""Ma'am, if you tell us what's wrong we might be able to sort it out.""
* Lady: ""No! I want to speak to the superintendent. I want to speak to the Department of the Interior! I want to speak to anyone higher than *you*!""

Finally after this goes into a circle one of our rangers (who has been here for years) comes in and tries to calm her down. Still the same thing, they weren't worthy of hearing Crazy Lady's complaint. They finally track down the Park Superintendent's number and give it to her, and she proceeds to storm off into the museum to look at the exhibits. And purchase some things from the bookstore.

Both coworkers are baffled that this lady had such a bad time but still bought something from the store. Life continued on though, and Crazy Lady got stuck to the back of our minds.

Then my boss shows up one morning a few days just laughing his butt off.

* Boss: ""So... you guys remember Crazy Lady?""

We all nod and kind of lean in a little bit. While she hadn't been at the front, we'd all been wondering what was so horrible about our park that Crazy Lady would throw a fit and refuse to tell us what's wrong. The superintendent had received a few calls from her, but finally called her back and made contact.

* Superintendent: ""Ma'am, we received a few calls that said you had a complaint for the park.""
* CL: ""Yes! I was so upset. There were people climbing all over the rocks!!""

To give you some perspective: Our national park is one of the few parks in the system with an *open hiking policy*. That quite literally means that as long as you stay inside the park fence, you can hike and go anywhere you want. Want to be on top of that cliff over there? Fall off into a pit of rattlesnakes? Go for it!

So CL was just upset that people were following the rules and enjoying our park.

* Superintendent: ""Ma'am, I'm ___, the park superintendent. We cannot do anything about that, because it's our park policy.""
* CL: "".. Oh."" (she says when she realized who she was talking to) ""Well, i'm not there anymore, so it doesn't matter.""
* *click*

We all started laughing. Obviously she wasn't the most pleasant person to begin with. While I've only been here a couple months, Crazy Lady will always be a story I remember. Hope you guys enjoyed :)"
28q5it,6,2014-06-21,Seeking alpha assessment on LTR/ex,kevmeyer,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/28q5it/seeking_alpha_assessment_on_ltrex/,"I’m seeking an objective alpha assessment on a situation. I’ve packed it with a good amnt of background &amp; info, but if anyone can bear with the length, I’d really appreciate some 3rd party insight.

My ex-girlfriend and I originally dated for 9 months (together at first &amp; turned into distance after I graduated). I’m 23 she’s 21. In the months leading up to the breakup, we were pretty happy in love but I felt as though she was getting lazier in the relationship (didn’t cook or do nice things for me). I let her know that I wasn’t happy about that and I wasn’t going to tolerate it given what I do for her and she assured me it’d be fixed. Then the next time we’re together, nothing is fixed. I break it off, she is an emotional wreck begging me to reconsider &amp; promising change but I’m not swayed (she had plenty of fair warning; if she cared she would’ve handled it). 

For months after the breakup, she continuously contacts me saying she made mistakes/apologizing/begging for another chance. I just kept saying no, but I made the beta mistake of engaging in long text exchanges w/ her just repeatedly saying no instead of ignoring like I should’ve. After 3 months she begins seeing another guy (call him Mike); I didn’t know about it but I don’t blame her. We hadn’t talked in a month until she found out a friend of mine had passed so she called to gimme support. We had a long talk and she said she still wanted back together (I failed a MEGA **** test by lying &amp; saying no when she asked if I’d hooked up w/ anyone); I said we can start talking again and see how things go. She agreed but never stopped seeing Mike and I found out a week later through mutual friends (this was the first I’d heard of him). I told her to end things w/ him if she had hope of us being together &amp; she agreed (more angrily reactive than I should’ve been).

Soon we agreed to get back together and things seemed off: she was distant - hot &amp; cold. Saying things like she was scared about us, didn’t wanna hurt me, and twice asking to give her a month break. I’d say I didn’t want someone who wasn’t sure they wanted me and that I’m not gonna wait around for her for a month, then her tune would instantly change to wanting me but soon go cold again. I strongly sensed that another guy was in the picture so I braced myself for that reality but never brought it up or acted insecure/jealous knowing the truth present itself. After a month of that, I told her I was going to her city one weekend and she asked if I could come another time b/c she worked… right then I knew I had to end it, but she beat me to it the next day. She was a wreck but I just let her go.

I still end up going to her city that weekend (all my buddies are still there). Thurs we hit the bars and her acquaintances (most of whom wanna bang me) see me (they let her know I'm in town). Friday she bombards me w/ texts &amp; calls saying how she made the biggest mistake/wants to be with me etc. So I go to her place, we hook up a bunch and it’s all great.. she’s obsessed. And then she makes me swear we’re together cuz she fears me banging someone else that night. Sat we meet &amp; it’s going fine then I see a text from Mike on her phone (confirmed my suspicion). I casually tell her I’m out, then come the waterworks, begging, and bs about how she’d only talked to him after we split days before. I knew better but played into it. Sun I go out w/ friends all day &amp; ignore her. I get an angry night text about how I don’t care.. ignored it but figured she prob ran to Mike (later confirmed). Mon morning she’s bombarding me w/ “where are u, we need to talk ASAP.” She reiterates how upset she is but I weather the storm and we spend the day together.

Mon night she gives me the “I can’t do this anymore.” I’m indifferent and let her go (she said to her girl friend’s but clearly to Mike). So I expose our past month’s relationship to all her friends (she obv hid it from everyone so that she could keep seeing Mike), give them proof which they gave to him (they claim he wants to date her), and then I left town. They gave her shit for ""playing"" two of us. For the 2 weeks after leaving, she hounded me with calls/emails/texts profusely apologizing &amp; begging me to talk (ignored them all). Since, she’s made more civil attempts to try to talk, and I’ve just told her I’m busy maybe later. Been hooking up with 2 girls since getting back.. she likely knows through my fbook wall (she never fails to text me within an hour of a girl posting something).

I’m objectively a good few notches above her on the SMV scale (have looks, family $, attend a top 10 law school - and she’s a 7.5) - I had 100% hand the first 9months. She knows I nailed a bunch of girls before we dated, many hotter than her. I feel as though my Beta backslides were too much communication at times (got away w/ it when I had total hand), some negative/butthurt moods before the 1st split, and obv letting her think that I only had eyes for her. She’s always been sold on a future w/ me, mostly b/c of what I can bring from a beta provider standpoint. Mike is real average in every way: seems like a chill guy but not great with chicks and her friends claim he has oneitis for her. The last weekend I was there, we prob banged wildly 15 times - surprised she even walk to go see him. 

Where do I stand in her eyes, or contextually compared with him? Am I paranoid thinking that I’ve become a beta provider to her that she wants as a safety net? Was my beta backslide strong enough that it caused her to keep seeing him after we got back together? Torn a bit as to whether the attraction or rapport was the downfall. I’m positive she’ll try to hook me back if I agree to talk and it’d be weak to give her any attention after her disloyalty, so is there any way of recovering her respect? Reason I ask is b/c I’m headed back to her city for an internship in July &amp; Aug: would like to hookup but refuse to do so unless I have hand.

I know this is long, but any insight would be much appreciated"

Last week was my first week of work (if you could call it that). I was working with another girl from CSU named Zhanat, she's from Kazakhstan. Originally, we were told that we would be working for a company called ""China Outlook Investment Group"", but when we arrived on the first day, we found out that CRCC had been incorrect in that statement, and we would actually be working for a partner company called MAS Capital. This all seemed fine at first, we were in the same office as COIG, so not really all that different. Now I expected to have some boring, ""intern"" type tasks to complete on the first day, but from day 1 I could tell that this internship would not be beneficial at all. Our manager gave us a list of the tasks that we would be working on for the month, and I was blown away that nothing on that list included anything finance related (which I found weird because I'm supposed to be doing a finance internship). Regardless, I took to the tasks, not wanting to offend my manager, and in hopes that if I got through them, I might get some actual work. Day 1 was rather uneventful, we got into the office right around lunch time so it wasn't even a full days work.

Day 2 rolled around and the first thing our manager had us do was re-arrange his office furniture... at that point I was pissed and wrote the CRCC program manger expressing my concerns. This is more or less where the ""drama"" started, and everything started going to shit. I essentially told CRCC that this was not an acceptable internship, and that I wanted to do actual projects, and not do what was essentially secretary work. This began what would be a week-long battle with CRCC in an attempt to get them to understand this. During this time, I also got in contact with the CSU study abroad coordinator, who was extremely helpful during the entire process and really went to bat for Zhanat and I.

I lasted 4 days in that internship, and during that time all I managed to complete was a translation of an IPO document from Chinese to English (the only meaningful thing I actually got to do) and write a spam email to small franchises in the US. Oh yea, and I blew through 2 seasons of Game of Thrones... thats how little work our manager assigned to us. My stance on the whole situation was this; I paid $5000 to be here, and  am still paying for all of my living expenses past that. I get that usually interns get stuck with bullshit work, but the whole point of CRCC is that you pay to get badass internships with badass companies, there are plenty of other internship programs in China that are *much* less expensive because they don't offer the same level of ""service"" CRCC does.

It basically came down to threats to get CRCC to take me seriously, I told them if they couldn't find me a good internship, or refused to work with me, I'd simply go find my own internship and expect a refund from CRCC. That got their attention, and suddenly they responded to all my emails within a few hours, and we had a meeting set up for that afternoon... interesting how suddenly when money is brought up their ears perk right up.

Long story short, the meeting with the manager was pretty eye opening for CRCC... to start, they didn't even know who our manager was. We were meeting in a room that I had never been in, with a guy I had never met. When I told this to CRCC, they seemed confused, and that was when I reiterated that the company that they told us we would be working for was not, in fact, who we were working for. My coordinator at the beginning was STILL trying to get us to stay with the company, but after our manager was rude to her, she was really embarrassed. I explained that CRCC had already managed to waste 20% of my internship time by fucking around with their ""protocol"" and they FINALLY agreed to find us a new internship.

I was notified on Friday evening that I had an interview with Lloyd's Register on Monday. After doing some research, I think I'll really enjoy working there, mainly because its a globally recognized company that's been around since the early 1700's.

Other than the drama with the internship, I've been having fun in Shanghai. Every day there's something that makes me love this city a little more... at the same time though, I don't think I could live here in the state it's in. I think this time I'm taking a more critical view of China, and I've noticed one aspect that seems to be consistent: the Chinese have no respect for anyone but the individual. They are incredibly happy, and kind people... however at the same time they are incredibly selfish. This shines through in daily life, everyone is always trying to get ahead, to benefit themselves at the expense of others. That and they don't have much respect for quality. Things on the surface level generally look acceptable, however once you get close in and really get a good look, it's obvious that there were MANY shortcuts taken... be it in the construction of a building, or the quality of a living environment.

Well this has been a long post, hopefully I can do shorter updates in a more consistent manner so they don't get so lengthy."
28q97x,1,2014-06-21,"GF (F20) of two years broke up with me (M21) a few weeks ago to be with someone else (M20), and I'm still trying to move on",themanfromthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28q97x/gf_f20_of_two_years_broke_up_with_me_m21_a_few/,"She and I met at college when I was 19 and she was 18. Now, I'm a recent graduate, but she still has another year left. At graduation, everything seemed perfect. We were still really in love, we were talking about visiting each other over the summer. We lived a few hours away from each other, but we'd survived long distance for the previous two years. 

After graduation, we talked or texted every day. There were some days where we didn't have as much to say as others, but that always seemed normal to me. Plus she had an internship that took up her time, while I am unfortunately unemployed (though not for lack of applying). Things were a little tough, but nothing that we hadn't really gone through before.

Then, a few weeks ago (May 28th to be exact), she sends me an email of all things telling me that she's breaking up with me. This was a total surprise. I called her, and she told me that it just wasn't going to work. She wouldn't really explain why or what happened or any real details though.

She had always been friends with this guy, I'll call him ""Alex."" Alex is her age, and she graduated high school with him. He's in the military, and has spent time overseas and is currently stationed on the other side of the country from us. He has always been a huge flirt in general, but occasionally to her. This made me uncomfortable when we were together, but she always promised me that they were just friends, and I believed her because I trusted her.

She had planned to fly out to visit him for a week while we were still together. She promised me nothing would happen, and that they were just friends. Leading up to the breakup, she kept posting things on facebook and twitter about how excited she was to visit him, and she couldn't wait to see her ""favorite soldier."" Again, I tried not to think too much about it because I trusted her. I was just trying not to be paranoid.

After she broke up with me, I asked her if it had anything to do with Alex. She denied it, but she was a little too defensive about it. She talked about how I should be grateful he's out there fighting for my country, and that we're able to speak English because of him, and so on and so forth. Plus, later that day, she accidentally sends me a snapchat, I assume directed to him, with the note ""You look sexy in your uniform."" This is what really sent me over the edge. Now, as she's getting closer to her trip, the two of them have started being openly lovey-dovey, posting public comments on social media and stuff like that. 

It's been almost a month now since this has happened, and I still can't get over it. I'm angry all the time. Sometimes I'm angry at her, sometimes I'm angry at him, and sometimes I'm angry at myself. I just want to move on and let go of my negative feelings, but I can't seem to do that. I'm still heartbroken, and I still feel betrayed and lied to. I've tried unfriending and unfollowing them, but I still can't get past this. I think a big part of that is because I really don't have a support group back in my hometown. All of my highschool friends have moved away (some to other countries), and none of my college friends lived close to me to begin with. I don't know who to turn to or who can help me move on.

I don't want to fixate on what has happened, but I'm really struggling. I would really appreciate any advice or help that /r/relationships could offer me. Thank you all so much in advance.

---   
**tl;dr**: She left me so she could be with another guy almost a month ago, and I'm still angry, lonely, and heartbroken, but I want to move on."

* How was your first week?

I ask these questions because I've been an intern for about two weeks now, and really haven't accomplished much. My company's code base is quite vast. So I was delegated to mostly fixing bugs and working on application level work. I currently don't understand much of the tools that my company uses. I am worried me not fixing a bug will look as if I'm useless (I understand that most employees view interns as useless!), but I'd like to present myself as if I'm not useless!

Like I said above, this will be primarily a gaming PC, but he does have interest in doing some recording for Youtube and eventually wants to pick up a capture card for some console recording. But the capture card would be for later, so just making sure there is a PCI port open is all that is needed.

Here is the build I have thrown together so far. And as a note as well, I will be providing him hard drives to use, I have a ton extra leftover from my Western Digital internship. =P

The price is a bit over what we want and I'm curious to see what you guys think. Maybe going with an AMD processor will probably help.

Finally, in January, it looked like we were done for good and I pushed all my feelings for her to the side. I don't want another relationship until I graduate college. I don't want to have feelings for anyone or get sucked in to a relationship. I want to be single, focus on my internship and academics, and just live my life quietly for a little while. 

So I ignored her for six months. Total radio silence. I moved on with my life, started seeing other women (casually, of course), and I've been happy if not a little bored. 

I attended my high school's graduation two days ago because one of my friends was graduating and I wanted to support her and cheer her as she made the walk to the podium. Sometime after the ceremony, my ex comes up to me, kisses me on the cheek, and starts talking like nothing happened. Like we were just fine. 

I was outraged. Livid. I am not someone quick to anger, and this set me right off. Instead of saying, ""Fuck off,"" or walking away, I just went right with it. Started joking and laughing with her just like old times. And she told me that she couldn't have just ignored me. ""A lot of this was you,"" referring to her time at the high school.

She also told me that we get along. We just click. We're the only people so far who really, really understand each other completely. It's true. During my silence I found myself missing her humor, her stories, and just having someone to be a total fucking shitstain with. 

I hate how weak my resolve is. I should have pushed her away, and I didn't. And, yet, I let her call me and talked with her for two hours, just jabbering away like old times. She told me she wanted to be some kind of weird friends-with-benefits thing. She has a girlfriend, but they're in an open relationship, so at least we're not having an affair. I told her I didn't love her anymore, that I wasn't looking to love *anyone* or be in a committed relationship until I graduated college. She said the same thing sans the relationship part. 

Last night we met at a park and kissed and held each other. We were lying down on this playground and I held her on top of me and stroked her hair and face. We didn't say a word for about fifteen minutes. Just held each other in the silence of 12 a.m. It was all so fucking tender and sentimental. The way she kissed me, so softly and deliberately, it felt like an apology. She's terrible at communicating and I think that was her way of telling me everything. 

When I told her I had to leave, she refused to let me go. Just held on to me tightly and kissed me hard. I don't know what this means. Before she proposed being friends, she wanted to see me to get some closure and say goodbye. I'm not sure if I want it to be goodbye. We planned a lot of funny shit, since she's going to go to a college less than a mile down the road from mine and wants to hang out when school starts. I'm not sure of anything, to be honest. What does any of this mean? We know we're bad together, in a relationship. But this felt so good, so *right*. And I kind of hate that it does. I feel like like every time I try to run, she catches up with me. 

The past few months I've had problems going to sleep. I'll stay awake until four or five in the morning and sleep until late afternoon. Last night, after I came home, I slept soundly and immediately. Why does this keep happening with us? What do I do? "

OK, backstory: I am a 25 year old farm intern guy living in the midwest. I am dating a 21 year old girl who lives on the coast and we have not physically seen each other for 6 months.

Alright, anyway, today we  set up our stand at a farmers market in a different county for a special event. I had no idea where we were, but I'm not too familiar with the state as a whole anyway.

During the market, I tend to daze off and stare at the pretty girls because I haven't gotten a lick of action since seeing my girlfriend over 6 months ago.

Well this time, I locked eyes with the most beautiful women I had ever seen. She was conventionally pretty, but a bit more thick/muscular from what I imagine to be manual rural work (it was a farming/agriculture community).

I always make a point to smile/nod to ever customer, but I think when looking at her I accidentally let my mouth go agape and looked like a zombie moron. She locked eyes with me, smiled, and approached our tent.

*Gulp*

After some small talk, and her telling me how interested she was in sustainable agriculture, I asked her if there was any way I could help her.

She said, ""Wow, you're carrots sure are small.""

AND FOR SOME DUMB REASON, I respond with: ""I swear this has never happened to me before..."" deadpan.

Luckily, she thought it was the funniest thing she had ever heard and then proceeded to say ""I wish I could say the same for my husband!""

Oh man...so she kept flashing me smiles and batting her eyes at me during the transaction while I thought dirty thoughts, but I thought I was just imagining it like every other week.

I couldn't stop thinking about her after that and went into autopilot.

She had to be about 45-47 years old, if not older, but that didn't matter to me.

My current girlfriend is very young, and there are both mental &amp; physical things I feel that I am missing out on due to this. I imagined the deep conversations this woman and I could have. I imagined all of the techniques she had learned through the years, and how she probably knew exactly what she wanted and would be confident enough to tell me exactly what she wanted done to her.

Oh god, what a fantasy. I've never had to hide an erection at market due to my fantasizing before, but this was making me hot. It had just been way too long.

Anyway, my fantasy of the woman coming back and asking me to take her on the produce table never happened and we began to pack up the truck.

I had brought my bike and planned on doing the 35+ miles back to our farm while the others drove the truck back.

Unfortunately, a couple miles into my ride, I had no idea where the fuck I was. I am a moron and didn't think about how my phone's GPS would have no service in the middle of fucking nowhere.

Goddamnit.

So I biked around in circles for awhile trying to make sense of the country road signs. Nope.

I pulled over at an intersection and held my phone high in the air. Nope. I waved down a car and asked them for help, but they were elderly and made me more confused than before and I just feigned thanks and pretended to bike away confidently.

At the next intersection, I tried again to wait for a car to ask for help. A car didn't show for 15 minutes, but then a black SUV pulled up beside me and I waved them down.

The woman. Oh my god. My fantasy girl. Play it cool...

She was more excited to see me than she should've been, and I told her how I was trying to do a long bike home but didn't even know which direction to head. She got excited and told me she was headed toward my home to go to the Grocery Co-op and could bring me about halfway home. Perfect!

I was extremely giddy but also nervous so I talked really fast like an idiot. Fortunately, she laughed at everything I said.

She said she had to stop at home to get more cash, and asked if that was fine. I said yeah, whatever, I'm in no rush.

When we got to her home, she invited me inside to wait while she grabbed her stuff. I awkwardly sat in her kitchen, looking at pictures of her family, her husband and grown kids, and her cool rustic art. It was a country home/farm so we had something in common to talk about.

When she came back out to the kitchen she asked if I was hungry, and that she could quick whip us something for us to eat. She joked about using my tiny carrots. I then said something along the lines of, ""It's not the size of the carrots, it's how you use them.""

I've never seen anyone laugh so hard.

She grabbed my arm hard and laughed/snorted for awhile. She looked beautiful and her whole body shook when she laughed. It was so sexy, I had never been with a big breasted woman and she looked so fit despite having some girth. She also radiated confidence, but it didn't make me intimidated because I knew she thought I was funny.

Anyway, I accepted the invite to eat some dinner, and while she cooked I asked her where her husband was. Apparently he was on vacation, but she didn't like about him. She said they were going through some stuff.

I didn't mention my girlfriend. I felt deceitful, but I was still playing the fantasy at the market over in my head.

As I sat at the bar at the kitchen, I looked down her loose-fitting shirt as she cut up the veggies with speed and power. I thought I could see her entire breasts, but I wasn't sure because it was dark, and I again thought I was making stuff up in my mind.

Occasionally she would look up at me and smile. I felt comfortable around her, and I think she liked having me around.

She through some stuff in a pot to let simmer and again asked me if I was in a hurry. I told her I didn't have anything going on until work in 2 days, and she then slowed down and said she would be right back.

She came back in what I assume to be a lingerie top and boy short bottoms.

*Gulp*

At first she acted like nothing had changed. I had a hard time making small talk or jokes anymore, I was actually getting nervous now. This is what I wanted, but when I was actually presented with it, it was a bit overwhelming. She was bending over, reaching for things, putting on a show without admitting it.

My god. I was hard as a rock.

She invited me to come sit on the couch in the living room while the food cooked, and I accepted.

I asked again when her husband would be back, and she assured me he was on vacation and not to ask about him anymore.

She put in a movie she had rented and said it was scary and was glad she had someone to watch it with. She sat kinda across from me on the L-shaped couch and looked at the television, (intentionally ignoring me I assume)

She then put one leg up on the couch so that I could see up her shorts. Ummm, well I could see everything because she was wearing no underwear.

Oh my fucking god, this cannot be real. I knew she knew that I could see her but she pretended to be interested in the movie. I couldn't tell you what happens at the beginning of that movie if you pay me $100.

Whenever something happened in the movie she jerked or bounced so I could get a better view or have a show. I was loving it, but again, nervous.

She got up to turn off the stove and I watched her walk. I could see the bottom of her butt cheeks as she walked away and they were solid and had a farmer's tan.

When she came back to the couch she said she was hungry. I made a joke about that's why they invented food, and again she laughed a lot but then got serious and asked me what I wanted her to do. 

I couldn't hide my boner or my excitement at this point, and I asked her what she wanted to do.

She said, ""Absolutely anything.""

I dumbly asked, ""Do you have a condom?"" and then immediately regretted it. I didn't want to go that far, I like my girlfriend too much. But it in the moment, it was hard to resist.

Luckily I was saved &amp; she said she did not.

She then began to unbutton my pants and rub my cock. Oh my god, I felt like I was gonna blow just from a light breeze. I haven't gotten any action in months.

She then pulled it out and teased me, putting her mouth close and then pulling away. Blowing air on it. This was such torture.

I told her I didn't want to go too far because I wanted to respect her and she said she understood. I told her hands were OK but that's it.

She began to stroke me and it was more amazing than any sex I'd ever had, both because it was wrong and because she knew exactly what she was doing.

But all of a sudden, she stopped. She took off her top, flopped out her nice firm breasts, and said, ""I can't do this dry, do you mind if I lube it up?""

I agreed, and she said, ""this is only to get it wet"" and put her mouth around my cock and pretended to wet it, while putting it deep enough to gag herself.

I half-heartedly told her to stop, but couldn't resist. I'd never felt anything like that. My girlfriend can't even fit me in her mouth.

I felt like I was about to cum, but for some reason I didn't. Even though each second felt like a continuous orgasm.

Then, something happened.

She stopped, looked up and smiled at me, and hopped on the couch. She then took off her shorts and looked back at me.

""Put it in.""

Put it in? Fuck no I wasn't going to put it in without a condom. I didn't know this woman.

Which is easy to say now. At the time, it was a harder decision, so after minor hesitation, I ran up behind her.

I'm not an aggressive man, but the pent up frustration combined with the hard farm work I had been doing made me into a monster. My newfound strength allowed me to pick this woman up like a rag doll, and I thrust myself into her pretty hard while holding her to a hover.

I expected it to be easy going in, due to her wetness, but it was tighter than anything I'd ever felt, possibly due to my hardness.

She let out the sexiest moan and looked back at me with the most seductive smile while biting her lip. She knew exactly what she was doing.

She kept shouting, ""harder, harder"" despite me pounding her like a jackhammer. She then was screaming, ""I'm going to cum, I'm going to cum"" which usually sends me over the deep end and makes me cum, but I held on.

She then got angry and yelled, ""you better not fucking cum, I'm almost there"" while I amazingly kept hanging on. I felt like a rockstar, because this went on for what felt like 10 more minutes with her quivering feeling like she was borderline cumming.

I finally felt her go stiff and her vagina felt like a vacuum hose around my cock. She yelled, ""cum inside of me you stud"" Instead of pushing off, I leaned into her nice big round ass, laid on her back, and unleashed inside of her.

Oh my fucking god. I have never felt anything like it ever before. As I relaxed on her back, still inside of her, I started to freak out. I never came inside of anyone before, much less a random woman in the middle of fucking nowhere.

We cuddled for a bit, talking about a few things and how much it meant to her and how it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. She then offered to take a shower with me, and I agreed. As she went to get the shower ready, I went into the bathroom.

I grabbed a pad of paper and a pen and wrote her a note about how this was a dream come true and the greatest thing that has ever happened to me, and thanking her, but that I had to go back to real life.

I put the note on the kitchen counter and while I heard the tub running, ran back through the garage, got my bike out of the back of the SUV, and pedaled like a madman until I got cell reception.

I can't say I regret the experience (yet) but I have no idea how this affects my future. I'm glad it happened because I think it's making me realize I'm too young to settle down and I have too many options available, but I also realize this is definitely the most crazy thing that's ever going to happen to me. Too many thoughts going through my head right now. Jesus."

I've read you can have your transcripts reviewed by an accredited university. Has anyone done this? Any advice, tips, or insight? Do I seem like a good candidate for this, or should I continue to pursue a Masters? If I do the Masters will I just be bored out of my skull re-taking classes? Has anyone heard of a Masters program waiving classes for the Masters that you already took in undergrad? **/end TLDR**

I'm studying Human Nutrition at an undergraduate level but my campus lacks the DPD accreditation from ACEND. We were pursuing it but our University got a new president who apparently put the brakes on all projects/pursuits of that nature until he gets settled in. (Even if we get it I'm not sure it will retroactively apply to me anyways, as we'll get it close to or after my graduation.)

My plan has been to go to a Masters DPD program, not because I particularly love the idea shelling out another 60-80k, but because I thought it was my only option, due to the lack of DPD with my Bachelors.

But I was just browsing the AND website and saw this passage:

&gt;If you already have a degree from a U.S. regionally accredited college or university that is not in dietetics and are interested in a nutrition career, you can choose to become a RDN or a DTR. In either case, you will need to have your college transcripts evaluated by a director of a dietetics program accredited by ACEND. The director will evaluate your previous academic preparation and identify the courses that you would need to complete at that institution to meet the dietetics requirements. The number of courses you need and the college’s degree requirements will determine whether you need to complete another degree or not. It may be possible to complete the required dietetics coursework while enrolled in a graduate program. Because the policies, procedures and costs for the transcript evaluation may vary from one institution to another, you may want to contact more than one dietetics program for further information. The dietetics program director can advise you of your options.

Because I will have completed every course listed in the curriculum of most DPD programs I think this might be an option for me but I'm wondering if it's even possible to take my BS to another school just to have them say ""Yep, looks good"" and/or maybe have to take one or two a la carte courses. Has anyone been in this position? Has anyone had their degree from a non-accredited program ""okay'ed?"" If it were okay'ed I'd just need an Internship and to sit the exam, right?

I don't hate the idea of getting a Masters but when I look at the *Masters* curriculum at most schools I've taken over half the courses listed so I'd rather not sit through the same thing (though possibly a bit more in-depth, admittedly) all over again.

Courses I'll have taken upon finishing my BS:

* Scientific Foundations of Human Nutrition

* Infant &amp; Child Nutrition

* Life Cycle Nutrition

* Fitness &amp; Sports Nutrition

* Community Nutrition

* Nutrition Assessment

* Nutrition Communication &amp; Counseling

* Nutrition and Diet Therapy

* Advanced Human Nutrition

* Principles of Chemistry I &amp; II w/ Labs

* A&amp;P w/ Labs (Separate Courses)

* Organic Chemistry I &amp; II w/ Labs

* Culinary Arts w/ Lab

* Food Science w/ Lab

* General Biology I &amp; II w/ Labs

* Genetics w/ Lab

* Microbiology w/ Lab

* Biochemistry I &amp; II (No Labs)

* Statistics

And of course all the usual Gen Eds. As you can see I've got a pretty rigorous Nutrition program under my belt already and so I'm worried about approaching Masters programs since they all seem to be designed for career-changers who have very little background."
28rdon,298,2014-06-21,The Woman in White,DudePharm,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/28rdon/the_woman_in_white/,"First time posting, and I have to say, I love this subreddit.  Hopefully this story fits the bill.

Back when I had finished college out of state, I returned home before for the summer to get some intern hours in before starting pharmacy school the following semester.  It was also the memorable summer where I hooked up with an old high school girlfriend who, at this point, I am marrying in a few weeks.

At the time, my girlfriend lived out on the outskirts of our 33k populated town.  She had grown up out there in a densely wooded area where picket fences didn't exist.  Everyone out there knew each other for the most part but there were your share of eccentric oddities that were able to let their freak flag fly way out there.  

So, her father was a bit protective, but an all around cool guy.  That being said, in order for us to 'hang out' I would have to sneak in through her bay window on the back side of the house.  Often I would drive up behind her house (on a shared back alley dirt road) sneak in through the window, sleep for a few hours, and leave at dawn.  Rough, but at the time it was completely worth it.  

This means of getting some did have its close calls. One time a SWAT bust happened around 1 AM to some neighbor who apparently stored a lot of meth in his house, which was a relatively scary moment but it was nothing compared to what happened a few weeks later.

Now it should be said that when I drive up to the house, I usually had music playing, windows rolled up, mainly because it was a pain in the ass to roll them down.  And the nights when I would be over for dinner, I was gone before nightfall.  This becomes relevant for what actually happened, as I hadn't had the pleasure to be around for the 'witching' hour.

One night I woke up at roughly 3 AM, and couldn't go back to sleep.  So after much deliberation, I kissed my groggy girlfriend and proceeded to sneak out and make a beeline for my car.  Now, another bit of information:  there are no street lights out here, just the bright spotlight her father installed off the back of the house, and my car is just behind a fence off to the side.  

When I got to my car, there was a figure dressed in white peering into each of the windows.  It was a very lanky woman, nothing on but a dirty nightgown, hair that looked like it had been recently pulled in every which direction.  As I approached (and hell, I dont know what compelled me to keep walking in that direction) she methodically placed her face against each window, circling the car over and over.  I froze as she stopped on the other side of the car.  Her face started to turn towards me, slowly, robotically.  I did my best to duck back behind some shrubs but she must have sensed my presence as she turned and looked me.

I will never forget those eyes.  No odd colors, no bloodshot redness, just glazed over and wide, almost staring through me.  Her lips were smashed together and sucked into her mouth and in a long, wide smile.  Her cheeks, covered in leather-like skin, sagged on her pronounced cheek bones.  

I fell backwards and into the dirt, and at first I felt like an idiot for doing so.  I kicked backwards in the shock of it all and as I got up, she marched over to me, her eyebrows furrowed and her upper lip curling like a snarl.  I froze, unsure what to do, I remember how loudly my heart was pounding in my chest.  I looked up and down at her, seeing if she had some kind of weapon, hoping I wouldnt get stabbed, my body found as the sun came up.

She just stood over me, part of her body illuminated in the spotlight, and pointed a yellowed finger.  I sat there, grimacing, waiting for her to make a move.  Which was odd, as I am a 6'4"" dude and she was maybe 5'6 tops.  But appearance is everything and I'm not the most pro-confrontational person.

Nothing happened for what seemed like minutes.  As I slowly muddled through my situation and stared at a woman who looked like she was going to explode from anger pointed at me like she had found some murderer hiding in the dark.  I finally made a move to get up before her mouth went wide and she screamed.

For quite a long time.  An eternity almost.  Sinusoidally moving through octaves of rage and combustable frustration. 

Her face went red quickly as her initial, ear splitting, screech evolved into a low wail.  And the worst part was how she stared at me, the entire time of it all, without really ever seeing me.  Her eyes seemed eternally focused on some point, deep in the dirt under me.  I got up and ran back to the house, not caring that her dad would likely have a shotgun or something waiting for me to tell the awkward story of why I am at their house at 3 in the morning.  

As I did, I heard her feet clop against the dirt of the road, but I didnt hear that for long as she quickly regained her breath and filled the air with the loudest string of nonsense and obscenities I have ever heard.  Gems like, ""Goatf*cker, you KILLLED MY HAAAAAMMER!"" or the classic, ""Piece of dried diarrhea sh*t, always peeing in my f*cking car!""  Those were just the ones I could build some kind of coherent sentence out of.

the backdoor was locked, and my wimpy self didn't dare to attempt the window and expose my girlfriend to the banshee outside.  So I ran around out front, hoping to lose her.  Except the front door was open, and my future father-in-law smiled at me and yelled at me to come inside.  I duck in, incredulously looking at him as he laughed.  I tried to explain myself when he quieted me and beckoned me to listen.  And in a surreal 15 minutes, my FIL and I sat there in the dark of his dining room and listened to this wizened, mentally-ill woman scream into the night.  

The screaming never stopped, and my FIL explained that it rarely did, she would usually just scream for hours until he got exhausted and passed out.  My future father in law walked me out and told me good night, thankfully not asking any questions as to why I was there (which came later and it wasn't so bad) as we both heard the woman scream in the distance.  My FIL told me to drive out via a back route and to keep my windows open.

I drove off and did so.  And before long my headlights revealed a dark house not far off from my girlfriend's.  And there she was, standing in front of the open door screaming at me through my windshield.  The fear returned, even in my car. I backed out of the area and drove out the normal way.

Some time later, I chanced staying after dark, realizing that my girlfriend was exaggerating a bit about how draconian her father was.  I remember sitting outside with him one night, his dog between us.  Listening to her curse at everyone in the world, similar in nature to stargazers (screamauditors?).  My father told me that Jane, the woman in white, had been by herself for some time now, no family had ever come by as far as he could tell.  Police had been called several times, but she had been coherent enough to legally prevent them from taking her away.  No one could force her to take her medication, or seek help.

Until one day, where I had heard that some children had knocked on her door selling cookies.  She had apparently slapped one of them and the police were called and she was taken to the psychiatric section of the nearby hospital where I was interning.

One night, like most swing shifts I had to work from time to time, I had to restock the medication dispensing machine (Pyxis).  And since I had to walk through a hallway of patient rooms, its always a bit unsettling as hallway lights are always off.  Upon arrival, I glance around the nurses station, taking in the array of camera feeds that are always under surveillance.  And I see her, in the grainy video, sitting on her bed, rocking back and forth, and you can almost make out her mouth moving.  I'm pretty sure she was saying nothing nice to no one in particular.  I made sure to walk by her room with a quicker step on my exodus out of the ward.

She never came back to that house, I did hear that she got back on her meds and some distant relative offered to take her in, but she refused to leave her home.  My father in law, who has since moved out of the area, says the last time he was there that he had a very decent and coherent conversation with her.  And I sincerely hope she ends up on her feet.  But until then, I hope Jane is alright and that I will never have to meet the woman in white again."

I have never used github before, nor do I understand anything about version control (but my programs are so small that it really isn't necessary).

Not just fucking right away but building up to the moment of entry.

Here are some scenes I've been having fun with lately:

**Impregnation, ageplay**

Rich, powerful men no longer want a ""trophy"" wife to raise their children. These men look for certain characteristics that could pass to their heirs - intelligence, health, and beauty to name a few.

Women in their early teens have been kidnapped from all around the world, forced into a refined sexual slavery. Hand picked, these women represent some of the most intelligent and beautiful people from across the globe, ensuring that clients are satisfied in the gene pool their child will receive. At a young age, these girls are trained in the many ways of extracting a man's seed. They dedicate every day to refining their craft, with the knowledge that they are free to go once the mother has given birth to the child. A trust fund will be set up for each mother, allowing them to live luxuriously once the child is born. After four years, the girls are presented to prospective clients.

Men of all types come in to choose who they will breed, and each man has different taste, allowing him to choose from the hundreds of women available in the catalog.

**age play, can go any direction**

You had been around for years and years. You were always my older sister's most trustworthy friend - from when you guys were in elementary school, to visiting her at college, until today.

I had moved out of town when I hit 18 and hadn't much visited, so you never saw me and rarely heard stories of me. You always like to pretend I was a little sibling, as you had none of your own, and were sad at my disappearance.

You happened to travel to New York for a Friday meeting, and decided to spend the weekend and explore the city. You're friends recommend a bar in Brooklyn so you head there with your hottest dress and those heels you've been waiting to wear for what seems like months now.

That's where you see me at the other side of the wooden bar. In the dark smoke you can make out your personally adopted little brother, in a tailored suit and more handsome than you remember him being. His hair is wavy and dirty blonde, and he has that five o'clock shadow. His hazel eyes are the same as they were as a kid though, and they draw you to him.

I see somebody approaching out of the corner of my eye and turn towards you. ""Holy shit, you're the last person I expected to see here."" I say, looking you up and down.

**Work place, domination**

Every fucking day these interns come in late and basically do shit for whatever strange-hour shift they've scheduled. I've only recently graduated college and started my career, so of course I'm the one who has to manage these interns only two or three years younger than me.

None of them are here because of their skill. It's K St in DC - their parents have some level of wealth and power and were able to get their trust-fund babies into a resume-building internship.

I've had enough of baby sitting, so I call you in, prepared to fire you. I don't care what kind of backlash there is from the top; I can't stand another second of your laziness.

That's when I see you walk in in a tight, short pencil skirt, a half open blouse, and heels that shouldn't ever be appropriate at the work place. My eyes climb your stockings, past your curvy hips and busting out tits, and land on your eyes attempting to seduce me. You have got to be fucking kidding me. This little whore thinks she can win me over with a slutty outfit?

I stand up and close the door behind you, locking it. You look at me, opening your mouth to start working your magic - but that idea stops fast once I slap your face and have you bent over my desk, pushing your head against the wood.

So let me know what you think of these three, and if you'd want to play any of them. If you wanna talk about it first that's great, or you can hop right into it.

This might be a little intense for the morning, but I'm hoping it lasts a bit! Detailed and responsive writers get bonus points!"

I am a 22 year-old university student studying accounting at an average-ranked university in Canada. After a bachelor’s degree, most accounting graduates strive for a designation called the CPA. To get into the CPA school, applicants must get a global GPA of 3 (though the average GPA of selected candidates is a 3.4),  and they must get at least B- in many courses throughout their degrees, which includes very difficult classes. 

So far, I am halfway done in my program. My GPA is a 3.04, but I did not get a B- in  a few of   the required . In addition, I do have a failure on my transcript, and might get a second one after my exam on Monday. 
I am currently enrolled in a summer class. The class is about Canadian taxes, and it is required for me to get a B-. I did do this class in the Winter term, but I dropped it halfway through the semester because I had developed bad anxiety and it was to much for me to bare. I am heading into this exam with a 53% average and the final exam is worth 55%;  I’m really not prepared. 

To make matters worse, classes are only going to be harder and my GPA is going to go down drastically. I am really worried about my future and I’m depressed these days. I don’t have much job experience, my parents  pay for my tuition and they don’t know about my bad grades, and I feel really bad that they are wasting money for me. Furthermore, although my dad is in one of these highest tax brackets (my mom doesn’t work), he often complains about money nowadays. He recently  borrowed $6,000 from my sister who works as a part-time teller. My parents often pressure me to do an internship but given my very little job experience and a few bad grades in accounting classes, I doubt anybody will take me. 

How do I turn my life around? What can I do to relieve this sadness and hopefully get into a CPA program?

28rioo,3,2014-06-21,the reason why im comfortable with this pain,RandomPullOutGuy,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/28rioo/the_reason_why_im_comfortable_with_this_pain/,"to start off, i'm not sure if this is the right place for this but whatever, i don't have a destination for this letter, so it is kind of hard to send.

At this point i'm a 23 year old college student who is completing his internship, 1 girlfriend ever, broke up with me a year ago as i was a fill-in for her emptiness until she could get home to here next boyfriend.

At this point in my life i am living at my mom's house, 1 semester left of college and no career nailed down. I am fine with being single at this point in my life as i am not sure where i am going to end up, if i knew that i was going to be in my hometown the rest of my life i would talk to those that i am interested in spending life with her in town. I do not feel comfortable getting into a relationship at this point in my life as i do not want to pass up a career opportunity just for someone and i do not want to either drag someone along with me or have to break ties with someone as i have found my career opportunity and they have found something in a different place. 

I see all my friends trying to start the rest of their lives before having a path in their life. I see these people that are currently happy but i have also seen some of my friends who have tried starting the rest of their lives fail, not just in the love they have found but in academic and mental states.

I have had friends try to set me up with people from their lives but after the failure that occurs in the relationship i have lost focus in the primary goals in my life at that time. I have had to fight to stay in college multiple times now because i have invested myself into a relationship with another person that has failed horrendously. 

I have found a way that my self supportive life style will help me in the future. The lonely nights that have led me to sadness will allow me to find what will truly make me happy, not just what will make me comfortable for the time being, ending in pain and unhappiness.

throughout the years i have been people's floormat, being used just so that they could get to their next place in life. I have reached a point where i have decided that it is a good idea to build myself up to a point where i cannot be walked over, not as a wall but a receptive barrier, i will absorb what is thrown at me, and if i deem it worthwhile i can allow it to pass.

For anyone that read this whole thing, hopefully it helps you see into yourself, use what i have said however the hell you want. Good Night! "

28rm25,0,2014-06-21,I [23/m] just started seeing a new girl [22/f] and I'm already miserable.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28rm25/i_23m_just_started_seeing_a_new_girl_22f_and_im/,"I met a girl at the beginning of May, and due to her doing a little traveling, I've only seen her three times since then. The times that I did see her were very nice and I really liked her. The problem is, I cannot stop thinking about her and it's making me absolutely miserable. It's gotten to the point where I wish I had never met her in the first place because I'm always worrying about what's going to happen or if she's losing interest.


She's away this summer for an internship but I said I'd still like to see her every few weeks until she comes back because the city she's in isn't very far away. I keep getting the sense that she isn't all that into it. She takes forever to return my texts. One time she said she would text me to hang out on a Saturday and I never heard from her, but she later sent this huge apology. She seemed hesitant about me visiting her this summer because she claimed she was worried about getting distracted from her work and the logistical timing was bad.


I don't initiate every instance of communication but she usually slows down on responses very quickly.


However, when I actually saw her in person she expressed interest. She was the first to ask where I saw our relationship going (on the third date two weeks ago). She also claims she has little good dating experience (she told me this long story about some dude she sort of saw who was very insecure and controlling that she didn't even like but dated because he wouldn't leave her alone) and she has no idea what to do in a dating. I spoke to her on the phone the other day and asked her straight up if she was actually interested in this and she said yes. She claimed she didn't know what I wanted from her and she was afraid of not giving me what I want. I told her all I wanted was to know she liked me so I wasn't wasting my fucking time. When I said I might be staying near her area next Fall she picked up on that right away and said if that were the case she would like to continue seeing me then too. She also told me she doesn't like the whole ""texting thing"" and wants to be more of a talking person. After I saw her on the third date and after I spoke with her the other day she sent me messages saying how refreshing and nice talking to me was and thanking me for a good time.


So I feel like I'm getting mixed signals and it's really pissing me off. I absolutely cannot stand her texting habits to the point where I don't even want to try to contact her. I can't help but feel like she isn't really into this but for some reason is kind of keeping it going. I think about it constantly and I'm getting so tired of worrying over it that I almost just want it all to be over.


I've spoken to my friends extensively about it and they all tell me to relax because ""it's obvious that she likes you, stop worrying about the stupid text thing."" They don't think I should just doom the relationship quite yet.


So I guess I'm wondering if you have any pointers on how I can make myself care much, much less, or if you think the signs tell me to kill the relationship entirely?


---   
**tl;dr**: Girl is, in my opinion, sending mix signals and it's giving me so much anxiety that I almost want to end the relationship entirely. Other people tell me to relax because she ""clearly likes you"" but I cannot get back to my normal self."
28rmhv,7,2014-06-21,"I (18F, college soph) am spending the whole summer vacation with my mom and where I know no one. I feel lost, lonely and frustrated. MMFB?",mirc_4,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/28rmhv/i_18f_college_soph_am_spending_the_whole_summer/,"This is the fifth time I'm posting in MMFB. Sounds horribly desperate and sad, and hope I'm not bothering anyone.
I'm also warning it may come as shallow, but understand that since middle school it is very hard for me to make friends, but also quite hard for me to stay without.

For this not to be too long, I'll make some points :

- 18F, college freshman soon to be sophomore this fall
- This summer, I was supposed to go back home and spend the whole month of June in my hometown and have great times with high school friends then follow my mom to Africa where she'll start her own business and I'll do my mandatory internship
- But sh*t happened: a new opportunity rose for my mom, and to accept it she had to leave my hometown in June 10th
- To save money, she decided to bring me, so I was in Africa sooner than expected, couldn't see my high school friends.

- I am currently in Africa, staying at my aunts, with my two cousins who are still in middle/high school, both are very popular folks, go out every night with their crew of male friends. They're both school jocks.
- Both are leaving Africa in one week anyway: one is going to Australia with his friends, the other one is going to Europe with his friends
- They don't give a single f*** about me, and don't invite me to their outings/parties. I understand them, I don't know anyone from their social group anyway...
- So there's me staying alone, with no friends my age and nothing to do at home except drawing, sleeping late, reading.

- When I try to talk with mom about the situation, she calls me selfish and doesn't try to discuss about it. She tends not to discuss about problems and ignore them, I hate that.

- I also forgot to mention that several friends invited me to do stuff over the summer (anime convention in July with high school bff, trip to Middle East with college bffs in mid-July) but my parents cancelled everything, justifying lack of money, and that it would be to hard to organise with the mandatory internship. I call BS, but I can't discuss with them.

- Meanwhile, I get to see all my college friends on fb doing road trips, awesome trips with friends...

- I am writing this out of anger after mom forcely brought me to a dinner with only adults (of 50 years old...) I almost cried of frustration.

- Aaaaand **icing on the cake**: my mum heard me cry in my sleep the other night, so she came to my room. When she poked/held me, apparently, I said in my sleep ""Stop mom. I'm trying to make friends there. I have to make friends by myself."" Loner much. :(

I feel like at 18, I shouldn't be with my mom until September and not having fun. I know it's terribly selfish, and that it's justified (kind of) but I already  have a hard time feeling mature, grown up, and this situation is not helping. I compare myself to others and see they're having great time with their friends, like real teenagers/grown ups. I just feel like a kid, I feel lonely, because I won't do anything for the rest of vacation. I feel my vacation and my youth days are being wasted. My internship won't even be interesting. 

I may come across as terribly shallow and rude and ungrateful, but that's how I feel it. Maybe my views about teenage years are wrong as well, but...seeing others and comparing my situation to their awesome vacation as real teenagers, I can't help but feel like it.

28rom1,1,2014-06-21,I think I am lot more insecure than I thought I was...,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/28rom1/i_think_i_am_lot_more_insecure_than_i_thought_i/,"So, I am 18 years old. I have always been told that I look like I am in my mid twenties, but I do not think that is relevant. 

I am in the midst of an internship for a company that my Uncle founded and is the CEO of. He hired a good and also very successful man to work with him. This guy has been friends with my Aunt and Uncle for a long time (I believe over a decade or so) and he is gay. He is somewhere in his 40s, and very handsome. He kind of has that hot-straight-dad vibe to him, only he is gay. 

I was interviewed by this man in early April, and he and this one other guy (who I now know is gay, late 20s) were in the room during the interview. I was REALLY turned on by him (older guy). They both left the company before my internship started. This guy is still really good friends with my Aunt and Uncle, but he is just not working with them anymore.

Long story short, I saw this older the other day, just to catch up with him. I was alone with him in his house (where he lives with his partner of 7 years, they are not always monogamous), and I ended throwing pretty much every combination of words at him that I could think of that would give him the impression that I was emotionally and physically prepared for a casual thing with him. In the midst of that conversation, I asked him about the other guy in the interview room (gay guy in his late 20s). I asked if he thought he was attractive (he personally is not my type). He said that, yes, he thought he was attractive (the extent of which is unclear). I ended up playing around with this older guy, having the time of my life, and I will probably see him again sometime next week. When he shut the bedroom door behind him that day he said ""You cannot tell anyone about this,"" and that really turned me on. As I was playing around with him, I told him that all I was thinking about during our interview in early April was playing around with him, I asked if he felt the same way. His response confuses me probably more than it should. He basically leaned his head back a little, reflecting on his thoughts, and said ""Well, yeah.."" slowly. But he left me feeling like there was something that he did not say at that moment... 

But the thing is, I feel like shit now. I am very insecure. Now, all I think of is the idea that the older guy would have rather been playing around with the other gay guy in his late 20s. What I did with that older guy was wrong (in a hot way), and if he played around with the gay guy in his late 20s it would probably also be a little wrong, but to a much lesser extent. 

There are many more little factors of the story that I could spend all night writing about. If you have any questions regarding more details, I'm more than happy to provide more context. The other gay guy that was in the interview room that is in his late 20s is hairless, white, and in average shape (not fat, not buff). I'm pretty much the same, only hairier, and probably a little more muscular.

I really am just looking for your thoughts. Sorry, no TL;DR here, as it kind of feels like what I just wrote up above was the TL;DR.

28rq1c,5,2014-06-21,"First interview this week. ""No coding/trivia""... Be prepared to talk about past projects.""",nappyheadedimus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28rq1c/first_interview_this_week_no_codingtrivia_be/,"Hi, there. First of all, I've read through the FAQ. I'll be studying the Wikipedia pages of all of the suggested Data Structures/Algorithms topics. I just wanted to get some opinions on what the interview might have meant when he said that the interview ""will not intentionally include any coding or technical trivia"". 

He said I should be ready to discuss any of my academic/independent coding projects (Platform, Architecture, Design Patterns, etc). So he was fairly specific. I plan on discussing in-class projects from my two semesters of Computer Science classes as well as assignments from my Data Structures class. As for the independent projects, I haven't done many. I've created a few games (Game of Fifteen, Breakout using the Stanford SPL) but I feel a little underqualified. 

I'm very passionate about computer science. I love learning anything related to it. I have no doubt that this will come across in the interview. But it's gonna be about 35 minutes and I don't see how I can speak for more than 10 minutes at the most about my past coding projects. Am I too worried? It'll be a phone interview and he'll be sharing his desktop. The position is a Software Engineering Internship. I've never interviewed before so I have very little idea what to expect.

Any advice? Recommendations on what I should focus on? I've only written programs in C/C++ but I've DABBLED wit CSS, PHP, HTML and Javascript plus SQL.

Thanks for any advice. Truly, thanks :)"

28rvv5,5,2014-06-22,"BBEG-to-Be, Meet the Psionic Shotgun",LordOfTheSquid,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/28rvv5/bbegtobe_meet_the_psionic_shotgun/,"[Previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/288tk7/assassins_and_astral_constructs/)

This week's session opened with the three of us standing in the center of a circular chamber in an ancient tomb, with four hallways going in each of the cardinal directions. At a bit of a loss for what to do, we decided we may as well start by investigating the north passage. With the Beguiler in front checking for traps, we made our way down the corridor until we came across a large, frigid storage room. Even the Cleric's aura of heat had no effect upon the magical chill, but perhaps that was for the best; had she thawed the numerous corpses lying on the shelves in there, we would likely have to start making fortitude saves agianst the stench of death. We slowly wandered through the vast room, taking in the macabre sight of rows upon roves of corpse shelves, stacked three high throughout. Towards the back of the chamber, we discovered the skeleton of a wyvern, lying lifeless in the cold. It was at that point we decided to try some of the other corridors coming off of the main room, not wanting to see what other foul corpses lay in that gelid crypt.

At this point, we decided to try our luck with the southern passage. Where the walls of the northern one had been decorated with carvings and frescoes of war and blood, this one's walls were covered with scenes of peace and plenty. A casting of Detect Magic from the Beguiler revealed a strong aura of Evocation partway down the hallway. He decided to sneak down the hall, stopping some fifteen feet before the top of a stairway which descended into the darkness below. Unfortunately, he'd misjudged the distance to the trap, and was treated to yet another sheet of lightning. “You do have trapfinding as class feature, you know,” I quipped, “you don't have to take care of traps by triggering them all yourself.” A quick Search check later, and the Beguiler found a small hole in the wall with some gears on the other side. Rather than stick his hand in to try and manually disable it, he just stuck a crossbow bolt in the gears to jam the trap, and tried crossing through the threatened zone again. The bolt snapped as the cogs turned, with a second arcing wall of electricity snapped across the corridor, but the semiliteral wrench in the gears succeeded in slowing the trap's response enough to allow safe passage. The Cleric followed suit, tossing one of her crossbow bolts into the same hole, and making it through the trapped region just in time. Considering how the last trap hadn't been set off by my artificial construction, I briefly toyed with the idea of just walking through unharmed. I chose to play it safe however, and payed the same ammunition tax to get through. No lighting rained down anyways, as I'd half suspected, but alarms started sounding as soon as I'd crossed. Oops.

Looking back down the corridor, we saw the circular room spinning wildly, finally settling down with the four entranceways shuffled. Coming from that chamber we heard the sound of numerous heavy footsteps, so we decided it was time we tried hoofing it as well. We started down the steep stairs, trying our best to avoid tumbling to our doom as we fled the unseend pursuers. Taking a breather some three or four minutes later, we looked back up to the top of the stairs where we saw four armored figures locked in formation. I quickly manifested Psionic Minor Creation, creating a patch of grease to catch any unwary pursuit, and we carried on our way down.

After what seemed like ages, we finally arrived at the bottom of the stairs. A corridor stretched some 120 feet ahead of us, and we could hear two voices coming from somewhere around the corner at the end of the passage. Moving cautiously, the Beguiler found a pitfall trap which would have dropped us some sixty feet onto two dozen poisoned spikes. This bit of information gave me an idea, so I called for us to stop for a while. I carefully ripped up my scholarly robes, creating a piece of fabric about as large as the hole over the pit. I let it drift down the shaft, gently settling over the spikes at the bottom. Calling upon my psionic power, I hopped the spikes themselves 30 seconds into the future, leaving the poison layer and the torn robes sitting where they were. Now with only empty space beneath it, the fabric fell, absorbing the residual poison that was also left behind. Manifesting Telekinetic Thrust, I yanked the poison-soaked rags back up to the top of the shaft, where I carefully stowed them in my bag.

The Cleric, upon seeing what I'd done, decided she'd try and see what she could do along the same vein. After looking through her list of prepared spells, she confirmed with the DM that the spikes themselves were wicked pieces of metal, set firm in stone. When I realized what she was planning, I broke down into uncontrollable laughter. One casting of Stone Shape later, and some two dozen spikes were out of the trap and into our posession. The DM, impressed by our ingenuity, decided to give us all double XP for that particular piece of creative problem-solving.

As we continued down the corridor, the voices grew louder, until we could resolve that one of them was in fact the Necromancer we'd abandoned in the prison during our first session. A quick peek around the corner revealed that the other appeared to be some sort of apprentice or intern who was taking notes on a piece of parchment. Knowing that we couldn't let the Necromancer escape again, we worked out a battle plan for taking him down. As we got into position, I took the liberty of recoating the spikes with the poison that I'd harvested from them, as well as a few drops of various venoms we'd found among the dead Assassin's gear. With a toxic brew of three different poisons on each spike, I was ready for action.

Surprise round. The Cleric rushed into the room and cast Doom, which the Necromancer easily negated with a successful save. Next, the Beguiler, disguised as the Necromancer himself in the robes we'd stolen, cast Power Word: Pain, setting up a simple DOT effect. On my turn, I charged in and proceeded to launch a volley of six thrice-poisoned spikes at the Necromancer. Unfortunately, all but one of them were deflected by his Mage Armor spell, and he passed two of the saves against poison on the one that did hit. Luckily, he failed the save for a strength-damaging toxin, and he keeled over under his own weight.

Round 1. Our squishy, squishy party was instead crispy for once, as a massive fireball rained down from the ceiling. I was the only one to make the reflex save, merely being dropped to half health. The Cleric was down to about four hit points, and the Beguiler was unconscious at negative five HP. Fortunately, the cleric brought him back up to being barely alive, so that he could knock out the Apprentice with a well-placed spell. It was now my turn. Surveying the situation, I judged that we would almost certainly all die if the Necromancer managed to set off another fireball like the last one, even if I managed to heal myself during the current round. My two direct-damage powers, Energy Ray and Crystal Shard, would almost certainly lack the firepower to bring down the Necromancer for good. I drew another poisoned spike from my haversack and launched it towards the Necromancer, along with the five that had missed their mark on the first time through.This time, all but one managed to hit, turning the Necromancer into a pincushion. As he slumped over, defeated, we knew we'd seen the last of him.

The Cleric, not missing a beat, quickly ran over to the prone pincushion and poured Black Sand from her flask onto him, turning his body into a somewhat larger mound of ebon grains. After we'd patched ourselves up, we realized that we needed to do something about the Apprentice. Fortunately, the Beguiler was still wearing the Necromancer's face and robes. When the apprentice came to, our Beguiler managed to convince the youth that he was, in fact, the real Necromancer, while the one which we'd so unceremoniously slain was the imposter. Thanks to the Beguilers amazing Bluff checks, the Apprentice believed him without question. Spinning a tale of how the secret tomb and lab had been breached, we convinced him to grab the Necromancer's spellbook and research notes, before rigging the self-destruct sequence to eliminate the vast collection of corpses and undead production facilities. Making our way to the top of the stairs, we came across four figures we'd completely forgotten about: a group of warforged mercenaries, barring the way with greathammers and adamantine armor.

We panicked at first, especially when they did not obey the disguised Beguiler. A quick Knowledge: History check revealed the correct command, “stand down” to make them obey. With our new bodyguards, we made our way to the Necromancer's library, where we snatched platinum bars form the vault and trashy romance novels from the shelves (the Necromancer apparently had some odd tastes). Once the Apprentice had returned, we made our way out of the tomb and back towards the city, convincing the young lackey to find an inn for the night while we took care of business back at the Mages' College.

Despite the fact that we'd disturbed her in the middle of the night, the Wizard was happy to see that we'd successfully found the research notes and destroyed the undead laboratory. She even offered us a potential position at the university and set us up with a private vault in the College, where we stashed our ill-gotten loot. Casual conversation with her about the warforged mercenaries we'd found revealed that she was somewhat of a warforged fangirl, and it turns out that my character being a 64-year-old psiforged was kind of a big deal (in this campaign setting, all warforged produced during a ten-year war some sixty years ago were nearlly all destroyed, and that there are apparently only a dozen or so warforged left that survived the genocide/recycling). After deflecting her questions about warforged history (in part due to my out-of-character uncertainty of warforged lore in this campaign), we managed to finally get some rest after a long day of tomb raiding.

The next morning, we met back up with the Apprentice in a public square, where the Beguiler convinced him that the youth needed to return to the College for his magical education, ridding ourselves of a potential liability. The Wizard met back up with us too, and shared what she had gleaned from the Necromancer's research notes. It turns out that he was on the payroll of someone named Zaxus, and that he had spent millions on aquiring bodies, both living and dead. Our curiosity piqued, we knew that we had a new lead.

So I'm a third year CS student in India. I've been meaning to apply for an internship for a while, now, but there have been a few hitches with the whole thing.

My university gives me around 2 - 3 weeks of leave, twice a year, nowhere near enough to commit to the average internship. Unfortunately, because of mandatory attendance rules, I can't work on one during the year either.

What other options do I have? I've got a couple of small personal projects; designed a few websites and apps (though that isn't remotely in line with what I want to do). Should I work on open-source? Hunt for people who want stuff made? More personal projects?

Worst case scenario - take a year off? If I'm doing that, I'd like to find internships abroad, too - how plausible is that? I'm assuming it'd be harder for people from developing countries.

I'd appreciate any advice. Cheers. :)"

Like many, I moved back home to my parents after graduating University two years ago. I have had an unpaid internship and a few odd jobs since then but nothing solid.

My parents have been struggling financially recently and I get really anxious about their situation. I feel even more guilty that my parents let me live at home rent free. (I try to do housework to make up for it (but I'm pretty lousy at it!)).

However I have found several short term (6-12 month) job opportunity's in my field of work that are abroad. This would be an awesome (if not sometimes nervewracking) 'life experience' and it would also be a very valuable mark on my C.V... 
but I am too anxious to follow through and apply; in part because it would be like jumping into the deep end but also because I feel like I would be abandoning my parents who I have always tried to please (they don't agree with me working or travelling abroad much).

At the age of 24 I should be 'flying the nest' and having a life of my own so to speak. I know this probably pales in comparison with what many of you may have to deal with but I want grow up and move on with my life and not live like a 24 year old teenager."

a short introduction: I'm in my 6th semester of university studying Computer Science for a bachelor's degree. At the beginning of this semester, I started an internship in my department which prepared me for my bachelor thesis which I was to write in the same department with the same supervisor. We got along really well in the beginning, everything was fine so far. But the internship took much longer than I planned or expected, and to be honest that didn't do well on my general motivation. Anyway, additional to that there are some differences of opinion between her and me and also between the coordinator of the department and me. I feel that I don't get along with them anymore and that writing my bachelor thesis there would become a pain in the ass.

Now I'm not sure what to do, because if I step away now I probably won't be able to finish my bachelor's degree this semester and therefore would have to add another semester before starting my master's degree. On the other hand, it would be stupid to just go on like this. I do like my topic, but it is a very theoretical topic and I kind of think that a practical topic like a software implementation would suit me better.

What do you think? I know that this is my decision in the end, but I'd like to see some other opinions on that.

Thanks in advance! "

28sqgo,21,2014-06-22,How Xeffect will benefit you even if you did not fill out every boxes from personal experience,techrat_reddit,theXeffect,https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/comments/28sqgo/how_xeffect_will_benefit_you_even_if_you_did_not/,"I write this post to encourage those who do not have a perfect card. I see many posts in this subreddit that mentions how having an incomplete card makes them want to give up or start a new one. In the following post, I give reasons why you should not give up and stick to the card:

1. whenever you mark X in a box, you benefit immediately or very shortly. For example, by sleeping before 11, I experienced a significant boost in energy the following day whether the card was perfect or not. During that refreshed day, I studied harder which led to a concrete improvement in grade. 

2. Missing boxes allows you to see patterns of how you spend your time. For example, after a month, I noticed that my boxes for Fridays to sleep before eleven were always empty. I realized that I have a club meeting on each Friday that leads to late-night partying. This gave me an opportunity to properly assess the effects of late-night partying and sleeping early in a logical fashion.

3. The card will serve you as a reminder. Say you have been swept up by the busy schedule and forgot about your habits for a while. By seeing a physical card lying around somewhere where you frequently can see, you will be reminded and can resume the process. I recently got an internship that required me to be occupied the whole day and forgot about the meditation-10-minutes-a-day habit. Just yesterday, I saw the card and remembered I have a goal. Now, during internship, whenever I find time, I meditate. This relates to the point #1: the moment I meditate, I feel calm and clean-headed, so the benefits show instantly regardless of whether you did the habit yesterday or not.

By giving up or even restarting a card will forfeit you of many benefits that Xeffect can provide you. My cards are far from perfect, yet I stick to my cards because for the above reasons. For me, it is not the result of having a perfect card that matters, but the process of striving to mark X in an empty box everyday that matters. Don't give up. Carry on."

You can read about some of her insane positions [here](http://www.heathermizeur.com/), but two that I thought were particularly bad were her positions on guns and taxes, and so I emailed her to voice a few of my grievances with her, and this is the response I got:

&gt;Dear Brent,

&gt;I think if you knew some more about our policy, you would be more inclined to support Heather.

&gt;As someone that grew up in Missouri, I've been shooting guns pretty much my entire life on our farmland and so I understand the importance of the Second Amendment. Our plans for gun control do not hinder your right to own a firearm, they are simply put in place to reduce the amount of gun violence. **We plan to raise the legal age for buying ANY firearm, not just pistols, to 25 years of age** and also to implement universal background checks. Personally, I don't mind going through a few extra steps just to make sure someone with a violent history doesn't ever get their hands on a weapon. Additionally, we would work to remove all firearms from any scene of domestic violence as well as out of the reach of anyone with mental instability. Lastly we want to improve gun buyback programs in Maryland to recycle older guns back, rather than let them slip into the hands of a criminal.

&gt;Our plans for taxes are also something you might agree with more than you'd think. We aim to reinstate the millionaires tax in order to give tax breaks to 90% of Marylanders, having the wealthy pay their fair share. **We also understand that our platform for raising minimum wage to $16.70 an hour by 2022 is going to be harder on small business than any large corporations.** To compensate for this we have decided to remove a corporate tax loophole that has been allowing big businesses to avoid paying taxes in Maryland. We will use the revenue generated from removing that loophole to give tax cuts to small businesses in order to help them manage the increasing minimum wage.

&gt;I hope this information has helped you to see where we are coming from. Heather's goal is to create a transparent government that is run by the voice of the people, not the deep pockets of the establishment in Annapolis.

&gt;Take care,

Okay my favorite community, the time has come that I ask for all your opinions, experiences, and thoughts. 

First, a little background information, I've been hooked for nearly three years. I didn't start off with hydros and bullshit like that, went from roxis, to dope, to dilaudid, the occasional fent, OPs, opana, etc. But really, I just love the fuck out of my dope. During those three years, I have had MAYBE two months worth of days clean all together. I've gone to detox, came out worse than when I went in. I've tried the sub doc, stopped after a week because I wanted to continue to get high. I've tried cutting back, to no avail. I've tried cold turkey, and wanted to kill myself. I've tried alot of things basically, none of which worked. 

Before I started doing opiates, I was doing well in college. Drinking and smoking pot all the time, but never affected my school work. Deans list, was supposed to graduate early, extremely good internship for my dad's company that paid super well. Opiates destroyed all that. I got into opiates with my boyfriend, who I've been on again off again with for the past 4 years. We've put each other through hell, we've fueled each others addictions and made them worse, we've enabled each other, all the things couples in addictive, destructive relationships do. But, despite anything and everything, he's my forever boy. There's some people that just know when they've met that person that they'll be with for the rest of their lives. At 22, I know I've found my person. Nothing will change my mind about that. He is the only person that I can always count on, that will (almost) always put me even before himself, and who loves me unconditionally despite all my fuck ups and all the fights we've had. 

Now, to the hard shit. These drugs are destroying my life. Dope has taken everything from me. I have no relationship with anyone in my family, all my friends have abandoned me until I can 'get my shit together' (understandably), I can't get a new job with my dirty piss and because of how unstable I am. I'm living from high to high, doing my best to escape the sickness of withdrawals. I'm tired, I'm beaten down, I'm ashamed of myself and what I've become, I'm lonely, and I'm afraid. But at the same time, I fucking love heroin. I love making life's bullshit fade away as soon as the plunger goes down. The final verdict though is I'm at a point that I'm either going to end up in jail, an institution, or dead. Simple as that. I no longer trust myself to have control over my own life or to make rational decisions for myself. 

So that's where you guys come in. I have a lot of choices on what I can do to stop this shit and get out while I hopefully still can. I would love to hear everyone's personal experiences with each option I have and how successful the choices made were. I'm also going to include my experiences with each, so maybe you guys can help me decide what the best option for me is. So here we go. 

1) Cold turkey: I don't really think I have to even say this, but fuck cold turkey. I always tell myself that if I go through the suffering of cold turkey, I'm less likely to relapse because of the hell that cold turkey entails. This typically isn't the case. I usually last a week or two, max, then I'm right back where I started off. 

2) inpatient detox program: I recently completed such a program, and it was hell on earth. I don't really even consider myself clean during my stay, because I was so fucked up on so many meds along 24mgs of subutex a day and my prescribed klonopin. I met a very bad character in rehab, who I then became 'friends' with outside of the center when we were released on the same day. He introduced me to dilaudid, gave me multiple k8s a day (which I had never tried previously, trust me when I say I fell in love). He also introduced me to some fantastic cocaine, which I became slightly hooked on for a few weeks as well. Speedballs and all that good stuff. I was so much worse off for the three weeks after I got out than I had ever been before. I am very, very lucky to be alive. This leads me to be wary towards short-term detox programs. 

3) suboxone maintenance: I got on suboxone shortly after my horrible few weeks after detox. My parents footed the bill (as they have with everything recovery wise, all they want in the world is for their daughter to get better and money isn't an issue for them). I lasted about a week, someone stole my entire script, and I went back to dope. Now, if I go with this option, it won't be through a doctor. My boyfriend is getting on suboxone tomorrow, and because the things are always way over prescribed, he will be dosing me with some of the extras he gets. 

4) naltrexone: yes, the pill that prevents you from being high. I don't know much about it and I'm very curious to hear others experiences with it. 

5) vivitrol shot: the goddamn vivitrol shot. I've sworn so many times I would NEVER get the vivitrol shot. But things are getting bad enough that it's a possibility. I just want to hear others problems/experience with it. 

6) long term treatment: and finally, my last option, long term treatment. I'm 99% against it. I'm not cool with leaving the town I've lived in my entire life to somewhere that I know no one. My parents want me to go to a place called Marr in Atlanta. There's a very slim chance that's gonna happen. 

So, those are my options. Please give me feedback on the methods you've tried/recommendations. I appreciate it greatly!

28tnc7,12,2014-06-22,Concerns on targeting the game industry as a junior developer,Delicious_Cookies,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/28tnc7/concerns_on_targeting_the_game_industry_as_a/,"I'm looking for career advice and want to prod some out of the programmers here who are currently or previously have worked in the game industry. I have concerns about whether or not I want to follow my passion and pursue a career there or focus on the broader areas of software development. I'm hoping the questions at the end of this can be answered in a way to provide assistance to any of the junior developers considering a full-time career within the game industry, and if you don't want to read a shitty personal background please skip to the end of the post.

I'm currently a junior going into my senior year of college seeking a CS degree and I've been trying to find that niche/industry of programming that I really have a passion for by looking into open source projects I could contribute to. I'm spending the summer mainly adding to my programming portfolio so I'm not going to be turned away for internships and jobs because of lack of demonstrable experience. I've spent a lot of time using Java (school + freelancing) and writing applets using the core lang, but now I'm at a cross-roads for figuring out where I want my career to actually go and what industry of programming I want to specialize in. 
On one hand, I'm intimidated by all of the crazy requirements I see on job postings for junior developers and internships (1-3 years of work experience with the language, knowledge of a language specific framework, Agile/SCRUM/other software dev practices, experience with VCS in a big project, etc.) so if I were to continue on the Java track I'd be looking for sub-sets to dive into there, most likely by contributing to some open source project but I've yet to find one which interests me heavily. The fields using Java are so diverse that I'm not sure what they are or where I'd want to go, but most job postings I've scoured are enterprise focused so going through the Java EE tutorials would be my short term goal.

On the other hand, I want to jump into C++ for the first time in 4 years (it was my first programming language which I started learning in HS) and begin to learn UE4, and try contributing to the latest UT game using my newly acquired knowledge. This is a huge undertaking but one I feel I'd be willing to put in the time to make worthwhile, and it's an industry which I know I'd enjoy working in and using a language/technology I so far enjoy working in more than Java (currently powering through Accelerated C++ with ease). This has the additional advantage of making me ahead of the curve with UE4, and given UE's track record for industry adoption I think it's a safe technology to bet on. I also have a heavy passion for games and Unreal holds an even greater place in my heart. I grew up with UT2k4 as my first PC game and I spent a lot of time with UnrealED making levels for the servers I played on in middle school. It also led me to looking for a job in game development, and I settled on becoming a programmer but have until now have been focused on software development in general rather than a specific industry like gaming. Having even a small portion of my code contributed to the codebase would be a dream come true.

My main worry with this plan of action is that my area isn't a popular place for any kind of game development, and I'm not sure how the experience I gain over the summer and throughout the school year will appeal these enterprise-focused companies looking for software development interns/junior devs which are close by. I can't exactly move to a better area for the game industry until I've made enough money to trek out there and survive for awhile.

Even if there's no game development industry in the area though, there's a possibility that some of the companies will ask for C++ or be more inclined to hire someone with experience in two primarily OOP technologies (I also have Perl under my belt for scripting), so the knowledge shouldn't be all for naught. Either decision will arm me with experience being a part of a team and working on a large project, which I think is the most needed thing to add to my portfolio at this point.

I'm also cautious of the game industry itself, as I've heard a number of stories about the difficulties of breaking into it as a junior developer.

Questions:
How did you come to choose the game development industry as a programmer?, was it your industry of choice or did you leave another to pursue it? 
How well has your experience in the game industry allowed you to find employment in other areas/industries of software development?
If you had the patience to read through the whole post, am I making some sort of mistake by allowing passion to guide me to game development?

Any comments would be appreciated."

Thanks for all of your advice again, after I saw B  in the hospital, as I said in my first post she disappeared for what felt like hours and hours. By the time I had pestered a nurse enough to actually listen to me she assured me that someone would be in soon to hear me out. She explained that I had been found unconscious by the side of a road in the early hours and been taken straight to hospital for rehydration and some treatment of minor flesh wounds.  


‘Is my w…wii…wife here?’ I stuttered, holding the nurse’s arm to stop her exiting. 

‘Yes’ she smiled brightly. My face immediately fell. It wasn’t just some sick drug-induced fantasy, she had tracked me down to this hospital. I felt itchy all over, wondering if she had implanted any more chips.


‘Please help me’ I begged quietly, tears filling my eyes. 


‘Just try and calm down’ she explained in a reassuring tone, patting my arm.


‘Everything is going to be fine, you just need to stay calm’ She explained. 


I noticed her picking up my chart and scrawl ‘Wife confirms untreated psychosis. Pt still in episode and delusional’. She replaced the chart and left before I had a chance to construct a word.


 I needed to get out of this hospital bed. I went to sit up but this only caused a massive head rush. I immediately laid down flat again and swallowed vomit. I tried to move my legs but felt nothing but searing pain in the right one, which had previously held the microchip. I clutched the bedsheets, scrunching my hands into tight fists. I didn’t have the strength to stand up.


Before I had any chance to dwell on this another nurse had entered my room. An attractive young blonde, donned with rubber gloves and a plastic apron, with a kind smile. This was the first thing that had put a slight smile on my face in the last 48 hours. I know, you’d have thought I would have learnt my lesson but, clearly not. 


‘Sir, your wife has explained the situation to us and we’ve finally got round to identifying you’ 


‘Nurse’ I said, quickly.


 ‘My wife, my wife she’s abusing me’ I said, quietly. 


 She looked at me empathetically and nodded understandingly. I breathed out a deep sigh of relief, finally, everything was going to be okay.


 ‘We all understand here, don’t worry’ she reassured 


‘Now, I need to give you some medicine so I’m going to insert a little needle into your hand’ 


She unwrapped the IV and inserted it, almost painlessly, into my hand. She then turned to the trolley and drew liquid from a small vial using an injection. 


‘What medicine’ I enquired, confused. 


Her face showed slight annoyance at my query. ‘Just relax and hold still and let me administer it sir’  


Maybe the events of the last couple of days had stripped me of trust for any person or maybe I was just finally coming to my senses but I drew my hand back and started to struggle out of my bed. This wasn’t right.


‘Stop that, right now’ she hissed at a low volume, pinning my head down with surprising force and aggression. I started to yell for help to no avail, it was too late I felt the warm spurt of foreign liquid course into my veins.  


And then black.


 I woke up and it felt like my eyelids had been sewn shut, there were so heavy. And my mouth and throat felt like they were made out of cotton. With great difficulty I managed to prise them open with all the muscular force that my weary face had remaining. The room was dimly lit, I could make out nothing in my environment more than a foot or so away. I looked down to my arms and legs. I was naked. I was tied to a chair. There was also a thick wad of fabric stuffed into my mouth. I silently screamed. Suddenly, the room was flooded with light. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Many familiar faces were in the room, arranged in a circle, set in the same position as I. Clotheless and tied up. 


 My 8 fuck buddies of the past and present. 


And me. 


Fuck, and B.


I could hear the dull, terrified moaning of the girls ring through the air as B approached me, a cruel smirk on her face and her arms behind her back. 


‘Hello’ she laughed. 


I could feel the pounding of my heart in my ears.


 ‘Did my good friend get you off for a nice sleep then?’ she enquired, mockingly meeting my gaze at eye level. Uncontrollably, tears were streaming down my cheeks.  She walked over to the first girl on my right. It was Anne, I remembered her well as she was my first affair, about four years ago now. Sweet brown ringlets framed her elvish face. She was an intern, she’d first sucked my dick for the opportunity to shadow me and the guarantee of a good reference.  


‘Anne’ B said, tracing the outline of Anne’s quivering lips with a look of fake empathy on her face. ‘The 21st of July 2010, it went on for two months’ she explained.


B ran her finger down her naked chest, between her small pert breasts and down the firm contour of her abdomen. Out of nowhere a flash of silver over her neck and Anne slumped over, limp. Blood was gushing out of her neck and formed a bloody apron over her torso. I grunted deeply in shock, cutting my lip open with my teeth.


 ‘The game has begun’ B grinned, dabbing at Anne’s throat with her index finger and tasting the blood.  


And the game continued, the same practice of identification and murder was the fate of the next girl, and the next girl, and the next. You get the idea. Some I barely remembered the faces of but at least had some brief recollection of their body. I tried my best to keep my eyes closed after the third, Beth-the girl who served me coffee and I had fucked in my car in 2011, had been killed.  B kept demanding I keep my eyes open, even going to the lengths of physically opening them and threatening me with the blade. 


Finally the last girl, who I was still currently, seeing was to be met with her fate. Yvonne was sweating, her face was as pale as a sheet, and tears were streaming out of her eyes and although inaudible I could tell she was begging for mercy through her moans past the cloth in her mouth.  


‘Yvonne, ongoing since January 2014…’ B stated, looking Yvonne in the eye, familiarly. 


‘Notable, mostly due to…’ She stopped, I sensed a slight choke in her voice.


 ‘The affair commenced on the night of my latest miscarriage. She was my best friend.’ she continued, robotically. 


 I clenched my teeth, waiting for her throat to be torn open and blood to piss out  but was instead met with the sight of her being gutted. Viciously plunging the knife into her abdomen over and over, B screamed in satisfaction as she did it. Afterwards, she had something in her hand. It wasn’t…Vomit filled my mouth.  It was a foetus.


‘Fitting’ squealed B. 


She threw it on the floor, despite its appearance of a congealed mass of blood I had seen too many miscarriages to mistake it for anything else. B knew before, of course. That’s why she had chosen that method of killing. 


‘Now for you’   


I looked into her eyes as she approached me, I heard the clinking of the blade on the floor as she got closer which gave me some sense of relief amongst the dizzying atmosphere of death, the metallic aroma of blood stinging my nostrils and the taste of bile acid in my mouth. ‘It’ll be over if you make a single sound, or disobey in any way’ she explained, removing the gag. I daren’t make a sound as I surveyed the room, mounds of dead flesh amongst a sea of red. 


She cocked her head a little and stared at me in absolute silence for a good few minutes. 


‘Lick my pussy’ she demanded. 


I had no choice but to comply so as she thrust her sweaty vagina forcefully into my damp, with sweat and tears, and bloody face. I obediently performed fellatio, moans were escaping from her lips as I did so but I drowned them out. There was no way out. My mind was no longer racing. This was it. She was capable of so much, this had become clear. 



She was going to surely kill me after this. 


Until…. I felt her body noticeably relax as she reached orgasm. 


I bit and tore at her clit as hard as I possibly could and simultaneously pushed my head with all my force into her. She fell to the floor screaming in agony, grasping at her genitalia, writhing, screaming. 


 Adrenaline consumed me and, still attached to the chair, I ran for the door. I realised now we were in my basement, I managed to wriggle one arm free by nearly cutting off its circulation and grabbed the blade so I could free my other arm and legs, which I did. I pushed open the window and darted out into the night.


 I’m naked. I don’t know how far I have run but I didn’t stop until I had fallen to the ground and my face had kissed tarmac. I swear I heard the chorus of angels as a gloved hand tapped on my back. 


‘Sir’


  I turned over and was met with two police officers. 


‘My wife did this to me’ I whispered. 


He looked visibly shocked 


‘Let’s get you in the car’ he said, helping me up with the other officer and them both easing me into the car. When we got to the police station they gave me clothes and I had a very long discussion about everything that happened. The police doctor identified another chip just superficial to my gluteal muscles and one near my spine but he had a detector (usually used for fucking animals) that reassured me that there were no other chips present. 


I gave my address obviously but have heard nothing about that side of things and if she was caught and about the bodies of the other girls in the basement. I’m not sure if I want to know. They have promised me that I will be safe though and I’m going into some sort of protection programme. 


Thanks for all your advice guys. 


I’m sorry I cheated on you, B.

I'll be a college senior in the fall. Right now I'm taking a summer class on operating systems, and it has made me realize that I want to get into systems programming. So far I've focused on Android development and desktop applications-I've developed a few small applications for both. The only languages I know are Java, C++, some Python and a tiny bit of AVR assembly. I don't have any internships (sucks, I know). So what can I do in the next year or so to make myself hireable in this area? Specifically I'm really fascinated with compilers and language design. Unfortunately my college doesn't offer any courses on it, since we're extremely small (1400 students). We have to do a senior these though, which I would like to use as a tool for what I'm trying to accomplish here.

Thanks for any help!"

Please, I need outside perspectives!",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28ufm6/i_am_confused_please_i_need_outside_perspectives/,"Look, I'll be honest. I'm 22 and haven't been in a relationship for a while. Like, 4 years... kind of a while. This is why I need your advice. 

Look out. Long text.

Here's the situation:

I have recently met a girl. We're both working as summer interns at some company not worth mentioning, and over these past 2 weeks we've become nicely acquainted.

Now, I don't normally communicate very well. I'm more of a shut-in. (There's a running joke among the other interns that I'm an Old Scrooge that hates everyone.) But, this girl has really taken initiative to get to know me. At first, it was rather uncomfortable; but over time, she really has grown on me. I've found out that I really enjoy her company, her personality, and we share quite a few hobbies and interests. She's pretty awesome.

She and a friend of hers came up to me last week and asked if I had any plans this weekend. I said no, then asked if they had any. They both said they weren't up to snuff, so I insisted we hang out. They were cool with that and we all exchanged numbers.

On Saturday, we met up to watch a movie. All went well. We had the typical movie theater experience and walked out at the end of the credits. The girl I liked decided we should do something else, so I recommended we head to the beach. They thought it was a fun idea.

Now, this is where I get confused...

We made it to the beach at 11:30pm. We built a nice little fire, cracked a couple beers, and began to chill out. We're all sitting around chitchatting and whatnot, and there's, what I think, some flirting going on. It's then I start getting the courage to make a move. *Thanks, alcohol.*

I, lamely, ask her if I may kiss her.

I must have caught her pretty off guard, because she just laughed. Not menacingly, I don't think. Then says, ""Uhhhhhhh. That was really straight straightforward. I don't know.""

It falls quiet for a bit. It stung. But, I ask, ""So, is that a 'no' then?"" And she replies with another laugh and says, ""I don't know.""

At this point, I'm just wishing she'd say no, because I'm flustered a bit. So, I pipe in, ""A maybe, then?"" And she replies, ""Yeah. Maybe later.""

I'm thinking I completely fucked it all up, and I think I got shot down. But, her friend that was with us, later said, ""You weren't shut down, you were just delayed.""

We stayed until sunrise, drove home, and after a quick ""Thanks, it was fun"" we separated and haven't spoken for the rest of today.
I feel uneasy because I really do like this girl. I'm clueless. I don't know if there's still a chance, or if I potentially ruined a friendship with awkwardness.

I'm seeing her tomorrow at work, and I have no idea how I'm to interact...

So, guys, please talk to me. Haha

**tl;dr: Met new girl and have grown fond of her over these past 2 weeks. Tried to make a move and was turned down. Girl I like says, ""Maybe later."" Her friend says I was ""delayed"" not turned down. Need advice on how to take all of this.**"
28ujj1,1,2014-06-23,I'm getting mixed messages and I don't really know how to handle it all.,didier8418,teenrelationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/comments/28ujj1/im_getting_mixed_messages_and_i_dont_really_know/,"Hello everyone!  I'll just go by my first initial, C.

I may as well start from the beginning.  About a week ago I started to really get to know a girl who's been in my class for a year.  We're both 17 headed into senior year next year.  This Monday, I took her out to see a movie, and for the next three days we spent some  occasional time together (she works a lot).

Technically, I took her out while she wasn't single.  She had a boyfriend but he's graduated now and doing nothing with his life, and she really has no feelings for him anymore.  Anyway, she dumped him Wednesday and that night we hung out again afterward.  

Here's the thing.  Ever since that night she and I haven't seen each other at all, really.  Part of it is my fault and part of it hers.  On both Thursday and Saturday night she wanted to chill but I had other things planned already - namely because she takes forever to get done with work and then even when she IS done, doesn't really communicate too much until later on in the day. 

On Friday and today I invited her to watch some World Cup with me. Both times she was busy.  Friday she was just with some friends already - understandable.  Today she suddenly got chores for a few hours when she got back from work.  Definitely seems flaky as hell but, again, shit happens right?

Well, she and I planned to do something tomorrow before she leaves for 5 weeks on an internship.  I don't honestly know if she will flake out or not.  My dilemma is this: she posted a Snapchat story of her with another dude in my class --  shortly after I had asked her if she wanted to hang out and we ultimately decided for Monday.

I'm just... Really confused.  I feel like after the things we've done recently and how passionate she was to be around me, as well as how *I* have felt around her, it just hurts to see that.  Especially when she posts that story and has yet to open the Snapchat I sent her individually like a few hours ago-ish.

To be honest, I'm like, 100% inexperienced with stuff like this.  So when a girl gives me this much attention, my confidence in making moves and just in general is not as high as many of my classmates, including the boy she is with, presumably, right now.  

I figured that since she has just concluded a relationship that I'd wait until a few days had gone by before making my feelings very clear.  Yet at the same time, who takes a guy out to a movie, alone, without having any feelings for them at all?

I fear that maybe I've just approached it all wrong. Maybe I was naive to think that the time we'd spent together was something more.  And maybe all of this is totally inconsequential and she's just always been really good friends with the guy she's with.  After all, I've only really known her WELL for like a week, so I shouldn't expect her to always prioritize me.

I guess I'm concerned that maybe because I'm not used to getting so much attention from girls that I've misinterpreted a few ""dates"" as something more than they really are.  And maybe I'm misinterpreting her outing with this boy and decision to seemingly ignore me, too.  

Ultimately I'm just inexperienced, overwhelmed and paranoid.  Paranoid that maybe something I thought was more than just a friendship never really was.  And the thought of that hurts, but if that's the case, I'm OK with it.

To be honest the past few days have been an emotional rollercoaster that I don't care to ever experience again in my life 😂.  She's made me feel incredible when I'm with her yet awful when I'm not.  And now the time I spent with her feels like years ago even though it was just less than a week ago when this all started.

I'm a dramatic, emotional kid reddit! 😭😂 haha.  I don't know where to go from here.  I kinda just accepted that we probably aren't anything more than friends even though my interpretations of her signals have always led me to believe otherwise.  I really do hope that I see her tomorrow or hear back from her tonight so I can talk to her.  Otherwise, well, it'll be interesting to see how she feels about me when she's been out of town for 5 weeks.  Maybe things will change.

I just.. I'm just mad that we've gone from being so connected, so close, to so damn distant in so little time.

Thanks for listening.  Anyone who read this all through, I really appreciate it a lot.  I'm trying to remember that I'll look back on this in years and regret that I ever got this emotionally invested in a girl, but at the same time, I really want to learn something from this experience, too.  And I think I already have..."
28umxo,5,2014-06-23,Need advice on staying as intern at small company.,error35,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28umxo/need_advice_on_staying_as_intern_at_small_company/,"Hi, this summer I'm doing an internship at a small web development company (6-8 people). I'm a sophomore going into my junior year for CS at a four-year school in southern CA.

It seems that the job requirements are very different from the actual work I'm doing. It also seems like my managers want me to perform at a level I'm not currently at. For example, I will be assigned a task and reprimanded for either not finishing it in time or not going by some inferred requirements. However, I feel justified in the time I take to ensure quality and correctness. I understand that maybe some of the comments I receive can be passed as creative criticism but it really doesn't feel that way. As someone used to having good grades and generally being a good employee at previous companies, I feel like a failure every time I get home from work.

I also feel like since the company is small, there is a level of micromanagement that I'm having trouble adjusting to. I feel like I'm scrutinized for the smallest things, even if it's my first time.

I took the position with pay being at minimum wage because I thought I could gain experience and learn the industry (web development). However, I'm learning very little, and I feel like my daily work is very monotone.

With commute and normal hours, I seldom have time to read, code, or work on hobby projects as I could previously. Overall I don't enjoy any hour I'm at work and I'm extremely mentally fatigued afterwards. I know I'm being biased by nature, so I'd like to hear what others think about my situation and if I'm just being a ""wuss"". I know experience at such a company this early in school is very hard to come by, so if I leave, I feel like I'll be losing out on a big opportunity.

Felt writing here would get me better advice/help on a level deeper than academic worries.

I'm in a bit of a tailspin and don't know how I should proceed next.
I've just finished my first year of a terminal MA program. The year did not go very well for me. I achieved good grades in my courses, and TA'ing panned out fairly well. The individual I moved to this city to research under has unfortunately had to go into early retirement as she combats a serious medical condition. She will not be returning.

There is no one else that could oversee my research, nor do any of the other scholars seem interested in what I do. I talked to the graduate advisor about bringing in another individual to oversee my work in conjunction with someone at my institution, for I have learned that this sometimes the case with PhDs. My advisor is unwilling to make this accommodation.

I have basically spent the last year doing coursework, and I am being encouraged to pursue a course-based MA. I haven't engaged with my research topic in about a year now. I've just been so busy.

I guess I'm feeling really lost because I had ambitions that are now impossible to engage with, and I'm no longer even connected to what my research interests used to be. Things have changed, my focus is now fuzzy, and I have no idea what comes next for the upcoming year.

And to make matters worse, I'm so negative about what happens even if I do get my MA. Like... even if everything was rosy with my research interests, I'm quickly learning just how rough life is going down this road. Here is a quick summary of thoughts:

* I have managed to avoid debt due to funding and help from parents. Part of me is terrified of tackling a PhD program, especially if I go to Europe (my most likely destination), because I'll be a foreign student and tuition can be nuts. Do I really want to accrue debt if the education doesn't provide fruitful opportunities to advance myself economically?

* I am already 30 years old and have a partner. I don't know if I want to put my relationship through the hardships of a PhD program. I also know it is very hard for **any** relationship to survive the terrible demands of year to year or semester to semester contract work before I can establish a full time position somewhere (this doesn't even include tenureship!). My partner also has a career after all. Also, given my age, I don't know if I want to be approaching 40 before I find some modicum of job security.

* I no longer even engage with what used to be my research interests. I really do not have a strong passion for what I'm doing here anymore, and that is a real shame. I really don't know what I want anymore. I can play the victim card by pointing to the rug having been pulled out from under me by my mentor having to retire, but I really would have found some way to make it work if I had the ambition to... which evidence suggests I do not. So am I even cut out for this anymore?

* But I feel trapped and a bit helpless. When doing undergrad work, I spent my summers on fieldschools and picking up more coursework. My CV looks great. But I really have not acquired marketable skills for ""the real world"" outside of academia. A great CV... but a crappy resume... if that makes sense. I didn't do internships or co-op programs because of being away at fieldschools or summer sessions. The jobs I did pick up where always temporary and manual labor because it paid well for a student in the summer. I feel like I have no outs or options if I decide not to continue with academia.

* My self-worth is now at an all time low. I feel like I've made terrible choices that have led me to a point now where even my options are unclear. I feel depressed, disengaged, and now wonder if I'm not just some bum that's managed to coast by because I can BS papers and now my luck is running dry or something. I wallow a lot and have no idea what I do next.

**TL;DR** I just need some help/advice here. I am losing touch with my passion, becoming disillusioned with academia, frustrated with the sacrifices I've made up until now leaving me in a position where I am unable to find fulfillment and opportunity in the future."

Never thought I would say that. A little background first, I've been working at the company for 4 years, 2 years in the IT department as an intern/ part-time as I finished college. The current IT staff is made up of 2 people one that has been here for over 15 years and the other over 7 years. When I started I noticed quite a few things that didn't seem right like a password list for all employees, no documentation, and a lack of organization. Sadly I fell into some of these same patterns for the first year and a half, but now that I have been hired on full time I have resolved to push to get some of these things changed. This is where HIPAA is coming into play because it is giving me quite a bit more support for some of these changes besides just that it is best practice or a risk to the company. After going through HIPAA documents that were referenced here on /r/sysadmin there is a lot more that needs to change and not just in the IT department. 

While I am fairly certain that I will be able to present the information to upper management in a way that they will understand, I am more nervous about upper management deciding that they will take the risk of getting audited or waiting until we get a HIPAA complaint to make certain changes. I am also worried about push back from my co-workers because some of the changes HIPAA requires changes the way they have been working for the last 5+ years. Quick example is that HIPAA requires documentation of policy and procedure in the IT department and I am pushing for even more documentation since we have pretty much nothing right now, but my coworkers are saying that we will need to get approval from upper management to do that because it will take too much time.

I'm looking for advice on dealing with this push back from my coworkers and dealing with upper management not wanting to make the changes that need/should be made.

I can post more detail of what changes I am proposing based on HIPAA and best practices from The Practice of System and Network Administration and what I have read on this subreddit.

There are other issues that I could discuss too but I think that those will be dealt with by upper management. 

I'll try to respond a quick as possible but my desk is in a position where people can easily see my screen so I have to be a bit careful with how much I am on reddit."

That being said we have started looking at other parts of the country as we both have no desire to remain in DC area for the long term.  Great place to build a resume, but time for someplace new, preferably more laid back and less expensive. Salaries in DC area for IT are overall decently high due to cost of living.  I know that is not true for everywhere in the country where we are looking.  Columbus, Portland, Austin, etc.  

My experience is as follows: BS in Comp Sci, 10 years post college experience and 2 years college internship, no current certifications.  My work experience has been a mish mash of Windows, Linux, Security, and some Cisco pretty much in that order.

If I was going to specialize, maybe even get a couple non entry level certs over the next year while we look, what would be the better choices in terms of maintaining a good salary most places in the country?  Thought about taking Windows all the way to MCSE Private Cloud or Excahnge.  Thought about running with the Linux for LPIC 2-3 and maybe RHCE.  Thought about going full InfoSec, which I really enjoy but I have the least relevant experience at it.

I've never really made any choice Purely for money and I won't make this one Purely for money, but I would like to know my options from other admins about what are some of the most profitable specializations that can carry over to most job markets.

&gt;Me: So, the question?

&gt;Tweedle: Yes. Um. It's a personal request.

Oh god. 

&gt;Me: And that is...?

&gt;Tweedle: Can I borrow your car? 

&gt;Me: What? No. Tweedle, I'm sorry, I think you should go back to the call center now and continue with your work. I'll see you on Monday. 

Tweedle looked at his shoes, then at level1, this time without tears, then turned, saying ""Yes sir"" and walked out of IT.

&gt;level1: See what I mean? 

&gt;Me: That wasn't so bad, but it was a strange request. It'll be fine. 

Back to user migrations which was slow going due to some strange problem with our MAPI that ITDIR and our contracted sysadmin guru couldn't fix. Because of that I had the pleasure of moving objects one at a time so as not to accidentally pull the problem over in an automated migration. Yay! 

The rest of the week was quiet. The weekend came. Then Monday came. 

I sent level1 down to the callcenter with a cart to get Tweedle, Whippy, and their machines. He returned moments later empty handed. 

&gt;level1: They aren't there, and their machines are gone.

&gt;Me: What? I don't understand. Where could they have gone. 

&gt;level1: How should I know!? 

&gt;Me: Okay... Let's look at the security footage then. I don't understand how two complete workstations could have disappeared without someone noticing. 

*To the NVR!*

We pulled up Friday's footage of the lobby cameras and watched around closing time. Frontdesklady was sitting, talking on the phone as always, people were starting to shuffle out. 

&gt;Me: There they are! They're holding equipment! 

Frontdesklady doesn't seem to notice. They walk in, then out again a couple of times with more equipment, cables and all. On their last trip our they say something to frontdesklady and she cheerfully waves goodbye!

&gt;Me: She just watched them leave with our computers! What is her problem!?

level1 had stood there, silently watching as two good computers left the building. I could read his mind. He was less upset about the computer theft, and more upset that now he would need to build two new machines. Stupid.

&gt;Tweedle: Gooood morning Mr. Stix!

Ahh! 

level1 and I jerked around, surprised to find tweedle and whippy standing just inside the outer door of IT, holding PCs and cables, the door clicked shut behind them. Somehow they managed their silent entry while holding the equipment. 

&gt;Me: Tweedle, Whippy, what the hell!?...

I didn't know what else to say.

&gt;Whippy: I'm sorry Mr. Stix. Did we startle you? That wasn't our intention. I sincerely apologize. 

level1 stood there in silent amazement. 

&gt;Me: Fine. Okay, explain. 

I turned my screen towards them and pointed at the paused video feed of them walking from the building.

&gt;Me: Why did you take largenonprofit machines from the building!?

&gt;Tweedle: CCB gave us work to do at home, and we don't have a computer.

That made too much sense. It wasn't their fault that no one cleared anything with me around here. 

&gt;Me: Fine. Okay. level1, please set them up at the table.

&gt;Whippy: That's okay Mr. Stix, we know how to set everything up. Do you happen to have a power strip and 2 ethernet cables.

level1 continued to stand.

&gt;Me: Uh. Yes... Sure we do. level1, please show them our IT storage space and help them get set up. 

level1 woke up and walked towards our storage room, motioning for the others to follow. I was blown away both at the ineptitude of CCB as well as the apparent gain in skill points for Whippy and Tweedle since our last encounter. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all. 

A new email popped up. I closed the RDP session with our NVR machine and opened it.

I applied to several of them and the first positive response came from a big consulting firm. We scheduled the contract signing for this Friday. Today I got a call from another firm, a big investment bank, saying I had been accepted into their internship program.

The problem is: How do I turn down the other internship without burning my chances of being recruited by the company when I'm looking for a real job?

Not wanting to put all my eggs in one basket, and wanting to keep my options open, I applied to other jobs, and I let you know about it, which you were ok with. Well after narrowing it down, I specifically went out of my way to let you know that I was in the running for another position, and that I wanted to wait to make a decision until after I found out about this other position. I was unsure if I should be so open, but I SPECIFICALLY WENT OUT OF MY WAY TO STAY OPEN WITH YOU. I put it all out there, and you said you were fine with that, and that you had no problem waiting until I heard back.

I heard back, and they declined my application. I the let you know that I would like to take the offer from you and keep working with your company. You said that sounded great and we would discuss the details. 

Well from hearing you retract your offer today I learned how much integrity you lack. Not only did you just go back on your word, but you just left me further stranded without a job and back to square one.

They are offering relocation assistance and part of that is either a $2500 (before tax, monthly) stipend for rent, or corporate housing for $500 monthly (my cost) for a one-bedroom space, or $300 per person in a two bedroom. Corporate housing would be walking distance from the office (in South Lake Union). An Orca card is included too, so public transport is free.

Since it is only four months, I believe I pay tax back in Canada (Ontario). I expect my marginal tax rate to be about 20%, so the stipend would effectively be $2000. This means corporate housing effectively costs me $2300-2500 per month.

The recruiter warned that finding short-term housing in Seattle would be difficult. A cursory search on Craigslist was not fruitful. My bothfriend has a lot of friends in the area (mostly Capitol Hill) though, who may have space available.

I don't have to decide right away, but thought I would ask what PF thinks is a better choice. The convenience and cost of corporate housing or the extra work (and likely commute) and lower cost of finding a place on my own. 

I'm glad to clarify other things, and please let me know if I made any mistakes or incorrect assumptions. Suggestions and tips on anything associated with being a Seattle resident for a short while are also welcome. I plan to cross-post to r/frugal, but I expect I know the answer they'll give - you folks will likely contemplate the bigger picture more.

Thanks!

**Edit:** I'm specifically considering [aPodments](http://apodment.com/), specifically the [Alturra](http://apodment.com/alturra.htm) building. It's a 20-30 minute walk to work, and about $740/month with a 3-month lease (and then goes month-to-month). Drawback is that there isn't a stove in the unit, but I don't mind the shared kitchen (I plan to do rice and beans in a crock pot in the unit for most of my meals anyway, I'm a lazy cook)."

I originally thought about spending extra time over the summer to learn Android development. However, my friends got the following internships: Google JS stuff, small startup Ruby/Rails and me on some testing side on web dev. I write small python scripts with selenium to test and try to automate whole testing procedure. I feel fine doing that and decided that maybe it is more wise to embark on web dev route because it is not boring and my friends are working with web dev. We could then continue in our 2nd year and try to build something and maybe start a business if we all have web dev background. I like Android programming more than web dev though. 

What are your thoughts? I ask because I don't have time to spend on both things. It already seems daunting task to learn web dev: html5 -&gt; css3 -&gt; js -&gt; jquery -&gt; ruby -&gt; rails and I want to have a life outside too. :)"

I have had 2 internships during the busy season for tax so far at a B4 and regional firm (who invited me back for next spring as an intern.. Didn't want to wait) and I'll be starting my masters this fall. This is basically my only chance at a CPA firm for the time being.

I'm just curious to know if being offered a salary in the upper $30s range, with overtime and bonuses carrying it to low $40s is a fair salary. This includes health insurance, retirement, and PTO if that helps. I was told that the firm wasn't able to offer mid $40s because they are such a small firm and I'm only starting out.

Advice would be kindly appreciated."

28vp3j,6,2014-06-23,Will my current tech support internship help me in the future?,Jarmanuel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28vp3j/will_my_current_tech_support_internship_help_me/,"I finished my freshman year of college two months ago (declared comp sci at the end) and I'm currently working a tech support ""internship"" (not really sure if it qualifies as that, there really isn't a whole lot of learning) for a state government department. As you can probably expect, I really don't have much work to do, and it's almost all menial. Most of what I do is just catering to the occasional help desk ticket and sometimes re-imaging computers from Windows XP (state govt is a little behind the times) to Windows 7, and I spend a lot of my free time learning Android.

I work 40 hours a week and, while I really do not like it here, I don't plan on quitting until it's time to go back to school. I figure it's better to get paid a bit to teach myself relevant skills than to spend the time gaming. But I was wondering if this internship would help me land software development internships in the future. I'm a little worried (based on other threads on this subreddit) that the tech support experience on my resume would force me into future tech support positions, though I suppose that, since this was only my freshman summer, it won't be a big deal.

**TLDR:** Will companies care about my tech support experience when applying for software development internships, and if so, would it be positive or negative for me?"
28vuqt,7,2014-06-23,"My grandma is gross, my dad's not a demon, my mom's a saint (rant)",[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/28vuqt/my_grandma_is_gross_my_dads_not_a_demon_my_moms_a/,"This is going to be a long winded post, followed up with another post asking how to deal with my situation... things are rough right now.

For a long time, I was convinced my dad was a narcissist and that he was really bad and not worth having a relationship with. Over the past few months, I have come to realize that he's not so bad. He's a troubled person and he's made a lot of mistakes (mostly related to him coming from a shitty family and not having a filter). He has untreated bipolar disorder. I inherited it from him, and now I'm stable and in good health so there are not two emotionally disturbed people in the house duking it out any more. Things in my home have gotten a lot better. His family is trying to heal and mine is healing. But in the last few weeks, my eyes have been opened and I realized how my negative view of my dad has been manipulated by the really messed up person in my family...

My maternal grandmother. 

Before the events of the past two months, I had a really good relationship with her. I had a hard time finding myself (and work) after college. She helped me out financially by giving me a substantial amount of pocket money. We spent a lot of time together, going on a great vacation to Asia and doing a lot of fun stuff. She helped me study and introduced me to a program that is giving me a scholarship to study abroad. I'm very happy about that. But after this family breakup I'm realizing so many things she was doing were not ok. She was manipulating me (didn't work to the extent she wanted to) and I was putting up with way too much stuff. I should have suspected more. My mom warned me, ""She'll turn on you too. It's how she is. Be prepared."" That makes me feel a little better... But coming to the realization that my grandma really was deliberately trying to cause trouble is painful.

What did she do? For starters, she disgusts her only child, my mom, for being fat and a spendthrift. She trash-talked my mom to me all the time, calling her fat, and greedy, and saying that she spent all the money, and that she was using my grandma to pay for all the vacations we went on. Yes, grandma did offer to pay for parts of three nice vacations. However, we did not ask her to pay. We took her on the vacations because we thought we were doing something nice by bringing her along and giving her the chance to go out and get to nice places. We were prepared to pay for everything and we thought she was being nice. She also goes on tirades for my parents spending too much money. On this front she excessively trash-talks my dad. My parents could stand to get less stuff, but in no way are they bankrupting us. Grandma went on a massive rant after my mom got an amazon package sent to her house (doorman building). What was in the package? A replacement mop head, skin lotion and cat treats. SOOOOO expensive. I realized by all this trash talk she is trying to distance me from my nuclear family.

She tells me not to go to my doctor for bipolar disorder. I quit one therapist/psychiatrist because I felt she was at a loss and not helping me any more. I had had the doctor for a long time and felt like I needed a change. My grandma tried to convince me that she was all I needed because of her history as a psychiatric nurse. I immediately found a new psychiatrist. I didn't listen.

My grandma insulted me and called my fat and ugly. One day I went to visit her and she went on a tirade about how fat and ugly I was. She mimed my mom shoving food into her face and compared me to my mom. For reference, I'm not fat. I'm really healthy and I was wearing a huge sweater. I also had a rash from an allergic reaction.  Later she went back on it, but she never apologized. She just said she wanted me to have a ""healthy glow"". 

She plays games with money with others, too. She has a shitload of money inherited from my grandfather. She pretends not to have any money, but she has a LOT. She told me that she had barely enough to pay for her monthly expenses and was freaking out when her utilities went up by $100. She was telling me about that and making me feel bad. But...when I went 
to my mom to talk about it, my mom let me know what the situation of the finances was and there was no reason for grandma to be worried at all.

She plays games with the money, by the way. My mom signed a lot of property from the will over to her because she didn't want to fight over it. My mom wanted to preserve my relationship with my grandma. My grandma is pretending there is no will, but my mom knows it's somewhere (grandma probably threw it out). The money thing is a huge mess that would probably take an entire post to detail.

My grandma actively discouraged me from getting a job, leading to a situation where I'm a super broke intern. When I was interviewing, she'd put me down and she would discourage me from looking. I still looked but she took the heat off my back with the spending money. I regret not taking a temp job I might have gotten if I didn't take the internship with the expectation that I would continue to get the help with pocket money. I say temp because I'm going away for a semester and I don't have time to find something permanent. 

Now, I keep saying recent events led to a family breakup, and I need advice on how to handle what's happening... but that needs a whole post to itself. 

I am so, so angry at myself for letting myself be manipulated. I'm angry for becoming complacent and dependent. I'm disgusted by her actions and I'm coming to the realization that it's NOT ok for her to trash my family or call me names. I'm realizing that I DON'T have an obligation to be with her and I DON'T have to feel guilty about not seeing her. "
28w3uy,219,2014-06-23,please help me save her.,jm893,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/28w3uy/please_help_me_save_her/,"My girlfriend and I have been together since 2009, and she is absolutely everything I could ever dream of.  We met in my hometown, my senior year of high school.  I live in a big city, and we went to different high schools, so it wasn’t strange that we had never met before.  I had a fake ID at the time, and I liked to hang around a dingy old dive in the college neighborhood with my older friends.  I first saw her when she approached the bar, and I fell hard on the spot.  I was immediately reluctant to approach her, as I was a high school kid at a 21+.  No hot girl is going to be interested once they find that out.  I brushed it off and decided to chalk it up as a loss.  I went back to my game of pool, which I was winning by a long shot.  As I was lining up my shot at the 8 ball, I saw the soft flesh of the small sliver of stomach peeking between her top and her shorts in my peripheral. I felt the small hairs on my neck stand on edge with her being so close to me.  She dropped a stack of quarters on the ledge of the table and sauntered over to the juke box.  I sunk the 8.  I was going to play against her.  

Okay, I’m getting caught up, but long story short, we hit it off incredibly, and I even found out that she was only a year older than me.  We had a good laugh about the fact that we were originally both afraid to reveal our true age, and we have been happily together ever since.  Our relationship has been long distance as of recently.  We went to college in the same city, but she recently moved across the country for grad school.  She didn’t get a lot of funding and isn’t able to work more than part time with her hectic school schedule and internship, so she had no choice but to live in the dorms, at least for now.  Almost every night, we Skype for a while because it’s still strange to spend our nights in separate beds.  As I said, she has a very hectic schedule so these calls usually happen pretty late in the evening.  
The first time we were able to Skype wasn’t until about three days after she moved, and although we were able to call and text, my God was it amazing to see her face.  She beamed at me, and I all but melted into my shoes.  She had her ear buds in, so her long hair was tucked behind both of her ears, and they were sticking out just a tiny little bit.  So fucking cute.  She and I chatted for hours, her talking at almost a whisper.  I noticed her roommate was sitting in the chair at the other end of the room hunched over the desk.  My girlfriend was absolutely brilliant, and if her roommate was in the same major as she was, I pitied them.  I was so grateful that she was making this time for me when her roommate was obviously swamped with work, even at 2am.  My girlfriend weirded me out a bit when she made a comment about missing having sex with me with her roommate in the room, but it was subtle and I figured that maybe they’d become fast friends and she wasn’t too uncomfortable about it.  Besides, my girlfriend had headphones in, so I could say whatever I wanted regardless, which kind of turned me on.  We eventually both decided to head off to sleep.  
She’s been at school for about six months now, and we have these Skype conversations at least 4 nights a week.  It’s been hard that she’s away, and I’ve been so proud of her, but after about the second month I was worried that her loaded schedule was taking it out of her a little too much.  She gradually has started losing weight, and her face has become sharp angles.  She’s always tired and has been having trouble with various ailments over the course of her being there.  I eventually decided that I needed to go stay with her a while and make sure everything was ok.  I’ve dealt with stress overload, and it can take a serious toll on your health.  I was hoping that having me around for the weekend would help her relax and that she’d let me take care of her.  We talked about it and she was thrilled, so I booked a plane ticket, made arrangements at work, and off I went. 

I was doing some last minute texting as I waited to hear the announcement for takeoff, and caught a picture message from my girlfriend at the last minute.  She had taken it from her laptop, and her roommate, as usual, was hunched over the desk across the room.  I felt so bad every time I saw her.  She was always working at that damned desk, for all I knew she was more overworked and overstressed then my girlfriend.  I couldn’t believe that I’d overlooked the fact that I could be causing quite a disturbance for this girl by staying in the dorms with them.  On a whim, I decided to say fuck the extra money and texted my girlfriend that I thought we should spend a romantic night in a hotel.  I switched my phone into airplane mode, cued up Netflix, and off I went.  

We met at the airport, and she was so psyched about the hotel idea that she had brought an overnight bag with her and we went straight there.  I pulled out all the stops, and it was the most amazing night.  We drank and talked for hours, got room service delivery for dinner, and I even opted into one of the cheesy romance themed bedrooms.  My girlfriend is still the same amazing woman I’ve known for all these years, but her physical strength has depleted severely.  I tried bringing it up to her gently, because I didn’t want to make her feel self conscious—I love this girl unconditionally.  She insists that everything is fine, even if she’s willing to admit that she feels constantly drained.  The pale, almost translucent color of her skin is what worried me the most; it just made her look so sick.  But she is still the most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on.  I fell asleep just studying all of the wonderful little details of her body laying next to me.

Now, Reddit, here’s why I’m posting here.  Our beautiful evening together was only a few hours ago, and I woke up to use the bathroom.  I hope to God that one of you can help me, because every frantic button I press brings me closer to being frozen with fear.  I’ve tried everything I can to make it go away.  I distracted myself for almost an hour, typing out this post with my eyes glued to my computer screen.  We drank three bottles of wine tonight, and I prayed I just woke up to piss half delusional.  But it’s not going away.  I pissed myself from fear and desperation an hour ago, because I can’t move from this spot.  I’m so scared.  My beautiful girlfriend is still next to me, but she’s fading.  Her breathing is shallow now, and she still hasn’t woken from the puddle of urine I soaked this stupid damned heart-shaped mattress in.  Guys, I woke up to pee, and stopped as soon as I sat up.  There is a small desk across the room from the bed.  And when I opened my eyes, I saw the back of a head I knew so very well at this point.  That hunched figure looked so much less human when it wasn’t blurred into pixels on a computer screen.  I swear to God I thought it was the booze when I first saw it.  To reassure myself, I shook my girlfriend and chuckled nervously about hallucinating that her roommate was in the room, at the desk.  She opened her eyes and a look of confusion washed over her face.  

“Baby, I live in a single dorm.”

And then her eyes rolled into the back of her head and she went limp.  

My girlfriend doesn’t have a roommate.  But she’s always been there. 

And now she’s here. 

Please, someone, help me save her.


EDIT: my girlfriend is alive. The figure eventually left, but I still haven't seen it from the front. Dealing with this shit and trying to save my girlfriends life, will update ASAP "

We met on a cruise in a really unique way and ended up spending the whole night together and watching the sun rise before we parted ways. Although it's still really early in our relationship we've both been to one another's hometowns and met one another's parents. Personally, I have never had a girfriend before, but have had crushes and spent a lot of time with different girls. She on the other hand had a boyfriend of two years in high school, they were eachothers firsts for a lot of things and he eventually cheated on her giving her some trust issues, and combined with other life problems, some depression. In the beginning we spent every night at my house, even when we weren't dating. We waited to have sex early on so it wasn't about that, we'd just sit around and watch greys anatomy (her favorite show) or redbox a movie, and we both loved it. I have never felt the way I do about my girfriend towards anyone in my entire life. She is easily the most important person to me and I'd do anything to make sure we stay together.

I've been reading a few posts on here about loving the first person you've dated and whether it is possible or not, and i strongly believe that I do love her because I've never tried so hard for anyone before and she makes me extremely happy when I see her. We hardly ever argue, but when we do it's about this. She believes that it isn't possible for me to know if I love her because I've never been with anyone but her. I know that I love her, and I devote all of my time to trying to make her happy and being with her. Early on she was the same, but recently things have started to change. She still likes to be around me and do stuff, but she doesn't seem to be in love with me anymore.

 We go to the same college and I had to go home for a summer internship while she stayed for some classes. I would come visit on the weekends and then leave for the whole week. The longest we had to be apart was a two week period when I couldn't make it back out. She always texted me nonstop (which I love) early on and would always make sure that I was thinking about her, and we talked to eachother every night before we went to bed. After these 2 weeks I came back out to school for summer classes and things just haven't been the same. She's always tired, not interested, takes a while to text back, kinda cold when were together, and if she's drunk she'll accuse me of cheating and not loving her. We've talked about it and she always appologizes but it still hurts. Lately she just hasn't been as loving towards me at all, unless it involves sex. She loves it when we have sex, and it's the only time I still get those ""love eyes"" that were a commonplace before. If I bring up a ""lazy"" night of movies or netflix she just goes straight to talking about sex and avoids the other activities. I would normally think that she's just in it for the sex, but we were crazy about eachother early on and even waited a few weeks to start doing it. She used to send me the cutest corny text walls for me to wake up to, and now I'm lucky to get a genuine 10 word response, let alone something cute. When she goes out with her friends I get worried about her because our school is considered a party school and I would never know if something happened. All I ask is that she texts me, and her short responses every 15-20 minutes don't help. Maybe I'm just being clingy? I told her that I worry about her and she laughed as if that would be crazy that she would do something to hurt me, not even acknowledging that I still worry and she's the same way when it's me who goes out.

I tried talking with her about it yesterday and told her it seems like she's bored of me, and she assured me that it's not the case and that she doesn't want to break up and still loves me. She said the separation was hard on her, and she just got used to being by herself. I'm hoping that me being here and taking classes is going to help, but I'm worried it won't. I told her I want to do some fun new date ideas like go to a local lake and get snow cones and walk around, or go to one of those pottery painting places and she just shrugged it off and said she'd rather lay in bed. Were going away to my hometown this weekend and well have the house to ourselves so I'm hoping that helps us, but I'm just not sure.

Being new to the whole relationship thing, I'm not sure if this is a rut everyone has or if this is different from most people's experiences. I was just wondering which steps I should take to make sure this relationship keeps it's luster, because she really does mean the world to me.

Tl;dr newer relationship is in a rut/hit a wall and I'm just looking for someway to get our relationship back to what it was."

28wmjd,1,2014-06-23,28 Day report - ...Skype Sex?,Eccentrikk,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/28wmjd/28_day_report_skype_sex/,"Today marks the 4th week-28 day period-of NoFap and I feel great. I currently have a goal of 60 days of no PMO which is exactly when my girlfriend comes back. I have just overcome a week long flatline and my mood has improved. I'm a 19 year old male who started watching porn since around the age of 10, then started fapping around 14. Until the later teenage years I started watching porn for entertainment and because I could, not to fap. I was bored. One of the main reasons I started NoFap was due to my inability to orgasm with my girlfriend during sex. It was either hit or miss...and most of the time it was a miss. I also couldn't feel anything during blowjobs, but I've never been able to orgasm from, also known as DE (delayed ejaculation) and/or the death grip. Like most people I thought it was the condom so we tried a variety of different condoms.  It did make a difference to some extent but I still wasn't able to orgasm most of the time.  I know she feels bummed out sometimes but she has accepted it and is very welcoming of my problem. I'm very grateful for her. 

Today I was Skyping with my girlfriend who is overseas for and internship and we did engage in Skype sex. At first I was a little skeptical but she really wanted me to join so I thought why not. I've been reading around and Skype sex is a grey area, some people consider it a relapse and others don't. I joined her because I wanted to make her happy and see how much sensitivity I had gained. I had also just come up from a flatline so I was horny and really feeling myself, no pun intended. It could be because I was touching myself, but the sensation was incredible. It hasn't felt that good in a long time and I was able to orgasm within a few minutes with a very loose rather than almost an hour of death grip.  Needless to say, she was very happy.

When she does come back I will continue my my abstinence from PMO.  The Skype sex with her was a one time thing and she has agreed to support my progress. NoFap has convinced me enough that it is effective and I want to continue my progress. Some things that it has improved  in my life in addition to increased sensation are:
*More free time
*More time to work out (many people have noticed an improvement)
*Generally more positive mood
*Improved diet
*No more thoughts about porn
*DE has subsided (but will obviously test again in another month when she does return).

One thing that should be noted and I encourage other people to do as well is to take vitamins. Any multivitamin is good with some fish oil.  I feel like many people don't eat properly/get the proper nutrients they need and it really does help boost your mood and you'll see better results if you work out.  I also take CDP-Choline after reading up on that too.  For those who want to take it, I can't say if it's working or not but I am able to think clearer.  Supposedly it's supposed to increase dopamine receptors and blood flow to the brain, so I'm game.

Throughout this whole experience, I don't consider it a relapse because I consider Skype sex with my girlfriend to be as close to real sex with her for the time being, plus she asked me too. There was no type of guilt associated with it and I still feel like I'm on track.  However, porn and masturbating on its own is still offlimits.  
What are your thoughts?

Stay strong fellow fapstronauts."

I have a lot of project work under my belt. Been very active in different societies at my university. Even did a 6 week internship last year in the fall. My GPA is decent-ish (3.1).

I really, really want to get a chance to go abroad. But I am looking for a paid internship or a job. I applied through IAESTE few months back. I got nominated for an internship in Korea University. I was so excited. But then out of the blue Korea University rejected me because of ""insufficient computer skills"" which was totally crazy because of 2 reasons: (1) The initial offer letter mentioned they wanted someone with expertise in microprocessors, embedded systems and control systems...All of which I am well versed in and (2) I mentioned a bunch of computer skills (knowledge of different programming languages, CAD, PCB designing, MS Office, MATLAB, Simulation and Modeling, graphic designing etc). So yeah. Very shitty luck.

I am practically ranting at this point...Basically I have been scoring the Internet for internship opportunities. But either they are only for US/EU people or they are on websites which demand ridiculous amount of fees for unpaid internships. I would genuinely appreciate any help I can get. Thank you.

28xz4j,2,2014-06-24,"Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] one year, I think he's depressed and I'm not sure how to help (temporary LDR).",616throwaway616,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/28xz4j/me_22_f_with_my_boyfriend_21_m_one_year_i_think/,"First off, I'd like to start off by saying my boyfriend and I met last August at college, he's a junior and I'm a senior, studying abroad for the summer for an internship in Europe.  I'll graduate in August when I return.

I love my boyfriend, and we've always been great with each other.  We can talk about anything, we spend every moment we can together even if it's just studying or watching Netflix. We've never fought before and when we do disagree on a topic we talk it out, and usually end up having copious amounts of sex, it's awesome.

However, this summer has been really hard on my boyfriend.  We've never done LDR, and I think he's taking it really hard.  We try to talk and Skype as much as we can, but it's hard, especially because we're on different schedules. 

More and more recently we haven't been able to have a ""normal"" conversation. Most of the time he always brings a conversation back to how much he misses me and how much he wishes he could hold me or be with me. He also keeps talking about he hopes I don't cheat on him (which I would never do), despite us talking about a future together. I keep reminding him about how we're going to see each other in just over a month.

Another thing is that he's unhappy at his job.  He's working with his grandfather this summer in construction and he hates it.  He says it's mundane work and he hates the people he works with.  I also try to remind him that it's just a summer job, it's not forever and it's good money.  

He tells me he feels alone and ""stressed"" which I think is his way of saying he's depressed.  He goes out with his friends (not lying, I see photos that his friends post) but says he still feels alone.  The past couple of days though he's said some real concerning things like ""I don't know how much longer I can do this"" and ""I can't take the stress anymore.""

I'm scared that he's going to do something drastic, and I'm really not in a position where I can do anything. I could call his parents, but I know he would resent me for it.  I told him that he should talk about it to someone other than me and that it might help, but he said I'm the only person that he can be open with, and just keeps repeating that he can't wait to see me. 

What should I do?

tl;dr I think my boyfriend is depressed, but I'm not in a position to help and feel helpless.  "

My name is J and I live in the UK. Between 2011 to 2012 I lost 110 Lbs through calorie counting. I was 152 Lbs at my lightest. I am 5 foot 8"".

During that time I was away from family and friends on an internship. I did well and was really pleased with myself.

But then my internship ended and I moved back to my hometown, and that is where it all began going down hill. I now weight 205Lbs :(

I know the trick is to limit my calorie intake but these days I find it so hard! I work as a Software Developer so sat down in front of a PC all day. And drive to work because work is an hour's drive away. When I get home I am so tired that I simply put my head down and sleep. Then repeat the same routine the next day.

On weekends .. me and friends gather, and I eat so much junk with them :(

I would greatly appreciate some advice on how I can regain the mental strength I had previously. Today is my first day back on the diet, one of many past 'first days' :( With your help I hope I can stick to this one and achieve the weight loss I am seeking.

28y66s,7,2014-06-24,Should I drop out?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28y66s/should_i_drop_out/,"I'm currently a 3rd year CS student at a Canadian University.

I also have some pretty awesome side projects including an app in the App Store which is netting me $25k/year in passive income.

I really do love programming, but lately I've had zero motivation to continue school because the theoretical crap they teach doesn't interest me and it's making me unhappy.

I'm really considering dropping out since I don't see any point anymore. I'm also not too concerned about future employers because I can't see myself working for someone else forever.

28yaxl,5,2014-06-24,My Apologies if not the Right Place,Somethingwittyimsure,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/28yaxl/my_apologies_if_not_the_right_place/,"So, I don't know. I apologize if this is not technically allowed, as I've not fallen into a set date or approach, but I'm worried that I'm headed towards a decision to commit suicide, one that I would likely take every step to carry out, if the resolve finally comes. 

I'm in this weird limbo where I am no longer simply fantasizing on the way to work or in the daze that comes before sleep what would happen if I happened to die. I suppose it was a security blanket that would keep me aware of the fact that I was simply curious with how people would respond to my disappearance from their lives. I'm not the only one who does so, and that knowledge sort of kept me from ever saying I was suicidal.

But...that's changed. I'm starting to think on it in a more self-directed way, I guess you could say. I'm focusing only on the immediate - the end of feeling like shit, the end of the unending self-criticism and anxiety that I feel every god damn day, just the end of slogging through finding and utilizing ways to feel positive and think positively, only to find that nothing is changing. 

Even now, I am nagging myself constantly with the reminder that I have no good reason to feel this way, that's countered by the realization that that thought is irrational and antagonistic to the ""me that I have to nurture and be kind towards,"" but then that's met with yet more strings of thought that are either slanted towards unending cycles of self-pity and bullshit or irrelevant entirely.

I've talked with my all of two actual friends, but to the one I feel guilty because I've already talked with him already about this mental state when my mood is in the lower swing, and I feel that I'm already straining the relationship when I'm clearly showing signs of no enthusiasm when we're hanging out. To the other, he is clearly bothered by my depressive state but...I don't know - he retreats to smoking weed to block the bad shit in his life, and that's just...not something I'm going to add to. What's worse is that I feel like I'm stagnant with them, since one is just smoking weed (he has a problem and knows it, but it's his life choice and I can't judge him for it), and the other I feel is just annoyed by my presence and will move on in the end anyway.

FaceBook's depressing because all the ""normal"" people have been and are continuing to have their wonderful, perfect lives that smack me across the face. I went abroad for my junior year, but nothing good really came of it. I made no friends, language skills didn't improve all that much (and what little did has regressed since coming home), and seeing the sights leaves no wonder to me for whatever reason. There was no profound change or greatness in the experience, which just stings when everyone else seems to have gone through great changes for the better. I was depressed, went through the end of a failing relationship, and spent the remainder trying to make friends and not succeeding. Back to that ""trying to take on a positive energy"" bullshit an what not. Worked on smiling, maintaining a more positive attitude, started exercising to improve my self-image, etc. Still, nothing changed.

I think I said it aloud today - can't remember, but I think deep down that I truly feel like a failure, and there's a large part of me that I know wants to succeed. I still have steps I can take to reach it, but if there's no friends/loved ones about - ones walking beside me, ones I can actually feel comfortable to be around - then I'll just end up this sad, pathetic, lonely piece of shit. It feels as though there's this dichotomy that I have to either focus on my social shit, or I have to abandon all pretense of social circles and the emotional turbulence it keeps causing if I want to succeed anywhere. And then I rightly think that that's bullshit, but there's still a lot of crap that I have to sift through. And then I feel that I'm at a time in my life when I need to be doing internships, building my entry-level career before graduating, and learning to be an ""adult"" like my peers -- feeling as though I've long been behind them, and the time it will take me to ""fix myself"" will ultimately leave me in the dust. And thus begins yet another cycle.

And yet, right now, I know that if I can't inwardly grasp a sense of that reality of being a sad, lonely figure at the end is capable of being avoided in any possible, realistic way, then I will sadly find that resolve to end this.

I'm tired of always being the one that has the problem, the one who's failing at the things that matter, always having to be taken care of, that my inadequacies are the ones bringing people down. I'm tired of - should none of that be true - constantly feeling as though it is. It's painful. It's painful to the point of tears, and I really just want it to stop, and I don't know what to do about it anymore. I've been trying with all of my power to fight it, and I really don't want this to be a battle I lose."

I'm writing here because I don't know where else to go. I'm currently going through a depressive episode - they happen cyclically for me, and this one is particularly stressful just because I'm going through a big period of change in my life.

Let's start with the background, I guess - I'm 22 years old, currently working full time and finishing up a degree in computer science on the side. I just got a job offer at my internship company (salaried and everything), and my girlfriend and I are about to find a place to move in together. It'll be my first real job and my first real experience living with someone I deeply love. It was actually her idea to try and reach out to anyone I could.

You'd think with a situation like this, I would feel great, and I do - I know that these are things that should make me really happy and excited, but when I'm going through a depressive episode those feelings are fuzzy and muted. It all ends up leading to a frustration and thoughts that nothing will ever make me happy and that I should just give up.

My girlfriend, the love of my life and my soulmate, knows about my depression and has been nothing short of the most loving person I could ask for. Even on the days when I can't seem to smile at all, she's unfazed ready to support me - again, something that should make me happy but only ends up making me feel like a burden, and that she should and could be happier with someone ""normal"" - despite the fact that I know that's not what she would ever wish for, the anxiety and depressive emotions get the best of me.

I'm reaching out because I'm scared that I have all of these (what should be) happy and exciting events going on in my life, but all I can feel at the moment is dull and worthless. I have people who love me, a job that I enjoy, and yet when these episodes happen I can't seem to muster a positive reaction to anything - and now when they wear off, I spend a lot of time just scared of when the numbness will start again :( it's enough to make me think that this depression is too much of a burden for me to bear, and too much of a burden to put on those who love me. I'm afraid that the people who love me now will just become frustrated with me if this depression continues, and that I'll end up alone with all of the sadness and numbness.

So if anyone has any advice, please help me. I'm scared, and I just want to feel things again. I want to be excited that my life is going somewhere. I want to stop feeling like a burden to the people I love. "
28ypha,9,2014-06-24,Where do I go from here?,firerunswyld,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/28ypha/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"So, my fellow redditors... I'm stuck in a rut.  I have a couple of options to choose from.  My story:

From age 16-20, I never worked a job for longer than 3 months, and I quit every one without notice because I never wanted the option of being able to return to that job if I hated it enough to quit in the first place.  I was a very firm believer in the phrase ""do what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life.""  I had no idea what I loved, but, by god, I was going to figure it out.

Despite my unconventional career search strategy, I was still able to maintain steady employment.  I interview well, and not looking like I just crawled out from under a rock helped.

So 9 years ago, at about 4 am, whilst stoned out of my mind, I saw a commercial for Ohio/Illinois Center for Broadcasting.  10 hours later, I was sitting in front of the Admissions Coach at the school signing paperwork.  I didn't know it at the time, but I was about to embark upon a path that would change the course of my life.  

The next ten months was a whirlwind of useless classes teaching outdated broadcasting techniques that I was never to use again.  The two things I received for my 10 grand and 10 months of busywork were a) an internship on Rovers Morning Glory, and b) a mantra: Never Say No.

Post graduation I worked as a production assistant on American Idol in several cities during audition season.  This gig had promise.  Easily would have turned in to full time work.  Had I not been co-dependent at the time, I'd have been able to tell my girlfriend to kick rocks when she called me and begged me to come home.  Instead, I quit and went home.  

A few weeks after settling back in to a crap relationship in the armpit of the country, I interviewed and was hired by House of Blues as a stage and lighting tech.  Now, bear in mind this was before the company was purchased by Live Nation, back in the days if Isaak Tigrid.  It was an amazing company to work for.  Help ever, hurt never.  We accept everybody as they are (unless they're assholes).  I mean, come on, the company founder was ousted by the rest of management because he did things like give bags of pot away as Christmas bonuses to ground level employees.  Everybody I worked with was cool.  

I loved the company so much the first two years I worked there that despite Live Nation buying us out, being busted down to part time to save the company money, years of broken promises of upward mobility, and no raises, I stayed for 9 years.

During that 9 years I also subcontracted as a stage and lighting tech and production coordinator for various other local events companies.  I also became an EMT/Firefighter to supplement my income.  I worked for Next Top Model, Discovery Channel, and Fox News in various entry level roles around the country.  

I never did turn any of those opportunities into anything long term, but I did gain a lot of really good experience.  

This year, I started working full time for a business logistics company that pays me a ridiculous amount of money to pack boxes.  My benefits are insanely good.  They pay 100% college tuition anywhere I want to take classes as long as I maintain full time employment with this company.  The Christmas bonus averages around the equivalent of an extra 5 months of pay.  I listen to audiobooks and podcasts all day long.  

At the end of the day though, I pack boxes.  There's no joy or pride in my work.  

So here's what I'm thinking... Do I get my Masters of Science in Entertainment Business from Full Sail, and see where that, along with my already extensive entertainment field experience, takes me, or do I settle in to a career here at the logistics company?

We both study in different cities but i used to see her aroudn 3 days a week, which was enough for me.

Recently i started a internship and had to move back in with my mom because she lives very closes to my internship. Because of this i wasnt't able to my gf during weekdays anymore only on the weekends. A year ago we had the same problem but then i would see her every day in the weekend. But this time it was different most of the time i only saw her one day on the weekend, she said she needed some rest aswell because she was very busy with her study and other activities. 

After a couple of weekends i got sick of only seeing her one day each week and we had a bit of a fight about it a couple times. Then she finally said that she didn't enjoy seeing me that much anymore and that i wasn't myself. Then 2 weekends go by with some tension between us.

We both didn't like the tension and wanted to get things back to normal. So she said we should take a break (not seeing eachother and not talking with eachother) for a month so we both had some time to think if we wanted to continue our relationship , i was hesitant at first but went with it anyways.

Now i am 3 weeks in and i've been getting drunk quite a lot in this period with friends. I am pretty sure that i want to continue with her. But last week she has been posting a lot of pictures on FB of her going out with friends. Now there is nothing wrong with that but the thing is she looks quite drunk and wears a lot more make-up than usual, normally she doesn't get drunk and wears very little make-up.

I am gonna see her this weekend. And i am becomming nervous that she might have someone else or wants to break up. 

So please give me some advice on how to get her back

I am currently working as an intern in a software company in France. At the end of that internship (in 2 months) I will have an engineer degree in software development from France and I also have an Msc in computer science from the UK.
When this internship ends, I will have 1 year and a half of experience as a software developer. I have a lot of knowledge in the standard software languages such as C, C++, C# and Java. I have spent one year abroad studying artificial intelligence
I have also done cross-platform development, developed video games and a lot of other different softwares.
I really like working with complex algorithms, on problem solving, anything that is not the design of the software/web development.

I am fluent in french and can speak and write in english. I am a member of an english conversation group and spent one year in the UK to improve my english.

My nationality is french, I am therefore an european citizen.

I want out permanently.

My main problem is I don't know how/where to start. I have tried to look for jobs in domains I like in the UK, Germany and in the countries of northern europe such as Norway, Sweden and Finland but I have not found a lot of success.

I have waited a long time to make this post as I see it as a ""last resort"". I really hope you can help me.
English is not my native language so maybe I have made mistakes while writing.

If you need other information don't hesitate to ask I have tried to give the information needed according to the post in the sidebar [How to ask for help in/r/IWantOut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/qb8jc/how_to_ask_for_help_in_riwantout/).

28yyxp,2,2014-06-24,Comp E seeking college and career advice,SuperSaiyanSandwich,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/28yyxp/comp_e_seeking_college_and_career_advice/,"I'm currently an undergrad at UMBC in Maryland(up and coming little brother school to College Park). I'm currently entering my senior year in Computer Engineering and am having second thoughts. I universally loathe nearly all of my CMPE coursework such as circuits, assembly, PCB design, etc. They're a daily grind, not very interesting, and incredibly complex. That being said I've loved nearly every comp sci class I've taken including a python course, two java classes, and a data structures course.

I'm currently working a summer internship as a software engineer doing defense work with Java. I love programming in Java, and while I'm generally not a fan of the defense industry the work isn't bad.

My goal/question is, I'd love to head to the west coast to check out a new place in my life and to work in a more consumer application driven environment than the gov't hub that is Baltimore/DC area. Is it worth it to add close to another year of college to head towards a CMSC degree or should I just stick with CMPE and try to get a developer job with that? 

Additionally, would a big firm such as Google, MSFT, etc. give me a chance with a mediocre GPA and a somewhat unrelated degree? I can't imagine they would, however, I do have a 4.0 in all CMSC classes listed and wouldn't be opposed to going to a more prestigious grad school for CMSC if needed to prove my worth.

I realize this post was poorly worded and all over the place but I wasn't sure where to even start. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: Also of note, I do have a math minor having completed Calc 3, diff Eq, and a real analysis/proofs class if that helps my chances in any way."

Recently, one of the guys in charge of our IT Help Desk came to us with a request for an IM system such that a patron at a machine hooked into the public side VLAN can page and chat with one of the help desk techs behind the desk, who's machine is running on our staff side VLAN.

The individual in-charge of our Networks here has indicated that we don't want to fiddle around with trying to get this IM system to communicate across our VLANs. Not entirely sure why, but it seems as though they believe it to be too difficult or something. I'm not so sure it'd be impossible, or even difficult for that matter. They've instead instructed me (a lowly intern ;-) ) to do some research into Internet based software, which isn't a terrible idea, but I just really believe that using our own infrastructure wouldn't be difficult.

So I was hoping you all could shed some light on setting up an IM system that works across our VLANs."

28zcn4,1,2014-06-24,Berlin V (better late than never...and filled with my ever so wacky musings),mi1154,blogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/blogs/comments/28zcn4/berlin_v_better_late_than_neverand_filled_with_my/,"Last week marked one month in Berlin. I honestly cannot believe that I have been here for over one month. I suppose time really does fly when you are constantly busy. Speaking of busy, I just realized how much I have done in the lab today. Whilst I was finishing up a cDNA synthesis from the RNA I extracted yesterday, I opened my freezer box and realized that it is almost full. I've done a lot of extractions so far this summer...unfortunately not a single one of them has been completely successful. That is science for you.
   
   
 Aside from realizing that I am hated by RNA, I realize that I have had the opportunity to meet some fantastic people here that do not hate me. Through the relationships I have formed here in Germany, one thing is apparent: I love watching football (or for you state-siders, soccer). The World Cup has served as entertainment for a great deal of my nights in Germany.  Whether it be breaking down a language barrier with the universally understood ""GOAAALLLLLL!"", or Hmm's and Hah!'s, the disapproving grunts, occasional giggles, and all too common gasps at close calls and bleeding players, the World Cup  has been a source of enjoyment that I have had the opportunity to share with strangers, colleagues, flat mates, and friends from all corners of the globe.
   
   
 --Has anyone ever really thought about that statement? Globes have no corners...OK, moving on--
   
   
 Unfortunately, Thursday, it all changes. I will be watching the USA vs. Germany game with my colleagues, and I am sure that I will be the only Yankee in the room. I predict that my experience will be interesting at the very least. If the USA wins, I wonder if the BBQ they are planning will even happen. If Germany wins, I wonder if I will ever hear the end of it. If the teams end the match in a draw, will I have to hear how it was planned from the start? The USA coach is from Berlin, Germany...not only that, he is from Wedding...which is where I live. I can only imagine that this game will feel like I am stuck in the middle of a civil war. Either outcome, I still lose. BUT, that's a pessimistic thought...I'm excited to watch world class competition between my homeland, and my surrogate homeland. No matter what the outcome, I will have a great time. LET'S GO USMNT!
   
   
 --Wow, I just noticed something else: USMNT is like United States Marines: Ninja Turtles...NSA, if you are currently spying on this blog, please do not turn our Marines into Ninja Turtles. My cousins are Marines...It would be mighty weird to see turtles show up at a family reunion.--
   
   
 So, what have I been up to in the past week? Honestly, that's a good question. I have been working, going to a music festival, watching World Cup Football (Soccer), playing games of chess over the internet against Caroline, talking to my flat mates, meeting other interns, READING JOURNAL ARTICLES, extracting RNA, accidentally degrading RNA, finding out two days and countless hours of pipetting after extracting the RNA that it is no longer there, discovering that my cDNA synthesis did not work, I did have some success! I promise!!! I found about 100 ways to lose RNA!
   
   
 On a more happy note, my allergies are doing fine :) I think I am finally getting used to the sporadic weather here in Berlin. Having never REALLY been landlocked to this extent, I did not expect the weather to be as crazy as it is. Some days it is excessively hot, the next it could be 50°F and raining. Oh, by the way, the heating stopped working at the beginning of June because it was supposedly summer...shame on whoever put together that system...my room is freezing every morning. For any of you that know me well enough to have had turn up the thermostat without remembering when you put it down to 65°F in the middle of the night every time I come home...this is a big deal. I almost NEVER get cold.
   
   
 Speaking of temperature, in my house we have always had air conditioning. This is the first full summer I have gone without the good old AC. At first, I wanted to choke every time the temperature exceeded 25°C (WHATEVER THAT MEANS). Now, everything seems pretty normal for me. I never have a hard time falling asleep because it is too hot, there is a constant breeze here in Berlin that always cools me off. Not to mention, there is almost literally no humidity in this part of Germany. The only time the humidity even starts to bother me is when it is about to rain, has just rained, or I forgot to open my window for 15 minutes within 24 hours.
   
   
 For those of you back home in Rochester, please do me a huge favor and attend the Jazz Festival. I really miss the festivals that Rochester has all summer. Party in the Park, Corn Hill, Park Ave. and many others...We are really quite lucky to have so many festivals going on. Not to mention, most of them are free to attend. That is one thing about home that I am really having a hard time with. That, and I miss my family.
   
   
 Anyhow, I'm off to see the wizard or something. There are things to be done, friends to make, food to eat, beer to drink, sights to see, and places to be. Thank you for reading! Tschüs!

I was at college then, and I told him that I wouldn't be home (where the position is located at) for 2 weeks, and told him the exact date I would be back. He said he would contact me then. The day came and I had sent a follow-up email the day before that I just arrived back home, and he replied the next day saying he was just about to contact me, and if I could come in for an in-person interview the next day.

I thought the interview went pretty well, I talked with about 3 different people for 30 minutes each. At the end of the interview, he told me they had 2 more candidates to interview, but he would contact me ""in a few days.""

I had my interview last Wednesday (6 days ago). This would be my first internship (marketing) and I would really love this position. He never responded to my thank you email after my in-person interview. Would it be wise to email him tomorrow or should I just sit tight and wait a bit longer? I understand there must be time for the other candidates to come in, and for him to make the decision with the other employees and such.

I don't know much about how the interview process goes for these positions (most of my past jobs have been work study).

Originally my girlfriend was planning to do an internship at a village in puzhuang town close to suzhou, I was going to get a tourist visa and explore China while she interned.

However she was unable to get the correct visa so it has ended up with us both going on a tourist visa. She is no longer planning to intern, and we will both just visit China for a month.

The company who she was interning with was owned by the father of a mutual friend of ours and was really helpful in trying to get her a visa so we are planning on paying him a courtesy visit to give some gifts.

We will stay one night there and he plans to show us the factory, after that we will return to suzhou to a hotel we have booked. Perhaps this seems ridiculous but i am concerned of being in a factory without a working visa even just visiting. Particularly as i am Caucasian i will stick out like a sore thumb in a village which probably sees no foreigners. My girlfriend is ethnically Chinese so her presence would not be so incongruous

What I'm really asking is will my worries really amount to anything? Is it really likely i could be implicated in a situation where it looks like I'm working and incur problems with the local authorities.

2) Money: At my rate, I could possibly keep going in my career and make tons more money working as an engineer, but my heart and my happiness is with kids and education. 

3) Immigration: I was brought to America as a child and have been living in the shadows up till recently with the DACA (thanks Obama, for real) and now I can pursue my dream of being an American citizen hopefully.

2902s1,7,2014-06-24,Hate new boss (Rant),arnaldSchrodaniger,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2902s1/hate_new_boss_rant/,"I use to work under the general manager of a small tech company until a few weeks ago.  There was a new project and the gm hired a project manager who I now report to instead of the gm.  I use to love my job and actually looked forward to coming in.  My former boss, the gm, is a nice, goofy, old, but brilliant man and the work environment was very relaxed.  He can be considered ""one of the guys"" and not a terrible tyrant of a boss that so many people have.

So my new boss, the project manager comes in and things go south.  She is a woman and let me clear this up right now.  I have no problem working under a woman.  Ive had 2 other bosses who were female and they were fine.  I am in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelors in cs 3 years ago so I dont claim to be a programmer extraordinaire.  Im still learning and eager to learn more so I dont think Im better than my bosses or colleagues as Im still relatively new.   However my new boss is different.

My new boss is arrogant, informal, opinionated, and quite frankly, I dont think she can program her way out of a paper bag.  Simply put, she is a ""gamer girl"" type.  She makes it known that she has held many top positions like ""director of ..."" and like people to know she is a real geeky girl.  However, none of her positions indicate any practical programming.  They are all fluff and glorified titles.  I looked her name up on google and found her twitter.  It consists of posting pics of stacks of programming/cs/agile books with quotes like, ""So many books but a real programmer is always ready to learn. #realprogrammer""  She also spouts agile and scrum nonsense everywhere.  One of her other quotes is ""Just trained an intern software developer in agile and hes now a real programmer.""  Heres the kicker, ""Havent programmed in years but with all of my experience, I now manage projects instead of doing them.""  She is 35 years old and got a degree in psychology two decades ago. Far from being an experienced anything.  She is also an avid feminist who likes to bring up issues of gender equality in software jobs such as how few women they are in the workplace no less.  She was hired as a project manager but she was suppose to work with the rest of the team, not just give orders and tell us what to do.  Instead, she pushes her actual programming duties onto others.  A 5 person job had now turned into a 4 person job and 1 person to badger us along the way.

I am a decent programmer in silicon valley.  Ive had multiple job offers and have no problem finding another if this one doesnt works out.  I actually chose to stay at my current one because it was so nice to work at instead of taking another job that paid about 12% more.  Now I might actually quit due to a bad boss.    

Anyways, how do you guys feel about this situation?  I wrote this to partly vent but mostly because I want to know how others feel and if anyone else was in a similar situation.  I just want some feedback about this and it doesnt even have to relate to this directly.  Maybe talk about other instances where you've had bad bosses.


tl;dr New boss is arrogant and I dont like her.  What do I do? Have you had bad bosses, if so, what did you do?

My girlfriend and I found out that she's pregnant. I'm 23 and she's 21. I told her that I will support any decision she makes on this matter. As of right now, she has decided that she's going to take the pill (basically assisted miscarriage).  

The problem is that we're from the southeast and she's in L.A. for a summer internship. I can't imagine what she's going through out there all alone. She is unwilling to leave her internship. I have offered to move out there for the summer so that she isn't alone but she doesn't want me to leave my job to do that.

I feel incredibly guilty that I can't be there with her during all of this. It feels terrible. I'm remaining supportive and available 24/7 but I don't know if what I'm doing is enough. I want to respect her wishes but I can't help but feel that I NEED to be there. I don't want her to feel isolated. 

If I can't temporarily move out there, what can I do to support her from so far away? How can I be sure that she is remaining healthy both physically and mentally?

I'm consuming all the information I can on supporting a woman having an abortion but I still feel that I need any and all advice. "
2906kr,0,2014-06-24,First approach,Maadboi,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2906kr/first_approach/,"This is my first post, so here is a little bit of background information on me. Im 17 years old, average looking, 1.80m (metric system all day). I am a really social person, it is easy for me to get to know people and make new friends. I am really good at academics. I went to primary school at the age of 5 and then skipped one year. That means, I graduated high school with 16 went to uni right when I turned 17. I had no game at all in high school, which is mostly due to the fact that I was much younger than the girls I found interesting. I still looked like a kid when everybody else already looked like adults for years. I feel really weird around people in my age, because they seem immature to me. That's why I never tried anything with girls who are as old as I am: I talk to them and I simply do not like them.

At uni, people do not see me as a kid anymore, consequently my game improved. I had opportunities for a lot of make-outs and I guess a few hook-ups (like most people at uni) and I could have gone for something serious with two girls (HB8 and HB7, I guess), but I am only physically attracted to them and both are pretty needy. **It is important to note that these girls like me because of social proof only. I am valedictorian and really popular. I never made any moves, so it is kind of random that they like me** Also, I had a very bad case of one-itis (I managed to get really deep into the friendzone), but thanks to this subreddit I grew some balls, stopped putting her on a pedestal and moved on. 

The reason why I want to do pick-up is the following: I am not interested in fucking girls I do not really connect with at all, so I thought it's best to try being friends with girls and if I develop feelings for them, I'll try to develop it into a relationship. This **never** worked and is, from what I read in this subreddit and from my experience, a really bad strategy. **Consequently, I have to make clear that I want things to get physical earlier**. Also, I never walk up to women I do not know, so my pool of women is really restricted. I had to work for everything I achieved in life so far, so why do I expect that meeting girls I like will just happen on its own?

**Now the approach**: 

On the way to my internship, I see this really good looking girl in the bus every morning. I have AA and she wears earphones all the time, so I never find an opening. This one morning, I listen to a playlist, that always puts me in a good mood. I try to make eye-contact, which doesn't really work because she is staring out of the window. We get out of the bus at the same station. As she removes her earphones, I'm like ""Fuck it, you have nothing to lose"". This is my first approach ever and I am really nervous. I am really unlucky: The moment I walk towards her, she turns away, but not far enough to not realize that I approach her, which catches me off-guard and gives me time to hesitate for a bit. At that point, all my anxieties come back. She stares at me in expectation. 

I say ""Hi, I'm maadboi. I wanted to ask for your name."" **Worst. Sentence.Ever** If you want to know her name, just ask for it. You do not need to explain what you are doing.
She smiles awkwardly and answers: ""I'm Sophia."" I try to make eye contact but she avoids it. Still, I can tell she is flattered. Next thing I hear me mumble is: ""I know that's pretty direct, isn't it?"" She agrees. I ask, what she is doing and she explains that she is studying dental medicine. I mention a friend of mine who studies it as well in the same city and ask whether she knows him. She declines. All of her answers are really short. Eventually, she asks what I am doing. I respond that I moved to the north to study biochemistry, but that I came back home for an internship over the summer. I try to answer in a way that allows her to ask more questions, but she doesn't. Then, there is this horrible silence. I did not expect her to say nothing at all and I don't know what to say. It stays like this for the longest 5 to 10 seconds of my life. Eventually our ways part, and we both say bye.

**What I did well:**
* I approached
* I gave a long answer that contains more information about me

**What I did poorly:**
* I made poor eye-contact. That was **never** a problem for me and I am really confused that I wasnt able to maintain eye-contact
* My timing was bad, she turned around as I approached, so there was no momentum
* I can only imagine how horrible my body language was, I did not offer a handshake
* I did not keep the conversation going
* I was very outcome-dependent
* I mumbled, my voice was not confident

**Conclusion:**
I am really happy that I approached. I was thinking about all sorts of scenarios that could happen if I approached before. It is a relief to get rid of those thoughts. Also, I am really happy with myself. Even though the interaction was horrible, I am much more confident now. I know that I am not a pussy and have the courage to do what I want. I do not really care what she thinks, because I will never see this girl again. I was really surprised about how easy it is to handle rejection - thinking about how the interaction looked like from a stranger's point of view made me laugh a lot. It was hilarious **My question is:** I really do not feel ready for daygame after this experience. Is there a way to improve in baby-steps or do I have to do loads of approaches now in order to improve?

I am sorry for the wall of text. I appreciate all sorts of advice and apologize for my bad english. It is not my native languange.

29088j,1,2014-06-24,Trouble Getting Back In Shape... Is It The Depo?,lolvo240,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/29088j/trouble_getting_back_in_shape_is_it_the_depo/,"To make a long story very short, I used to be fit but then  BOOM, depo. Can I get fit again? So far, the answer is no despite my best efforts, and I've narrowed it down to probably being caused by the depo. Is there hope for me if I quit?

To make a long story pretty long:
- Used to be very fit in early high school. Ate whatever I wanted, walked EVERYWHERE, swam for 2+hrs every day, was able to lift ridiculous weights with no real training or knowledge - and do it again the next day. Reached my current height (5'7"") and weighed 130 from 8th grade through 10th grade. Always looked about 110 due to being mostly muscle. 
- Convinced mom to put me on the ring in 10th grade due to hellish PMS and acne. Loved it, didn't gain any weight... it made me incredibly depressed though, and I dealt with it.
- Moved to new school, maintained until senior year when I got a new doctor. Told her about having one, solitary migraine w/ aura after inner tubing in 100 degree weather all day to the point of heat exhaustion. Nurse tells me I NEED to go on the shot or I will definitely have a heart attack and die before I'm 21. Skeptical, but do it anyway because doctors know best, right...?
- On the shot through the rest of high school, a year of college. Notice weight slowly creeping up to 135, still exercising pretty regularly and eating healthy. Blame the tiredness I experienced on stress.
- Drop out of college to do a work readiness program/internship at the age of 19. Stress eat through six months of competitive classes, bringing me up to 140.
- Spend a year in the internship commuting 2 hrs both ways, sitting on my butt all day, played Minecraft through most of the last six months. Had a realization for new years 2014 when, at 150 lbs, I no longer fit into my favorite dress.
- Spent the past six months at my new job dialing in my diet, eating fresh foods and cutting carbs down to almost nothing, limiting drinks and ditching mixers, walking a mile to and from work every day, and leaving everything I have in the free weights section of the gym twice a week. 

And the weight isn't coming off. 

If anything, I've gained a bit - I'm sitting unhappily at 155 right now. I'm tired all the time, even when I get 8-9 hours of sleep a night. I can only lift a fraction of what I used to be able to (without any trainer or previous experience). I can't even squat/deadlift my own weight after six months of progressive training. My lower back has started aching constantly despite always being very strict with my form and having no prior injuries, and I'm experiencing crippling DOMS after every workout regardless of intensity. The only factor that I can think of is the depo. 

Has anyone else had experience with trying to get in shape/drop pounds/recomposition their body while on the depo? Does birth control really make it harder? Or am I just not working hard enough? Will the weight come off easier once the depo wears off? How long will that really take - it's supposed to have a 50 day half-life - since I've been on it for a few years? Will I ever be able to do enough to get back to being myself, and not a fat-covered version of myself?

Right now, I'm waiting for the depo to wear off. I've got another month of ""protection"" still, and I'm getting so discouraged at my lack of results. At this point, whenever I look at/feel my body it's a kind of torture; I can feel my old, muscular body underneath the awful layer of fat that's gathered on my legs, back, and arms. I want to tear it off, burn it off - it's disgusting. I can grab handfuls of fat on my stomach, pull it away, and feel the muscles hidden beneath. I don't want to starve myself, because I know it will just cause me to lose more muscle mass, make my skin droop, and screw up my metabolism even more... but at this point, it's starting to look like a viable option. Is there hope for me?"

The Positives: The position is paid.

The Negatives: The attorney/partner that I am working for has the worst anger management issues that I have ever seen.  He literally goes on yelling/screaming tirades over the smallest inconsequential things.  He belittles people, calls them stupid, attacks physical appearance (wtf?) and other childish things unfitting of a managing partner.  I have been here less than a month and I have personally seen this attorney make different employees cry 5+ times.  The entire office lives in complete fear of this individual and everyone seems unhappy.  I worked in three law offices prior to this, I understand the demands of the profession and the stressors associated with tight deadlines, but this is on another level.  Those attorneys were at least courteous and respectful to their staff.  This attorney has some deep seeded emotional issues, and unfortunately is the managing attorney of the firm.  I dread coming in to work every morning.

So the way I see It is I have two options:

1) Suck it up, try not to get fired, and grind out that resume spot.

2) Quit, and either attempt to find something else this late in the summer or just enjoy the rest of my summer off.

Suggestions? If I quit how will this look for the bar/future employers, and would it even be possible to explain away?  I feel like I am kinda fucked and I need to just ride it out."

I just turned twenty.

I've always used my young age and relative amount of success to mentally put off doing things that I'm actually passionate about. I don't feel like anything I do at work or school actually matters.

I'm a computer science major and I'm good at what I do, but I don't like imagining my future developing software for some boring company.

I want to do something cool like make music or video games or something (which I almost feel bad about because computer science has the potential to improve our qualities of life tremendously), but I just feel like anything outside of a 9 - 5 (7 - 4 in my case) job will satisfy my parents (more importantly my mom whom I actually live with and see every day and pays for my college almost single handedly).

But I know that's bullshit. There are plenty of other reasons why I don't go around making artistic stuff. It's not easy. I just want to feel like the things I do are meaningful and fun and my life just couldn't be further from meaningful or fun right now. It's not hard in the slightest it's just boring and repetitive. 

I get up every day and cook my eggs and toast (because I'm on a strict diet that I can't seem to stick to for more than a week) and go to school or work (school this summer). Then I study or work as hard as I can, eat at times that I've planned out, go to the gym before going home, and then get home and crash because I'm fucking tired (like right now). 

I keep doing these things because I want to look good and feel good about myself, but I can't tell if any of it's worth it.

Side note: I've only been in three relationships and I've been single for two years and have paralyzing fear of meeting new people and pretty much only have one friend whom I go to the gym with almost every day.

My friends and I agreed that we'd all get a place together in Brooklyn if we all got the internships we were looking for, that didn't happen of course and I was chosen to enjoy the sweaty subways and bustling streets of the Big Apple alone.  Thankfully my parents had some old friends who have a place on the Upper West Side, but maybe I shouldn't be so thankful?

I moved in two weeks ago at the start of my internship, my bedroom has it's own bathroom and is kind of annexed from the rest of the apartment so I get privacy, which for a young guy meeting girls in the city is awesome. On my third night there I was pretty stoked about relaxing in bed and watching a movie, that's when I noticed it. It wasn't anything you could see or touch, you could just feel it. 

People say when a spirit is in the room with you the air gets colder, that's a lie. It gets warm, sticky warm, but not so much that you're sweating, just enough to let you know it's there and there isn't anything you can do about it. I sat there in the moist heat watching this movie and my best guess was that I dozed off because suddenly I was watching the credits. It wasn't till the following morning when I woke up to a note from my parents friends thanking me for doing the dishes that I knew something was up. I went to work anyways and that was it for the day.

The weekend I felt the warmth again. I'm going to stress this again because it's important, this is not a ""I'm out on a summer day and it's humid"" warmth, this is a soothing, massaging heat that you feel down to your bones. It's fucking terrible. All I remember from that Friday was hating it and doing everything I could to get to sleep early so I wouldn't feel it anymore.  I woke up Saturday in someone else's clothes.

I don't know who's clothes they are and I really don't think I want to. I later discovered that a woman and her husband had been killed Friday night, their bodies found stripped naked in Riverside Park. The worst part is their 15 year old son Bobby was with them and he has since gone missing. I don't think I'm responsible because the bodies were apparently mutilated pretty bad and the new clothes I had were perfectly clean but it scares the shit out of me to think that I ""warmed out"" the same night this happened. 

The next time was about a week ago, it was late and I was lying awake thinking about this when I felt it. It crept up me this time, starting at my feet and working up until my chest was filled with the moist heat. That's all I remember, nothing was disturbed in my room the next day, which was a huge relief. The rest of the apartment seemed fine too. My parents friends had left a note saying they were heading off on a vacation this week which was short notice if any but it gives me some time to sort this out. I've been doing a lot of research on spirits and demons but nothing seems to match up. All the articles say that they may make you feel angry or you'll hear growling and have lots of nightmares but I've experienced none of that. I'd actually say I'm feeling better than I normally do, I've been waking up rested and feeling very very relaxed. Which is leading me to believe I might be crazy and maybe I just slept walked to the thrift shop, haha. But I'm really posting this here because of what happened last night.

Last night I ""warmed out"" (Sorry I really don't know what else to call it) and when I woke up there were four neatly folded stacks of clothes on the ground in front of my bed, two stacks of girls clothes and two other stacks with jeans and a t-shirt/button down on top.  On the fourth stack was a note with two words written on it, in my handwriting.

""Good work""

I don't know what good work I've done and I haven't heard of any murder's in the area so I'm hoping, like the first night, I just did some cleaning around the hou

You are a college professor and assistant dean with the brightest of futures. Your history classes are always among the most popular and you are a favorite of the students. And while you have had to deal with a fe crushes--nothing has risen of any real concern. You are after all, a married woman with two kids and living that ""white picket fence"" life.

But lately *he* has been testing that idea and your inner demons you didn't know existed. It started with his harmless compliments...followed by little gifts and trinkets in your office...and then...seductive emails and erotic photos. You put up the token resistance and steered him away. But you hadn't reported it...and hadn't even removed him from your courses. *You found yourself enjoying it...even dressing more provocatively as he sat in the front row.* where was this going?

This RP could involve many things. Some adult-level age play (18+), flirting, public sex, infidelity, and even blackmail...maybe scenes at school, parties, her home...

**Lewinsky**

Yes...the political intern scandal is infamous in America...but this RP reverses the roles. You are a famous politician...a US senator with dreams of the big office. You are in the middle of a campaign based upon conservative values. Still a single woman you preach on topics involving wholesome relationships and abstinence until marriage.

But behind closed doors you find yourself fantasizing of the opposite. You troll alternate lifestyle websites...BDSM, D/s, age play, noncon, cum play...you can't hardly even focus anymore and need an oulet. What about that new intern? Have you caught him looking you over? Is he as sexy as he seems? Could he keep a secret? You think you have to find out. But can you take the risk...or could you stop if you did?

Again...the possibilities are aplenty. Every kink could be in play in addition to those mentioned above.

My experience is the usual sort of experience for a 21-year-old. I've had a job for 4 years at home, and then while at school I write for my school newspaper (am now Editor-in-Chief for the coming academic year). I've had two internships - one was very formal, I went into an office and did real work for 20 hours a week. I wrote web copy for the company's products, and began to help reconfigure and smooth out their website.

 The other was... well it's barely an internship, it was sort of this confusing on-call thing where my boss would forget about me for months on end, and then randomly spring up to give me another job to do. I'd spend 20 minutes on the project (usually researching a client or writing up social media copy), send everything back to her, and then there went the communication on that.... anyways.

For every career choice I've considered, I've backed away because either A: it would not be beneficial to my health in the long run (teaching and psychology would drive my stress levels off the deep end) or B: I wasn't really helping anybody (PR).

I'm the kind of person that needs meaning in a job. I can't do it just to do it. I don't care about the money, just as long as it's livable and I can save up money to go to Disney World every now and again. But really, the big thing for me is, I have to do something for someone. I need to make a difference in someone's life. At the end of the day, someone else should feel better because of me.

Naturally, I turned to the plethora of internet assessments to see what my next step should be. My school's Career Services center offered a bunch of different assessments. In every one (and I mean every one) I was told I should be one of three things: a teacher, a counselor, or a religious leader.

So, the teaching one is out for reasons I've already said. Religious leader is also out - I don't really identify with one religion. That leaves a counselor.

I went and met with the Director of the Career Services. He looked over my resume (he gave me a perfect score on that) and then we discussed my options. He recommended a job like what he does - a career counselor.

Well, it sounds neat and all, but I'm looking at jobs in that field and they just seem so sparse... and I live in the Boston area, which has so many schools it's unbelievable.

And then there's the doubt - what if I change my mind *again*?

Other notes: my job at home is in a grocery store bakery. I would say it's the worst job I've ever done, but that would be a lie because cashiering at that store was the worst. So sticking in that company is a no-go. The people are nice, but the job itself lacks everything I need and I feel incredibly drained just thinking about the place.

Working as a journalist would be a pretty fun job - but there's almost zero chance of me making any kind of living off of it. Print journalism is dying. I don't have the skills to be able to be on the writing staff of any paper like the NYT, or even HuffPost. 

And finally, the icing on the cake: pressure from the family to succeed is making it worse. I have all of the ambition to do things, to work hard and smart and well, but I still haven't found a career field I'll truly be happy in. The constant questions (have you figured it out yet? have you started looking for jobs? what will you do? etc etc) are stressful.

I'm set to graduate next May with a Bachelor's in Strategic Communications, and minors in PR and Management. Reddit... what can I do? 

TL;DR: Lost 21-year-old seeks guidance. Too much ambition, but no idea which way to direct it. Had a decent amount of experience. Family pressure to pick something and be successful like RIGHT NOW."
290xqr,10,2014-06-24,"After 2 years of self-sabotage and inactivity, I desperately need help",[deleted],getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/290xqr/after_2_years_of_selfsabotage_and_inactivity_i/,"I'm at my rope's end and desperately need help figuring out how to fix things. Please give me any advice you have. I can't emphasize how desperate I am right now.

I graduated high school 5 years ago and I've been on a huge downward spiral since then. It got really bad about 2 years ago and it has just been getting worse. It started off with depression, then social anxiety from almost never leaving house, then just regular anxiety about everything. I am not depressed or socially anxious anymore. However, I am pretty anxious and seem unable to feel happy or even content.

Basically, I do everything possible to screw myself over and I don't care about myself at all. I don't know why I am like this. I was always a high achiever and did wonderfully in high school. In the past 2 years, I've skipped over 75% of my classes, haven't had a single job or internship, don't know any professors and have no friends. 

I saw an online internship program last summer that I really wanted to do, but I decided I wasn't prepared enough and I would learn the necessary software and skills and apply next summer (this summer). The application process opens up next month and I haven't done shit to prepare. I have almost nothing to put on my resume and I didn't learn the software programs I needed to learn.

Why? I have no fucking clue. I missed over 80% of my classes during the spring semester. I have absolutely no clue what I did all day during that time period, just wasting time on the internet and taught myself the material for my classes. 

I've been trying to lose weight for years but just don't give a shit about myself or my health. Every day it's the same crap. Drink tons of diet soda and eat random junk and bread. I am sure I am deficient in tons of vitamins and minerals. I have tried to eat better, but I really just don't care.

I don't hate myself. I don't think poorly of myself. I just truly do not care about myself at all. I don't know why, which drives me crazy. How can I fix this? I don't understand why I feel this way, but it feels inescapable. I just don't care about myself. I don't know what to do anymore. How can I stop self-sabotaging? 

I am open to any suggestions. Thank you for reading this and for any help."

2914ip,1,2014-06-25,[REQUEST] Apps for an auditor looking to boost productivity with a tablet.,[deleted],androidapps,https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/2914ip/request_apps_for_an_auditor_looking_to_boost/,"Hey, guys, I'm a starting auditor with one of the Big Four firms and I'm looking to pick up one of the new 10.5 Galaxy Tab S devices as a pure work device that ideally wouldn't connect to the internet any more than absolutely necessary (software updates and the like).  Intended tasks would be the following:

1.  Take notes from discussions with seniors.  During my internship my desk area got to be a bit of a mess because of all the various scrawled notes, which were hard to keep track of.  Ideally, I'm looking for a good note-taking app to use with a writing device, so that I can draw quick arrows among points and the like.  And yes, taking dinner orders, of course.
2.  Keep track of appointments, deadlines, and contact info for client-site contacts.  A good scheduling app (which I don't think would be hard to find, no help necessary) would take care of that and the usual contacts app would be fine for keeping contact info centralized.
3.  Track time more efficiently.  Yes, we have spreadsheets in 3-minute increments.  That's a pain in the ass, an app could do it much more easily.  This would probably involve writing my own app, but I pretty much know exactly what I want and I think I could learn enough coding to make something viable without too much work.  The process wouldn't be especially complex, it would just keep records of settings and when I tapped a button, basically, before doing some simple calculations with the data it gathered.
4.  Bring over documents and spreadsheets for over-the-shoulder review and clarifications by seniors.  The laptops we have aren't exactly the lightest and they're kinda clumsy to pass around or have one person holding the thing out in the air while the other person looks at it.  Here's where it gets hard:  We're anal about security, and with good reason.  I need to know two things:  a)  What's the fastest way to transfer files from a laptop to a tablet, ideally without connecting to the internet, and b)  Is there any way that I can create a virtual machine or an automatically-wiped partition on my tablet's hard drive so any files brought over can be securely wiped on command or automatically?

Tl;dr:  1.  What's the best note-taking app, in your view?
2.  What's the best secure (meaning ideally not over the internet) way to move small files quickly between a laptop and tablet?  I'm thinking Bluetooth since these are small files (mostly-text word docs and spreadsheets), but if you have better ideas I'd love to hear them.
3.  Is there any way that I can have the files stored on my tablet in such a way that they will automatically delete, say, every day or whenever I need them to, and be deleted completely so that they cannot be recovered when they are deleted?

All the best, guys, thanks in advance for any advice you can give me."
29176q,14,2014-06-25,Do you think you'll ever be happy?,twelvegage12,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/29176q/do_you_think_youll_ever_be_happy/,"I've dealt with depression pretty much all of my life. My mom has it, and I was put on meds (prozac) in elementary and again in high school once we moved after my sophomore year in high school. 

I don't have any real negative memories from my childhood, but I know there were some. My parents physically fought a lot, but I don't really hold onto that, at least not consciously. They're still married after 29 years together. 

Before I even graduated high school I signed up and joined the army. I always did well in school, but I wanted to be independent and ""blaze my own path"" so to speak, pay my own way through college and get the benefits of having served. I did my 4 years, and got out honorably. Throughout my time in the army, I married a Korean while stationed in Korea and had a daughter. Never dealt with depression though, even while in Iraq.

Immediately upon returning from Iraq, I got out of the army and started college at 22. I was married to someone whose English was limited, with a kid and was waiting tables. It was during this time that I started smoking pot. Not a full-blown stoner, but it was more than every now and then.

We ended up getting divorced, which was obviously the right decision. Our daughter went with her for about the first year, and then, one day, she basically dropped her off and said she didn't know when she'd get her back. Her mom is still around, lives 5 minutes down the road, but never sees. As of this post, her mom hasn't seen her in 5 or 6 weeks. 

After being divorced, but while in college, I met an amazing woman. An amazing woman who makes me want to be better, makes me want things I've never wanted, all that good stuff. Well, I screwed it up while I was in college and we broke up after dating for about a year and a half. We broke up. I was crushed. I would go out with buddies to take my mind off of her, tried to talk to girls, all that stuff.

During the relationship is the time that I went to the VA to get back on meds. We were having communication issues, along with other typical couple issues, but my depression was obvious. After trying a multitude of different med combinations, I eventually stopped with the meds. During the relationship, I smoked considerably less. Between the two of us there are 3 kids, so it made sense not to at home, but when an opportunity arose to do so outside of the house, I partook. 

Anyway, before meeting her, while dating her, and especially after we broke up (a couple months before graduation) my graduation date was the exact date I could finally be happy again. I'd finally be done chasing the carrot. I'd finally cross the finish line.

Well, I graduated, and turns out, that people aren't handing out jobs when you walk across the stage. I did all the right things in college: I was the president of 2 student organizations, did quite a bit of networking, interned, all of that. My grades weren't GREAT (failed 3 courses 1 semester when dealing with the divorce), but not bad by any means. I landed a cool internship during the summer and a part-time job working 6-midnight at the newspaper. 

It was right around the end of the summer when my internship was over and it took me a couple months, but I eventually found another paid internship (while maintaining my night job at the paper.) It was also during this time, that I began talking with my ex. It started slow and I had to rebuild her trust, but I enjoyed the process. I enjoyed getting to see her, and talk to her, and all of that. I stressed over it to know end. Eventually, I shaved my beard, changed my phone number and a bunch of other things to prove to her what she meant to me. It worked. Things have been great between us. Our communication is so amazing. I never could've imagined it being like this. We got engaged April 6 of this year. 

That internship I took eventually turned into a ""full-time"" gig. I put full-time in quotes, because my full-time salary is 23k a year. I know, I know, there's a lot of people that don't have one job and here I am complaining about having 2. I knew, from the second question asked at the interview, that I did NOT want the internship. The job never disappointed. I still hate it. I work at least 60 hours a week (while driving 35 minutes + traffic each way) to make what most of my friends make in one normal job. My fiance just got a new job within her company and makes just under 60k. 

If you've stuck with me this long, thank you, I truly appreciate it. My story is a long one, but now I'll get to the depression part.

I keep going back to my time in the army, especially my time in Iraq, and that was probably the happiest I ever was. My main job in Iraq was casualty reporting. I didn't deal with ""shooting bad guys"" and all that, but my job was writing up the reports on the guys that were wounded, killed, etc. I also did mail and promotions :P Back to the point, despite not really liking my job, not liking my boss, not liking where I was, I was actually happy. During my deployment, my daughter was born, but I was lucky enough to be able to take leave to see her be born. I didn't come back until she was just about a year old. Things were so much simpler then though. Send money home to pay bills, give the wife living money, etc. No worrying about the other b.s. of life. I have reckoned that it was the combination of the army doing everything for me and the fact that I could die at any minute that kept me from depression. Plus, we did some really silly shit.

Cut back to now, and I have a great daughter, two great (soon-to-be) step-daughters, an AMAZING fiance, a supportive family, everything. But I'm still not happy. I deal with a lot of jealousy, but I've never considered myself to be the overly jealous type. I'm jealous that my fiance got her job without any college, someone literally asked her while she was working at a daycare if she'd like to fill in while on maternity leave. She's been there 9 years now and makes about double what I make. We live in the house that she grew up in, but she paid for it. We're working on switching a couple of bills into my name, mainly so I can feel like a man and actually contribute financially on some level. 

I'm perpetually exhausted now from working so much, but I'm sure the depression contributes to it. I'm still in good shape. My work schedule doesn't allow me to work out much, but any day that I'm not working 14 hours, I do workout. 

I'm stuck in two jobs that I have no real upward mobility in, and neither of which has any legitimate chance of turning into a job that pays well enough so that I can quit the other. I've applied at more places than I'd even care to count, ones that I was qualified for, over qualified for, under qualified for, everything. There were some that I would've been perfect for. Nothing. I've looked into being a cop, a fire fighter, a pressure washing technician, a corrections officer, everything. For one reason or another, nothing has happened. I have given up hope on changing jobs at the current time and have resumed smoking because it helps me not feel pain, at least in the moment. 

Through all of this, it has always seemed like I'm chasing that carrot. I graduated - no carrot. I get my first ""full-time"" job - no carrot. I get engaged - no carrot. Am I capable of being happy? I feel like there's something wrong with me.

I've described depression as being down in a hole that you don't want to get out of. That when people try to help you out of that hole, you deny it and WANT them to tell you that you deserve it, and to push you further down. All while wanting to be happy, but not knowing how. I think I've forgotten how to be happy and live in the moment. 

If you've managed to read all of this, I can't thank you enough. Just writing it all out has helped to some extent, in the hopes that someone, who understands, will respond. I'm sure there are things I left out or didn't expand upon enough, if you have questions - ask them, I will fill in whatever blanks I can. I tried to turn an encyclopedia into a children's book. "
2918z1,1,2014-06-25,"What do you think my chances are for transferring into UT Austin for computer science?/x-post from r/college, just looking for some opinions from people that go here",throwawy2356,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/2918z1/what_do_you_think_my_chances_are_for_transferring/,"Hey guys, so I'm looking to transfer into UT Austin for computer science some time around next year (from my current computer science program), I was wondering if you guys could tell me what my chances are? Here are my stats:
GPA: 3.92/4.00 (1 A- and 1 B-, rest all A's), will possibly be higher at the time of application as Im taking a summer class (so about 3.93 ish)
EC's: 
-Internship at intel as a validation engineer/technicial (summer after freshman year) 
-Currently interning at hewlett packard as a software engineer (for the summer) 
-4 years of being on a first tech challenge robotics team in high school, went to national championships twice 
-Will maybe have another prestigious internship under my belt at the time that I apply 
-Spent a year on my current schools mars rover robotics team (competing in the university rover challenge) 
-various other coding / programming side projects (don't know how much this matters)

I can get excellent letters of recommendation from my teachers, and employers (if your allowed to get them from employers. My concerns are however that I am applying from out of state. Also, at the time I apply, I will have a little over 70 hours of credit from my current school(im assuming its not all transferrable though), but A good chunk of this is from a community college in portland oregon, so Im hoping those wont transfer either.

And thanks for your input and im really hoping I can get in! I really like the program at UT austin and Austin TX seems like a really cool place to live.

291c5g,88,2014-06-25,All I wanted was to stay in the fucking closet.,throwaway_ydafu,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/291c5g/all_i_wanted_was_to_stay_in_the_fucking_closet/,"I am so sorry for this wall of text

Well, I guess to start this off I should say I am 15 and in the closet. I am only out to a few number of friends and have a boyfriend. We've been texting for about 3 months now and he's my first.

I was on my laptop when my mom approached me tonight. She asked me if there was anything on my phone she needed to know about. After I said no, she demanded to see my phone and look at my pictures. Naturally, I told her 'no' and locked my phone. 

That's when she told me everything. 

She accessed all my text messages through our cell provider. She knew about all the pictures I've been sending and receiving for weeks. She wouldn't say it at first, but from her word choice she knew that I was gay and she wanted to confirm it with me. 

It started off with her making threats to open my phone. She said she would call my dad if I didn't open it. She never did, but then she escalated to *calling the fucking cops* if I didn't open it. Due to her job, she is pretty close to the police department and the claim was pretty believable. 

I started to cry. She still threatened to call these people and opened up her phone to call dad. At this point I begged her to end the call, so she did. She said that now was the time for me to tell her anything, or else she would *tell my fucking siblings* everything I would tell her. That's when she sat down and started holding my hand saying that I could tell her anything. After about 15 minutes of going back and forth of her saying I can say anything to her and me saying 'no thanks', we went to her car so my siblings couldn't hear.

I was in complete tears at this point. She was going to call the number I was texting (my boyfriend) and talk to whoever picked up. She threatened to call whomevers parents they were and tell them everything. I couldn't let this happen, his parents are really homophobic. They hid the fact that he had an aunt until he found out at a family gathering because she is lesbian. I opened my phone and showed mom a picture of my boyfriend, completely in tears.

I didn't want to come out to my mom today. Although for the most part she was supportive, it is not what I wanted. Being gay isn't that big of a deal to me, I didn't want this to be such a huge thing. I don't need ""help"" because I'm gay, I'm perfectly fine with it and was actually pretty happy with myself. My mom thinks otherwise. She wants me to see a therapist and talk it out. Talk what out exactly?! Everything was perfectly fine until she decided to invade my privacy, and she's hurt me because of it. I won't be able to forgive her in the near future.

Well, if you made it this far I would have to thank you for reading, it's nice to just tell someone

**EDIT**

Thank you guys so much, I really appreciate your kind words here. I'll try to reply to every single one of you, but I am at an internship and might not be able to be on reddit until later"
291d83,1,2014-06-25,Public Relations/Marketing person that wants to switch over into some kind of IT role... what would you recommend for me?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/291d83/public_relationsmarketing_person_that_wants_to/,"Hey everyone. I have been pretty dissatisfied with my career and ultimately I know that I regret my major and career choices thus far and that I want to move into some kind of IT role. I could really use some non-judgmental guidance if anyone can relate at all/had a similar path.

Here's my background:
I received my Master's in Communication focusing on public relations last fall, and did a few internships and assistantships related to that degree. Then I had a godawful time trying to find a job in the field (500 ish apps). I finally found one, BUT it is not full-time and is dead end and with no benefits.

 It has also made me realize that I had this industry in general. I write blog posts of meaningless corporate drivel. I make marketing materials that are neither artistic nor appreciated by anyone (people who can't even open indesign critiquing me all day), and most of all I find that most of my co-workers and peers are just pretty stupid. I say stupid because most of them don't want to learn. My own supervisor has told me that she doesn't want to even bother learning basic html or any of the adobe products, even though that's what we pretty much deal with every day. 

So why do I go this way? Well, until a few years ago, I only cared about music, and I graduated with an English degree just to finish college. Then I was pressured highly by my girlfriend at the time to go to grad school because she thought I was a loser and somehow it was the ticket to me getting an actual career. I wish I had better resolve and common sense, but it didn't seem like too bad of an idea at the time, but now I know it was wrong. I know I should be working with computers on a more technical level, and I wish that I had better focused priorities in the past.

Now I'm at a point in my life where I am serious about studying, learning, and actually getting good at something.

As far as computer stuff, I consider myself a little bit versed in everything. I recently completed the A+ certification, but I have been building personal computers as a hobby for about 10 years, as I used to set up networks for LAN parties and all of that. So I am decent with basic troubleshooting and maintenance. I worked at best buy for some time a few years back, but everyone knows the geek squad is just a sales position, not real tech support. Additionally, I do have some coding skills. I am really advanced with my html and css, but I do have beginner level competency with javascript and python. I like coding, but I have hit a brick wall that I feel I won't get over with more schooling.

Lastly, I've realized that I am happiest at work when I am at my computer heavily invested in some type of problem (usually it's trying to figure out how to do something in one of the Adobe programs or a glitch on our website).

Basically, I'm just sharing that so you know I'm not like others who are only interested in the cash grab 

I know that whatever I decide, I will fully investment in, and I am really thinking of going back to school to do pre-requisites for either a computer science degree, data analytics, or IT related.

I'm much less concerned about money and more concerned about job stability, getting to work with smarter, more inquisitive minded co-workers, and being presented with more challenges that have me engrossed by my computer screen for hours (where I wish I had more time at work to finish).

What would you lead me into if you were, say, a career counselor that knows things

291kie,1,2014-06-25,[F/20] feelings of hopelessness in LDR,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/291kie/f20_feelings_of_hopelessness_in_ldr/,"So I started going out with my boyfriend [M/21] after being very good friends for over a year. He is a beautiful human being and I love him dearly. 

From May 25th, however, I left the States to do an internship abroad in Japan for 2 months (still ongoing). It has been painful, as you guys would understand, and it has also been wonderful and our relationship has deepened because of it.

The problem is, I return to the States for a month in August, then as soon as September comes around I'll be back in Japan--this time, I'm studying abroad for a year (September to July). As I'm graduating abroad, I'll be entering the working world shortly after that (he's also going to graduate at that time, so we're both going to be searching for employment).

While this internship has a definite end point, and thus I know when I""ll be back with him down to the hour, the year abroad is rather different. I don't know when we'll see each other again. I don't know if we're going to be able to find jobs at all near each other (or at all, hahahaha, the classic fear!). When I think of such a huge period of time apart from him (made worse by the fact that I can't say it will only be a year that we'll be apart--what if we get jobs across the world? etc.) it hurts incredibly and I feel overwhelmingly hopeless.

He's an incredible person and we've both helped each other through so much, and I can confidently say that this relationship has made us both strive to be better people. I don't want to lose him, but when I think about how long we might be apart I feel both helpless and hopeless.

How do you guys deal with this?

Thank you for your time

TL;DR: Already abroad, feel okay because this has an end point. Going abroad again shortly after returning with no end point. Don't want to lose one of the most important people to me, but it feels hopeless sometimes."

I'm in the very unusual situation where my Summer Internship location has been changed from London to Edinburgh at the very last minute. I need to find accommodation from the 3rd of July to the 6th of September and am, of course, more than willing to pay rent.

Unfortunately, most letting agents do not appear to accept such short lets and I have found little success enquiring through Gumtree and other websites over the past few days.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I should move forward? I'll be based in RBS Gogarburn so would be looking to live in Corstorphine or Edinburgh City Centre.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Thanks to a lovely user I have now found a place to stay. Cheers to everyone that helped xo"
2922lq,4,2014-06-25,Hired as an intern but will not work this summer. What do I do?,ethioman91,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2922lq/hired_as_an_intern_but_will_not_work_this_summer/,"This summer I started a little late on finding an internship. I wasn't having much luck so I found a website listing a bunch of companies in my area. I found that some didn't really have an application page but they did have their contact information. Being a bit desperate, I emailed the companies asking if they had any sort of internship available or if they were considering having one. The CEO of one company (lets call him Dr. Johnson) said that he would like to talk to me. This company is small, I would estimate &lt; 10 employees. When I talked to him at the 'interview' he was talking to me like he would hire me. He told me to come in around Memorial Day so he could see what I could do on SolidWorks and then start working on a SolidWorks project. The week before Memorial Day I ask him if he wanted me to start on Memorial Day or the day right after and he basically tells me that he wants me to start a week later because he was going to be out of town for three days that week. I am okay with this because I thought that it gave me an extra week to relax. So by the end of that week, I call him asking what time he wanted me to start on the following Monday, June 2nd. He says that from June 9-29 he would be in Germany and that I could start on June 30. Fortunately, He also asked me if I wanted to work under the CTO (lets call him Dr. Patel). I say that I do because then I could start sooner and I feel like I would get more experience if I work with an engineer doing more engineering tasks. Dr. Johnson said he would talk to Dr. Patel to see if I could work under him. I wait for him to respond and he says unfortunately Dr. Patel is caught up in a lot of work and that he doesn't have time for an intern. This meant I would start on June 30 and work under Dr. Johnson. I am upset at this point because this would delay my start by a month and reduce my pay as well. I deal with it and then last week I decide to email him about what I am supposed to do until I start like paperwork, etc and when exactly I will be starting. I get an email from him last night saying that he will not be available in the entire month of July because he will be travelling to Chicago and Shanghai. This means that the SolidWorks project he had planned on me doing is now cancelled and a wasted summer. 

I think I should mention two things. First, a friend told me when I got hired that I should be getting a verification letter, but I never got one. I realize now I should have requested one. Second, the closest thing to work I have done for him is sign a confidentiality form.

I obviously am not happy with this outcome and I want to do something about it. I was thinking about asking him for a referral to another company in my area and calling Dr. Patel to talk to him directly to see if he had anything for me. /r/engineering what should I do?

**TL;DR** Was hired to start working on Memorial day, gets delayed a week because my boss travels, then another 4 weeks for other travels, and finally no internship because he will be traveling some more. Suggestions?"

Almost every people I read about see their job appliance turned down because they're not the *perfect* type for the company. And when I say perfect, it can be a little thing (again, from what I read, which can be totally false).

Now as for the reasons as to why I was let go, I believe it was mainly because I crossed (unintentionally) one of the longstanding employees (Clerk of the Board, a position elected by the legislators) by having my hours as 10-5 instead of 9-5, the fact that I had missed the ceremony where the new legislators were elected (I had strep throat the week before my operation and getting better was a priority for me at the time) and the fact that I would be missing the first two weeks of the new legislative session because of my operation.

An example would be if the customer forgot their invoice on the way out so they then text the number with their message about forgetting the invoice. The message would then go to the correct email for such a problem and then that department can take care of it.

I have personally never dealt with phone numbers and email addresses together and figured I would ask here what would you step wise to do this. I am not asking for specific code or anything since I may or may not end up doing this depending on the amount of work it will be and if my boss determines it is a waste of time, also because if I end up doing it I won't learn a whole lot from copying someone elses code.

Also the reason the simplest solution of the customer sending an email in the first place is not being used is because many of the customers that come in are out in the field all day without a computer and not all have smart phones. (Company is a hosing and fitting company).

I just got hired (haven't started yet) to be in charge of computer security for a mid-size company. All in all, this is one of the most senior positions there, and I've got 15 years of experience in my field.

 For background the lobby for the IT department has glass walls, and folks enter in to a reception area with a reception desk.  Behind it are 6 offices (with doors) and the server room. The actual secretary got moved down the hall in to the help-desk area a few months ago.

Stopped in to drop off some paperwork, and the boss points to the reception desk, and says that is where I'll be sitting. (Besides secretary, I'm the only female).  Mentally I freak out, but casually say ""Well, that's going to be very distracting"".   He then mentions that he may move me and the secretary in to a joint cubicle in the help desk area.  This is in an open area adjoining the break room.  UGG

WTF....  I'm used to being one of the only females in this industry, but this is insane.  I'm having some bad feelings now that I'm not going to be doing anything but answering help-desk calls to unjam printers, reset passwords, etc...  If I get stuck at that desk, I'm going to be playing receptionist because everyone that walks in to that office will be asking me *""Is Mr. Boss in, or when will he be back?""* ALL DAY.
The final insult is half of the offices house year-round interns and very junior employees (all male).  

How do I stand my ground on this tactfully before I start?

**EDIT:**  Wanted to clarify a few things I see that keep coming up, so hope it helps answer some questions.
* I currently live in a more remote area of the US, think cold and northerly.  The IT has been drying up recently, but I'm not in a position to currently move yet. My hubby's job is doing great at this time.

* This is a new position to this company, and they need it badly.  I'm starting to think that they don't even realize the task I have ahead of me. (Which does not bode well for my new position)

*  As others have pointed out *""If I sit at the reception desk, I'm going to be perceived as a receptionist.""*  This is very true and also very bad.  I'm going to be coming in and changing policies, procedures, and people are not going to like it.  It has to be done though to shore up the current lack of Info Sec.  

* Since employees are not going to like my changes, I need to start the job off with the right impression of my position.  As in.. ""No, you can't walk all over me.  I do have authority to change things around here"".  However with this current desk situation, I'm seriously doubting that my boss will have the balls to back me up when I implement new policies.

*  Thanks for all the great comments and support too!

**EDIT 2, cause this is buried in the comments**  I was originally hired by ""Old Boss"" who just recently left the company, and am now coming on with ""New Boss"" who is a technical n00b (I'm just now finding out) and just kind of fell in to the boss position.  I found out I'm making 3 times more than he is. He left his paycheck sitting out, no I wasn't snooping.  I'm sure this fact is not settling well with him.

**Final Edit, Until the Update in a Week or so**   Thanks so much, I didn't expect this to blow up this big, but I really appreciate the great advice and viewpoints on this issue.  Just got a call for another job interview 10 minutes ago.  Going in the morning (applied 2 months ago).  I promise to do an update on this and let ya know what's going on.  I really hope tomorrow goes well, so cross your fingers for me; because I don't want to have to deal with ""new boss"" and shitty situation.

2939ne,1,2014-06-25,I feel like I've lost my purpose and path.,justinhammerpants,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2939ne/i_feel_like_ive_lost_my_purpose_and_path/,"Am I meant to start this out with an intro/background? I suppose I could, it's certainly easier to do so to strangers on the internet than to anyone I know IRL.
I've always had a little bit of depression affecting me, even when I was a kid. During elementary I had friends, but I was still never the first one who was chosen or called when it came to playtime. I was the spare. The backup when no one else could come out. Moving on to jr.high, I figured out I was bisexual/pansexual, got a girlfriend, people at my school found out and I was basically cut off from everyone. (To the point where one day we were having a class meeting, and one of the girls raised their hand and, in front of everyone, asked if I could be banned from the girls locker rooms after PE because I was making everyone uncomfortable.) After that I had my first serious slam of depression that I clearly and vividly remember. I didn't go to school for over two weeks, and when I got back, I was asked if I had a nice vacation. (That was when I was about 14)
After all of that happened, I just started blocking everyone out, because I figured that it was better to cut people out and forget about them, because no matter what, they would probably end up hurting me and forgetting about me, so why bother in the first place? And this has stuck with me for a long, long time. I alienate others before they can do the same to me. 

I've tried to get over that. Tried to make friends and stick to it, but somehow I always end up as the back burner friend, and I'm sure I'm partially at fault for that. But that means I don't really have a support system to fall back on. I'm left all on my own.



So we cut to present day. Three weeks ago I returned home to Norway after a 16 month internship in the US. I had a wonderful time there, mostly because I was working full time, 40-60 hours a week, and on my time off, there was always something to do. Somewhere new to go explore, cheap movies (here movies go for about $23 dollars a pop, and no way to sneak into another), and just always something for me to do. And I had coworkers who, by proxy of working with me, spent time with me, and often we would go out to dinner after work etc. It was nice. I felt like I was finally making friends. And maybe they would stick!

But no. I came back and I am all but forgotten. Not for trying, I've sent message on FB and responded to snapchats etc. But it's always me asking how they are and what they are doing and what is happening there. I haven't once been asked how I am doing or what is new with me. 

I feel so useless, and like I don't have any purpose, so why bother with anything? I am actively trying to find a job, but there is very little available here, mostly telemarketing, and I don't feel comfortable with that. I tried going to the local volunteer centre so I could have something to do with my days, something to get me out of the house, but they're on summer holiday until mid-august. And so I don't know what to do with myself. I try to get out of bed and do something. I've been doing yard work quite a bit, but other than that, I don't know what to do with myself. 
I can barely even read right now, because my kindle died a week before I left from the US and I was too worried it wouldn't arrive in time to order a new one. I've been to the library, but they're on summer hours too, which means they're only open for about 4 hours a day, and their selection isn't too wide. On top of that, I'm trying to avoid spending money since I have no income, but it's hard. I don't know what to do to make myself feel useful anymore.


**TL;DR** Internship ended, and being unemployed is making me feel like a waste of space.  "
293djz,0,2014-06-25,Need help answering interview questions.,[deleted],AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/293djz/need_help_answering_interview_questions/,"Hi.  I'm a rencent masters graduate applying within the book publishing, magazine and journalism industry.  I've had several interviews the past two months (success! I finally mastered the cover letter) but have not been hired for any of the positions I interviewed for.  Obviously I need to work on my interview skills. 

Some background: I have an MFA in creative writing.  Some of the interviews have been for editorial positions, while others have been for more behind-the-scenes roles, such as PR, fundraising, outreach, and social media marketing. I haven experience in all of these through a magazine internship and through having started my own small press.

For the behind-the-secenes jobs I always get the following question:

1.""You DO know you won't be doing any creative writing in this position.  Would you be happy doing a job that isn't creative?""

In my mind I'm thinking, ""why did you ask me to this interview if my MFA displeases you?"" In all honestly I really would be happy doing these type of jobs.  In fact, I might even like them more because editing isn't all it's cracked up to be.  However the interviewer never seems to be satisfied with my answer.  This question has really been a stumbling block for me. I think some HR reps have a lot of preconceived notions about ""creative"" people, such as them being lackadaisical and disorganized, which I am not at all. I feel I have to break down a few stereotypes.

Other questions the answers to which interviewers seem not to be satisfied with:

2. How do you go about multi tasking and prioritizing your time?

I usually say I try balance my time evenly between long-term and short-term tasks, leaving time for both ongoing projects and things that need to be addressed right away. I then put forward the analogy that most people spend a majority of their time addressing short-term tasks and never get around to accomplishing the more long-term goals the set for themselves, such as writing a novel, which is why making time for both is important.  It's really easy to neglect the long term in favor of the concrete and immediate. I then turn the question back on them and ask them how they prioritize their time.   

3. Would you be comfortable using X, Y, and Z software ?

Sometime's it's something stupid like Excel (who doesn't know how to use Excel at this point?) but more often than not its something a little more sexy like Photoshop or InDesin.  I say I would be comfortable working with those applications. I talk about moments in the past where I had to use unfamiliar technology without any training. What more can I say?

4. How are you with meeting deadlines?

Great! Fabulous! The best! Probably better than you! I cite several examples of times I met deadlines in the past, such as during grad school, as a teacher (I taught middle school English for a year) and times during which I was a freelance writer.  Maybe they're just not convinced? 

Other problems may just be my overall demeanor and appearance. I don't get nervous during interviews.  So maybe I'm too laid back? 
Also, I'm blonde and have the unfortunate circumstance of having a baby face.  I look about 5 years younger than I am, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence in people. I've been so disillusioned from my previous interviews that I've actually been thinking of dying my hair brown and dressing differently so as to take on a more ""edgy"" appearance.  Maybe I'll get a wedge haircut like Suze Orman ;)

If anyone can provide me insight to these questions that would be great!

293gan,21,2014-06-25,[B/S] Having sex after a long day,[deleted],incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/293gan/bs_having_sex_after_a_long_day/,"It was a cold day and me and my sister had just returned from a long day of snowboarding in the Canadian backcountry, 
“That was a good day.” She said

“Indeed it was.” I replied 

We were in the car driving home, it was a long drive and so we talked about different thi9ngs ranging from politics to relationship advice (she was single and I was too so I don’t know why we talked about things like that). 
“So how did you last relationship end?”

“my boyfriend cheated on me” she replied

“Oh”

“So why aren’t you in a relationship” she asked?  

“I could never keep one. Every time I asked one of the girls out I was denied.” 

“Well.”

We drove the rest of the way home in silence after that awkward conversation. When we arrived home we had realized that it was only me and her in the house, on the counter were two bowls of pasta and a note, 

*your father and I have gone to a international summit in Toronto.* (we lived in Montreal)* we will be back tomorrow around noon. The pasta is for you two. Love mom and dad*

“Well this is news to me.” She said to me  

“Ya, they didn’t tell me that it was today, I thought that it was next week.”  

“So you knew about this.”

“Yes I did. Do you have a problem with it just being me and you in the house?”

“No.”

And with that we put our pastas in the microwave and sat down to eat, 

“So any plans for the night,” I asked her.

“Defiantly not, after the day we had. How about you?”

“I am just going to do some work.” (I was an intern at a IT company)

We finished our meals and I when to my room to work on a program for work and she went down into the basement to watch a movie. About an hour later she walked back up to her room and I didn’t hear her because I had some headphones on, a few moments later I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was my sister; she was in her green Victoria’s Secret Pushup bra and her pj’s,

“Uhh, why are you dressed like that?”
 
“I was wondering if you could give ma massage.”

“Ya sure, let me finish this line of code and ill be right over.”

“I’ll be waiting.”

This struck me as weird because we had always been very close but she had never acted like this around me. So when I had finished my line of code I walked over to my sister&lt;s bedroom and she had taken of her pj’s, so she was sitting in her matching green underwear. I had never seen my sister dress so sexy.  I was in euphoria. She looked at me and there was a long pause,

“what are you waiting for, give me a massage.” 

My mind was just frozen in the door; I didn’t know how to handle it. 

“Ok.”

I approached her and put my hand around her waist and she looked at me,

“That’s it.”

I messaged her back and then moved down to her legs and her thighs, she was enjoying it, making “Oooo”s and “oh that feels so good”, whenever  I applied some pressure. I kept doing this because she likes it.

“You have a nice ass, sis”

“Thanks, could you massage it for me.” 

“Sure.”

I started to massage her ass and I was trying to figure out what had changed and where it was leading. A few minutes later she asked me to stop and she rolled off her back and sat up to face me,

“I know that you are turned on” 

“Me. What. No, you are my sister for Christ sake”

I couldn’t finish my sentence because she had pounced on me and had knocked me onto my back,
“You are straddling me” I said 

“I know.”

 And with one swift movement she unbuckled my pants and pulled them off, my cock stood erect and ready for action,

“Ooo, you have a nice cock” she said as she moved down to it.

She started to tease it with her tongue before putting the entire thing in her mouth. It was my first time getting a blowjob so it felt great but I was worried about cumming to early and not getting to fuck her.

“Let’s Switch.”

“Okay.”

She rolled onto her back and I pulled off her panties in the same swift movement that I did. She let out a small gasp as I put my finger into her pussy. I fingered her for a few more minutes. 

“Let’s Fuck” She said 

I rolled onto my back and she climbed onto my cock, we started in cowgirl and then doggy style and then missionary. Halfway thought missionary I felt her body tens up as she came and then I felt the tingle in my legs and I was about to cum,

“Im going to cum!”

“Cum all over my face”, she jumped of the bed and knelt down in front of me. She started to suck me off and then she deep-throated me and I came deep into her throat.

“that felt so good” she said 
“Ya it did.”

She got up and walked to the door,

“Going to take a shower, do you want to join me?”

“Sure.”

We made each other cum multiple times in the shower.

**The End**

293gir,1,2014-06-25,How did you cope with being alone as a teenager?,-SorryAboutThis,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/293gir/how_did_you_cope_with_being_alone_as_a_teenager/,"I'm 18 I've been struggling with Body Dysmorphic Disorder for sometime now, alongside feelings of loneliness and occasional suicidal thoughts. Though these have been worries since the beginning of high-school(I'm a Sophomore at University now), they've been particularly intense this summer as I'm currently working an internship that keeps busy from 5am to about 5pm. Besides this I've never really gotten any girls besides some here-and-there sexual advances at Uni, mostly because I refuse to engage it the foul hook-up and douchey-bro culture that has cultivated in North Eastern US. 

Additionally, I quite frankly only have about two friends in my neighborhood with whom I keep in contact with - one of which I can sense harbors similar feelings and the other of which has recently acquired an off-putting ego. I have friends at Uni, but most live too far away for frequent visits - especially taking into consideration my work schedule. 

On the topic of work, I'm partners with this girl whom I don't believe fancies(&lt;&lt; UK people got me saying this) me as I do her. I don't despise her or anything like that just I'm sure you all know how hard it is to be in constant communication(we do ALL our work together) with someone for whom your feelings are not reciprocated. As an 18-year old in dire need of affection, it can get quite difficult. 

This is compounded by family issues that have resulted in me emotionally disassociating myself from my family - in one aspect because they’re all bordering primal in their tendencies to argue and shout incessantly, and they’ve never been the emotionally nourishing type. I can see your mental image of me taking form — a pudgy kid who smells rotten but is in denial — I ensure you that’s not the case. I’ve done almost everything I can to make myself an attractive candidate for friendship/relationships and even job/work. But I feel as if my life hasn’t improved as a result of these changes. 

Anyhow, most days see me waking up at five, commenting to NY and working till three, getting back home at five, and staying in my room with roughly assorted occupations - surfing the web and reddit of course. As time has gone along, it has cascaded into joining suicide websites and researching techniques to kill myself. This is only because I hate feeling so lonely all the time, working (essentially) alone. Coming home to nobody but an argumentative family, spending weekends by myself, yet having to put up with all the teeny-bopper relationship stuff propagating through Facebook and Shopping Malls. I used to never be affected by that because I’d alway think *I’ll find someone eventually*, but nobody is out there for me. 

Anyhow, how do anyone of your (teenagers) or did any of you put up with this at this age? Constantly bottling up feelings of hopelessness and anguish.. Only recently has suicide become not only viable, but welcoming to me. I’m afraid how my depressing childhood will affect my adulthood if I keep going on.. having to drag my sorrows around like heavy luggage whilst facing the already burdening challenges brought forth by adulthood. 

Anyone currently in a similar situation? How do you keep doing this?

293icw,1,2014-06-25,I've done everything right (mostly). Nothing is getting better.,margherite,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/293icw/ive_done_everything_right_mostly_nothing_is/,"I am 20/f, with a long history of mental illness. I'm will be a junior in college in the fall. Honors, staff writer for the campus paper. This summer I have a job at a bakery, a journalism internship, a family. I have a boyfriend who is the person I've connected with more than I ever thought I possibly could, and after this summer we are set to move in to an apartment near campus together. That upcoming move and that relationship has been my source of excitement and hope for the last months. Nothing has ever been so good for me as he has. And he's been the reason I've held on so long. See, he's been suicidal and diagnosed with MDD for a while now, and last summer was forcibly admitted into a psych ward because of alarming things said to his therapist. Things are looking up a lot for him now, though he struggles. Things are not looking up for me.

Six months ago roughly, I was admitted to a residential treatment facility a few states away for an eating disorder I've had since the age of 12-13, which affected me at varying levels of severity. For a bit of background, I have a very strange relationship with my mother, who is an alcoholic, probably a narcissist, who was extremely emotionally abusive during my childhood, and that relationship probably had a lot to do with sparking my disorders. Too long to explain her but just be assured, she is not healthy in any way. Things have been going downhill for me for years, but I always managed pretty well. I have had worsening depression and an anxiety disorder since early-mid teens, and began thinking about suicide more than is normal at a very early age. Before Christmas break (which was the month during which I spend my time at the residential center), I was a disaster. Living in a dorm, I slept about once every other night, binged and purged constantly, didn't go to class, didn't take my exams, slept odd hours during the day when I could sleep, and was so amazingly lost I would certainly have been admitted to a hospital if I had been home. 

Mid-October, I went to the emergency room for a stomach and esophageal problem (rupture) due to my bulimia. I went home for a few days, got in on some therapy, went back to school. Things got worse. I spent weeks in a stupor and daze, which is coming back now.  I bought bottles of painkillers and considered the best time, day and way to take them. I looked around my dorm for a good spot to tie a rope. My boyfriend found my pills in my purse, and took them from me. He's amazing--should mention that.

At the facility, things seemed a little more hopeful. I started taking an antidepressant and opened up a lot in therapy. I was in residential for three weeks and partial hospitalization for roughly one week. My insurance dropped me very suddenly and in the space of a half day I was discharged; on my way home the next afternoon. Things went bad about a month after I got home, and I stopped taking my antidepressant. Bad idea I know, and I don't really know why I did. Just didn't get it refilled. And actually never even received scripts from the nurse at the facility.

Began throwing up again. If this binge-purging had ever affected my weight in any way I would already be dead, as I wouldn't be able to take it, but I'm one of the lucky ones whose weight hasn't changed at all in my years of bulimia (my years of anorexia were a different story obviously). In early spring, my dad informed me that, though I was never ever alerted during my time in the facility, insurance was not covering me for the full 11 days I was in the facility after the start of the new year, and I now have a bill of about $7,000. Taking care of this has been terrible, as my again-untreated anxiety and depression have a nice way of making me unable to do anything. I called off work today because I just can't. I was scheduled for a doctor's appointment last week to get an appeal to insurance started, and skipped it because I didn't care. It's amazing to me that I've held on so long with work and interning and even managed to do a lot of cool stuff at my internship. But bad days are just taking over and nothing is working anymore.

I can't take care of this bill. I'm lying to everyone. I can't imagine how much longer I can keep up all these lies (I'm taking my meds, I'm doing fine, I'm not throwing up, I'm happy, I'm safe, I'm just tired, and I've been telling everyone these lies). I have been depressed so long; it sounds dramatic but I've thought since I was about 12 that I would kill myself at some point, and it has certainly looked that way up until now. I'm about set to try something. Today I've done nothing, like so many other days, but cry, binge/purge and think about all my safety points (ways to kill myself) throughout the house. Sharp knives, pills, gun in my dad's closet. It's very tempting and my family is going on vacation in a week. It seems perfect. Up until now I've relied on the responsibility to keep my boyfriend safe from himself in order to keep myself safe too; i know if I were to hurt myself he wouldn't be able to take it, and he's told me so in so many words. But it's too bad now. I just want to be done. It doesn't matter how supportive anyone is of me, because I just want to be finished with this stuff and that's it. I can't take the isolation and depression and anger and flatness anymore. Therapy I've done, treatment I've done, and nothing has worked. I need help."

Plus I'm leaving to go back home from an internship that I've been on for 6 months. Really difficult to stop when you are alone in an apartment. I will have summer school and be living at home for the rest of the summer so I will be busy. Plus having people around will keep my hands out of my pants.  I will not let my guard down. 

I'm expecting to start having wet dreams again soon because that happened often before I got addicted to fapping over two years ago. And whenever I would stop (best being a week) they would start coming again. Since my religion is against it, that is another reason I want to stop fapping. I first started because I was sick of wet dreams and then got addicted. Another reason is I want my life back because I waste some much time doing it.

293yx3,1,2014-06-25,Mobile: Critical Devices for Healthcare,Tigerspike,healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/293yx3/mobile_critical_devices_for_healthcare/,"Up to 70% of healthcare professionals in the U.S. are using mobile technology while providing patient care but most healthcare organisations do not have a mobile strategy.

Mobile devices have huge potential to improve processes, increase efficiencies, reduce costs and increase compliance. A report from GE this year, estimates that there could be up to US$63 billion worth of global savings in healthcare with a 1% reduction in system inefficiency.  Enter the mobile solution.

The main barrier to enterprise mobility in healthcare is security, especially surrounding the sensitive nature of patient information while accessing EMRs (electronic medical records).  However, staff are already accessing medical data and consulting their personal devices for information – and this is a far bigger security risk than the risk involved in implementing a mobile strategy. Data breaches in the U.S alone cost health organisations almost $7 billion per year and worldwide, 54% of healthcare organisations have a had a privacy/security issue in the past two years.  Without a strategy, healthcare organisations have no control over how staff access information and this $7 billion could be set to increase rapidly.  It seems that the risk of not having a mobile strategy is greater than the investment in one.

This article will review some case studies (NHS, UK and Mount Sinai, Canada) of how some health organisations have successfully implemented a mobile strategy as well as Tigerspike advice on the topic.  The question is; can you afford to not implement a strategy?

Mobile enterprise solutions can bring an abundance of benefits to staff, patients and organisations including improving workflow, enhancing collaboration and reducing paper use, making the healthcare industry more effective and efficient.  The User Experience is hugely important to ensure uptake in your mobile strategy through producing a solution which feels amazing to use while staying ahead in the technology landscape.

A well-designed mobile solution can determine the best treatment for the patient through accelerating the decision making process, reducing complexity and human error, thus empowering healthcare decision makers.

MOBILE SOLUTIONS:

Personal Media devices have enabled the growth of so many solutions for patients to monitor their health.  Take the latest announcement from Apple around the HealthKit tool for developers which will be implemented through iOS8.  It offers users a centralised hub for health and fitness motoring.

Scanadu have created a mobile scanner which can be linked to your smartphone.  It empowers the user to monitor their health but can also share that information with your doctor.  You can read more about wearable technology in healthcare on our wearable technology blog here.

At an enterprise level, the uptake of mobile solutions has not been so widespread.  For many hospitals, CoW’s (Computers on Wheels) are still seen as the sole mobile device solution of choice as there is still a fear of implementing a mobile solution or a monitored BYOD solution.  We’ve researched some forward thinking health organisations who are currently trialling mobile solutions which showcases how efficiency, employee engagement and patient satisfaction/health can be improved.

 The NHS, the world’s fifth largest employer, has been trialling some customised mobile solutions across the UK, recognising that these devices are primary vehicles for engagement.  One hospital in South Devon has developed an iPad system which runs VitalPAC.  This system monitors and analyses patients vital signs on tablets and supports staff in recording patient observations bedside, while also reminds staff to observe patients at regular intervals. This encourages staff to pick up on any change in patient’s vitals sooner enabling faster decision making, more accuracy and improving efficiency.

Another initiative in Leeds, from the NHS is the HSCIC which has deployed the iPhone 4s across the organisation after dissatisfaction with Symbian devices.  With built-in encryption, staff having iPhones means data is encrypted, reducing risk of unauthorised access and remote wiping of devices.  They are now considering the introduction of iPads.

 Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada has recently developed VitalHub, an iPhone app which gives physicians secure, remote access to patient records, test results, vital statistics and medical literature.  Overcoming the security issue, IT staff integrated the phones with the hospitals Microsoft Exchange Server while on the front end, password and VPN certificates ensure confidentiality.

Aside from using mobile devices in patient care, there are tremendous benefits for tablets to be used while training interns and residents. A recent study at the University of Chicago Medical Centre showed that interns and residents who were given tablets saved the equivalent of three hours per day and made fewer medication errors.  Relevant information can be accessed when needed on the go rather than consulting a CoW later on.  From a patient care perspective, tablets could be used in explaining procedures to patients, which are often not explained very well, causing confusion for patients.



SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS:

Tigerspike’s mission is to improve peoples lives through the power of personal media technology (mobile, tablet and connected devices), changing how people work and live.  Increased efficiency at work means employees can spend more time at home with their families.  Better informed patients and employees means healthier and happier patients and employees.

Tigerspike advise adopting a ‘launch and learn’ approach whereby you trial a solution in a small area of your business, gain feedback and release a widespread solution thereafter.  A centralised mobile solution will help your organisation maintain control of information that your staff access, improve pain points and  ultimately change the way staff work and interact with patients.

With regards security and integration with complex back end systems, Tigerspike has a multitude of experience in these areas and can offer advice to health organisations on mobile strategy. Some of our work in this space include companies such as Novartis, Merck Sharpe and Dohme, Kaiser Permanente and Resmed.

On the security front, Tigerspike have developed Karacell, a made-for-mobile encryption technology that addresses the issues of speed and power consumption.  In situations where organisations must still comply to government standards, an AES layer can be wrapped as a second layer around the inner Karacell layer, providing both the compliance of AES with the added security of Karacell.

We are hosting a number of events (from July), across our offices worldwide on the business imperative for investing in mobile and success stories from across the world.  This will be a cross-industry analysis so please do contact us should you be interested in attending"

The first time I came to this forum was July 2011, 2 months before University started and I had just gotten home from a party being demotivated how I couldn't get any action (me being a virgin and all, which looking back was the least of my worries). After that I became more engrossed in what the sidebar had to say and found the text liberating because I wasn't expressing my manhood properly - no sports, female friends who came to me cause I was easy to talk to, ashamed of who I was. I still have a lot to learn but I have definitely expanded out of my comfort zone and other people see it too. 

1) I stopped seeking approval of others
2) I stopped being toxic when I faced rejection in academics, internship opportunities, everything else essentially 
3) I started being honest with myself about my efforts and commitments to goals and people
4) I stopped stigmatizing sexuality - coming from a culture-oriented family this was a huge barrier, which ultimately helped me understand others better 5) I understood that some of the biggest barriers to success with women and life aren't external but internal obstructions

So tomorrow I will be celebrating with people I can genuinely say care about me and my friends at the club and want to thank-you for showing me what brotherhood (albeit through an online forum) could look like. It's my b-day but I will secretly treat it as a milestone. I still have a lot to learn but am confident I am treading the right path. 

Cheers!"

It's my first time posting here. This is also a throwaway because it's something I'd rather he (boyfriend [26M] not find out about, since he knows my actual reddit username.

Here's some light background information: We don't live together, but both of us want to. We have a great and healthy relationship. He graduated college 2 years ago and I'm still in school and working full time.

So here's my issue...

He can't find a job. He's pretty much been an intern since before graduation (he's fantastic at getting internships), and at all of these internships, his superiors offer letters of recommendation, keep an eye out for job openings/opportunities, etc. But none of them have hired him. He applies to jobs every single day, but nothing has ever come of the interviews he gets.

I was always the one who would say ""Hold out, something better must be coming,"" or ""Don't worry, there are plenty of other firms around here."" Once all of the in-state options were exhausted, it turned into ""Can you look out of state? There is WAY more opportunity in (fill in the city)."" After the umpteenth no-call-back though, I've lost most of my optimism. 

We're both ready to start our lives together, but that isn't going to happen unless he feels that he can support us. I used to get so excited at the thought of him going to interviews or getting some other opportunity to put a foot in the door somewhere, but now, when he tells me about these new things that are coming along, all I feel is exhaustion. 

I'm just really struggling with being the support he needs through this while not spiraling down, myself. I don't know if I'm looking for advice, or just to vent, but I needed to get it out somewhere.

---   

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend can't find a job, and I'm having trouble being the rock he needs to get through 2+ years of unemployment. "
294csa,2,2014-06-25,Is a masters in computer science from cal state school a bad idea?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/294csa/is_a_masters_in_computer_science_from_cal_state/,"Long story short,  I originally attended Cal Poly Pomona and started as a civil engineering major but didn't feel it was for me and wanted a challenge so I switched to aerospace engineering then eventually transferred to the university of Michigan (Ann Arbor).  I graduated two years ago with a GPA of 3.0 (my GPA from Pomona didn't transfer over). I struggled to get a job due to a mediocre GPA and lack of internship. Later I found this tragedy to be a blessing because now I'm pursuing my passion computer science (never had a passion in aerospace , I mostly did it for the challenge and because my father said I wasn't smart enough ).

Problem is I'm going to Cal State Fullerton which isn't a bad school but it's such a downgrade from U of M. I finished my first semester with a 4.0 (general programming and data structures while working part time).

My question to you all is do you think that it would be best for me to transfer to UCLA or San Jose State after I finish all the undergraduate Computer Science courses or should I be fine finishing in Fullerton? 

I would love to work in Silicon Valley and I want to make sure that I can do what it takes to get a job there. I really wish that I switched to computer science while at Michigan but that's in the past now. 

I actually wonder if my degree in aerospace from Michigan would help me a little or if it's worthless. Please let me know what you guys (and ladies ) think.

Thanks for taking the time to read this."
294dkt,9,2014-06-25,What is my life?,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/294dkt/what_is_my_life/,"I've been working on NoFap for over a year now. I started at the first of June in 2013. I've been watching porn and masturbating since I was 12, I believe. I was 18 when I started (19, almost 20, now), so I had over 6 years of pmo addiction to fight. I never knew I was addicted, but I always knew it was wrong. Last June, I finally admitted and began working on a change.

Before NoFap, I suffered from self-diagnosed social anxiety and depression. I never talked to my parents, or really anybody about this. My first year of college was over in May 2013, and while it wasn't that bad, it wasn't what I wanted. So what do I want? All I've ever wanted was to find the right girl, marry her, and never let her go. I don't care about getting laid, drinking, partying, or any of that. I don't need to succeed with every girl, just the right one. But that was never going to happen before I made a big change.

Last summer, I went from masturbating once or twice a day to every week or two. Days 9-14 were always super hard for me though, and I never made it past 15. But I started to see changes. The way I thought. The way I acted. Before, if I didn't know you well, I would talk to you a minimal amount. Today, I talked to the lady cutting my hair the entire time. Just nice small talk. But I never would have before. And I loved it.

I said many times, ""This is it. I'm never going to masturbate again."" But of course, I did. Many times I completely gave up on NoFap. This is my third reddit account since last summer when I started NoFap. I'm now on my best streak ever. Tomorrow will be 4 weeks. It feels like 4 years. I wish I could tell you that I found the secret to success, but it's really simple and I think most of you know what I'm about to tell you already. I've learned two things over the last 4 weeks. 1: You have to be 100% committed. If you're just 99% committed, you'll never make it to day 100. It's impossible. You can't stay in that state of mind where you hope that you make it longer than last time. Where you just hope you can stop masturbating. I've stopped hoping that I won't, and rather just stopped masturbating. Don't hope. Just do. 2: Edging is not allowed. Not even one stroke. I always fail by planning to just edge, but accidentally going all the way. But even if you don't have an orgasm, you're still staying the same state of mind as before. This attempt for me has been incredibly easier because I'm not edging like I used to. If you ever edge, even just a little bit, reset your counter and just stop edging.

Now I have an engineering internship at a large aerospace company and have to interact with different people all day every day. I never would have applied for this before NoFap. Now I'm talking to a great girl I go to college with, and things are looking bright for our future. I have a date with her next time I see her in July. My first date over 2 and a half years! I feel comfortable talking to her. I can talk to anyone about anything. I have no problem making speeches and giving presentations any more. I don't care what other people think anymore. I do and say what I want and move on with my life. I don't oogle every girl I see anymore. I am happy. Truly happy for the first time in my life.

Today I saw a music video with nudity in it. I normally don't watch music videos and had no idea this was even acceptable. I watched it for about 15 seconds and just closed the page. It disgusted me that this was just casually in a popular song's music video. Admittedly, it did turn me on and it was super hard to not masturbate, let alone edge, but I didn't. Before today I had no strong urges to masturbate. Because I told myself, I don't do that anymore. And I meant it.

I could never imagine being who I am today. A year ago when I started this, it was because I knew masturbation was wrong and it went against my religion. I didn't know how bad it was for you though. I'm getting in shape. I can talk to anyone. I have a great job, great friends, and a great potential girlfriend. One year. Not one year of failing though, one year of growing. Learning. Changing. That's what NoFap is. It's change. And change is hard. It's scary. If you mess up, that's ok. Just remember that one day you will make it. Things will be better. You can change."

294lbn,0,2014-06-26,How I quit Reddit and why I think it's a very toxic place.,DeltaEks,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/294lbn/how_i_quit_reddit_and_why_i_think_its_a_very/,"**TL;DR - I will be bolding the text I feel is most important to my story so all you lazies can follow along easier**

This is the first time I've logged in since **I forced myself off Reddit almost 3 months ago** due to it being a major distraction from the pressing responsibilities of my final semester of college. I have a rich history of addictive and obsessive behaviors (thankfully none of those are related to substance abuse), so I knew it was something I had to do in order to focus on the most difficult workload of my entire college experience.

**I've used self-control programs** and chrome extensions in the past for these kind of things, **but they have always failed me.** Mainly due to their intrusive behavior and slap-in-your-face attitude towards self-control. I always found myself deleting them after a few hours. However, **I figured out a way to monitor my own self-control: custom Ad-Block filters.** I set a custom filter for Reddit and other time-wasting sites that completely hid the main content section from view. This allowed my muscle memory of subconsciously typing ""reddit"" into the search bar every time I want an burst of dopamine satisfaction to be reprogrammed to a feeling of disappointment whenever I was met with a blank reddit page. **This was surprisingly effective**, because it was unobtrusive and it reminded me of why I was doing this in the first place. I feel that more self-control programs and extensions should take this approach.

**My absence from Reddit allowed me to reflect on my experience** as a Redditor and how it has effected my life. I originally joined 2 years ago to interact with the Team Fortress 2 community. I posted there exclusively for about 6 months, slowly learning the ropes of Reddit and eventually branching off into other subreddits. It wasn't long before **I understood out how to socially engineer my comments and posts to get the attention and response I desired** (something I've admittedly done in the past on other various online communities). I was drawn to this attention and I enjoyed being known in a community, people blatantly commenting to tell me how many upvotes they had given me (via an RES feature), **people respecting my opinions and backing me in arguments. These are all things I've never experienced to this extent** in the real world. These feelings drove me to the point where I would spend hours upon hours on Reddit, just trying to contribute as much as I could. There was a particular day during an internship at a web development company where I was being unsupervised, and instead of figuring out what I should be doing (I was one of those ""we don't have anything for this intern to do let's just give him odd jobs"" interns unfortunately) I spent literally all day on Reddit. My obsession was that bad. I'd be constantly stressing over what kinds of things I should be posting and whether people would hate me if I accidentally re-posted.

I guess you could say I was part of the outer ""hive-mind"" of reddit. Avoiding succumbing to the overused meme except when necessary to get the top comment. **Selling out to the community hive mind was a daily practice for me.** I was aware, but at the same time, I was being unaware of the actual effect it had on my thinking as well as the amount of productivity I was forfeiting. It's the same way how advertisements, press conferences and promotions try to manipulate the public's view of a certain idea or product. Reddit has always been based on a ""majority rules"" ruleset, and in the same way the majority mindset drives the content. If 75% of people on a subreddit are looking to bully people, it would be expected that a large majority of content would be geared towards bullying others and be further reinforced by the other members. Having seen the evolution of a few increasingly popular subreddits, mostly /r/smashbros and /r/tf2 (and also /r/notinteresting, because I remember when it was actually about things that were actually not interesting...), **the majority mindset continues to grow out of control and the minority becomes less and less vocal**. This might seem pretty obvious, but it is a crucial reason why I think Reddit is toxic.

Here's a list of the types of subreddits that I've come across:

* **Neutral** - the rare subs that actually work as intended, helping others and contain a rich community of independently-thinking members. (examples: /r/me_irl, self-help and/or depression help subs)
* **Monster** - The community is so huge that the content-submitting user base is primarily focused on trying to socially engineer their posts to gain the most pseudo-profit. (examples: /r/funny, we all know the rest)
* **Niche** - The topic of the subreddit is so specific that over time the content of the post usually circle-jerks around the topic itself creating an inescapable vacuum of inside jokes and memes. (examples: /r/notinteresting, /r/truetruetf2)
* **Elitist** - There is a large divide between the ""pros"" and the ""noobs"" creating a sense of entitlement for the pros that allow them to think highly of themselves. (examples: /r/buildapc, most competitive gaming subs)
* **Others** - These are ones that are hard to categorize because the status of the community is largely influenced by the community outside of reddit. (/r/mlp, sport-team subreddits, fan subreddits, many others)

Given this list, I'd go as far to say that all the categories here besides ""neutral"" and some ""others"" should be considered toxic. You know, while we're listing things, why don't I list things I hate most about the toxic parts of reddit (this is going a little off topic, but I'm in a ranting mood so deal with it!):

* Anything mentioning something even remotely close to the phrase ""Sir, you are a gentleman and a scholar""
* Negative votes on someone expressing a very valid opinion that the ""hive mind"" doesn't agree with followed by a string of circle-jerky comments.
* ""Follow the leader"" strings of comments (pun strings, fill-in-the-next-word strings, etc)
* A particular person in the community that is disliked and downvoted based on something they've done in the past regardless of how valid their current statement is (I understand why this is a reasonable response, but I still think it's immature).
* People jumping to conclusions on the character/orientation/gender/personality of a redditor based on 1 post that they don't agree with.
* People assuming their sarcasm is being understood without giving any indication or hint that it's sarcasm.
* I can't fucking tolerate memes anymore, sorry.

But anyway, **I don't care if you people enjoy Reddit.** I know I probably still would be enjoying Reddit right now if I didn't get addicted so easily. **I just want people to be aware of what goes on behind all the fun and enjoyment of Reddit.** Also, I forgot to mention a lot of my Reddit ""conditioning"" was during heavy phases of depression which I can happily say are getting much better after a few years of medication and therapy. Depression really messes with your brain, and I've had to give up a lot of things that are now considered to be triggers of my depressive past. I feel that Reddit, in some ways is one of those triggers, so this is farewell I guess.

Feel free to ask questions or whatever. I don't even know what kind of response I'll get from this, but I hope it was a good read regardless."
294n6l,2,2014-06-26,I'm just so tired.,Physii,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/294n6l/im_just_so_tired/,"Sorry for the massive wall of text I just don't know how to tell this otherwise.

Hey guys, I'm sure you get stories like this all the time but here goes, currently I am almost 21 with only 2 years college experience facing anxiety, depression and pessimism:
Throughout my whole life I felt that I wanted to do something important, leave something cool behind. I felt specifically drawn towards science and engineering. During high school I was always pressured to go to 'AP' Classes, I never could do it because I just couldn't meet up to the standards. I graduated taking only standard classes with a gpa of a 3.7. whilst my classmates with sports and other duties got 4.0's with ease. Then when it came time to pick colleges my family kinda pressured me but it was still my choice. I had a scholarship at the time so I went to the Catholic University of America. 

The first semester was great, met alot of nice people, got active on campus, grades were ok, next semester, roomate turns out to be a huge douche, have to keep finding places to study. At this point my grades were still good, just not as good as the first semester. Second Year, first semester, total clusterfuck. I had never procrastinated (over 15-20 min) ever in my life and it started to become a problem. I started procrastinating at this time because I was taking unbelievably hard courses that sophmores usually do not take. I was having anxiety because I noticed it took me really long times to get small assignments done. I went to ask the professor for help with classwork and he professionally told me to go fuck myself. So in short, anxiety slowed down work, classwork built up, started procrastinating uncontrollably, (it wasn't even fun, all I could think of was that I was wasting time whilst procras.). I got mostly C's and 2 F's. I hated myself unconditionally after this. Why couldn't I get better, why can't I be as productive as my classmates? 

I promised my mom at christmas time that I would do all I could to try to do better. Now it is most recent semester, it starts off ok, make A's first quarter, and right around midterms I just couldn't shake the feeling that I will never be as smart or as talented as my classmates. My work pace slowed down, and I took midterms, none of the info I studied applied to what was on it. I was devastated after I got another F for a quarter, I just couldn't handle it. I keep my folks informed on everything and it was just so hard talking to it about them. I went to seek psychological help. I had a hard time just finding a psychologist. He helped but I never felt better about the situation I'm in. He told me I'm depressed, and probably have been for a number of years without realizing it. We tried fighting the depression for a number of weeks to no avail, all I could ever think about in my free time was different ways to kill myself. I knew I didn't have the stomach to kill myself, it would devastate my family, but one night before finals week I decided I wanted to see if I could push myself. I trespassed onto a construction renovation project one rainy night on campus, climbed up on some scaffolding and see how high I could go. Obviously I didn't kill myself, I ended up being too scared to actually make the jump. I decided to tell my counselor on the note he doesn't tell my mom. (At this point I told her I felt suicidal but didn't want to act on it. If she knew she would shit bricks) The school pulls me out of classes literally during the first day of finals and sends me back home. They were cool about it, and didn't tell my mom. I was given a 'medical exemption' meaning my grades for this semester wouldn't count. Cool I guess. I decide to drop out of Catholic due to my decreasing success there. 

This was in mid May and now to the current time. My counselor told me I should consider looking for other psychologists in my area. My mom told me I could get an internship with her friend Dave who works for an building engineering firm. So I talked with my new psychologist after a few weeks and he told me that what I suffer from is 'learned pessimism' and that I should be taking steps to try to become an optimist. He recommended I read ""Learned Optimism"" by Martin E.P. Seligman. It's pretty decent so far, but since I'm out of college I want to do all I can to be more productive again. My plan for this summer was to go to community college for this year, then go to university in Pennsylvania, then switch my major to physics and master in engineering, Problem is i'm a perfectionist, I read slow, I work slow, all because I think I'll fuck up something along the way that I'll need to fix later. Interning isn't hard, it's just really hard to stay motivated sometimes. I have a guitar, never play it, have adobe flash, never use it. It's not even that I don't want to be productive, it almost feels like I can't be productive.

 During my time home I've learned to hate everything. I watch these faggots like PewdiePie, and rage that these fuckers didn't go to college or really do anything yet make millions. I learned I hate my government, because I made almost $1000 these past 3 weeks but they decided they wanted to take 20% of it to pay for shit that will probably be wasted. But what is the worst is that I'm starting to feel like I hate my family. I love them don't get me wrong, but I'm absolutely sick of them. This whole experience has decimated my faith in God, and they govern my life so I have to be exposed to 'the word of god' everywhere. I had the house to myself for a week, some disgusting house sparrows decided to roost in the neighbors drier vent. I killed them, and when I told her I killed them she got all mad because they're 'a creature of god' nevermind the fact that my stepdad is a hunter. My brother no longer respects me because I'm no longer in college, he thinks nothing I say is relevant and that I'm just some angry faggot trying to tell him what to do. He's a great kid, but he's spoiled, argues over every little fucking thing in life. What is worse is that I should be a functioning adult by now. I shouldn't be a depressed pessimist that finds it hard just to sit down and crack a book rather than be on the computer. I really wish I could really do anything, I just have no money of my own. 

So thats my long story, I know this isn't /r/getting_over_it but if you guys have any suggestions on how I can just be more productive that would be awesome. I'm currently taking vitamins B-complex and they help, but I just feel like I need a mental push."
294pgy,147,2014-06-26,"At Eighteen years old, I just fell for a classic murderer's trick.",tomtom547,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/294pgy/at_eighteen_years_old_i_just_fell_for_a_classic/,"It's the kind of thing they warn you about in schools. They tell you it over and over again, pound the information into your impressionable little skulls with an iron hammer. Apparently that nail wasn't long enough, because it just didn't get through to me.

Back story: Two days ago, after calling and talking to the same hiring manager for days, I manage to get a job interview for the next day. It's at a Ross, not a bad place to work, but almost three miles away. Now, I live in Florida, and have a physical disability called [McArdles disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_storage_disease_type_V) Not a fun situation to be walking that far in the 95* weather, but fuck it, I need a job.

So, I head out, everything's going fine, I get to the interview and I'm sweaty and out of breath. That ends up working in my favor, actually, as the employer seemed impressed I strived that much, just to make it there. The interview went fine, and I started back. Half way back, I feel like I'm going to pass out. My legs are heavy, I'm sunburned, I'm soaked in sweat, the bottle of water I had starting this journey had long since run empty, and I could feel blisters forming in my Polo boots.

That's when I see my saving grace. As I pass a fire station, a car pulls into a gravel pit thirty or so yards from me.

""Are you Tomtom547?"" A female voice called from the tan minivan, I could smell the McDolands from where I was standing. I tilt my head in confusion and nod a few times as I stop in my tracks ""Yeah..?"" I call back to her.

At this point, I had sweat in my eyes, so I couldn't really make her out until I got close to her minivan, and I could just feel the icy cold AC luring me in closer to what could have potentially been the death of me. She explains she's Kim, an intern at my mom's work. I vaguely remember the name, and in my state, I didn't really care if she was Hitler, she had AC and I was about to drop dead.

So, into the car I went. She seemed very happy about it all, to have picked me up. She drives me strait home, which  I found odd, as I hadn't told her where I lived. I thank her, step out of the car, and go inside.

"" 'Ey moms, Kim just drove me home."" Mom looks at me, confused. ""Kim? She lives an hour from here, how did she pick you up?"" 

At this point a flag goes off in my head, as Kim had told me she lived just down the street and around the corner. Not only that, the only Kim from my mother's work is a much older red headed lady who drives a blue SUV. This lady's hair was ghost white, and was maybe 30 or so.

As I run all the details by my mom, nothing's ringing a bell to her. I start getting nervous, being the paranoid, shooting-a-shotgun-since-ten, living in the woods, Florida boy I am. I make her call Kim. Nope, Kim has never met me, apparently.

So that's how I fell for a trick 10 year old kids are taught to avoid, which could have easily gotten me killed."

2955n4,1,2014-06-26,[HELP] Newly adopted dog - transitioning questions,pghjoe49,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/2955n4/help_newly_adopted_dog_transitioning_questions/,"Try to bear with me as this is kind of a long story:

-My friend Carly babysits for a woman named Judy. 

-Judy is a foster mom for autistic children.

-Judy has 2 dogs; (something) and Peanut.

-Both dogs are dachshunds. 

-Judy gets super stressed out from the everyday monotony that fostering entails and decides to take a two month vacation somewhere. I’m not sure what the details of it are. 

-She leaves the two dogs (I’m not sure where they stayed).

-She comes back (last Thursday/Friday) and the two dogs start fighting relentlessly, so much so that peanut ends up with quite a few cuts all over her body, and the puncture wound in her leg lead to her getting a cute little pink cast that she hates.

-The vet says that she needs to separate the two dogs or it will continue happening. 

-Judy decides to find a different home for peanut; my friend Carly takes her in the mean time.

-Carly asks me if I would like to adopt her; I oblige. 



So that’s what has lead up to this point. I now have peanut and I’m trying my best to take care of her. I’m a 21 year old college senior currently working an internship 40 hours a week. My problem is that peanut is acting super skiddish and it seems to me like she is depressed. She won’t eat her food (I actually picked up a can of wet food yesterday and she managed to eat it but I need to put it in front of her), she won’t go to the bathroom outside (she just sits in the grass and stares at me), and she has accidents when I crate her for the day. At first I thought maybe this was just how she is, but after calling Judy, she said that she acts like a normal hyper little dog (my brother actually has a long-haired dachshund as well, so I’m familiar with their personalities). Judy also said that her other dog is doing the same thing (accidents, not being herself, etc). Any time I take peanut out of her crate, she gets super excited and just wants to be held and petted, but will not eat or go to the bathroom. From what I have heard/read, it seems as if she is just really confused and is getting used to a new home, but being that I am a first time dog owner, I want to make sure that I am making this process as easy and painless as possible. I'm obviously no master of dog psychology, but it seems like she thinks i am going to leave her like her previous owner did. Peanut is 4, NOT spayed (something that will change if i keep her), and a long-haired female dachshund.

Can you guys give me some suggestions as to how to make her transition easier?

Also, I’m sure I’m missing some info, so if you have any questions, just ask!

I'm currently doing an internship for a company and they would require a better way of viewing who has what license for the software they use. 

I've never done this before, and am basically looking just for any pointers, or warning about what I should look out for in order to make it efficient and all that. 

I would like the server/or machine with just a simple program on it run a script to make their Licensing Software output a file and then create a web page with the data. Managed to make it do that on my computer, but I have no idea what to do next, how to make it be able accessible by other people (Windows network by the way) and refreshable. 

Absolutely any advice appreciated. 
Thank you!"
295fm0,3,2014-06-26,[UPDATE] Me [19 F] feeling like a failure in the eyes of my Dad [52 M]. Feeling suicidal.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/295fm0/update_me_19_f_feeling_like_a_failure_in_the_eyes/,"Update from http://redd.it/27q7u9

I always love reading people update old problems, so I thought I'd do the same with this post from a few weeks back.

First, I guess I should say that I feel TONS better! But I'm not 100% sure of where this frustration is coming from. I've been having terrible PMS recently, and it's been getting out of hand as of late. I normally have a full week of emotional turmoil before I actually get my period, and it used to come in moody phases where one day I would be very lusty, another very angry and mad, another apathetic, and then a few days of just straight up misery. In fact, it's gotten so bad that my friends in college would refer to these phases in numbers, and saying someone was ""in Phase 4"" meant they were incredibly sad.

But recently, phases 1-3 would last maybe one or two days total and then for 4 or 5 days straight I want to do nothing but cry. That's how I felt when I wrote the last post; usually there's at least some sort of uphill when I'm upset, but I was in such a dark and surreal place then.

So first thing's first. I'm going to the doctor's later this week to talk to her about maybe an anti-depressant and definitely birth control. My mom said that she would have bad PMSing too around my age to the point where she would have to be carried home. She also kinda self-diagnosed me with PMDD (Pre-Menstrual Dysfunctional Disorder), but we're going to confirm this with the doctor before making it a thing.

But all in all, I still need to understand that the feelings I felt when I was suicidal cannot all be blamed on PMS. I can't just blow them off and dismiss them. I've come to the conclusion that my dad is a narcissist and that nothing I could possibly do would make him feel proud of me. Heck, it was my brother's high school graduation yesterday, and he never once said congratulations to him or was excited to do anything that my brother wanted to do in celebration. He bemoaned going to my brother's favorite pizza place and was bitter the entire time.

Heck, after having those suicidal thoughts and explaining how depressed I was getting thinking about grades, my mom *explicitly* told my dad to never mention grades to me. What does he do? We all go out to Chili's for dinner, and mid-conversation he starts yelling at me about grades. In public. I just wanted to slap him then and there, but I didn't want to stoop to his level.

My mom has come to this conclusion that my dad superimposes his family onto my family. It's strange, but it actually works out to be true. My grandfather used to call my grandmother ""lazy"" and would blame her for making everyone in his family fat. And sure enough my dad does that to my mom now. One of my dad's brothers (family of 4 sons) had a mental breakdown when he went to Brown University and dropped out from stress. That's who I'm superimposed with. Another brother started at a government military job after graduating from MIT but left that due to stress as well and is now a high school computer science teacher; my dad sees him and sees nothing but failure, and unfortunately this is who my brother is superimposed with. My dad's brother is a researcher who travels all over the world and is very successful; we joke that this brother is superimposed with our dog since our dad *never* talks about him. Which is kind of ironic in a sad way.

So I'm taking comfort in the fact that my dad is going on a business trip to England that will last for a while after my brother and I both start college. He's leaving this Saturday morning, and we won't see him until Thanksgiving.

Someone on a recent post said something that really struck me. ""Family is earned. Just because you're related to them doesn't mean that they're family"", or something like that. My dad has never really been there for me, and ever instance of ""I'm so proud of you"" has been prompted by my mother's command. He was never really there for us when we were kids, and he sure hasn't been there for me as an adult.

My mom on the other hand has been nothing but supportive, and I realize now that the people she works with on a daily basis make it difficult for her to stay positive all the time, which is normal. She still has her moments when she vents her anger and frustration at my brother and I, but these are fewer and I think the fact that I was suicidal has made her a bit more...careful? at least until my dad leaves this Saturday. But overall, she's been nothing but protective of me towards dad. She gets excited when I tell her about my summer internship at a prestigious university while my dad gets upset because he thinks I'm not ""doing enough"".

But yeah. Moral of the story, I'm feeling better and not taking my dad's words to heart anymore. And my mom's awesome for having to put up with him.

---   
**tl;dr: I'm going to the doctor's to see if birth control or antidepressants are right for me. My dad's a narcisisst and I'm pretty much done trying to impress him. And meanwhile my mom's awesome.**"
295lk7,1,2014-06-26,Just broke up with my bf of 3 years. Just need help on moving on,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/295lk7/just_broke_up_with_my_bf_of_3_years_just_need/,"Last night I did it, but it had to be done. I should have done it a long time ago.

I dated the sweetest guy for 3 years. I mean rare species, he would never do anything to hurt anyone else, he is honest, faithful, loyal, hardworking. We started dating my junior year of college, and tbh, he was the president of the fraternity that my ex was in, so I think it started as more of a ""ah ha! look what I have now!"" type of thing. We are polar opposites. I am extremely outgoing, talkative, driven person. M is more reserved and relaxed and very quiet. Looking back at it now I can see that we probably were never compatible, I just trained my mind to think we were.

I genuinely had a good year with him. But after he graduated and moved back home (2 hours away from school) so began our long distance relationship. It was hard, really hard at first, but I gradually started getting used to it. Being on my own all the time, seeing him every other weekend. I wasn't happy because our relationship wasn't what it should be for two people in their young twenties who were ""in love"", but I let it go on. 

And so came law school, and I took the best option for me and moved to a school 6 hours away. It was the best decision of my life, but so our relationship became even more stretched. I realized that I, myself, was changing and he was staying the same. I was the one who couldn't call because I would be at the library all night, I was the one who couldn't text consistently because I had class and obligations. I was the one who was changing, and this brought with it a MASSIVE amount of guilt. Because, again, he is a SAINT. He is so sweet and always is there for me when I need him, but I felt that it was my fault that the relationship was failing, and tbh at this point my feelings for him had dwindled down to little-to-none.

I kept telling myself I was going to do it, just end it. It needed to be done probably a year ago, and it's not fair that I was wasting his time. He is young and needs the chance to be single and meet someone who is in love with him. I kept backing out, because I would hear his happy optimistic voice and tell myself ""I'll do it tomorrow"".. He came in to visit a couple weekends ago and that was when I realized I couldn't continue like this. Sex was torture, I faked enjoyment the whole time. Dinners were mostly silent. Free time was spent on our cell phones.

So last night was it, I couldn't handle it anymore. I finally did it. He took it well, because he is the best man I've ever met and able to handle anything. He didn't cry (I was sobbing) he didn't beg, he just said if this is what I want and if I am unhappy this is what needs to happen.

----

So here I am, trying not to cry at my internship, seeking your help. The guilt is still there, but it's not a heart break situation where I want to be with him and he doesn't... no it's not that at all. It's that I feel so incredibly bad for causing pain on another individual who has been so good to me. 

Also I'm scared. I'm alone now, and for some reason that makes me feel terrified. I don't have someone to rely on anymore, and I don't have someone to text my random thoughts. I have a void, but it's more like I have lost a best friend.

I was once told that when you truly find love, you find it because you weren't looking for it. Because you found a way to truly love yourself first, and you came across someone who truly loves you. Not that you were retaliating against an ex, or because you ""wanted a boyfriend"", but because you truly love who they are.

Do you guys have any advice on how to pick up where I am? How to stay positive and focus on myself? How to feel not-so-scared of being alone? I know this was long but if you are still reading this I truly thank you.

Long time no see! I missed you guys. I'm back with a short tale of confusion that will hopefully pique your interest. (I say that mostly because I wanted to use the word ""pique"". It's a fun word. Pique pique pique. Smock. Smock smock smock. Don't knock my smock or I'll clean your clock!)

*cough*

Anyway, a little background: I'm the customer support intern at a local cable company. We're not tech support per se, but we work closely with them. I work in a town about 15 miles away from my hometown, and this place is full of wonderful people. Just *amazing* human beings. Fantastic.

We've been doing some general housekeeping lately. Being an ISP that started in the days before GMail and Yahoo Mail, we used to provide email addresses. We no longer do this, and we're trying to phase existing accounts out, and convince people to use a different email service. As part of this process, we recently went through the CableCompany.org email addresses and deleted accounts that had not been used for more than 180 days. Most of these accounts had been inactive for far longer than that. I figured that, since logic would dictate that these people hadn't used these email addresses for years in some cases, this would be easy.

*derisive laugh*

Let me paint you a word picture.

[DS](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/28gld9/how_to_lose_employees_and_make_people_hate_you/) and I were sitting at the front desk, working hard. It was a gray day outside, and no one was very talkative. The skies reflected the darkness in my soul. All in all, it just wasn't a very cheerful environment. Then comes the call. I apprehensively pick up the phone, hoping it's just someone calling to ask about prices. I don't really want to deal with explaining to new customers that we're booked solid through the middle of next month.

&gt;""Thank you for calling Cable_Company!""

&gt;""Yes, my name is Customer-""

Ohhhhh man. I recognized the name. We had just deactivated a couple of her email accounts due to inactivity. Crap.

She continued:

&gt;""-and we have email accounts through you guys. We can't get into most of them, and my daughter just bought concert tickets and had them sent to one of the accounts we can't access.""

&gt;""What account specifically?""

&gt;""name@CableCompany.org.""

Yep. This was one that I myself had dealt with. Crap.

&gt;""I'm sorry, ma'am, but it looks like that account was deactivated due to inactivity. Tech support might be able to help you, but I doubt it.""

&gt;""...oh. Well, what about OtherName@CableCompany.org?""

&gt;""I'm showing that that account was shut off in 2011, after 259 days of inactivity.""

&gt;""Well, what are you going to do about it?""

wat

&gt;""Like I said, you can try calling tech support, but I don't know if they can help you.""

&gt;""We need these concert tickets!""

&gt;""Ma'am, the number for tech support is 555-5555. That's gonna be your best bet. I can't help you beyond that.""

&gt;""...well, they'd better be able to help.""

*click*

I had to sit there for a minute just processing it. What are the odds that they'd need that account so soon after we turned it off? And, more importantly, WHY did they send it to an account that hadn't been used for over 6 months? The mind fairly boggles.

TL;DR: They paved paradise and put up an ISP."

295zfz,19,2014-06-26,"Tilt Control, Winrates, and Mental Edges",Furples,poker,https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/295zfz/tilt_control_winrates_and_mental_edges/,"The company I work for has decided to continue paying their interns a lot of money without actually giving them anything to do. Until this changes, expect a post pretty much every day.
 
**Mental Game**
 
A lot of people seem to think that mental game is a secondary priority to your poker game. In my opinion, a mental game is *part* of ones holistic poker game. I'd rather stake a 3bb/100h winner that never tilts than a player who plays a 5bb/100h untilted game but also punts a buy-in once every other session. Think about it this way:
 
Most good players do small things to marginally increase their winrate. Opening the button for 2.5x is a good example. Would you lose a ton of money if you decided to 3x it instead? Not really. But you still 2.5x it because it's arguably optimal in most situations. Essentially, you are clawing for every big blind you can. But there's no point doing this if you're just going to punt it off needlessly.
 
Let's say you make a spewy call every 500 hands or so. Let's say it's on the river for 100bb. There is 50bb in the pot and your opponent pots it for another 50bb. Assume it's a scenario where you absolutely know you're beat. If you bothered to do range analysis you would figure out you have ~15% equity against his range. But sometimes you tilt and call. This could be for any number of reasons:
 

1) You're mad at a disgusting run-out (JJ on J6789)

2) You're mad that somehow your fishy villain picked up a hand again

3) You're just tired so ""fuck it I call""

 
So you call the 50bb, either fully aware or in denial of the 15% equity. We can do math to see how this type of call affects your winrate.
 
EV of calling:
 
(15%)(100bb) + (85%)(-50bb) = -27.5bb
 
EV of folding:
 
0 (because the money you already invested is considered a sunk cost)
 
So basically you're losing an extra 27.5bb when tilt causes you to call in this spot. If this spot comes up once every 500 hands (~2 hours of 4-tabling), then it will lower your winrate by:
 
(27.5/100)(500) = (27.5/5) = 5.5 bb/100h
 
That's more than a dent in your winrate. For most winning players, that IS your winrate. You might think the 15% equity is extreme, but spots like this do occur. When you know you crush a fish's range on every street until he raises the river, for example. You have virtually no equity and you're not happy about it. But you call anyway.
 
**Tilt is an Edge**
 
I think this idea has improved my mental game the most. Poker players are competetive, which is why many of us study so much to improve. Part of our edge comes from exploiting bad players at the table (isolating fish, folding to nits, bluff-catching maniacs, etc). These opponents have a skill level (well, kind of), and we also have a skill level. Our edge comes from the difference between the relative skill levels. But what people fail to realize is that you can also push a mental game edge. If you tilt significantly less than everyone else, then you will make more money than your skill level edge would normally allow you to. Let's say that at a 6max table against some weak opponents, you would usually win 7bb/100h when everyone is playing their standard, non-tilted game. If you tilt less than the other 5 players, your winrate could increase to 8 or 9 bb/100h, depending on how spewy their tilt is. In other words, tilt control isn't just about not losing money, it's actually about winning more money.
 
Your skill edge derives from the idea that you would play your opponent's hands better than they do.
 
Your mental edge derives from the idea that you would tilt less than your opponent when put in the same situation.
 
ex: Your opponent open-limps aces to disguise their hand. They see a flop 6 ways and lose a big pot. You would have played their hand better (hence skill edge). The next hand, your opponent loses an 80/20 AIPF to runner runner. He proceeds to tilt off 50bb shortly after. In your opponent's position, you would have shrugged at the 80/20 loss and your play wouldn't change (hence mental edge).

Background: I am an IT Service Desk intern working for a large multi-LOB corporation on the West Coast. I've been working here for almost a year and basically do everything that the other Service Desk admins do, except for accessing applications that have sensitive personal information in them because the word ""intern"" prevents me from doing so.

The other day, my girlfriend had a great story to tell me. GF for short.

GF: ""Hey, beyondinsanity, you'd love to hear what my grandparents did.""

Me: ""What do you mean?""

GF: ""It's their computer. You see, they were having problems with popups so they called a support company and bought their software...""

*blood pressure begins to rise*

GF: ""Then, they set up the software and used it to back up their PC.""

*highly doubting that this was done correctly and that the software was legit*

GF: ""Then, they had another company work with them. This guy named John from Florida went onto their computer and tried to help them remove their viruses and other stuff. He was on the PC for 2 days before he was disconnected, and then they got a phone call from a lady at the company. She was hard to understand, and my grandparents were mad that they were not doing anything correctly, so they didn't let them back on.""

*blood is boiling*

GF: ""The PC is in Arizona, so you can't really help them until they get back and then you can go on the PC.""

At this point, my GF sees the look on my face.

Me: ""Have they changed every password they have?""

GF: ""No, why? They wouldn't like doing that, that's a lot to remember...""

Me: ""Well, considering they are millionaires and have all of their important documents on that PC, it might be a good idea.""

And my girlfriend and her family still don't understand why that might be a good idea. I don't think John/Ramesh from Florida/India did what they thought he did.

I get to talk to her grandparents in person within a few weeks."

Some background info:
I'm a Junior level CS student in the Bay Area.    I have a pretty good grasp on good code design as well as data structures and algorithms.  My education has been in Java, but I am self taught in other languages and technologies.  My goal is to be employed as a software engineer when I graduate.  I want an internship to further my knowledge in the software design process and learn what it's like to work in an office setting.  Also, I'm interested in both front end and back end work.

This is my first internship, and I'm extremely underwhelmed.  The job title is HTML5 Mobile Web Development Intern. What I'm actually doing is making HTML5 animations.  They have myself and two other interns making these animations, no one else in the office is working on this project.  I have been trying to make the most of this and code as much as possible.  There is no guidance, just make something configurable and responsive.  The two other interns are using a Adobe Edge to accomplish this.  I opted to learn and use javascript canvas.  I created a cool particle system, but was told to not do that.  I hated it the 2nd day I was here, but have stayed to see if it would get better. It has not.  The rest of the office is working on a different project which I've inquired about but that led nowhere.

TL;DR
I don't want to be doing this internship.  I feel as if I could be learning more on my own about what I want to be doing with regards to programming.  The pay is 500$ a month but I'm working 40-45 hours a week.  I think I'm doing myself a disservice being here.  There is no guidance, and the stuff I am working on I'm not necessarily interested in.  The only reason I'm considering staying is to have something on my resume and the 3-4$ an hour I'm making.

So should I stay, or should I go?

I responded, playing up my very very mild experience and they replied almost immediately offering me an interview next week. After some research I realised the job involved a lot know-how and IT expertise than I previously thought, and I now feel very out of my depth.

The role is within a start-up so I'm concerned they might not even really know what the job entails, particularly as they seem to have a very small staff at the moment.

I am happy to read up on the role, and if I did get it I'd make sure I did the job well, however I am a complete newbie in this area and I don't want to get there and have wasted my time travelling to the interview (it is a long commute into the city) as well as their time interviewing me.

Should I brush up and try and pretend I know more than I do? Or should I go in, as I am, and tell them I'm not an expert but I'm willing to learn?"

I am interested in nothing, and I have no motivation to do anything whatsoever. On top of that I'm very bad with people, since highschool I've been afraid of interacting with new people, I'm very bad at making friends. And the only friends I have left are my middle school/highschool friends who don't get to be around me very often. I can't finish things, I've started my studies over 3 times, and I've given up 3 times. This year I was 2 weeks away from my first diploma, and I ran away from my responsabilities, lied to my family, and went missing from my school and my friends there. I am very ashamed of how I am and of all my lies that cover it up and I think about it all the time everyday, at every second I'm afraid that I'm going to be found out. When people find out, I cut all ties, and I disapear, they insist for some time, calling me and even ringing my doorbell, but after a while they just give up. That's the way I've lost almost all my friends. I've been in love with a girl since I was 13, we got together when we were 18 and we only broke up a few months ago, this winter. She is a very driven person, who loves what she does and is very very invested in her work and studies. And in the end she couldn't stay in love with someone like me so she broke up with me. With her I had something to look forward to, it was worth it to be unhappy if I got to see her every other week end (she is studying abroad). Now that I am alone, and I don't have her to think about for the first time in almost 10 years, I'm put in front of who I am and it's like nothing makes it worth it. I'm in an internship right now that people from my now former school would love to get, but I just don't care. I've had thoughts about suicide before, but since the break up it's been getting worse and worse. And now I'm at an all time low. I don't know what to do right now, everything seems pointless, there is nothing for me to look forward to, that would make it worth it to be bored and pretend I care about the things I do. Something that's been stopping me is my family, thinking about my mother and brothers finding out makes me cry and I cry for a long time. I've most often thought about others before myself because I dispise myself, but for once I'd like to do something for myself only. Right now I feel like suicide would be that something. And at the same time I'm telling myself I'm stupid to even consider suicide, that I'm just lazy and don't want to face my responsabilities. That's pretty much how I feel, thanks for reading."
296i72,2,2014-06-26,"Parents want me to do one thing, every other person tells me otherwise.",InfamousCthulu,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/296i72/parents_want_me_to_do_one_thing_every_other/,"This August begins my senior year, and I was lucky enough to receive an internship at [Caterpillar Incorporated](http://www.cat.com/). That being said, I started at kmart back in April.

How the internship at Caterpillar works, I go to school for 4 hours a day or so and I work at caterpillar for 3-4 hours a day as well. This will put me around 3-4pm when I'm done.

My parents however want me to keep my job at kmart, caterpillar, and increase my GPA this year by a few decimal points.

I don't feel like I can do all of that and I'd be perfectly content with caterpillar and school, after all, that will open a TON of doors and opportunities. 

Another thing my parents are worried about is my previous job record, I worked at a full time job 3-11pm 5 days a week and it made me depressed, so I only made it 6-8 weeks of that in the summer. Following that I worked at a restaurant again, hated that, probably about 10 weeks total of working there. 

I didn't have a job again (due to the market), until this April at kmart. 

Now they're worried anytime someone looks at my resume they're going to think I'll quit on them in some time, that being said I hardly put the restaurant I worked at on my resume, along with that putting caterpillar for a year looks amazing.

I'm hoping that caterpillar will keep me longer than the internship requires as well, which is a possibility as they're only hiring me because the intern before is going to college and they need to replace him.

The fact that I don't think I can balance it is my push factor, but I'm wondering if you think me quitting kmart for caterpillar will really hurt me that bad in the future?

Please respond with any advice or questions you have."
296jil,5,2014-06-26,"Big 4 audit, considering tax, with some additional, unique details that make the post somewhat different than all the others.",aright-aright-aright,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/296jil/big_4_audit_considering_tax_with_some_additional/,"Hey /r/accounting!

I hope this doesn't become too long-winded. I'm an intern this summer with a Big 4 firm in audit. Started the first few days of June. I basically chose audit because of research pointing me in the direction of better exit opps (into something perhaps less strictly accounting), team environment, and everyone seemingly hating tax. This was all before I had taken a tax or auditing class. Now I've taken one audit and two tax.

Additional note that is very critical to my thoughts here, I am very strongly attracted to entrepreneurship. My family had a small business growing up, and I'd love to not only be a small business owner myself, but to help other ones. This, along with enjoying my tax classes, have made me strongly consider starting my own accounting/tax practice in the future, a thought that was always merely in the back of my head. I'm not sure if the tax classes will be anything like the work done, but I enjoyed them for what its worth. The thought of working for just myself and family and helping others doing the same is extremely appealing, even though I know first hand it is not without its challenges.

A few weeks into my internship, my thoughts are these: the traveling to clients is quite annoying when living in a big city where traffic and urban living make it extremely annoying and time consuming to drive places, expensive to park, etc. This makes the idea of just going to office (10 min train ride to the office vs 1 hr+ drive to the suburbs) extremely appealing, not to mention not having the hassles of owning a car in a major city. Secondly, I'm not sure if its just summer time slowness or these particular clients, but as far as the team environment goes, its been either me and one other associate/senior or me and two others. Maybe I'm naive for thinking it would be different, but theres not a whole lot of communicating about the work we're doing and more just 2-3 people in a room at the same time.

Now, I know if I do decide to start my own practice, obviously the Tax experience would serve me slightly better. But I also would imagine the type of work is probably very, very dissimilar from F500 companies to small businesses and individuals so I'm not sure exactly how much better Tax would be over audit. Plus, if I'm only staying for a few years, I'm sure having the B4 audit experience wouldn't exactly be a hindrance and then I'd have more exit opps for a back up plan if I decide against my own practice (which to be frank seems unlikely). 

Basically, I'm not sure if I have a precise question or more just thoughts that I'd like feedback on from you more experienced folks, but if I had to pick questions they'd be something like: In my situation, where I'm strongly considering starting my own practice, am I much better served doing B4 Tax instead of Audit? Or are both of them so different from small business tax and accounting that I might as well stick with audit for the back up plan exit opps? I'm a little nervous about the idea of switching to Tax because I know much less about the work environment (such as typical hours, when busy season is, etc), so if anyone had first hand info on that I'd love it. I'd hate to switch to Tax only to have even worse hours than audit does lol. Also, if I do decide to try for this switch, should I do it before/during/after receiving my (presumed) FT offer?

The lack of travel for Tax in this city is a biiiig plus to me, but I'm willing to do what is overall best for my career outlook, which will likely be self employment but could be a more ""typical"" exit opp. I like to have options because life is unpredictable, but I also like to set a goal and put everything towards it.

Thank you so very much to whomever of you take the time to read this whole thing! Much much appreciated!"

My issue is that I have had virtually no experience with Access before, and I am having a hard time finding good resources online for how to interface with VBA.

Almost everything I would like to do simply involves, opening an Access database, running a query (sometimes one which requires a form), and copying the resulting DataSheet to a specific Excel sheet for further analysis.

296nhs,2,2014-06-26,I [23/f] broke up with my bf [25/m] of three years last night. I need help getting over the fear of being single.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/296nhs/i_23f_broke_up_with_my_bf_25m_of_three_years_last/,"Last night I did it, but it had to be done. I should have done it a long time ago. I dated the sweetest guy for 3 years. I mean rare species, he would never do anything to hurt anyone else, he is honest, faithful, loyal, hardworking. We started dating my junior year of college, and tbh, he was the president of the fraternity that my ex was in, so I think it started as more of a ""ah ha! look what I have now!"" type of thing. We are polar opposites. I am extremely outgoing, talkative, driven person. M is more reserved and relaxed and very quiet. Looking back at it now I can see that we probably were never compatible, I just trained my mind to think we were. I genuinely had a good year with him. But after he graduated and moved back home (2 hours away from school) so began our long distance relationship. 

It was hard, really hard at first, but I gradually started getting used to it. Being on my own all the time, seeing him every other weekend. I wasn't happy because our relationship wasn't what it should be for two people in their young twenties who were ""in love"", but I let it go on. And so came law school, and I took the best option for me and moved to a school 6 hours away. It was the best decision of my life, but so our relationship became even more stretched. I realized that I, myself, was changing and he was staying the same. I was the one who couldn't call because I would be at the library all night, I was the one who couldn't text consistently because I had class and obligations. I was the one who was changing, and this brought with it a MASSIVE amount of guilt. Because, again, he is a SAINT. He is so sweet and always is there for me when I need him, but I felt that it was my fault that the relationship was failing, and tbh at this point my feelings for him had dwindled down to little-to-none. I kept telling myself I was going to do it, just end it. 

It needed to be done probably a year ago, and it's not fair that I was wasting his time. He is young and needs the chance to be single and meet someone who is in love with him. I kept backing out, because I would hear his happy optimistic voice and tell myself ""I'll do it tomorrow"".. He came in to visit a couple weekends ago and that was when I realized I couldn't continue like this. Sex was torture, I faked enjoyment the whole time. Dinners were mostly silent. Free time was spent on our cell phones. 

So last night was it, I couldn't handle it anymore. I finally did it. He took it well, because he is the best man I've ever met and able to handle anything. He didn't cry (I was sobbing) he didn't beg, he just said if this is what I want and if I am unhappy this is what needs to happen. 
---

So here I am, trying not to cry at my internship, seeking your help. The guilt is still there, but it's not a heart break situation where I want to be with him and he doesn't... no it's not that at all. It's that I feel so incredibly bad for causing pain on another individual who has been so good to me. Also I'm scared. I'm alone now, and for some reason that makes me feel terrified. I don't have someone to rely on anymore, and I don't have someone to text my random thoughts. I have a void, but it's more like I have lost a best friend. I was once told that when you truly find love, you find it because you weren't looking for it. Because you found a way to truly love yourself first, and you came across someone who truly loves you. Not that you were retaliating against an ex, or because you ""wanted a boyfriend"", but because you truly love who they are. Do you guys have any advice on how to pick up where I am? How to stay positive and focus on myself? How to feel not-so-scared of being alone? I know this was long but if you are still reading this I truly thank you. B





TLDR: Bf and I dated for 3 years, both on different paths in life, feelings dwlindled, I let it drag on too long... finally ended it. Scared to be single, feeling serious guilt about hurting him."

But the problem is that I can only go there twice a week, Mondays and Wednesdays. Since i'm juggling an internship, college, and work on the other days. And they spar on Tuesdays, Thursdays and they said they might start Saturdays. So the only way I can start sparring is to wait for my summer college term to end and then reschedule my internship to free up my schedule for the sparring days. But i wanted to start fighting amateur within a year, and my summer term wont end for another 2 months. Will this really hurt my training? Not being able to spar for so long?

Note: This r4r is a mammoth insight into what goes on when a person who works long hours does when he gets bored in his free time. If you don't like reading a lot feel free to go browse the other male r4rs filled with incorrect grammar and multiple uses of the word ""YOLO"". I'm sure the borderline retardation and personality disorders will be a lot more entertaining in the long run.

Anyways, I'm a fairly laid back person. I like to live life as easily as possible while still keeping things fun and interesting. With how busy my work schedule can be, I'm not the average 21 year old. I do go out and have fun on my off time usually, but I cannot stand clubs or dicey bars. I would rather spend a night in reading or playing video games than going into a club or bar with as much room to move as a garbage compactor and listen to the buzzing and thumping ring in my ears for the next 3 days.

I value the little things in life over most other larger things, such as being able to put a smile on someone's face, an unexpected surprise, a day of to relax, and dance fights against the Sharks with my buddies the Jets. I love to travel whenever I get the chance, and one day hope to see Europe.

I could care less about keeping up to date on silly things such as fashion, politics, what hit single is out on the air, or what the Kardashians are up to. I don't mind someone who likes to treat themselves, but materialism is funny to me. It won't matter when you die (unless you get one of those sweet KISS Caskets), especially with my upcoming motorcycle jump over 15 flaming trash cans. So, the closest I can come to materialism is buying denim jeans to keep from a firey death to my calves, and to replace my normal short-shorts and tank top riding ensemble (it's to reduce wind resistance, I swear).

When it comes to dating and relationships, the most important things to me are communication, affection, and a very open sense of humor. I make plenty of terrible jokes, and can find something to laugh about in almost any situation, though I do know when to calm down and be serious. My sense of humor knows no bounds, and so I expect a match to be able to enjoy it as well or at least be understanding about it. For communication, I am not the kind to text 10 times an hour until you reply; I'm not a stalker. But, I am not the kind who is okay with going days without talking to someone I'm seeing. I like to talk as much as possible, but am understanding that it can't be all day, every day. And, like I said I love affection, I am not talking dry-humping in the mall, but if you aren't comfortable with any form of affection around other people (such as holding hands or a kiss every now and then) then you might as well stop here. I might sound picky, but truthfully I'm at the part in my life where I've had plenty of dating experience and am tired of selling myself short by stopping things I like doing because a partner doesn't like it.

I'm trying to find happiness, not make myself miserable with a partner for the rest of my life.

I'm currently studying biochemistry in university with aspirations to become a podiatric surgeon. My top choice for podiatry school is Temple.

I'm also conducting research at UPenn's medical school over the summer as part of an internship program and would love to meet new people during my stay in Philly!

I am also currently the reigning champion of the Artic Circle, having wrestled the Polar Bear King into submission, demanding the forfeiture of his kingdom. Though, it's more of a proxy position, most of the bears seem to think they're actually part of an Autonomous Collective. So, I'm trying to find a queen who's equally trained in fighting talking bears ruling an Autocratic Theocracy (Apparently all Polar Bears are Orthodox Catholic, never would have guessed!). Though, I will accept experience with fighting bears ruling in Democratic Positions or Oligarchies.

You're wildly quiet.

You wish you had a swivelly owl head. Me too!

You would really like to go hot-air ballooning but you feel a picnic at zero meters above sea level would be more appropriate. For now.

You make up words a lot and have some jumble to mumble. I want to understand you.

You managed to make it this far without thinking I'm functionally retarded.

You actually read through most of my r4r, or at least skimmed through the buzzwords and ignored the facetious drunken slurs.

You like scrapple.

You have a weird obsession with watching Russian car crash videos on YouTube, too (""Yakety Sax"" as a soundtrack is optional but highly recommended).

You aren't easily offended and have a decent sense of humor.

You don't have any ex boyfriend drama. I understand some of it comes with the territory. But if I wanted to hear about shitty excuses for ex's all day I'd watch Maury.

You can write more than ""Hey"" or ""I like your r4r."" for a first message or reply. Yes ladies, guys get that annoying shit too.

You think you can beat me in a hardcore game of Pictionary or Checkers.

Your have pictures of yourself that aren't all run through a gauntlet of Photoshop and Instagram filters. I will send you my pictures in a private message if you're interested. After all, this is a dating subreddit, not an art show for the world's laziest photographers.

-Currently interning at hewlett packard as a software engineer (for the summer)
 -4 years of being on a first tech challenge robotics team in high school, went to national championships twice 
-Will maybe have another prestigious internship under my belt at the time that I apply 
-Spent a year on my current schools mars rover robotics team (competing in the university rover challenge) 
-various other coding / programming side projects (don't know how much this matters)

I can get excellent letters of recommendation from my teachers, and employers (if your allowed to get them from employers. My concerns are however that I am applying from out of state. Also, at the time I apply, I will have a little over 70 sem hours of credit from my current school(im assuming its not all transferrable though), but A good chunk of this is from a community college in portland oregon, so Im hoping those wont transfer either."

Anyway, so I recently graduated from college (about year now), 22 yrs old and landed an OK paying full-time, 9-5 job. It’s boring as hell and I’ve been applying to other places wih no luck, and  I’ve grown really dismissive about reality to the point that I get into depressive/immobile states.  My loneliness definitely stems, in part, from the fact that I’m no longer in college with a group of friends and/or have the ability to seek out that thrill of meeting a new guy in class that I could maybe have a relationship with (wishful thinking) . But also, my loneliness comes from the fact that I know I’m gay, maybe I’ll hook up with girls when I’m drunk but to be frank, my dick gets hard for guys and it has since puberty so I know what I am and I know that deepening but strangely envious feeling for a guy you get when you have a crush.

Anway, over this past year of living on my own like a grown-ass adult, my sense of loneliness has sunk in more, but I have been able to overcome it by working out, reading and hanging out with some friends and family.  I was doing well distracting myself as best I could, but then, an intern started working in my department, who’s going to be a senior in college. I’ve engegaged him but I know it’s all illusions of grandeur and I can’t really befriend him like I could do with a guy in college. I feel a closeness with him but I don’t trust my instincts because I know I’m probably making overexcited connections like oh he leaned over me on my desk, he patted me on the back that’s physical contact so he must like me…chances are (the office rumor is) he blazes before work (objectively thinking about his behavior leads me to the same conclusion) He’s a fratbrah, with all his boys in other departments interning and they all go out to lunch together,. So it can’t be guinie affection., right? He’s probably as straight  as a laser pointer (best simile I could think of atm). He laughs at things I say but I don’t know if he’s just being polite since he’s the intern. Also, I’ve opened up to him to see if he’d do the same. I didn’t divulge everything about my life but enough to get him to say more. So I felt comfortable enough to give him my number to hang out any time in my town since my town got some bars and shit to do, we both like the same music, do the same drugs (MDMA, acid, weed—though I seldom do it now out of college, if at all) and he’s basically the same age as me. After giving him my number, he never texted me to say like hey here’s mine, probably lost the note or threw it out and thought like wtf  or maybe he thought it was inappropriate for him to contact me? In my approach so far, I feel like I’m being obsessive, but no one in department is my age, everyone is 27 years old plus and all married, or engaged and I’m beginning to realize that any opportunity to actually hang out with this guy is closing out. Part of me just wants a friend my age that I can do shit with but also a friend that could maybe, just maybe be a little bit more or experiement with……God, I hate this….

I had my most recent breakdown when I got home from work today—couldn’t move, just sat there and just started crying uncontrollably. I hate this empty, cold and lost feeling. I want to feel at “home,” I want to be with someone and feel comfortable, at last. Not just rotting away in a cubicle, waiting for the light to finally shine through the shadow. Again some of my issue is that my job is miserable and I have a lot career anxiety, but also this unattainable love and sense of being trapped in lonileness scares me. Once summer is over, I’ll never see this intern again, and……fuck, idk what to do. Should I friend him on social media? I’m also not “out” but as an introverted/laid back (or so I appear to be) guy, the whole coming out and look at me thing, is not for me, no offense. Anyway, I appreciate the feedback, hopefully this makes sense, but just writing this helped…..


**UPDATE: Thanks dudes for the advice, sorry been out of town for a while and haven't had time to check...I think I'm definitely making it out to be something that's not really there. Sometimes you just need to hear it from an unbiased 3rd person pov to realize it.**

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this, but here goes:

I moved to Sacramento a month ago for a full-time paid internship, but I have a dilemma with my roommate.  She's an absolutely wonderful and considerate roommate; however, she's allergic to cats so I've been having to keep my cat at my boyfriend's place an hour away. Unfortunately though, my boyfriend is unexpectedly having to move, and my cat will now have nowhere to stay but with me. (Giving her away is not an option as I am quite emotionally attached to her, haha.) 


So my question is, would anyone be willing to either A) Swap apartments with me if your current roommate doesn't mind cats, B) Let me and my cat move in with you, or C) Replace me in my roommate's apartment if I find somewhere else to live with my cat??

-21 year old female college student living in Sacramento to work a full-time software engineering internship in the area until December

-I have a cat - she's short haired, calico, indoor, spayed, about 1 year old, and super sweet

-I love running, exploring, healthy eating, and all things health-related

-I also spend a good portion of my free time sitting on the internet...

-I try to be really considerate of the people I live with.


Feel free to ask me anything! I'm definitely not expecting to find a roommate through reddit, but I figure it's worth a try. "
297q4n,1,2014-06-27,I'm losing weight but I'm not being healthy about it... and I can't stop,throwaway_loseit,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/297q4n/im_losing_weight_but_im_not_being_healthy_about/,"Throwaway because I need to get this off my chest. 

When I first started losing weight I was eating 1200 calories a day and had a low carb diet. Since I'm short (5'3''), this was the recommended amount by MFP. I started out at 167 pounds and I'm currently at 151, it's been 40 days. 

It started out fine and I was eating the 1200 calories a day. The first week alone I lost 6 pounds. Then I stalled for 2 weeks and I freaked out. I mean, I've dieted before and it was fine... it was slow but I knew losing weight took time. 

I just couldn't fail again this time, you know? I've tried losing weight at least 40 times and I ALWAYS fail. I refuse  to fail this time. Anyways, after 2 weeks of stalling, I started cutting calories to 1000. The weight started coming off faster. I was also working out 5 days a week for at least an hour a day. So, I cut my calories down further to speed up the process. Then more. Then more. It's disgusting how low I go some days. 

I don't look at food the same way. Food made me fat, how in the world can I eat it and expect to lose weight? Food is the enemy. I have to force myself to eat more than 600 calories. But I kind of feel good about myself when I don't eat a lot. I like that burn in my stomach because it means that food didn't control me that day, I won. I'm making progress. I understand how fucked up this is. I really do... I just can't seem to care. People are telling me how good I look, to keep up the hard work. My mom told me she was proud of me. I tell myselfd that I'll be able to stop once I'm at goal weight, I'll go back to normal then. But I've watched documentaries about eating disorders, I've read books about eating disorders... I know this is only the start. I know I need to stop. 

It escalated. I have a personal trainer. I almost passed out during our workout today. I've never felt like this before... I sat in the gym for 15 minutes and in my car for another 30 before I had enough energy to drive home. I was so light headed, so nauseous... but  I was kind of proud of how hard I pushed myself through the workout. How sick is that?

I'm scared. I really am. I'm scared because I can't stop and I can't fail. I feel like I have no control. I feel like I'm racing against a clock to lose weight and that I'm behind.. always behind. I'm smarter than this. I'm better than this. 

Anyone else going through this? I would like someone to talk to. I don't want people to judge me. I'm a 4.0 senior in college, I've had prestigious internships, I should have my shit together... I know better.

Before we found out we got the same job, we didn't really talk, i knew her from class and barely really spoke to her. So when i found out we'd be moving far away together, i knew we'd be talking a bunch together and what not. We do all the pre-hire stuff together and i'm picking up a little vibe here and there. I didn't wanna start anything before we came out here b/c i wanted to adjust to life her first before i added this into the mix.

Fast forward to being here, we're decently close now; we talk everyday, have had lunch together a couple times. She invited me out for drinks with a couple of her friends she knows out here, and was sticking around me for the night mostly. She invited me for drinks after work one day, one on one, i paid for our drinks, and when we're together she's seemingly engaged and interested. I can make her laugh, and it's nothing awkward ever. 

now, i really like her, and unfortunately got it pretty bad. I don't want to be too clingy and be asking to her to lunch every day and shit. She's a gorgeous girl, smart, and has these insanely gorgeous eyes i get lost in. 

My only problem i'm having here is that she just has stopped responding to my texts. We've made a list of stuff we wanna do (together) before we leave, and i'm texting her to get details about whatever we're gonna do for the weekend, and she just doesn't text back. I asked her about it today, and she said she forgot, so then today after work i texted again reminding her to let me know the deal, still no answer. I also texted her once asking how her day went, cause she looked insanely busy all day, and i was bored as hell. 

It's just weird, she ignores me (maybe) on text, but in person she's very sweet, and is usually looking to hang out with me or talk with me. But today she didn't even say bye to me, and i sit within 20 feet of her, and she saw me there. She just left work and didn't say anything to me.

I'm getting mixed signals. maybe i'm too late? She was pretty responsive early on, but now maybe i'm old news? I don't know. I like hanging out with her, and when we talk its always a good part of my day. I just want it to be a more official thing where i don't have to wonder if she's into me or not. I don't know, but i'd rather her just text me 'fuck off' than ignore me.

My plan so far is to see how this weekend goes when we hangout (albeit with her roommate too), then ask her out for dinner next week if i get a good feeling about it over the weekend.

if it weren't for ignoring me through text, i'd be pretty sure she's into me, but thats throwing me off, cause usually if i like someone, i'm responding to them cause i want to talk.

All this is messing with my head too, I've been having to run just to get my mind off the situation cause i just don't know what to do here. 

Probably half the reason i'm even writing this is cause i just wanna vent to someone, but damn, its crazy confusing right now, and i wish i could just get a straight read. "

297rly,3,2014-06-27,Need help understanding effect of distribution shape on confidence intervals,eriksreddit,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/297rly/need_help_understanding_effect_of_distribution/,"Recently, I was hired as an intern to design an experiment to assess the density of oysters at two locations in a nearby bay. I suggested that we take pilot samples to estimate the sample size needed. I used the variance of the samples and Z-score tables (alpha =0.05) to calculate the number of observations necessary to estimate the mean density + - 5 oysters per sq. meter (an acceptable amount of error). Simple stats, I know, but I'm really excited about it!

This got me thinking. I know that one of the assumptions of the method I'm using is that the data are normally distributed. I think that this is probably a reasonable assumption, because the habitat is pretty homogenous. However, I'm wondering what the consequences of erroneously imposing this assumption might be. These are my questions:

1) I'm struggling to understand how the confidence interval (CI) might change with different distribution shapes . My best guess is that the skewness controls the value of the mean, and the kurtosis controls the amount of data within the confidence intervals (variance). Let me elaborate. 

I know that mean of a positively skewed distribution will be less than the mean of a normal distribution. The opposite is true of a negatively skewed distribution. A tall skinny distribution (I don't know kurtosis terms) will have relatively small variance around the mean. The opposite is true of a wide fat distribution. 

So, I guess the variance of the distribution (and therefore the CI around the mean) may not necessarily change if the distribution is skewed. However, skinner distributions will change the CI . Since the variance of skinny distributions is small than normal distributions, more of the data fit within + - 5 oysters per sq m of the mean. So, my CI will actually increase. Am I on the right track?

2) Are there simple tests I can use for normality? sknewness? kurtosis? How do these tests work? Is it a worthwhile exercise to test the shape of my distribution to better understand the CI around my estimated mean or am I barking up the wrong tree?

3) If I test the data for normality and it turns out that the density is not distributed normally, what next? Is there a way to calculate the CI around your mean for a given sample size and set of parameters that are distinct to your specific distribution (in other words, for a sample size of N, is it possible to calculate the CI around the mean for a given kurtosis and skewness value)?

Thanks! Reddit stats rocks! Learning more every day, and super enthusiastic about it all!

I need to start moving on to other positions soon, but this particular internship is the one I desire most. I don't know now how much more time I can wait (I need to make payments in about 3 weeks for housing), especially since I may not be hired at all. The timeline goes a bit like this:

1. 3 weeks ago I submitted my resume and had a phone interview request. We had the phone interview a few days later, and he told me he would contact me when I got back from college.
2. I get back from college 2 weeks later (so a week ago) and I contact him with a follow-up email (although I told him the dates in my previous thank you email) and he replies back requesting for an onsite interview the next day.
3. I interview with him and 2 other people for a total of an hour and a half. I thought it went well. After the last interview, he tells me has 2 more candidates to interview and that he'll contact me in a few days. I send him a thank you email.
4. Today (8 days since the onsite interview) he replies to my thank you email saying he's been super busy. He asks for 2 writing samples and for 2 references. I email back within the hour and he says he'll get back to me soon.

Am I nearing the very end of this process? I'm not very impatient, but I really need to get started with a summer job and make money to pay my housing deposit.

I'll spare you guys my life story, as you can probably find it in my cscareerquestions posts, the TL;DR version follows:

I'm about to graduate from a school with some very good name recognition as well as a high ranking from US news for Information Technology with a B.S.  One of the requirements for the degree is a completion of an internship, which is at the end of the summer, would be the only barrier to me graduating.

As such, I've been pursuing internships for the fall, and have been looking at a service and support intern position in Denver CO.  I've received an offer for the position, that is literally half the expected salary for someone with my degree.  It includes a rather strange arrangement where after 6 months, I receive a 10% bonus, as well as a 15% increase in pay, at the conclusion of the internship (another 6 months, another 10% bonus) I would (hopefully) receive a full time offer from the company in a more technical capacity in either a consulting or development capacity.

I should note that I am on the east coast currently, and the company does not offer any sort of relocation package.  I'd be basically driving more than halfway across the country, on a salary simply insufficient to afford either the cost of living, as well as to even consider paying back any of my student loans.  Everything is throwing up red flags here to walk.  In order to make it work, they would have to increase their offer by almost 50% of what it is now.

It's the only offer on the table at this point, and while it is for an entry level intern position, I do happen to have 6 years of experience in customer service and tech support for consumer electronics.

Payscale.com places the offer in the 29th percentile with 0 years of experience, 14th percentile with 6 years of experience, if you consider my current tech support experience dealing with customers face to face.

Is this even worth negotiating?  I'd be aiming towards 40k to start."

My dad works for the same company and gave me a heads up today that someone he knows, let's call him Carl, is saying that Carl and I text all of the time. This guy is known for going after interns, like myself, and either getting them to date him or going to HR with sexual harassment claims against them if the turn him down. 

I didn't recognize his name until I had my dad send a picture to me, and he's someone my boss introduced me to and I will say hi to and occasionally make friendly banter with in the hallway, but never anything more than what would normally occur between colleagues, and let me make this clear he does not and will never have my number, and so whoever he is texting(if anyone) is not me at all, and the only people who have my number would not and have not given it to him.

I just don't know where to go from here since I've never worked in the corporate world before. I was thinking about talking to the college recruiter in hr just as a preemptive measure but not sure how that would go over. Any and all advice would greatly be appreciated!

Edit: Adding in the fact that he's been able to get away with this due to the executive managers liking him."
298pci,2,2014-06-27,I currently am unsure of where I want to take my life. I could really use some outsider's perspective,hibbert0604,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/298pci/i_currently_am_unsure_of_where_i_want_to_take_my/,"I graduated college with a degree in Geography specialized in GIS in May of last year. I have worked a couple of different internships and one job in my field and I absolutely hated it. I did nothing for a couple of months and my parents encouraged me to try and go back to school for computer science because I have always been pretty proficient with computers.

 So I started back classes in May of this year. However to be perfectly honest, I am hating every minute of being back in school. I am having to live at home to save money which means two hours of commuting every single week day, I also have a job, and on top of school, I have no free time whatsoever. I have grown distant from all of my friends as a result. I want to find my place in life. I don't want to have to wait two more years when I thought I was done a year ago. 

Do you guys have any suggestions as to some things I could look into? I'm sick of living at home. I'm sick of having no free time. I absolutely can not do this for two years. One of the things I have been seriously looking into was joining a branch of the armed forces. It sounds appealing to me. One of the things I want to do more than anything is travel and this would be good way to do so. I also have been on an insane fitness kick lately. I have lost 70 pounds since September. However I am hesitant to pull the trigger on committing to the armed forces because I am still about 30 pounds overweight. I wouldn't currently get admitted. I don't know how long it will take me to lose the remaining weight and get in shape to pass the demands of BMT. This is just one thought I have had recently though. I am open to any other suggestions. 

I really appreciate any advice you guys have to give. "
298pp0,16,2014-06-27,"I (21f) need advice on how to support my SO (22m) when he gets the news on the job he interviewed for, and I'm very very nervous of a potential fallout because he has really built it up...",nervousugh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/298pp0/i_21f_need_advice_on_how_to_support_my_so_22m/,"I just want to preface this by saying my hopes are extremely high for him, I believe in him and absolutely 100% know that this company would be lucky to have him as an employee. He's smart, qualified, kind, and fun, and has worked hard to get where he is. 

----

The thing is, he only graduated with his degree one month ago, and I think he expected it to be very easy and quick to find a job, so the longer it has taken to get interviews and the like, the more frustrated and stressed he has become. I completely understand this, however I do wish he could look at it more rationally and understand that these things do take time and it's not indicative of him not being 'good enough' or anything of the sort. (I've told him this, he says he knows, but brushes it off because he just wants to get a job now. Understandable...) So he's been building up this one particular job for a while. He interviewed for one back in April and didn't get it and was really heartbroken. But he picked himself up and I helped him apply like crazy. I found at least 50 job potentials and emailed them and he applied to whichever ones he liked. I did say that I think he should just apply to as many as possible, but, in the end it's his choice and I didn't pressure him. Then he found this particular position. 

-----

It is great, because it's a bit lower-level than the entry-level position he was seeking - and although I think he deserves a job on par with those his friends with the same degree are aiming for, I think it would be good for him to start here and build up, only because unlike the others, he was never able to nab an internship last summer. So he's limited on the experience level beyond his education. Which is fine. I think this would be a great place to start and he's definitely qualified. It is a position that is close to home, too, so he could live there and save up, which he reeeeally wants. He studied and prepared for the interview for a week, almost 2 hours every night, and printed out pages upon pages of his own previous work to show them during their meeting. I really think this was great and was super proud of him. They seemed to love him, said they'd let him know in one week ... which is today. 


----

Here's the thing. I love him and I think he did as much as possible to prepare for it. BUT. Because he did that, he's built it up - ""If I don't get this job, I'll feel like a complete failure."" I helped him write thank-you letters, which took forever because he gets distracted, but they came out really, really great, and he was over the moon about them. ""I've never had such good thank-you letters. If I don't get the job afterthose I don't know how I'll ever get one."" This makes me VERY nervous. I know how he reacts to things like this - not well. If he doesn't get it, I know he really WILL feel like a failure, even though of course he isn't. I've told him that he has a great chance, but even if he doesn't get it, it's not because he didn't do a good enough job preparing, it could just be that they chose someone else for a variety of reasons (!) - family connection, out of school for longer, had internships, etc. I just want him to believe he IS doing the best he can and yes, it's great to hope and want to an extreme level, but not to say things like ""i'll give up, I need this, I don't know what I'll do otherwise."" It's not the only job in the world!!! 

----

He did say last night that he just wants to be able to tell people ""yeah I gota job! I'm working at __."" He's only been out of school for a month, I doubt anyone would ever judge him for taking more than a month to find his first job... but that's just my opinion. I don't know how to talk him down from this anymore than I've tried so far. The other nervewracking thing? His ex-roommate and really, really good friend (both of ours) just got a job offer from a good company with a high starting salary. I haven't mentioned anything and asked our friend to wait to tell him just because I know he'll take that and add it to his shoulders as more pressure on this ONE job. It's only the 2nd interview he's EVER been on!!!! So I dunno. 

----

I guess I'm just looking for advice to know how to handle this regardless of what happens. Obviously if he gets it he'll be over the moon, and I with him, and I'll celebrate, buy him some beer, congratulate him, kiss him, anything. 

But if he doesn't get it, I'm really scared, only because I know he'll crash down and feel so awful about it. I don't know how to make him not put so much weight on the second interview he's ever been on... I know I can't change the way he feels or approaches things, but I wish there was a way to help him realize that he's building it up/putting too much pressure on himself. Or maybe I'm wrong, who knows.I just know that if he doesn't get it he will be miserable. It's already been very difficult for us with all this stress as of late, and things have been a little tense, but I'm trying to be patient and understanding. I'm scared with what might happen if he doesn't get it. 

----

I didn't get a job that I desperately wanted this summer. I let myself be sad and drink champagne with my roommate for the night. The next morning I threw myself into applications and interviews and when I couldn't get anything still I went to a temp agency, stayed there until I found the position I'm at now, and I feel fine about it all. However, this is the field he wants to work in, this is him working out of school, this is huge, for him. I know that. But I just want him to be able to handle disappointment or change without crashing and feeling like a total failure if he doesn't get a certain job. There will be so many rejections and such in everyone's life and I want him to be able to handle that maturely and then jump into applying after a day or two of being sad. I'm just scared for him, for us. I'm sorry for the length and rantiness.

----

TL;DR - any advice on this topic would be so appreciated: my boyfriend interviewed for a job at this company he REALLY wants to work for, has put it on a huge pedestal, has told me he will feel like a ""complete failure"" if he doesn't get it, etc. I'm looking for advice on how to support him/help him through this and prevent the stress/tension from leaking into our relationship if he doesn't happen to get it.

I decided on today to be the day I go back on a keto cycle.

I found myself mindlessly waking up, having and packing my berries-eggs-cheese-and-nuts breakfast, heading to the hospital where I pursue education.

Surely, but surely, as the stress of the 108F weather today, combined with senior students bossing you around, interns being assholes and the occasionally difficult patients all started to hit, I found myself in the break lounge mindlessly opening the freezer for some ice cream. Not only had I unwrapped the ice cream, but I actually dug my spoon in and proceeded to have some.

The sweetness of the ice cream hitting the back of mouth made me remember that I was on keto today. Needless to say, I spat it all out like I learned it was poison. It freaked me out to realize how mindless some of our eating habits are, some of which contribute mainly in our weight and lifestyle. In retrospect, I did not even want ice cream. I'm having me a cold glass of water.

298qff,2,2014-06-27,Lunch Interview?,HalcyonDementia,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/298qff/lunch_interview/,"I'll try to keep this brief. I graduated two years ago with a degree in music composition and technology. I found this music company I really wanted to work for and e-mailed the owner about a possible internship. He got back to me and said let's meet sometime, and when I e-mailed him back he never responded. I was bummed, but moved on and found other internships. 

Last year I got a full time job as a receptionist and am currently working there. It's boring, money isn't even good, but it's all I have at the moment. A few months ago I notice the same person I e-mailed two years ago checked out my linkedin page. So I e-mailed him, he remembered me, and asked to meet. I went to the office and had a chat, he said they didn't have a job at the moment, but might soon in the future. They asked if I was interested, I said yes.

Two months I get an e-mail asking if I would like to come in to interview because the position is opening up. I meet the whole team later that week, including who I would be replacing. They seemed to be getting a feel for my personality, since the office only has a few people and we'd be working together so closely. I got along with everyone, things were positive. I send a follow up, he said I did really well and that if I don't hear by mid-June to follow up.

We get to mid June, I email, he says I'm still one of their favorites and they should be able to tell me in 2-3 weeks.

I'm still on a roller coaster of emotions, as you can imagine. 

Yesterday I get another e-mail asking if I'm free next week to get lunch with two employees, one of which I would be the assistant for. I have no idea what to expect. I have never had a lunch interview, if that is what it is. What kinds of questions do you ask? What topics do you bring up? Would they invite multiple candidates out to lunch at different times? Are they just trying to get a better feel for my personality to see if I fit? What does it all mean?!

Sorry this was so long!"

298yzd,6,2014-06-27,Me [22 M] going through a breakup with my girlfriend [22 F] of 2 years. Moved to a new state and having trouble moving on and keeping no contact.,dkwhat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/298yzd/me_22_m_going_through_a_breakup_with_my/,"Wall of text incoming. Helps to type it all out!


We met in college a few weeks before I went on a 7 month internship in Florida. I have had two other serious relationships before but this was far more passionate and fast moving than those were and halfway through my internship we decided to do a long distance commited relationship. 


When I got back the relationship really blossomed. We were madly in love through the semester and the summer. Then, she left for Spain to study abroad for 4 months, and we decided to do long distance again. While she was gone there were ome infidelity issues- I drunkenly kissed a friend at a party. We worked through it over the next couple months and I ended up visiting her in Spain. That trip was, hands down, the happiest time of my life.


When she got back from her stud abroad things escalated quickly and the relationship became more serious. I became distracted because I had recently auditioned for a full time performing job that was perfect for me. However, because she studied abroad, she wouldn't graduate for another semester. I ended up getting the position but we were hesitant to do long distance again because 1) we were sick of long distance and 2) we weren't sure about future plans. 


I mulled it over for awhile and a few weeks before I left I told her that I don't care about how hard it will be, that I at least want to try and am willing to make sacrifices once she graduates to be with her. She said yes at first. A few weeks later on a vacation with her and my family she was acting very strange. We talked about it and she said it was nothing but that she had decided she did not want to do long distance and that she needed to choose herself for once, which I totally understand. However we left our relationship in a place that we both are still in love and want to get back together eventually, but that distance is too hard and would tear us apart (and we were both concerned about cheating).


So I leave, and after a few weeks settling into my new job our new friendship is going great—we talk every day. Then one day I just break down and ask her to get back together. She then tells me she cheated on me a few weeks before the vacation. Apparently, she ran into a guy from her work at a club and they flirted and he kissed her and she let him. She says it was a one time thing and it stopped there, that she felt terrible about herself for letting it happen and that alchohol was a big contributor. 


I am devastated because this is the girl of my dreams. I have always been a head over heels starry eyed romantic (which has gotten my heart broken many times) so I impulsively bought a plane ticket to surprise her the next day and win her back. When I showed up with flowers and all, however, someone had told ehr that I was coming and she was extremely distant and cold. I had a panic attack while I was there and she basically shut me down completely, was very cold, and said that she didnt want to do long distance, that she needed to focus on herself and her future and prioritize herself and she didn't want a relationship at all right now. All completely understandable and rational for her, but devastating for me. So I come back to Florida with my tail between my legs.


Tried dating someone here, but I could tell I wasn't ready so I stopped that. Recently on facebook there was a picture of my ex with the guy that she said kissed her at the club. We don't talk but I called to ask her if she had lied about anything else in the relationship, if it was an ongoing thing, and if she had broken up with me for him. In my mind, I could still see us getting back together and needed to hear the whole truth so I could figure out how to move on. She said that it was a one time thing, and that she is just casually ""hooking up"" with this guy and doesn't want to be in a relationship with him. 


I am depressed, and don't have many friends here. It is affecting my new job and I have crying fits pretty frequently. I try to make friends and plans but am having difficulty doing so. I am considering seeing a therapist. More than anything I want to finish up my obligation here and go home and try to win her back come December. Rationally, I know that might not be the best thing for either of us, but I can't deny it is exactly what I want to do.


---   
**tl;dr**: Should I see a therapist? Should I follow my impulse and try to win her back? Talking it out really helps, thank you so much."

2) What's the social scene like, especially for students older than the 18-22 range?

3) Having an internship is pretty much required for CS. As far as housing around Cheney goes, is a 10 month lease (Sept-June) Too much to ask for?

Over the past few months, while I’ve been waiting for my DK2 to arrive, I’ve had plenty of time to ponder where Virtual reality is going in general, and where OculusVR is headed specifically.

I’m very much looking forward to all the things that the DK2 will make possible, and extremely excited for the commercial release of the CV1; which I believe will be the real start of mainstream Virtual Reality acceptance.

But, what really fires up my imagination and hopes for the future, is not these two products; it is the things the OculusVR “Dream Team” or “Brain Trust” are planning and working on that go far beyond anything they have revealed to date.

Visit the OculusVR People page and truly pay attention to the job titles and backgrounds of the people that are now part of the team, and keep in mind that these people did not come on board to just make the dream specs of the CV1 become a reality for next year; they left their last jobs to become part of OculusVR for years of Virtual Reality focused projects, products, software, networks and systems.

I have some pretty good ideas of what the future of all these efforts will look like; and I know they will make everything we are currently hoping for the DK2 and CV1 units to do for us seem like playing with toys by comparison to what the future will hold for all of us.

Check out the OculusVR People page at: http://www.oculusvr.com/company/people/

And think about what all of these job titles imply is coming our way over the next few years!

**Are there any part time technical jobs on or off campus?**

I know in Oxford, technical positions are a bit limited, especially if you can only work part time. Does anyone know someone that would have info on the computer places?

**How difficult is a bartender or server position to grab?**

I'm over 21 so that isn't an issue, but I don't really have much experience in that sort of stuff. At the same time, I'm trying to keep my income to as close as it was before.

Apologies in advance if this ends up being long. 

For a little briefing: I started college as a CS major and Math minor. I struggled through the first year and I wasn't loving CS and nor was I doing well academically, at least by my standards.  It wasn't until junior year I was able to take a Web Development course and came to love it. Unfortunately, my college doesn't offer web development as a concentration nor does it offer any follow-up courses, so I'm stuck in Software Systems/Software Engineering. I don't feel like I am not taking away much from the concentrations and, for the most part, I'm not enjoying them either. I am doing better academically, but I feel like the only area I have any advantage over my peers is in Web development (which isn't even core curriculum), while I my other skills (particularly theory or algorithms) don't stand up. I possess what I would consider moderate web development and general programming skills, which is none too impressive either.  

Enough with that though. My problem and inquiry is for getting a job after graduation, and that in itself is a little story.  I applied for a number of internships for this summer and I didn't end up getting any offers. I hand picked a bunch of internships I thought I was qualified for and applied. I interviewed for some, but nothing came of them. Most of them felt like they went okay, but last one felt like a sure thing, and then nothing. The interview went great and I felt like I was answering all the questions well (I also aced the phone interview prior), but I didn't get it even though I thought the interview indicated I might have.

For some of them, the theory/algorithm parts is just my absolute weak spot; most of the questions I just can't answer, especially on the spot (if I had more time, they probably wouldn't be a problem, but theory is my very apparent weakness in the major). Coding stuff is more my strong suit and I can handle the normal interview stuff fine. 

All that being said, I'm worried that not having received an internship this summer and not really having a portfolio nor personal projects is REALLY going to hinder my chances of getting a job. That and the fact that I don't stand out against my peers (academically, skill wise, and knowledge) makes me feel like I don't bring anything to the table to start with. 

I'm not really sure what to do to move on. Should I try to land an internship before getting a real job, should I consider going into a specific field, or what? There's a lot of jobs/internships out there, but a lot of them require specific knowledge that I don't know and can't spend time to learn in school (e.g. specific frameworks, etc.). I'm not really sure where they expect you to have picked up some of this information/skills from sometimes for internships and I'm afraid to apply to a lot of positions I feel somewhat qualified to because I lack some of the required knowledge. 

I just don't really know where to go from here, and while I'm not in panic mode yet, I certainly am getting closer. 

Thanks in advance for any help/advice you can offer."

Yesterday, the final paperwork was approved for the Reconstruction, Industrialization and Modernization project. No time had been wasted. Within the hour, most of the cities builders had been called in, along with several hundred from other territories. 

Far below the viewing platform on the skyscraper, RIM was starting. Engineers and builders crowded the streets, donning their yellow hard hats. The Coterians were mostly curious to the changes, they occasionally stopped to look at a construction worker hoist some materials up on a truck.

Some complained about the street shutdowns, but public transportation had been state funded and was now free, permanently. The buses had been equipped with banners reading ""RIM for the future!"" and the subway was offering free information leaflets regarding the new changes.

McMiller turned around, a huge grin on his face. Behind him stood Zwoosh, who gave him a high five. ""Alright Hugo, great job. Now sit back and enjoy the ride."" Zwoosh fished out his AZUR phone and dialed in a number.

In a storage house out in Pervinca, an old phone rang, twice in fact, before a bearded old man picked up the receiver ""Tom's storage! How can I help you?"" Tom listened for a few seconds before hanging up and calling in his interns.

Fifteen minutes the local village woke up to ten trucks racing through, filled with lab supplies that had already been purchased for upgrades in the Cote laboratories.

McMiller entered the conference room. ""Ladies and gentlemen.. let me present to you.. the new Cote!"" He flipped a switch and a projector flickered a second before displaying a [map](http://i.imgur.com/RgQ4RAY.jpg?1). He picked up a laser pointed and started explaining the different points.

""Well, first we have our new and upgraded fortresses. Luusburg is located halfway up on the mountain and contains a military airport, anti-infantry, anti-air and even anti-naval capabilities while also hosting a large garrison.

Next is Holy Cliff Harbor. Any ship in our fleet can dock here, and a direct attack from either sea or land is impossible. 

Our other naval fort is Sentinels Rock. This base has the best anti-naval armaments in the Periwinkle kingdom and is equipped with ballistic missiles.

Last but not least, Queens Rock. Bastion and stronghold. Impossible to take, can withstand any assault by land. Being able to hold over ten thousand soldiers in it's underground structures, it has an extensive motor pool and modern weaponry.

Moving on from the forts, we have the new prison we have planned on for a long time."" A few of the council members in the audience nodded slightly, and some of the reporters scribbled furiously, trying to make their papers story the best one.

""Down here"" McMiller said as he pointed the laser at a red zone in the south ""is a new forbidden zone, due to military activity and insecurity about volcanic gases after the rupture. We have constructed two new research facilities on islands outside the coast, our new nano-steel being a product from one of them. These will undoubtedly prove extremely valuable in the future.""

""In addition, we have scrapped the old airport and are opening the new one ""Zwoosh Airport"", after our sponsor and Lt.Governor, Zwoosh Airlines Inc. We also have a new royal castle and/or palace to replace the sunk one, and a new cathedral. The cathedrals name is still a disputed issue.""

McMiller tapped a button and a new [map](http://i.imgur.com/K24XlLc.png?1) popped up. 
""This is the plan for the outlines of the building projects. City officials will each brief you more detailed regarding their sectors. Our time is up. Questions can be asked to my representative. Thank you for joining us today. May the future be bright. I would also like to remind you that we are creating countless jobs with RIM. We will make this the most successful territory and overcome the destruction of the rupture. Forever for Côte!"" "

I am fresh out of college and am considering accepting a job offer with a company nearby since I would like to stay in the area. There are a couple of questions that I have though.

1.) The only thing that I've been told with the salary is that it is ""between $40-50k"" and that benefits are ""standard"". Isn't this strange that I'm being given a range like this? Also, is this what I should expect for being fresh out of school? Especially since I never did an internship and this is my first job. (This is a job in South Carolina, btw)

2.) What can I expect in terms of advancement in general? Like if I put in 2 years at an entry level position, can I expect to move up? If so, what should be the ballpark figure that I ""should be"" making by then? And expanding on this, what would be the normal career track for a software developer? I think I would at some point like to move into more of a managerial role, but since I'm new, I really don't know the industry well enough to make that determination.  

3.) Is it easy to move around in the software development/IT field? I'm asking because I know at some point I would like to move geographically and it would be nice to have the ability to move outside of what I will be doing for this company. Or when you start down a certain path, is it hard to change?

What I have really been interested in since before nursing school was either ICU or the OR. I am kind of over bedside nursing and think maybe it's not for me. I am finding, however, OR is a tough field to break into. I did apply to an OR nurse position within my hospital recently but was told I wasn't qualified and that the best way to get into it was to complete the OR internship program (which I was also told they are not offering right now). So how the heck can I become an OR nurse??? 

Looking back, I wish I had gone to school to be a scrub tech, but I didn't know about all of that at the time. So, OR nurses, how do I get into this field? Do you just need to know someone, or is there really some extra programs or education I need to complete before becoming eligible?
Any advice y'all can give me would be great. Thanks!"

I just finished my second year as a computer science major, and I'm currently halfway through my first summer internship for a very large and recognizable company. I'm interning with the IT software development team, but I'm not sure if I like the IT side of things. About 2/3 of what I do is program a .NET web app and webservices to automate processes, and the rest is working on SSRS reports, which has to do with SQL and knowing the basics of how the business runs. I love the programming but I'm not so sure if I like the business reports and having to learn in-depth business concepts. I really love the company, my coworkers, and what I've been coding, they pay me very well, and they've strongly hinted that they'd want me back next summer.

How different is what I'm doing than a non-IT software development position, and how in-detail about business do you need to know for most positions? I don't mind the business side of things and sometimes some of the concepts are cool, but going into detail about it all really bores me. Also, I don't like this city very much. I'm thinking of turning down the offer at the end of the summer (assuming I get one) because I still have two summers after this summer, and I want to see what other coding jobs are like, but I'm not really sure how different this is than other positions. Also, if I change my mind a few years down the road and want to come back, would it look bad if I reapplied? And if I turn down the offer, what's the best way to do it etiquette-wise? I've been telling them that everything's great when they ask me, so I feel like I'd be stabbing them in the back when/if I say no, haha."

I'm getting outside a lot. I've been stone cold sober for three weeks, not because I ""quit"" or anything, but I just don't wanna right now. I'm keeping up with my hobbies. I'm five days clean from porn addiction. I'm kicking all kinds of ass at my paid internship, getting lots of praise and whatever. I'm eating right, a strict vegetarian diet with lots of protein. I'm pushing myself to be social even though it's hard. I have some pretty solid plans for the future. I'm taking my meds every day, I have one of those week-long pill containers to make sure. I'm fucking doing fucking yoga for fuck's sake. 

All I want to do is hang myself from the doorknob. I get vivid visions of it all the time. The crushing weight wont go away. Then I get sucked into a loop of fantasy and guilt (because it would hurt people I love) and then more self hatred and then more fantasy and more guilt and my head starts to spin. There's a voice and it has my voice and it's telling me to do it. It wont leave me alone. I want to carve my face up with an x-acto knife. I want to tear my scalp off of my skull. I'm still crying. It feels so hopeless, because I'm doing all those things your supposed to do, that I do to try to chase those feelings away, but I'm still so anxious, so angry, so tired. I'm exhausted really, I've had major depression since I was around eight years old, I'm twenty-seven now. This has always been my life, I'm so scared that it always will be. I just don't want to have to think about ending my own life anymore, I don't want to have to fight with a demon in my head that tells me I'm worthless, I'm loosing steam. 

I've felt like this before, and it goes away. Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and wonder why I was so upset. I'll be okay, I'm just tired. I know it will get better, it always does, but it always get's worse again. Why why why can't I at least just make myself forget that it always get's worse again?"

We have a bad start due to our flings. We transitioned from open relationship to becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. 

There  was a time when I was suspicious of her then she said I'm getting paranoid and she gave me her phone and facebook account.

We don't have a ground rule to start with. Our foundation was mostly sex, a little date. I also get involved with her family and she introduced me to them. I was the first boyfriend to be introduced to the family so is mine.She is also telling me about seeing me plain due to our wrong foundation.

Then when she was gone to her sister. She said we should be honest and open communication. I haven't done LDR before and I suck at communicating. Then all of a sudden things changed. She picks fights. And she is starting to push me away. I was curious at that time so I opened her facebook.

She was honest in saying that her fling is contacting her and saying ""hi"" I was jealous at that time. And I said to put herself on my shoes. Then she said I won't talk to him again if he message me. After a few days she's the one who contacted him. I ignored it and they stop chatting. I didn't tell her.

Then a few days earlier before she was gone. A guy who discourages LDR  and that guy is interested in her. After a couple of days. The guy started to show sexual intent to my girlfriend. He ask about her and our sexual life which intern she answered. They are talking while the guy admitted is masturbating about her. She always refuses when the guy convince both of them to masturbate. Then the stopped chatting because she said she'll stop chatting due to his behavior. 

Next this time a guy who is convincing her that I will most likely cheat on her and ready to wait whatever the time. 

We also become too comfortable with each other. I don't know if she knows that I was opening her facebook. I'm also puzzled because her friends are not in contact with her most are guys hitting on her. She seem to love the attention to guys just to stroke her ego and her insecurity. Now my trust is broken, also her trust in me was broken because I lied to her. She also hide this things to me.

**tl;dr** Open her facebook, lied about contacting flirt, spilled sexual life and love attention to guys.
What should I do now?"

I'm an undergrad who will be graduating next May with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. Unfortunately, I really don't have a solid plan for after that. I'm academically successful, and have a cumulative ~ 3.8 GPA, as well as two great completed software development internships under my belt (actually, one of the two is upcoming, but will be done by graduation). While my work experiences were very enjoyable and I could probably enter the software field right after graduating, another side of me thinks that getting a Master's degree (in computer engineering, computer science, or a related field) will be useful. However, I am not sure exactly what degree program I would want, or how it would specifically help me.

In summary, my 3 options are:

1. Apply for and enter a Master's degree program directly after undergrad.
2. Enter the workforce for a few years and then go back to school to get the Master's degree
3. Enter the workforce and never go to school again

Do you guys think that given my intended field (software development), getting a Master's degree is beneficial, and if so, which one and why? If so, should I go right away or work for a few years? General comments are also welcome.

Thanks very much,
TrainFan

29ant6,3,2014-06-27,Journey begins,jacobtransform,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/29ant6/journey_begins/,"Hey folks.

It's 4 AM while I'm writing this and I can already see dawn rising. Although I really want to go to bed and sleep, I need to do this first. It's time to reboot, to go cold turkey.

About a year ago, I was living the best time of my life, doing an internship in a country abroad. It was literally the best time I ever had, and I got there through work, dedication and - no games. I managed to be without games from 1/02/2013 until about July of that year. It was amazing, the time I had and the time I invested in other things.


Jumping to the actual moment, I feel like I'm in a shithole. I just managed to open up with a really good friend about my feelings and what's happening - and I agreed that this needs to be done. For the last month, though I had to go through some shit like moving to a new city (I'm studying abroad), final exams etc - I started playing extensively. I fooled myself, as always, telling that I've grown up; that this time, I would be able to control myself. That, because I will have more than one game, I won't fall victim to the same problem, playing one game over and over (e.g. League of Legends). 

It didn't work. Again. And I unninstalled, and installed again some days after, only to fall onto the same bit of depression. I thought gaming could help me, give me a relief, something to look to, a place to have fun, keep in touch with old friends. It doesn't. It can't. It can't because I'm a competitive, anxious son of a bitch, who will try to carry and win every game I play regardless of the title, without thinking of the real world consequences. I know I have a long way to go, and have to come to terms with this fact, that I can not, in any circunstance start playing again.

I went so far last year, and I know I can go even more if I don't have this dragging me down. I've been meaning to quit games altogether for a while now. I remember making similar promises on the last 3/4 years in the new years eve or in my birthday. I know I might have a relapse, like anyone who struggles with an addition has - but I got to try, I got to do it.

If ANYONE managed to read until now: thank you! :) I was really hoping I could get in touch with some of you, maybe to try and speak once in a week or so, and see how each other progress is doing? That would be awesome, to help and be helped. I think we're all in this together.

Day 1, starting now!"

I still have flashbacks of the time I jaywalked and a car honked at me. I still have flashbacks to presentation I bombed months ago (worth 5%). I still have flashbacks to the dumb things i said in high school. Its like I shut down and go into a spiral of an anxious imagination. I work in film and I run into celebrities and I'm super professional, I make myself proud. But I still think back to idiotic things, times i could have been even more professional. Like better conversation when I run into the talent in the elevator.

I recently fractured my foot by switching insoles (I'm on my feet on flat studio floor for 14 hours a day), stress fracture they say. So I cant walk for the majority of the production. Worst Intern ever. I feel bad, cause I love what I do even if they pay me scraps. I feel like I'm letting them down. but whats weird is I am more upset over the small stuff. I do paperwork and whatever I can since my foots busted, but I still feel anxious over my small actions, like I'm constantly about to blow it and never work in film again.

Thats recently, I've always had the perception that most of my social interactions are failures. I was bullied at a young age, I had thick skin and shrugged it all off and even got respected for being impenetrable to bullying. I realize now that I subconsciously agreed with the bullies. And I feel anxious for everything because I am consistently afraid of people finding out what the bullies did; that I'm broken. So I use my intellect and put up a shield of wit and humor. No matter what I do I am alone though. Only met one person who gets me and she screwed me over (which makes some nice trust issues with women now)

K I am ranting, Im going to try to scope this down. I know whats been making me unhappy and I am working on it. Its hard to work on it cause of my fractured foot right now, stuck at home but when I go back to my apartment (Parents for summer) I'm going to start living with less pressure on myself.

So here's what I need from you guys (other than me venting) How do I stop these flashbacks to embarrassing moments? I'm getting better at handling the future ones, but the past is still messing with me.


TL;DR Moments I deem embarrassing keep popping up in my head. I put lots of shame on myself. Also I started to notice, when i dodge a social mishap, I still imagine how I could have messed it up and get an even bigger rush of anxiety over a past event that hasn't even happened!"

Here's a short introduction to my credentials and who I am. Questions are below. 

My name is RockStoleMySock and I have a B.S. In Earth Science.  I received  my degree in May 2013. The program in which I participated is from a small, not-well-known department (or school, for that matter) in the northeast. As a result, I have diverse background in geology with 2 semesters of physics w/ Calculus, calculus 1, 2, and differential equations. I have some MatLab experience but no coding experience.

Since finishing my degree, I applied to geoscience and geophysics programs alike, but ended up being rejected from all schools to which I applied. All were for Fall 2014 consideration. 

Because I live in the northeast, there are no jobs or internships available that aren't in the environmental consulting field. I'm interested in getting into the O+G industry through a geophysics degree, but am beginning to both doubt my credentials and search for ways I can get myself out there. Since graduation,  I've been working part time at Yale University (as an unrelated museum tech) living in my parent's attic. I have saved enough money to take Calculus 3 over the summer (which I'm taking from July to August), but have little left over. I don't have much money to apply to scholarships and grad schools,  let alone field camp or meetings for the AGU, GSA, and SEG (all of which I am a member).

As a final note: my research interests include integrated basin analysis and exploration seismology. I have some books I've been sleuthing through, on seismic data acquisition, processing, and interpretation, and on multi-component seismic technology.

So here are my questions:

**1.)** How much does a geology background matter in geophysics? Does it hold significant value?

**2.)** What coding language(s) should I learn? C++/C#? Java? Python? Old 1950s programming languages?

**3.)** In applying to graduate schools for the spring 2015 semester, what else can I do to make myself more appealing to potential geophysics programs?

Thanks in advance! Any information or advice will be well-received and much appreciated.

Anyways, I have an internship and some classes in my city, and she is working at a camp in hers, for the second straight year. One of the guys she works with had a thing with her a while back, and sadly i'm pretty aware of the fact that he still wants to be with her.

Anyways, when she started working there this summer, she kind of gave him the cold shoulder, as did he, because she didn't want drama or anything like that. After a couple of weeks, she told me that they ""were going to try and be friends"". Alright, not thrilled, but lets move on. I trust her, and the people she hangs out with from her work are the same people he hangs out with, so I could see why having some sort of friendship is necessary.

Well here's the problem:

As I mentioned, we are a couple hours away from one another. because of this, and her work, I haven't seen her in about a month. We have plans to get together next weekend, and have a little vacation planned for the one after that. When we made these plans last week, I kinda asked why we can't see each other this weekend but dropped it pretty quickly.

Well this morning I wake up and talk to her and everything is great (it honestly has been really good), until she mentions that shes spending the day with her coworkers, including this dude, hanging out at the beach. This bothers me for a couple reasons...

1. I haven't seen her in a month, yet she is spending this day, which could be spent together, with her friends and a guy whom she has a history with....

2. She's hanging out with a guy she has a history with, and while I don't think anything will happen, i'm still not thrilled about it.

Since I see her next weekend and the one after that, I don't wanna make a big deal out of it. For all I know, they planned this little day trip a while back and I do think it is important for her to hang out and have fun too. Are my feelings justified, am I overreacting?

29bvw8,0,2014-06-28,4-month paid internship starting September: corporate housing or rent stipend? [X-post from /r/personalfinance],RussetWolf,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/29bvw8/4month_paid_internship_starting_september/,"I'm a Canadian computer science student doing a paid internship in Seattle starting in September. They are offering relocation assistance and part of that is either a $2000 (after tax, monthly) stipend for rent, or corporate housing for $500 monthly (my cost, so effectively $2500 cost with the opportunity cost of the stipend taken into account) for a one-bedroom space, or $300 (effectively $2300 my cost) per person in a two bedroom. Corporate housing would likely be walking distance from the office (in South Lake Union). An Orca card is included too, so public transport is free.

The recruiter warned that finding short-term housing in Seattle would be difficult. A cursory search on Craigslist was hit-and-miss. My bothfriend has a lot of friends in the area (mostly Capitol Hill) though, who may have space available.

I don't have to decide right away, but thought I would ask what you guys think is a better choice (someone in /r/Frugal suggested the cross-post). The convenience and cost of corporate housing or the extra work (and likely commute) and lower cost of finding a place on my own.

I'm glad to clarify other things, and please let me know if I made any mistakes or incorrect assumptions. Suggestions and tips on anything associated with being a Seattle resident for a short while are also welcome.

Thanks!

**Edit:** I'm specifically considering [aPodments](http://apodment.com/), specifically the [Alturra](http://apodment.com/alturra.htm) building. It's a 20-30 minute walk to work, and about $740/month with a 3-month lease (and then goes month-to-month). Drawback is that there isn't a stove in the unit, but I don't mind the shared kitchen (I plan to do rice and beans in a crock pot in the unit for most of my meals anyway, I'm a lazy cook)."

I am interning at a facility that is Christian based and cares for children with severe disabilities. Part of my internship is to come up with a month long bible study over the fruits of the spirit. I was once huge into my church as a child but since hitting 16 six years ago, I have quit going and forget much of my teachings. Because of this, I am finding creating this bible study a little difficult. 

This month, we are going over patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, and self control. Each week we will cover one ""fruit"" and I want to do so by teaching the kids a bible story that promotes the fruit we are covering. 

For example, for the first week we will cover patience so I am going to teach them about Noah and the ark and how he waited on God because he trusted God's promise. Goodness and kindness we will cover together and i was thinking about covering the story of the woman washing Jesus's feet. For faithfulness, I wanted to cover the story about Peter trusting Jesus to walk on water. For self control, I am at a loss for a story. 

Do any of you have any recommendations for stories that may be better than what I have chosen, yet that are kid friendly? Thank you for any and all help!!!"

I still plan on getting my CPA and have been trying to figure out classes to take at community colleges to get up to 225 quarter credits. (I have 180 QC's.)

Masters are quite expensive and I don't really want to have to worry a lot about scheduling my work and school around each other. 

I am the type of person who loves to learn and want to know everything there is about accounting and business in general. Now that I have graduated, how do I stay on top of accounting news and changes?

We grew up poor and my parents went bankrupt when I was in high school. 


I finally got out of my shitty house and lived with a horrible alcoholic roommate (did not discover this until after I moved in) so I spent all of my savings trying to get out of that situation. 

I recently discovered my mother quit her job and is addicted to meth. 

A week later my car broke down and it cost $500 to fix. (which is now on my credit card, considering I don't have those funds)


I had an amazing internship at a PR firm, which would have been great because that is what I want to do after I graduate in December, but had to quit to work full time at normal work to pay for the car repair. Now, I feel like my one shot of getting a good job after I graduate is gone.

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, which is untreated because I don't have the health insurance/ money to get looked at. 


My SO has been giving me shit because we don't have sex as much as he'd like because I have absolutely no libido due to my depression. 

In August, I have to go back to school for my last semester and I am dreading it. I want to take online courses and work full time, but I don't think I can do it since I get stressed so easily. I'm not going to be able to pay for this semester without going into even more debt. 


My SO's mother is trying to pressure me into walking for graduation to commemorate all of my hard work, but after I take my last final, I never want to step foot near that school again. These have literally been the worst years of my life and walking is just going to remind me of that. 


I am tired. I just want to fucking kill myself. I have no relationship with my family, no friends, the only person who actually cares whether I live or die is my SO. Even then, I feel like I can't have a 'normal' relationship until I get therapy and on medication for my depression. Bad things keep happening to me and it's getting harder and harder to deal with.

* Einstein's Theory of General Resurrection
* The Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System program

* The Release of the Cows. 
* Interns armed with guns that shoot knives. 

All my plans have failed. I need you to come up with resurrection plans, but you dozy buggers won't do that will you? As such I believe it's time to up the stakes a little. 

If you look under your seats, you'll notice a spring loaded wooden stake has been installed below you. If the spring fires, the stake will shoot up through the seat and cause a great deal of pain to whoever is sitting on said seat. This will happen at approximately 17:00 GMT 29/06/2014.

This is the write-up I'm posting in a few other places. PM me if you're interested or if you know someone.

**Graphic designer**
This is a contract arrangement. Probably about 1-2 projects a month at the moment and we're growing. Does not have to be anyone local but I do love Richmonders.

Looking for a highly skilled freelancer or company that knows graphic design for the web and is up to date on web design trends. Bonus points if you have basic familiarity with how html/css works so you understand what our coder will be doing with your designs.  Primarily needed for custom website layouts, also might require occasional logo, print, or other smaller jobs. Does not have to be local, but does have to be really good. We already have access to decent designers, what we want is someone who stands out as exceptional.

You will be representing our company with your work, and at least initially you will not be dealing with clients directly. Freelancers or companies are both fine, and we have to negotiate rates that expect a reasonable mark-up on our end, but we'll absolutely raise our prices to match your ability if we need to!



**Web Design Intern**
We are looking to bring on an intern for our Richmond, VA web development business. You will gain experience with the web design process and knowledge in front end development work primarily using HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery. The position is unpaid with flexible hours and our goal is to create a paid position for the same duties later this year.

An ideal candidate will have at least SOME relevant experience with HTML/CSS or basic scripting/programming such as javascript and will love computers and the internet. Must be a strong self-starter and problem solver and know how to google things.  Ideally you will own a laptop to work on but a workstation can be provided if necessary. Local to Richmond is ideal but if you want to drive from the middle of nowhere every day I won't judge you."
29cwio,0,2014-06-28,Advice,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/29cwio/advice/,"I apologize in advance if questions similar to mine have been asked before. I have browsed through this subreddit, and haven't found the information I've book looking for yet (but of course I could've easily overlooked something so again, sorry for any redundancy). 

I'm currently finishing my third year at a UC and I'm double majoring in Econ (BA) and Stats (BS). On a side note - I'll be spending an extra year trying to finish up so I still have 2 more years to go before I graduate. I was just hoping to get some advice but just for some quick background (which will help explain the extra year I have to take) when I began college I was pursuing medicine, and most of my experience is tailored towards that field (shadowing physicians, doing clinical research, working for hospice for several years.. etc - but I have also worked as an event coordinator for Habitat for Humanity) and the extra year is due to the science classes I had to take - but once I decided to take my math/basic stat pre-req for medical school, I was more and more interested in it. So to make a long story short, after a few months of arguing with myself and some self discovery by sitting in on a few math, stat and econ classes - in the last year I've changed my major to doubling in Econ and Stats. From there, I've been looking further and further into becoming an actuary by thoroughly looking through job descriptions, which programs they use, essentially what they're whole job consists of and I've really been intrigued by the whole career. 

I'll be taking my first exam late September and I'm hoping to complete the second exam before I graduate as well. But my biggest concern is my absolute lack of hands on experience in the field. I'm extremely eager to get some experience but I'm also limited by a lack of free time to give (most internships I can find need about 20hrs/week over the academic year and 40hrs/week over summer - and unfortunately, I have classes that I'm taking over summer) 

I'm happy to call up as many actuarial firms as I can to ask for maybe some sort of a shadowing position, if they give those out, or an internship but would it look bad if I only asked for just a few hours a week (I'm hoping for 12hrs/week)? Because I'm extremely, extremely eager to start working and learning, but at the same time - I don't want my grades to suffer and I'm currently self teaching myself some programs, hence my lack of time. 

Also, is my previous experience is now a waste? Because I've really been able to build up my leadership and communication skills with my volunteering/internship experience so I'm hoping it won't be too much of a waste since it's all centered around the medical field (with the exception of Habitat for Humanity). And would tutoring be a good job to note on my resume? My stats professor wants me to tutor in some statistic courses (probably would be some lower division stat courses and probably in regression analysis and the hours aren't bad at all) so I'm wondering if that could also be seen well by anyone reading my resume. (Also - I'm aware there's nothing that could probably replace having real experience, but would taking more computer science classes also help my chances of getting a job? I'm currently taking a programming class that's helping me learn C, and as I mentioned earlier, I'm also teaching myself Python + Java on my own right now and I have lots of experience working in Stata, and of course I'm learning R as well - still in beginner phase for R though). 

I'm really nervous about the strength of my job application if I happen to have barely any experience once I graduate and the most that I've learned about the actuarial field is pretty much from the internet (mostly job descriptions, cheesy videos, types of programs they work with and so on) but I don't know any actuaries myself, so a part of me feels I may be missing out on information about the in's and out's of the actuarial field. 

I would genuinely appreciate any advice and I seriously thank you in advance. 

EDIT - I'm sorry for the long post! I kept typing and didn't realize what happened until I clicked enter. "

I've been slowly realizing that I have Nparents, and it's been something I have really been struggling with. I just moved out and live about an hour away from them now, and am starting my new job in a week.

My Nmom used to have access to all my accounts (Gmail, Facebook, etc.), including both my checking and savings account. The money in both of the accounts was mostly made by me from internships, but a small portion was given to me by grandparents for college that I had left over. My Nmom promised that I would get access to my bank account once I graduated, but after graduation, she refused to hand over the password and kept making up excuses. She told me she wanted to hang onto it for a while longer so I ""don't do anything stupid."" After getting really sick of this, I went to the bank and made a new account, so now she can't access it anymore.

Once they found out I did this, they called me and yelled at me for a good hour. They said this was the worst thing I could have done, and that they would never do this to their enemy. They called me ungrateful multiple times, and also agreed this was worse than if I was to physically assault them, which I never have. They then said they weren't going to talk to me until I apologized, and that they were very disappointed in me. My Ndad told me this was completely uncalled for, since my mom sacrificed her life and career to raises me and stay home with me while growing up. They said some other things that were pretty horrible as well, and it made me feel like complete garbage.

What felt like the right and best decision at the time now doesn't feel so great. They don't have access to any of my accounts now, which is a huge relief, but I feel terrible for doing it. This is the first time I have ever went up against my parents, and it feels awful, but slightly liberating and freeing at the same time.

Sorry for all the rambling. I guess I was wondering what you guys think. Was it justified for me to do that, and should I apologize to them? I have been feeling a number of emotions these past few days. I know you guys don't have the whole story, but it would be awesome to get some input. 


**EDIT**: Oh my goodness! I did not expect to get this many replies! Thank you all so much for your advice, comments, and humor! Every comment has helped in more ways than you know. Just to clarify, right now I have two accounts I made just in my name, and I still have the two other ones with the minimum balance required just in case I ever changed my mind. I'll be closing the other two with my mom's name on them as soon as I can. They haven't ruined my credit or anything which is a huge relief. I just got off the phone with my mom and she's still waiting for an apology, and when I wouldn't give it to her, she hung up on me. She's trying to tell me my whole family thinks I made a bad decision and every relative I have things I'm garbage. But after reading all of your comments, I'm not going to let it bother me. She's also trying to rope my boyfriend in, and she is pulling the same narcissistic behavior on him that she's doing to me. Luckily, he sees it and immediately shuts her down. She also contacted both of his parents and is trying to put them in the middle.

Again, thank you all so much. I feel very confident about my decision and will stand by it. I'm going to try going LC/NC for a while, and hopefully they will realize on their own that they are overreacting big time and really need to calm down."

#^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So I met this girl on my last internship and we both hit it off really well. We started dating and about 4 weeks later she had to go back to her home state to move back in with her parents while she looked for a job.

Prior to that, we had already determined that we wanted to move somewhere together because we both feel like we have great chemistry and think that there might be something there. So of course we've kept in contact the past 4 weeks via calls, texts, and skype, and it's been all good up until the past week or so. (so just to be clear, we've only been dating for 2 months)

About a week ago, she went on a vacation with her parents. During that time, I didn't hear from her very often (which I expected), but when I did hear from her it was usually very superficial things asking about my day, etc. After the trip, nothing changed. She has seemed to be more distant since then.

You have to understand that prior to this, we would skype every night usually for an hour or two. Usually we would take our shirts off just for fun, and she usually initiated this moreso than me although I did my fair share as well. We also have done a little more than that on skype, but the point is that it's been completely different this past week. She hasn't made ANY kind of sexual conversation with me whatsoever. She hasn't told me that she misses me or how much she loves me (she would do this all the time). She just seems withdrawn and somewhat cold now, like I no longer interest her or something.

Thing is, we've both found jobs in another state together and if everything goes according to plan, we'll be moving out there within the next month, give or take. We've been talking about this process recently and she's still very much on board. She hasn't made any indication that she is having second thoughts about the whole thing and actually seems fairly excited. But I just can't help but feel like something is different between us.

She has been busier this past week. She got a part-time job at Starbucks and is working 3-4 hours a day, so maybe that has something to do with it. When I talked to her about this, I told her pretty much everything that I said here, that I feel like our communication has been different and I used the example of how we haven't done anything ""fun"" on skype for the past week (which was previously a daily occurrence). She said that she feels like our communication was off but that she just assumed that it was because she had been busier recently and because of the whole ""long distance thing"", but that she thought it would be better once we're together again.

I'm sure that those factors come into play but I can't help but feel like there's something else going on that she's not telling me. Granted, I'm not working right now myself (I'm studying for a board exam), but no matter what I'm doing any given day I'm pretty much always thinking about her, how much I miss her, and the fact that things just haven't been the same recently.

I know that I can't force her to act a certain way, and that's the last thing I would want anyways. But it just hurts to feel like she doesn't want to do these things with me any more. I asked her if we could skype tonight, otherwise I don't think we would've. And during our conversation, she just didn't seem into ""me"" like she has been the past 3 weeks. She told me that after we got off skype she was going to watch tv for an hour and then go to bed. That kinda hurt too because we had only been talking for about 10-15 minutes at that point and it felt like her tv show was more important than talking to me was...

So now I feel like I'm being incredibly insecure which I know is a huge turn off. But at the same time, I can't help these feelings that I'm experiencing. Something IS different, whether or not it's legitimately because she's more busy now or because there's something she's not telling me, I don't know.

If someone could tell me not to worry cause it'll all be ok once we're together, I'd say ""fine"". But the thing is, I don't know that for sure. On one hand she still seems totally into moving to this other state with me and truly beginning our relationship there, but on the other hand, I'm starting to feel like less of a priority to her and less interesting to her in general and it scares me to wonder if this is what it's going to be like after we move. At the end of the day, I feel like there may be a reasonable explanation to all this and that I'm being very insecure, and if this is the case, what should I do? Are my concerns justified? Am I being too insecure?

I think the answer is to just not bring this up anymore and see how things play out. She's supposed to fly out here in 2-3 weeks so I guess I can gauge how she feels about me when that happens..."

* I'll be a junior this fall
* I'm pursing a double major in math and computer science
* I'll go to my school's fall career fair and ""info day"" for CS students

I've thought about creating a Linkedin profile. I would like to find real interviews at fortune 500 companies (preferably software companies). I'm worried that with a LinkedIn profile, I'll just receive spam and intern offers from small local companies.

Any stories and knowledge would be greatly appreciated.

29dft9,2,2014-06-29,No offers from previous leadership conferences; one more coming up in July...,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/29dft9/no_offers_from_previous_leadership_conferences/,"(if you don't want to read all this, you can just skip to the question section at the bottom)

First, some quick background:
I will be a senior in the fall at a school with a top ten accounting program (very heavy recruiting from Big 4, regional, and local firms). I am interested in a summer internship in tax for next year. My GPA is 3.87/4.00 and I am a member of Beta Alpha Psi. I went to every single recruiting dinner last semester with all the tips from the 'Accounting Recruiting Guide' in mind. Importantly, however, I want to work in a different region from my school, so these dinners only have members of the local offices. After interviewing this past spring with the local offices and being referred to the offices in my prospective city, I have/had three leadership conferences this summer (all for offices in my top city):

Conference A: The firm-wide conference for a prominent regional firm (top ten public accounting in US). They have individual office conferences as well for other students. There were about 75 students at this conference (about 5 from the office I am looking at). This was a three-day conference focusing on charity, teamwork, and networking (no interviews).

Conference B: Local office conference for one of the Big Four. There were 12 students at this conference. This was a one-day conference with a teamwork activity and interviews for an internship position (one partner and one senior manager). I was told they only have one intern in each practice for the summer, but I was the only one of the conference participants who wanted tax in the summer.

Conference C: State-wide conference for a prominent national firm (also top ten). I've been told there will be 10 students at this conference (extremely selective). This will be a two-day conference that will involve interviews for internships.

I went to A and B fully prepared and gave it my all, especially with A since it was my top choice. After both of these conferences (and within one hour of each other), I was emailed by both firms that I had no future with the offices I was looking at. For the past month this has been eating at me like mad. I have no idea what I did to completely destroy my chances like that. I took initiative with the team tasks, made sure to treat everyone with the utmost respect, networked myself as strongly as I could, and stayed around talking with firm members until the very end. I asked for some feedback after the rejection email, but neither firm gave me anything. I felt great coming out of both and I have no idea what happened.

My concern now turns to C, which is coming up in a few weeks. I want to make sure I can improve upon whatever mistakes I made last time and secure this internship offer.

My questions:

What have been the experiences of others with these conferences? What am I missing here? How can I better my chances with C? Should I bother reapplying for A and B in the fall during recruiting season? How do I get networking experience with Big 4/regional firms in my top city when I don't even know the recruiters for some of these firms? I'm just sort of lost in how I get from where I am to an internship. Any help would be very much appreciated. Sorry for the long post.

29dhxh,26,2014-06-29,RANT-Saw my medical records. PISSED OFF,fastingmaniac,migraine,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/29dhxh/rantsaw_my_medical_records_pissed_off/,"So long story short, I got a traffic ticket for not having my insurance and registration current.  As a single mom who doesn't get child support, has daily headaches and never knows when a truly severe migraine will hit and an ER or ATU (Ambulatory Treatment Unit) visit (outpatient treatment that means you don't have to wait for hours in the ER and your doc can just order your go-to cocktail and you get treated immediately.  Honestly, ATU is like a magical fairy land sprinkled with Unicorn dust where the nurses are amazing and you are able to get help immediately.)  

Anyways, In order to prove to the court that I am not just a scofflaw who doesn't want to pay my bills, I brought proof to court that I have an actual disability, continue to manage to work a full-time job, and am raising a daughter who is doing amazing in school and in her many extra curricular activities.

I got copies of my medical records and was LIVID.  When I have been in the ER I find that about 50% of the docs who triage me as I am sobbing and vomiting non-stop see my detailed records (I always go to the same hospital on purpose to keep my records clear), ask me what my go-to cocktail is, tell me I clearly know my disease better than them, and hook me up with exactly with what I need.  I enormously appreciate this.

The other 50% of the time I get some asshole who knows sooooooooo much more than me (and has probably never had a migraine in their life) and tells me stuff  ""like no narcotics for my pain.""  Well Fuck You Intern, check my long list of allergies and horrid reactions to most standard migraine meds, see that the cocktail I request is very mild and I usually only need 1-2 mg of Dilaudid mixed in with it to completely relieve my pain.  Wow, what a drug-seeker I am. . . .  If I could take Tryptans I would.  If I hadn't gone blind overnight from Topomax after developing sudden onset glaucoma, or could even take some Benadryl without having severe dystonia that can result in a seizure--I WOULD YOU MOTHER FUCKING ASSHOLE.  I have numerous unusual drug allergies--Deal with it.

Some of the doctor's notes in my file from the various random docs/interns that I have seen over the last 12 months made me feel like they didn't believe me or felt like I was drug-seeking.  Often the doc assessed me AFTER I had rec'd my meds and was better and noted that 'I didn't appear sick at all.'  Fuck you asshole.  I had been puking bile from two days ago and sobbing uncontrollably for hours in your ER and you didn't witness that.  

My new headache doc has been trying to get me to go to the ER or the ATU BEFORE I get to the sobbing and puking stage where I can barely function in order to head off the severe pain, get help sooner, and get relief sooner.  Now? After reading some of the bullshit in my file?  I feel like I have to go back to waiting until I feel like I am going to die until I seek help.  When I do that?  Sometimes I have to be admitted because the migraine is 'stuck' and can't be fixed very easily.

I just want help when I need it.

I just want to not feel terrible all of the time.

I feel like I should not have to suffer so. . . .

I fucking hate some of these doctors.  

I. Just. Want. Help.  

And I don't think I should have to present as a super pathetic mess to get it.  People suck.  (Thanks for listening.)

EDIT:  Thank you for listening.  Thank you for the suggestions.  Just thank you.  I appreciate it more than you know.  I don't know anyone IRL that lives this life.  This reddit is a sanity-saver for me!"

29dlzg,3,2014-06-29,Increasingly forced to troubleshoot things outside of my expertise,lokufd,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/29dlzg/increasingly_forced_to_troubleshoot_things/,"This is probably the wrong place to ask, but I enjoy the professionalism in this community and I am sure that others were at some point in a similar position. 

I am not a fully fledged sysadmin. I'm going to school majoring in a degree for computer information systems, In the meanwhile I intern as helpdesk and tinker in my free time. In short, very knowledgeable I am not. 

My father is a handyman of all types, but his trade is an electrician. As such, he deals with installing and maintaining a lot of different things. His english however  is not very good, and lately he's been putting a lot of responsibility on my shoulders asking me to help him. He is a very hands-on person.

Lately, he tends to pick up projects that he doesn't really understand, and assumes that because I am good with computers and speak english, I can help him out. This is really frustrating for me, because some of the things that he asks of me are completely out of my desired field. I understand why he does this. Some contractors have big projects that can lead to other projects.


But this is bad for me for a lot of reasons: As an example, he recently accepted the task of installing some intercoms that are configurable through the computer. He gets the wiring part down, but has no fucking idea how the software works and that's where I apparently step in. I have no idea how an intercom works. And his goto reply to that is ""read the manual"". If I tell him I don't understand, his signature response is ""I thought you were good with computers, what's wrong?""

....

How, or at which fucking point can I explain to him that ""no, just because it works on a computer doesn't mean I understand how it works""? And ""no, helping you out once or twice does not make my assistance a commonplace thing""? 

Is it selfish of me to even think this way? I'm finding myself left increasingly frustrated slogging through manuals for shit not even remotely related to sysadmining, like a fucking truck cooler. (Fucking AL52 - Alarm List Full)

I also find it INCREDIBLY STUPID that he picks up projects he doesn't know how to do. His goto response to this is ""If I don't do it, how else will I learn it?"" 

I just don't know anymore. Am I in the wrong here? Is there any way that I can break it down to him that he is wrong? His lack of basic fucking common sense has left me at a loss of words. 

Sorry for the rant.

29dpw9,0,2014-06-29,Am I [19M] asking too much of my girlfriend [20F]?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29dpw9/am_i_19m_asking_too_much_of_my_girlfriend_20f/,"I'm currently a university student heading into my junior year, and at my university you are forced to live on campus for the first two years of your undergraduate degree. Last semester, I planned on getting a 2 bed apartment with my roommate at the time because it would save us both money. 

Fast forward to summer, and I get an internship offer from a local software company, and I had nowhere to stay so I asked my girlfriend if I could stay in her apartment for the summer while she was gone. Her roommate is also at the apartment, so she had no problem with it. About two weeks ago, my roommate from last semester messages me and tells me that he won't be able to attend university next semester, so all of a sudden I have nowhere to stay for next semester.

My first thought was to stay with my girlfriend for the semester until I figured something out, so I asked her roommate if she would be okay with it. The roommate had no problem with it, so I then asked my girlfriend, because she was my last option.

Right after I asked, she flipped out on me and told me to go live on campus again, even though she knew I couldn't afford it. I was extremely hurt by this because for two years I had always been there for her when she needed me and I never asked anything of her up until this point. 

I then told her that I couldn't be with someone who didn't want to be there for someone who had been there for her for so long.. Her reasoning was that she wasn't ready for me to live with her but the truth is that neither was I. However, she was my last option because I really can't afford anything else at this point as my family is going through a rough time

What really made this all worse is that I'm an international student and my girlfriend knew that if I couldn't find a place then I would have to leave the country..

Haven't talked to her since, but everyone I've talked to (including her friends) have said that what she did was pretty unfair.

I'm asking on here because I'd like an unbiased opinion on my situation.. Did I fuck up? 

Tl;Dr:  girlfriend was last option, told me I couldn't stay with her even though that would mean me having to leave the country "
29e0f8,6,2014-06-29,I broke up with my girlfriend; here's some things.,The_Trevaler,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/29e0f8/i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_heres_some_things/,"Not funny, not concise, not filled with bodily fluids, but it's a fuck up. If this doesn't quite meet the subreddit's rules, tell me and I shall fix. If you can think of a better place for this to be, tell me and I will move the post.

**Background**: We met in freshman year of college, it would have been three years in the fall, she helped me through severe depression (kept me alive, really), we've been long-distance for a little over a year now (from two hours during the majority of the year, six hours during last summer and through the holidays), and as of May, she moved to the west coast to try and get an internship in her field (I am on the east). I Love this woman- she is everything I thought I wanted from a partner and so much more besides. She has been wanting me to fly out there to see her, it would have cost in excess of several hundred dollars; but I'm at a point in my life where literally ever dollar must go to tuition in order for me to continue my education.

We have worked through some pretty major problems and life events for the both of us, we have weathered every storm thrown at us, until now.

I am her first ""real"" relationship, she is my second.

I also think it's important to mention that I have been considering proposing to her, not within the next year, but shortly after that, yes. As such, I have been asking a lot of my elder family and fellow students how marriage changes people and what to avoid doing.

**The Problem**: We have fought (through text and on the phone= long distance) literally every other day for the past two weeks and have been fighting pretty constantly for two months now, the problem ultimately stemming from her inability to control her anger and respect me as a partner. She has always had problems with her anger, but only recently has it gotten so bad.

What I mean by this is that we would fight about something insignificant, a small thing that wouldn't even be a blip in the radar if we were physically together and nothing more than a speed bump in the past portions of being long distance. But as of late, she would fly off the handle, tell me that she didn't even believe that I missed her (because I didn't have the money to spend to go see her), say outlandish things that began with ""I'm not even sure why I'm angry..."" or ""I'm really trying not to be a bitch -is bitchy-""

**The Break Up** So, I'm playing RDR, texting her, nothing out of the ordinary, when she starts accusing me of not missing her. Now, I Love this woman, I want to spend the rest of my life with her (present tense, indeed), and wake up crying because she isn't next to me when I reach out from a bad dream: I miss her. All of a sudden, it occurs to me that this is going to continue, possibly for the rest of my life, unless she changes how she interacts with me, or I break up with her.

So, without thinking it, I tell her that we're broken up for the rest of the summer, that I will take care of the pets she left with me, and to call me whenever she wants them back.

My thinking is that, if she realizes that how she's been treating me is not okay and is willing to work through it, she will contact me either at or prior to the ending of summer and we will see how we are then. Or, should she not, then I will have broken up with her for good and won't have an unhealthy relationship.

**My Fears**: She won't want to be with me at the end of the summer, she does but the relationship continues to be abusive, we get back together but have massive trust issues to work out, she takes her own life.

I Love her.

Bee, I Love you.

Update: Spent the better part of an evening in contact with her father; I've resolved to give this a few days, let us both get our heads back on straight, and then see if she wants to talk/is even willing to talk to me"
29eh4k,2,2014-06-29,What should I know about working for a startup?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/29eh4k/what_should_i_know_about_working_for_a_startup/,"I am an older college student, working on an IT-related degree, and with about 3-4 years of ""soft"" tech experience (tech support, local computer shop, simple web design). Through a friend, I have an offer to work at a startup company. It would be a user support type role, with some additional responsibilities and a chance to move into more of a tech role as I learn and the company grows. It's only about 6-7 people right now, through the first 2 phases of user-testing, and starting the pilot soon, but seems like it will be stable. 

The company itself seems stable and promising, but the salary is not going to be the best, and I will up for either a killer commute or for a move in the future. The plan now is to train onsite for a couple weeks, then work remotely most days, with one or two days a week on-site after that in my current role, but with a plan for the future to relocate closer to the company and take on a more involved technical role after graduation. 

The pay is not the greatest, but it is more than I am making at my current internship (although most of that will go to the commute costs). The main beneifts is that it seems like I will have a lot of chances to learn and work with things I am interested in doing more and that there is potential for me to grow into a role that will fit my long-term career goals better. I'm just wondering if this is all realistic.

I know that there is a high failure rate for startups and am not looking to get rich quick off of equity or anything like that, but it seems like a good opportunity to learn and get some real-world experience. I'm wondering what sort of things I need to ask about and what sort of things I should keep in mind and plan for if/when I do start."

Dear Creatures,

I have been a fan since mid-2009.  I am married, and I have an 11 month old son.  

Since Jan 2012 my life has been absolute crap.  I lost 2 jobs. 1) Because I took too many days off because I was taking care of my wife when she was pregnant. 2) As a bookkeeper I found out the CEO was purposefully running the business into the ground. I also was working for free as an unpaid intern since last November.  

My wife and son left last September to visit my in-laws IN EGYPT, because we know they wouldn't have another chance to see him until he was at least 5 or 6.

I was jobless and alone.  I hated it.  I had no friends because all my creature loving buddies went off to different jobs in different locations and we drifted apart. I had no money, and my family was not near me. 

I wanted to say thank you because you helped me.  There would be days I didn't want to get out of bed and not look for work. But, I'd open youtube on my phone and watch your videos. Your videos and humor gave me the inspiration to keep getting up with a smile on my face. If I was nervous for an interview. I'd think of one of your videos to make me laugh so I could go in without looking anxious or desperate.

In April, I got a good paying job with health, dental, and retirement benefits. My wife and son will be back TOMORROW.  I am very happy and excited. 

You helped me get through a small slump in my life by keeping laughing and making great videos. Thank you!

Finally, do not listen to your detractors, haters, and naysayers. As someone said, ""Do what you want and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind."" I and everyone here on this sub love you all.  Yeah, we may prefer 1 over another, but hey even parents have a favorite kid.

Keep up the good work.

Also, long-ish story before pics at the bottom.

A little backstory... as I kid growing up I hated Phys Ed of any kind, buried my nose into any sci-fi or ancient history book I could find, and was actively encouraged by my parents to disregard sports and focus on my education. Makes sense since I grew up in a trailer park and my mom dearly wanted me to be able to get out of that situation. 

Around the 4th grade, my father's mother died and (he was already pretty severely depressed) he got to the point where he was admitted to the VA for treatment. Long story short, because of the extra stress on my mom, we started eating frozen TV dinners, fast food, and that sort of awful food regularly just because it was the path of least resistance. You can see the huge weight shift in school photos between 4th, 5th, and 6th grade, sadly those photos are at home with my mom so I can't back up what I'm saying.

This is when I began a habit that has stuck with me since then: consciously sucking my gut in for almost all hours of the day, even when sitting or exercising. 

Going farther forward, I entered an experimental high school that was focused on aviation and catered to ""sports of the mind"". It didn't have PE of any kind other than a self-guided program you made yourself and just needed a parent signature on... I used the walking between class as PE hours... So that was a solid 4 years of essentially no exercise beyond what I got from hiking during Boy Scout outings.

---

College is where things started to turn around a bit, I ran into the martial art known as Kendo, and started practicing that twice a week. Eventually I started 'running' on the ellipticals at the university gym with friends a few days out of the week, but fairly inconsistently. I graduated high school at about 220, and the end of freshman year I had come down to 215. Not huge, but it was my first year of being anything close to regularly physically active in a good 4 years so I was happy. 

As college went on and I started training a bit harder at Kendo, I started eating more at the dorm cafeterias, and not in proportion to the training. In the summer of 2012, during an internship at Intel in Santa Clara, I stepped on a scale at the office gym and saw something disheartening: 241.8.

[This is me being a fat turd](http://imgur.com/a/UcjVg) on a dock near the Golden Gate bridge that summer. The embarrassment is extreme and I've never shared these before, but I think they're important to share as a reference for how far I've come since then.

I tried doing keto for the rest of that summer, but failed miserably. My salads were full of potatoes and corn, and not nearly enough fat. I was a silly boy then.

---

I tried again from February of 2013 until my graduation that June, as the brother of my girlfriend at the time was doing keto himself and he kindly helped me learn the ways of doing it (mostly) properly. The little progress I made during that time evaporated eventually between the stress of moving to a new job in a different state and a rough breakup at the end of August.

I tried to cope with things the right way - I joined on of the Intel workout programs during lunch breaks and tried to eat less (non-keto), but that petered out after a month. Eventually I stopped doing Kendo as well, out of self-loathing and a feeling of continually getting worse as time went on. 

Come January (you can guess where this is going) I restarted keto and began Stronglifts 5x5 to try and get myself out of that shit-rut. Stronglifts was fun, but after 2 months I saw no real change in my weight or physique, so I quit out of frustration.

---

April is when things finally started to turn around for me. I dusted off my armor and went back to Kendo practices whenever possible. Even better than that: a group of friends from Intel and myself decided to do a group weight loss competition with each other starting then and ending in July. 

Knowing that my friends would be aware of my actual weight, regardless of how much my gut was sucked in, as well as the general upturn in my emotional health around that time was exactly what I needed in terms of motivation. I read up on keto PROPERLY, and and stuck to the diet, with the occasional tiny cheat once every two or so weeks, keeping it limited to a single meal or treat. I even shared the good word of Keto with one of the girls in the team and have her converted!

Doing keto properly in the sense of not only restricting carbs, but keeping fats high AND keeping a good but not exact track of my caloric intake, has done some wonders. One of the other girls in the group who hadn't seen me since we started in April, without any prompting, commented on how much skinnier I looked at a Game of Thrones viewing party. This last week, I had to get my suit re-tailored and taken in for a wedding yesterday, and all of my old high school friends who I hadn't seen since graduation 5 years ago commented on my weight improvement. The feels are real right now. 

Now that I'm lighter, I've started doing some simple body-weight exercise like the beginner set up on /r/bodyweightfitness. I've ramped up Kendo practice to four times a week, and feel faster without having to move so much body around. 

Best of all, my gut doesn't stick out past my chest anymore. I don't have to hold my breath anymore to look slimmer. The last photo is me actually trying to push my gut out. TRYING. The struggle now will be to break that habit so I can use that extra lung capacity for Kendo! I can't wait to see my progress in another three months!

Thank you everybody on /r/keto and /r/ketorecipes for the motivating progress pics and stories, and the incredibly creative food ideas that have made it easy for me to stick to this lifestyle. KETO ON!

29ewog,0,2014-06-29,"Treated terribly for the past 6 months as an intern, then shown the door...what can I do now?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/29ewog/treated_terribly_for_the_past_6_months_as_an/,"At the start of the year I agreed to work as an intern (40 hours a week) working for practically nothing in the office at a small company for 6 months on the agreement that I would be offered a position after this period on a very good salary.

In the interview I was told that I would be offered a permanent position, including a very high wage and that the 6 months would be a time where I would be shown the ropes (I later discovered this was promised to every person that came in for an interview).

To begin with I enjoyed the job, within a week my boss made me feel uneasy, about 2 months in things changed drastically. There were 13 other employees and the Boss working in the office. The staff warned me that the boss was very difficult and if they could leave they would immediately. I started to see this side of him myself, he would aggressively swear at staff and clients. He would swear at me and call me names on a daily bases. 

Furthermore, he began making sexual comments to me despite the fact that he has a wife and 3 children. He would comment on my clothing, stare at my chest and body when speaking to me and constantly told me I was pretty, he would touch my hand, arm and shoulder any chance he could, one time he even tried to take a photo of me on his ipad claiming that it was for a staff section on the website (which never happened).

He accidentally sent me an email that was for someone else talking about how he thought I was stupid, then went on my email and deleted it thinking I hadn't seen it.

My colleagues told me that he had a habit of using interns and making excuses not to take them on once the intern period was finished.

But during the entire internship he promised me a full-time position at the company with this grand wage and I believed him. Once the internship had finished he told me that the next week I would start, I worked one week where, at the end of the week he told me via email that he would contact me at some point the week after because he wasn't sure if he could take me on because profits were down (which was untrue the company was doing very well). He never contacted me to tell me he didn't want me back I found out from my colleagues and he didn't pay me for the time I spent there once my internship had finished.

He is still using my work email, replying to my emails as me.

Furthermore he is continuing to bad mouth me to his employees (I made good friends with pretty much everyone that worked there and we still chat on a daily basis). I worked really hard while I was there and managed to increase sales. Since I've left sales have been down. 

What can I do now? I feel as though I was used and wasted a lot of time to be treated like crap.

Now I just have to be angry ""If only I did it the first day of preorder ... I would get it in just a few days"". I hoped that at E3 they would announce CV1 for Christmas, but with the silence at E3 and Facebook acquisition, we will not get the CV1 for one year, so this will be worth it.

29f5uc,8,2014-06-29,"Graduating soon, no experience. Help?",text_tidbits,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29f5uc/graduating_soon_no_experience_help/,"Hi.

A little background. I'm in my mid 20's and graduating with a bachelors in CS from a upper tier, but not top tier, school. 

I'm essentially rushing through the curriculum and finishing my degree in 1.75 years since I pay a flat fee per quarter rather than paying by unit. Due to this fast pace, I haven't had much chance to take time and learn languages/frameworks taught outside of school; I spend literally all of my time to master my courses and obtain a strong foundation in Computer Science concepts rather than just 'learning a language'. I have, currently, a 3.9 major GPA - but with 0 internship or experience in computer science (I have experience in other fields unrelated to compsci).

I have tried to grab an internship this summer, but they all denied me since nearly all of them wanted individuals with knowledge in web based languages and frameworks - which I did not learn yet. 


I'm graduating in early March 2015 - taking heavy courseloads until then. I have a bit of time this summer and I'm taking the time to learn Javascript and PHP. 

So my primary question: How competitive will I be after I graduate in getting a competitive salary with no experience, but high GPA? I'm still trying to land an internship this summer, but as time goes on, my hopes are diminishing. What else can I do to increase my odds of landing a good job upon graduation and to make myself more competitive?


Languages that I know and expertise relative to undergrad level:

C++ (high)

Python (moderate)

SQL (low - but good at relational algebra)

Java (low - used it only for one school quarter)

HTML/CSS/JS (in the process of learning right now)


I'm trying to get myself into GitHub as well to make a portfolio at least, but the task seems daunting. How difficult and time consuming is it to make a noticeable portfolio? (I'm trying to avoid putting school-based projects into my portfolio.)"

I have a couple of issues that i don't know how to solve, but i also don't want to talk with my family about it, in part because i don't talk about myself often, and because i don't like to talk with certain persons of my family because they will use everything i say against me. 
***
##First - Eating Disorder? 
I'm not really sure how to describe it, I'm 185cm ^(6ft?) tall and I weight 61kg ^(133pounts?), which is means that i have a BMI of 17.8 which is really low. And I can see that I'm in fact really skinny and i was like this since ever, i even used to try to never wear T-Shirts because i felt like i was unattractive but i just don't care anymore. 

Not really sure why exactly but might have something to do with the fact that I feel stomach sick almost everyday. Basically after leaving for work / school, most of the days i fell stomach sick, i have to go to the bathroom. *(This used to be a huge problem back when i was in High School since there was a policy that you couldn't go to the bathroom in the middle of a class.)* And i don't really have much appetite for food, especially things with chocolate or pastry of some sorts, it makes me fell sick just thinking of it. But i normally end up eating an apple and drinking an yogurt. At lunch it depends, for example, if the food is heavy (if the food is too greasy, or with to much fat, or to sweet, not really sure) sometimes i fell like i want to throw up, but is not often, the other days i normally just have no appetite and will not eat much. So i normally don't eat desert or anything like that. *(Strange because unless i'm super nervous i have no problem with things that are basically just sugar, e.g.   Mints, Candies, Ice Cream (if doesn't have much milk / chocolate), Jelly, but i can't eat things like Custard, Cake, or thinks like that UNLESS i'm at home and VERY RELAXED.)* After lunch since i don't eat much i get a bit hungry but i don't really know what to eat, because unless is fruit (with i don't eat that much if i'm not at home) i don't know that to eat, for example, if try to eat some cookies i will eat one and will fell without appetite again and a bit sick, but i will still get hungry. In the afternoon i would normally just eat a bread but no to much. When i get home is normally better, specially because food at home are more ""simple"" and easier to eat and i will normally eat soup (btw, i don't like soup with big pieces of anything, the simple fact of chewing makes me uncomfortable). But i will still get hungry really fast and the same thing happens because i will end up not eating anything until i go to bed, because i try to eat i will just lose all the appetite. Before i go to bad i usually drink a large cup of milk and a banana. 
But the biggest problem of all is the in the morning, i basically don't eat anything other then a cup of tea (no milk), and some toast, but even the i will fill sick. 

##Second - I GET FUCKING NERVOUS WITH ANYTHING
Every thing gets me nervous as fuck, especially new things. For example the other day my colleagues organized a dinner at a restaurant, but i was so fucking nervous that I ended up having to go to the bathroom 2 times in the middle of the dinner one of them being to throw up. Same thing happened at dinner at my aunts birthday, i had to go to the bathroom to throw up, and almost didn't eat anything because i was so afraid idk what.
Also when is exams weeks (finals) I will be felling super sick for days and will probably eat not to much, and throw up a couple of times, and having to go to the bathroom every 10mins in the morning. 

##Third - All the rest
I'm 19yo guy with almost no friends. I never had a real problem talking with people after i met them for a while, but is just coworkers / colleagues, but as soon they are not in workplace or school i will never talk to them again. Maybe trade talk to them if they play games that i play or but other then that I never talk to people. For example a old colleague of mine asked me how i was doing the other day on facebook and he asked if i wanted to go grab a coffee but i never answered back, because I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, I'm ashamed of me, because i don't have work (i'm just in an internship because my course / school), i failed to go University 2 times. I have NO GIRLFRIEND no other friend that i talk with, i'm fucking poor and i have the same cloths that i had 2 years ago, i don't have driver license at 19 (with is really rare in my country) because it is too expensive for my family to pay (also because they don't want to), I don't do anything other the pretending that i code (with i don't because i can't even focus to do simple tasks and cry to myself that i don't have a good computer, but i'm still one of the best in my class because they all suck). And because that i have to give all the money that i have been saving to my mom because we her shop is not selling almost anything, and my parents and to divorce and i had to move with my mom to my grandmothers (and family) with argue with my mom every month or so. And my dad moved to grandparents house with they will be forced to leave really soon. And my dad might be sick and as no self esteem (or at least i think so) becuase i stoped being with is friends. Even tho is the most intelligent person that i ever talked with and taught me everything i know, and did everything he could for me to succeed and still is on my side even tho i flailed so many times. 

**TLDR: I'm a fucking pussy who can't even do simple things properly and just pretends that he is really smart because he read some article somewhere, but can't do anything. Not even eating properly when he is hungry. And can just cry about his life.**"

I'm trying to get back into the habit of working out, but finding myself struggling a lot more than I expected. I will work out for a few days, then skip a day, but then a day turns to two, which turns to four and six, and then I've suddenly gone two weeks without going to work out. And it's making me gain weight, and that's in turn making me depressed, which is making me gain more weight again.

Originally I started at 101kg. I am F/25/5'6, and so of course, that put me in the obese category of the BMI scale. I worked hard for about 8 months, and got down to 90kg. Then my circumstances changed, I got an internship in the US, and for 16 months I didn't work out planned because I didn't have access to a gym, but I still lost another 8kg, putting me at 82kg. Now I'm back home and I just...can't find the motivation. I'm sure it's because I don't have a job and feel hopeless about my current uselessness, and because of that I'm eating more, as well as sitting around more, and that adds up, and I'm back up to 86kg. 

I need to get off my butt and get moving again, so tonight I'm having a final ""feast"", enjoying fresh strawberries with cream, and tomorrow I want to get out again and get moving. Going to start easy by going for a long walk each day, then bumping that up to a combined walk and jog, and hopefully one day I'll be able to make a full jog around my track that I'm plotting out.

I just hope I can stick to it, as I'm closer, yet still so far away from my goal of 70kg (though if I could get to 65 that would be the dream, but I'm trying to be realistic too as I've been overweight my whole life.)

**TL;DR** F/25/5'6. SW: 101kg, CW: 86kg, GW: 70kg. Need to get back into the habit of working out,and hoping that committing myself here will keep my motivated."

Well, I'm not familiar with NJ at all, so I hope you people could help with information and tips that would send me in the right direction.

I'm looking for a cheap place to rent, because the internship is unpaid.
 Furnished since I'll be there only one month. 
A stay of one month and no more must be possible. This means that it is trustworthy, so no catches or any other unpleasant situations. I would like it trouble and stress free.
Near or in Passaic, NJ.

In advance, thank you very much for your effort, and I look forward to your tips!"

Thanks to everyone who made my first prompt awesome, and it's time to change gears and try again!  So, here are a couple of prompts for the illicit romance fans out there, both lurking and active:
******
Scenario 1: Old flames never really die... (MF, romance, cheating)
 
We dated in high school, one of those relationships that took place mainly out of the gossip spotlight,  but one that so many people were secretly jealous of.  It lasted all the way through college, too...a pair of best friends that happened to be steamy lovers on the side.  We exchanged a lot of 'firsts' with each other.  After graduation, a change in one of your parents' jobs forced you to move away.  After a couple months of yearning phone calls and letters to one another, a break-up was, very emotionally, settled on by both of us.  You and I always carried a little torch for one another, no matter how many months went by.  The big city is tempting for a lonely girl, though, and you found yourself back in the dating scene; which paid off in spades when you finally stumbled across a nice guy.  A little too vanilla for your tastes, perhaps, but the best thing you could find that wouldn't remind you of me.
 
Then, the improbable happened.  On the cusp of moving on from one another, I was accepted for an internship not far at all from where you live.  Easily in driving distance, maybe 45 minutes away.  I decide to mail you a letter, giving me time to settle into an efficiency apartment before it arrives in your mailbox.
 
*Hey, gorgeous.  :)  Just letting you know I've accepted a new position in close range of you.  Would love to meet up, catch up, and..basically see you again.  Missed you more than you know.  Love, me.*  And a phone number penned at the bottom.  The same one you remember by heart after whispering the first few numbers out loud.  
 
All those feelings, the long nights, the memories of my fingertips and lips...they're threatening to burst the rickety dam you made yourself build in your mind in order to not be miserable at being apart.  I'm not deluding myself to the possibility that you've moved on, and am willing to offer you sincere congratulations and well-wishes.  But that torch we carry is still dangerously strong, and this rekindling could put the biggest dent in your current relationship...
******
Scenario 2: Society wouldn't understand... (Mf, ageplay, romance, teacher/student)
 
They didn't warn me about this after college.  A PhD in computer science and a BA in education didn't leave me much time to think about a relationship, or including anyone in my stressed-out, busy life.  I'm in my early 30's, now, with little more than 'Doctor' in front of my last name to show for it, which doesn't warm the bed at night very well.  I accepted a teaching position at the local high school.  It turned out to be the either the best, or worst decision of my life.  I haven't quite figured it out, yet.
 
My first year of teaching went well, as far as trying to get a bunch of high school kids the basic electronic education they'll need for later in life goes.  I got the curriculum down to an art, I started figuring out how to make it *fun*, and the kids loved it.  More smiles, less boring lectures, more interactive activities.
 
Life changed drastically in my second year of teaching.  *You* happened.  The quiet little girl in glasses in the back of the room.  The 'mouse' of the group, the one that always had a little shy stammer or your breath caught every time you were called on to answer a question for the class.  So cute, and so under the radar, because all the 'popular' girls were getting all the attention.
 
I don't know when, where, or why you managed to become infatuated with me, but the signs were very obvious.  Little secret smiles, little fidgets, the way you'd shuffle your feet or squeeze your knees together when I'd catch your eyes.  I'd smile back, when the room was distracted, just to see if I was right.  And the way you'd practically float for the rest of the day only confirmed my suspicions.
 
This progressed to the little doodles you'd scribble on the tests and quizzes I'd return to you.  Don't think I didn't see them.  And the more I interacted with you in this very subtle form...the more you were growing on me.  I couldn't let this happen, no one would understand, I'd lose everything I'd worked so hard to build up.  But there was this innocent allure to you that I couldn't ignore.
 
The climactic moment was a little, shaky, handwritten confession of your feelings that I found in my desk one night after classes.  I was done for.  My resolve melted into a puddle to join my heart.  Let that mingle with the plague of years of sleeping alone, and one can only *imagine* the thoughts in my head.  The next day, I decide to see where this will wind up.  So, I return one of your quizzes, with a sub-par grade on it to you, with a note I know you'll pick up on the underlying meaning of.
 
*Thank you for the note, asking for some help.  I'd be happy to answer any questions you have, and you can meet me after school in my office on Tuesdays or Thursdays.  Look forward to seeing you.  -Dr. K*
 
You're a smart girl, you know the risk I'm taking by responding at all.  I doubt you thought you'd receive a response at all, sending your fleeting fantasy into a spiral.  But I have a strong feeling that you are worth it, and then some.  So, putting the next move in your slightly trembling hands, I go about the rest of my day.   I have office hours today, so, all there was to do now, was wait.

In either scenario, my character is around 5'10"", black hair, grey eyes, frameless glasses.  Average build, with a little plush starting to show.  Mid-20's in the first scene; early 30's in the second.
******
**What I want:** I want a big change of pace from my first prompt.  I want this to be a story of forbidden romance.  Some exchanges in this RP will just be roleplayed phone calls or emails, with no physical contact.  There will be a good deal of emotion, both good  (a few passionate meetings) and bad (conflicting morals on whether this is 'right'), so a writer who enjoys that kind of thing is most welcome.  As is the case with me, I'm not in this sub for short-term flings, I want to write a story with you! :)
 
**Please include a character description, including a name, in initial posts, please!  Something as basic as what I've provided is perfect, or expand on it as you see fit.**
 
**What you can expect:**  The softer, more passionate side of me.  Romance, betrayal, mutual desire to keep things on the down-low, secret lives, the rewards and consequences of going against what society defines as 'normal'.  The fantastic clash of one's heart versus one's head.  Lots of room for personal kinks to be worked in.  Expect ageplay, of course, if you take me up on the second scenario, with me being the older party.  Just restating here for blunt clarity.  Lastly, you can expect my replies to not be *nearly* as long as my intros, and replies themselves might not be prompt.  I will get back to you if we write together, but I can't do consistent rapid-fire with life outside reddit pecking away at my free time.
 
**What you won't see:** The standard turn-offs.  No bathroom play, blood, physical violence.  Anything else is absolutely open for discussion, and easy to incorporate if it's something we're both interested in!  The last thing you won't see is me turning away a well thought out and well written reply, no matter how long this post has been up for.  Don't ever think you've missed your chance, as long as you want one.
 
That being said, since this is both a double-prompt, and a hook for all you secret romantics out there...I might get more replies than I can handle, and need to selectively reply to some of them.  Please, *please* don't take this as a sleight if I have to compliment your reply and ask to storytell with you another time.  Thank you!

Oh, how I've missed you!",RAGErER,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/29fk3d/plounge_oh_how_ive_missed_you/,"[](/chibitwi) That's right, Plounge, I have returned after my 7+ day hiatus in New York City, and boy do I have things to talk about that you don't care to hear! 

Potential wall of text incoming...
[](/sp)
[](/twicasualno) For one, the internship didn't go so well; however, it didn't go so bad. I was given a ""Sanity Check"" to perform on some new release for a electronic documentation software for a company called OpenText. Overall, it wasn't too taxing on me, especially since my cousin helped me along the way when I needed it. On the other hand, I only survived three full days of work before my mentality collapsed in on itself. That is, living with my reformed Jewish cousin and his wife took such a toll on me -my anxiety the most, but I'll get to that- that I had to move out and stay at the hotel with my family (who were accompanying me on the trip as a vacation, I should mention) for the remainder of the trip, concluding my work experience early.
[](/sp)
[](/itsfine) For anyone still interested, I'll go into a bit of further detail as to what caused me to need an ejection as a visiting intern: living with anxiety is hard, as many can empathize; that being said, my living with my cousin (who I had only met one other time previously) resulted in my nerves being so frail that 1) eating was similar to being anorexic (no offense to anyone suffering from that dreaded disorder), as I ate only the first, small serving of anything given to me, which was not much, nor was it enjoyable (matzo ball soup is not for me; neither is plain, cooked fettuccine noodles *shudders*) 2) working 9 hours a day doing something I knew little about began to turn me off of my passion for computer sciences; I was afraid that any more would have pushed to pursue another field 3) everyday I feared I would have to face the NY subway system *alone*; luckily I managed to not have to do that before I got out of the situation (the constant fear of being lost in a big, strange city took a lot out of me every morning) 
[](/sp)
[](/seriouslytwiswag)  None of those aforementioned grievances are probably noteworthy to anyone other than me, but I couldn't take it anymore; thus, I discussed my situation with my mom, and she agreed that I need to get help for my nearly crippling anxiety. So, sometime soon, I'll be seeing a counselor or something to help me out; hopefully, I'll be right as rain by this time next year (fingers crossed, right?)! 
[](/sp)
[](/twinervouslaugh) Now that my petty problems are off my chest again, how about some good things? Yeah, that sounds nice. New York was pretty... interesting, in a word; the amount of languages spoken other than English was neat, though I had already expected that fact to be confirmed. Also, every time I saw the name ""Manhattan,"" my initial pronunciation (though in my mind, because why would I ever speak in such a loud and bustling region) was **always** ""*Mane*-hattan,"" so that was amusing. As compared to my vacationing family, I spent my travel money not on myself, but on a very special gift for a very special somepony... I can't share what, or who, how much, though, because that certain somepony may read this before the gift is presented. Also also, I didn't take any pictures with my li'l Twily plush like I should have, but I honestly wouldn't have had much to take pictures of, since I sparsely had time for sight-seeing because of the hellish internship.
[](/sp)
[](/twiokie)  Whelp, that's all I have to ramble about this evening, guys and gals; thanks for listening! As you probably assumed, my vector threads will come back again next Saturday, so keep an eye out! AfterPlounge, Plounge dA group, yadda, yadda, you know the drill. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some re-adjusting to a small town to do! Aaand, done; see 'ya around the Plounge!
[](/sp)
[](/twiread) P.S. I managed to read at least 600,000 words of FimFics over the last week, including the last half of Fo:E, and many others! *Sooo* good!"

One emerging trend is that, in general, graduates are useless when they are employed. I fully understand that as when I was an intern in Intel I was useless for a great deal of time (Maybe all of it?).

Anyway, a lot of grad programs and jobs have training but also there is a sense that this grad will cost us money for X time and after this time they will be useful and being returning. To all the managers out there, in general how much time is this?

I know this will vary by industry, so I would mainly be talking about engineering/IT/technical."
29fw30,8,2014-06-29,I think suicide is the best option,suicide2343,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/29fw30/i_think_suicide_is_the_best_option/,"So I am going to finishing up college next May and with that I will lose the only friends that I have made my entire life (~two people). All of my family that I have been closed to has passed away so those two people are pretty much the only people that I care about in my life.

I am very *academically* successful at college and based on the fields that I am studying, it should not be too difficult to find a job post graduation for me (I already have my first internship this summer and it pays very well but it is not where I would want to go full time since (if I get that far) it has me doing menial tasks).

The main problem is though, that I do not really care about money, or careers, or job prospects since none of those things make me happy. I just do not want to lose my friends which will likely happen once we graduate since we'll probably go our separate ways. I would be willing to throw all  my work in college away and work minimum wage (or even being homeless) if it meant I wouldn't lose them. 

I know that you can still keep in touch after graduation but I know that will not work for me since during summer (when I am home, as opposed to being at college), it is incredibly difficult for me even if I am able to communicate with them through facebook etc.

As you may have guessed, based on my small number of friends, I have pretty significant social anxiety and find it difficult to make friends. I truly got lucky in meeting them and I know that even if I somehow got over my social anxiety, I am not going to meet anyone like them again. What is even more scary is that after college, it is going to be infinitely more difficult to make friends since college is such a social environment (not that I was very good at making friends there...). None of this is helped by the fact that I do not care to drink alcohol, or be around people that drink, which severally limits my ability to socialize or meet others since most people enjoy those things (fortunately, my two friends have similar opinions).

I just think that best option is to kill myself after graduation since after that, I will likely never be happy, which, in my opinion, the only reason to live (i.e. sounds selfish, but not for me, since I enjoy making other people happy).

I know that most people will give me advice (or suggest I see a therapist) about overcoming my social anxiety, but I do not think that will make me happy since I still do not want to lose my friends since they are the only people that I care about. Think of it like this, most people have a family that they care about that will be with them no matter what, but I do not have that since my family has died before I got to college, so to an extent, I think of them as my family.

I have been thinking about doing ending my life after graduation for a while, and I honestly think the only solution is if I somehow got a job in the same location/area as one of them but that might be that likely depending on where everyone ends up."

Assets:

* $875 in chequeing account

Liabilities:

* $9820 in 3% annual interest Student Line of Credit

* $10000 in (currently) interest free student loans (interest kicks in when I finish school)

As it stands all of my bills are already paid for all of July.

Should I allocate the rest of my money to pay down my line of credit, or should I build an emergency fund? I thought that I could just pay down the line of credit and then use it as an emergency fund should some issue arise. Is this sound logic?

Many of you are very helpful, and I have a career question. I recently recieved an offer for a B4 internship in London, UK. I am an American and go to school in the Northeast. I also have an offer from a different B4 firm for a big Northeast city (not NYC).

I REALLY want to do the one in London. I really want the international experience and I feel it would be pretty awesome for a resume. I also have a very heavy interest in the Finance industry, which is what London is known for. I got this offer through a connection and a lot of luck (they VERY rarely, almost never recruit people across borders, you can't even apply to this on their website/etc.).

However, would I be making a mistake? How hard would it be to start a career in the UK as an American? And if I really want to come back to the states,  would I be able to easily get an offer in an American city after my internship? I have heard of people transferring offices from city to city in the USA, but what about across the Atlantic? I figure since it is totally different there (IFRS vs. GAAP, etc.) that my experience in London would actually be looked down upon when applying to jobs in the US.

What do you think? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Just over two weeks ago, I moved from the US to Romania. I have a job that pays well for Romania, but I have student loans and the pay isn't enough. More than that, my girlfriend (Romanian) is about to accept a Master's program in Barcelona for September.

Right now I'm in Romania applying for extended residency. Once I get that, I think I can apply for a blue card. If granted, does that significantly improve my chances of landing a job in Spain? Wikipedia says that Spain has been slow in adopting the Blue Card - does anybody have experience with this?

And, if I do land a job, what kind of salary can I expect for a SE? The internet says that the pay is surprisingly low for software engineers in BCN - is that true? 


I took Spanish for four years, so I expect to be able to catch up to a conversational level fairly quickly. 


We're kind of overwhelmed - she doesn't want to lose me (and vice versa) but she also wants to grow. I need to know that I have a chance of following her to Barcelona - or that I don't. "
29gfwb,2,2014-06-30,Erging while away from college,boxstabber,Rowing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/29gfwb/erging_while_away_from_college/,"I have a somewhat intensive summer programme to follow in order to prepare for the next year of rowing at my UK college. However, I am currently on an internship in US (Los Angeles).

I've scoped out close by gyms and most have some sort of rowing machines. However, almost none have the Concept 2 ones. For example, one had ergs from Matrix (?), another the water based (like House of Cards). The former felt very weird, jittery, with inconsistent application of power. The latter, a bit better, but still distinctively different from Concept 2.

First question - What are your experiences with different rowing machines? I have only ever rowed Concept 2, it's the alpha and omega, standard for tests etc.

I'll likely sign up for the former gym due to a number of factors. Therefore, I am exploring other options with regards to erging. I am possibly thinking of buying one. I do not really have enough time to catch a good deal on Craigslist, but I could go for a new one on Amazon for 1,030 with shipping and sell it afterwards, since they hold their value. Alternatively, I could mail it back to UK, although I am not sure how expensive that would be. Would be neat to have one at home though.

Second question - Has anyone shipped these beasts? How expensive is it? Internationally?

Third - Any thoughts, suggestions etc?"

I don't know what to do anymore",SugarSugarBee,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/29gke0/dealing_with_a_chronic_illness_that_flares/,"I have a chronic pain condition (not crohn's or fibro, but a similar idea) that will flare up on occasion and cause me great pain no matter the meds I am on. Even worse, I am two years into this condition and STILL trying to find treatment/medication that works more consistently.

Right now I have an internship at my DREAM job. This week we were going to have a talk about the possibility of full time employment or a temp position after my internship ends. I have been super excited.

And then tonight... I get into bed at 10pm, and it is now 5am and I still haven't slept. It's past pain now and into a long panic attack over the idea of having to call in sick... *again.*

**Since January, I've have two surgeries requiring a week out of work, 2-3 days where I leave (only an hour usually) early to get to a doctor's appointment and at least 3 times where my flare ups have been so bad I have to stay home or leave early.**

They are fully aware I have a chronic condition and they have been wonderfully understanding (I see other co-workers with health issues who need time off and it doesn't seem to be a huge issue) but I know this isn't a good track record.

I have stayed hours late several times, done some work from home or at least answered emails on my off time, etc. I offer to do more to make up for the time that I've missed and it always evens out in the end. But other than doing everything I can to prevent a flare up, how do I show that I'm dedicated to my job, despite this thing I can't control?

**tl;dr: I have an internship that could lead to my dream job. My chronic pain condition has unpredictable flare ups that cause absences more than the average person. Right now I have to call in sick *again* because I've been up all night in pain. What else can I do to prove that I really do want to be there?**"
29gkm3,3,2014-06-30,Just starting my career in IT. Would like some advice.,hypnostic,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/29gkm3/just_starting_my_career_in_it_would_like_some/,"Hello everyone, I thought I would give a bit of a back story and describe my situation.

Essentially, I got an A.A. in Gen Ed and then tried to figure out where to go from there as I was thinking of transferring to a major university, but then I started looking really close at some of the A.S. programs my state college offered and what they would eventually help me get certs wise. I took quite a few classes and already fulfilled most of the Gen Ed and math requirements for the degree as well as all the electives, so I just had to take a few more classes that were centered in the Computer Science department itself. I chose (and fell in love with) the CCNA classes, CCNP Routing, and a Virtualization course centered on VMware in the datacenter. 

Since then I used some of the loan money to acquire various Cisco switches and routers as well as a server off of eBay. In retrospect, I probably shouldn’t have but I don’t have any regrets doing so.

My issue is that part of my A.S. degree is a work cooperative. The school sets up interviews for an internship and/or job. If I get it, I have to get my boss or HR to fill out paperwork for me weekly describing what I’ve done and how I could improve, etc. I have yet to get a job/internship and I have gone to every interview and felt like everything was Okay. The interviewers and I had a good back and forth and I was excited at the prospect of finally working in a job that would actually use my skills. Alas, it is not to be (yet).
 
I am trying to figure out what’s wrong with me (or my resume) about why I’m not getting these positions and internships. The only thing I can think of is that I don’t have any actual experience in a corporate environment or any real work experience in I.T.. However, I am able to answer all of their I.T. related questions and I feel like I have proven in the interview that I know what I’m doing up to a point. I would think that after this point is where they would come in and help give me experience and knowledge that I don’t have yet.
 
I was working on getting my CCNA in the middle of all of this and was about halfway done and then I got devastated and kind of gave up for a little bit. I have the opportunity to either pick it back up, or work on something else for a while. I recently won a contest where I got a 74-409 exam voucher for free. So, I was thinking of focusing on that. It’s not VMware, but its virtualization and it’s free. I also decided I should probably study for the MCSA exams and attempt those at some point. I’m just not sure what will be worth the most to me at this time. Initially I thought it would be the CCNA, but that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore according to several articles and posts I’ve read. 

So I am currently at a loss of what to pursue or do at the moment.. generally feeling lost. I just want a job doing what I love… fucking around with technology and helping people in the process.

So, can anyone point out any issues with my resume?

Any tips for interviews? I dress nicely, am polite, and do my best to be honest and professional in regards to my experience and what I wish to accomplish.

Any advice on what to focus on for the moment cert wise? What would be the most help to me to get the internship/job? (All jobs/internships so far have been for helpdesk or junior sys admin. Also, I do not currently have any certs besides ones given by my college for completing certain groups of classes)

Anything to add? Bueller? 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/gqeIu2k.png) is an anonymized version of my resume 

TL:DR - Things aren't going too well in the internship/job department. I wonder what's wrong with me or my resume. Would like some help. "
29gm44,27,2014-06-30,Well that went better than expected...Lost [m]y virginity to a [f]ilipina model this weekend,austinonian,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/29gm44/well_that_went_better_than_expectedlost_my/,"First, some background - I'm 18 years old and just finished my freshman year of college. I'm currently living on the west coast where I landed a summer finance internship. I've been told that I'm relatively attractive but I'm geeky/awkward as fuck in person. Maybe that's why at 18, I was still a virgin...until last night.

Anyway, this weekend, the other interns and I decided to drive out to an overnight indie film festival out in the middle of nowhere. I was especially looking forward to this because I hadn't made many friends in my new city, and unlike the other interns (who were all 21+ or had fakes), I couldn't really get out that much. 

My ride pulled up - one of my co-workers in her Corolla. I recognized another intern in the passenger seat. It turned out that the two other girls in the car were the driver's little sister and her friend from college. The sister was ridiculously attractive and 110% my type - sharp features, perky tits (no bra), sparkling eyes, toned ass, and all of 90 pounds at about 5'. I love me a petite filipina girl. Since the three of us were crammed in the back while my co-workers bought alcohol for the night, we struck up a conversation.

I immediately pulled out my best game. Unfortunately, I have none. So I just made some really terrible puns. At first, the little sister (I'll call her ""C"") more or less ignored me. I wasn't too surprised - she was three years older and an occasional model. I was just some nerd who worked with her big sister. Still, I couldn't help but notice her sneaking a couple looks when I changed into some comfier clothes for that night's outdoor screening.

When the rest of my co-workers and their friends arrived, we immediately set to drinking. Most of them soon left to watch the first film. This left C, her friend, and I alone. All of us were a bit tipsy. Before I knew it, we were rolling around on the blanket at our sleeping ground. Fuck it, I thought, and I started making out with C. She not only obliged, but proceeded to give me the worst hickie of my admittedly short career. ""How the fuck are you so into me right now?"" she giggled. I could ask you the same thing, I thought as worked my way from her full lips down her jawline and neck. Her friend shot me a look and walked to another makeshift campsite nearby.

""Get in the fucking tent,"" I whispered. Apparently, drunk me is a bit of a dom.

Since we were both buzzed, we started off slow. I tore off her shirt and  started kissing her neck...her tiny, perky breasts...her hips...as slowly and gently as I could. She moaned: ""I want you."" I kissed her shins, her knees, her thighs. ""Say my name,"" I replied.

I could see that she was wet. Soaked, in fact. I could see right through her pastel-pink panties. She was clean-shaven. ""[REDACTED]"" she whispered, grabbing my hair and nibbling a bit on my ear. 

""Say my name again."" I ran my hand over the wet lycra. And under it. ""[REDACTED],"" she moaned. I kissed her panties and started giving her pussy big, Great-Bernard licks. She shuddered: ""More! I'm Close!"". I couldn't believe my beginners luck. 

But because drunk me is a dom, I stopped. Not yet, I said. She moaned, but I did nothing. After a beat, as she breathed heavily, I slowly slid one, than two fingers into her tight, wet, pink pussy. ""Hnghh,"" she said. 

I carefully felt for the swollen bit I thought would be her g-spot. And I went to town. Call me trigger-happy. Still, I'd look her right in the eyes until they7 rolled back in her head, at which point I'd stop. She'd curse me, beg me, but I wouldn't start again until she said my name. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I didn't stop. It's difficult to tell since I don't have any points of comparison, but I think she came pretty hard. I felt her pumping around my fingers as she squirted all over the tent floor. Beginners luck, I tell ya.

""I want more,"" C whispered after she regained composure. Then she paused: ""Oh shit."" I noticed voices outside. The voices of my co-workers. Including C's big sister. ""We have to get dressed!"" she hissed. Surprising myself, I shook my head. She looked shocked for a second, then grinned. I reached for a condom, rolled it on my by now rock-hard cock, and took her from behind.

The actual sex was only ok. I was still drunk and inexperienced, so I couldn't move that quickly. SC definitely knew what she was doing but could barely balance when she tried to get on top. Eventually, I just ate her out again (she came twice more) and she returned the favor. 

That's when two of my coworkers entered the tent to change. ""We heard all of that! You're in so much fucking trouble!"" yelled C's sister from outside as we scrambled to get decent.

The rest of the night, we just talked and cuddled. She insisted it was just sex, and honestly I'm okay with that, but we both shared some personal shit that night. It was intimate.

Oh, and I fingered her again while her sister slept about twenty feet away.

And tonight...well, tonight, I can't sleep. I know that tomorrow all of the guys I work with will be giving me high-fives and knowing looks. The girls who didn't go to the film festival will be gossiping. And C's sister will be glaring. The whole while, I'll have to play down the incident because 1.

29goxo,26,2014-06-30,Wishlist for Season 6,brankinginthenorth,TheVampireDiaries,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVampireDiaries/comments/29goxo/wishlist_for_season_6/,"Personally I hope they put the focus back on Elena as a character more, otherwise the show doesn't hold together and separates into four different shows (Caroline and her bad bad boyfriends, Damon kills and snarks and cries, Stefan saves the world repeatedly, and Bonnie and Jeremy are in love sorta kinda if no one else is around and they don't have anything else going on that night).  That's been happening since Season 3 and I thought it'd get better with the Originals gone but last season was her worst as she's rarely interacting with people outside of her relationship with Damon or the larger plot dangers.  If we had a better sense of where her head is at it would help the viewers (okay, me) care more about her tribulations and relationship woes.

Also I would love if Elena and Tyler become better friends.  He's the only one of the regulars who doesn't have an explicitly defined relationship with her and that's part of the reason he gets underutilized and has been for two seasons.  And the first season too to be honest.  If he and Elena became college study buddies or they both take and internship at the same place or something and he could be the friend who's brutally honest with her and stuff.  He really isn't a bad character the writers just never utilize him that's all.  What would you like to see?"

The gist of it is is that it exists to keep workers unhappy so we keep buying gratification from things we don't need and spend unnecessarily. I've already started to notice this a little bit with myself, and I'm only an intern for the summer and only recently started working full time. But every two weeks a new paycheck comes in I splurge and buy things I didn't have before and quite frankly didn't need.  The thing is I'm more worried about getting into a routine of working for the rest of my life and be unsatisfied with how I'm leading my life (I'm generally tired on weekends and don't wanna do much and therefore I'm not having experiences I want to have) But the financial position that my family is doesn't allow me to just not work when I graduate as I wanna help my parents out and want them to not work. But I also wanna be happy with my life and be fulfilled. Any thoughts on how to get out of this vicious cycle or thoughts on any of this topic? "

Could use some advice here. Posting on a throwaway for confidentiality. 

**I really want to work in the UK and Europe, as well as do something that I actually like, but based on my current trajectory, that won't happen. So I'm coming here for advice.** I'm interested in possibly getting a second degree in something more technical than my first, but not sure what would be most useful/interesting. Here's my story so far:

**Personal info:**

* USA citizen, no additional citizenships (no arrests or anything that would affect visas)

* 22 years old

* No loans; about $16,000 USD in savings

**Education background:**

I'm graduating from a top 50-university in the USA with a BA in International Relations and Business, and I spent a year abroad at a top tier university in the UK. While I am glad my IR major led to abroad opportunities during university, I am finding that it is limiting in terms of international opportunities after university because I have no hard skills and the job market looks bleak in the UK/Europe so they're hiring domestically/EU more.

**Job outlook:**

Anyway, I have a full time job starting this August when I graduate at a high tech company. This job is doing things like business strategy, sales, and marketing. I've been doing this job for a year already as a remote intern, and feel like I won't be learning much new soon. (Though, obviously, full time vs remote part time intern is very different, so I will have to adjust.) I accepted the job because I didn't have any direction and wanted a safety net. It's not my dream job, but I'm grateful to have it, I like the people, and it pays pretty well. So I'm okay staying here for the next year or two. 

**Key issue: How to 1) find which skills to develop, and then 2) develop them**

*However*, I don't want to get complacent in this job. I want to keep improving on my skills and for that I need your help! How do I strategize developing skills that would be necessary at an international level? I can do math (have gotten A's in all classes up to basic calculus and statistics in university) and science, but I have heard so many people say I don't know what I'm getting into and that unless I'm *really* passionate (""can you talk someone's ear off about it?"") about engineering/computer science/etc, I won't like it.

That's just my problem though: I don't know what I like! Obviously I'm not a good judge of my own preferences because I picked IR and after 3 years I'm sick of it. So I'm having trouble trusting myself and others when it comes to these decisions, leaving me in a ""wheels spinning, going nowhere"" phase which is stressful and irritating. So, help me get out of this rut....Any suggestions on where to go from here? How do I know what I like until I try it?

Holy shit does Fett have daddy issues. I mean, every fucking time he came up it was ""I just want my daddy"" or ""I only want to live up to my daddy"". Forget that the entire thing felt out of place, it was just so whiny. Sure, Jacen killed his daughter leaving room for further (any) plot development regarding Fett and his place in the series, Fett then goes ""ha, my revenge is you gotta deal with this shit"" letting that collapse.

It was nice to see a different side of him, but I remember when Travis tried to give the clones emotions in her Republic Commando series, and I felt like I was getting bashed in the head there, and here.

However, as out of place as a lot of the characters felt, the plot was developed nicely, and the action was decent.

The growing divide between Jacen and Jaina is palpable. The creation of the GAG with Jacen at the head and Ben helping him. I get that Jacen is a powerful force user, but he is horrible at politics and tactics. ""I will be super obvious that I want to be nice, the other politicians will loooooove that"". Or ""I will intern Corellians, that will totally de-escalate growing tensions"".

Palleons resignation as Supreme Commander just shots ""PLOT POINT LATER"" and makes me giddy.

Jaina being suspended from duty is gonna be interesting when Han and Leia figure it out. Combine that with their looking at the Ailyn and seeing what Jacen did, Han essentially disowning Jacen was good development.

WHY CAN'T MARA SEE JACEN IS WALKING A DANGEROUS PATH! She does, she actually is wary. But she is concerned about Ben first, force second, and it is giving her problems. This is as foolish as Jacen thinking he isn't like Vader because he isn't doing this for love, but for peace (for those he loves). It just makes me shake my head."

**More about myself**

*I'm sorry if this looks like some kind of diary. It's not linear, my thoughts are not organized. I write things down as they come. I write about what feels important to me, and I understand they might not sound important to you (like how I got to pick a mobile OS). All of these things lead me to where I am today.*

I fell in love with computers early. Then it was the Internet. Eventually I started programming and discovered the open source movement. I hated Microsoft for some reasons, and only used Linux from 2006 to 2009.

When I was about 5, I knew I wanted to be an inventor. When I was 8, I wanted to work with computers. At 11, I knew that I wanted to study Computer Engineering. At 15, I was convinced that I would go for the PhD.

I always had a fascination for Apple products, it started with iPods. I watched every Keynote. I'm fascinated by Steve Jobs and relate a lot to him. I never owned a Mac or a iPhone, but I owned many iPods and an iPad. I don't consider myself an Apple fanboy.

The iPod triggered an interest for mobile computing. I started to learn everything about mobile computers, smartphones, etc. I still do to this day.

Before getting my first smartphone, I spent a lot of time comparing platforms and deciding which one I would get. I decided webOS was the superior mobile OS, and waited for the HP Pre 3 to be released. But HP killed it. 

At the same time, I discovered Windows Phone. I always hated Windows Mobile (with the start menu and stylus), and it was a shock when I discovered Windows Phone. Metro completely changed my opinion of Microsoft, and I immediatly bought a Windows Phone and started developping apps. Thanksfully, I was forced to learn Microsoft technologies at school, so it got easy. That's when I stopped hating Microsoft and embraced them.

Most of my professional experience has been related to mobile. I did QA on mobile for 18 months. I started building Windows Phone apps in my free time. I had an internship as an iOS developer. I'm now working with Xamarin to build applications on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. I see myself staying in the field of mobile for a long time.

Ever since I first saw a Palm Pilot or an iPod, I started drawing mobile devices. I loved to design the hardware, but my main focus was on software. At 12, I was already drawing UI that - I feel - had more potential than what we're using today. People would manipulate things and actions, not apps. I never stopped thinking about how computer UI/UX could be improved, with a focus on mobile.

My job is interesting, and I learn a lot. However, I don't feel I'm reaching my full potential. I always wanted to do Research and work on challenging and unresolved problems (in knowledge representation, HCI, UX/UI, etc), but I don't see myself doing 3-4 years in school learning stuff I already know just to get my bachelor degree, so that I could start a Master and eventually apply for PhD. When I quit, I was convinced that I would work for myself, or start my own company, and that a degree would be useless. I'm not sure what to think anymore.

I've been following startups a lot since 2010. Most of what I read is about startups in California, mostly SF. I gained a fascination for the United States, and couldn't stop thinking how great things are there. In Canada, I can't barely name 10 important tech companies. We have BlackBerry and CGI, while the US has Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Yahoo, Palantir, Twitter, etc. Bell Labs was in the US. Xerox Parc was in the US. This is where it's at and that's where I want to be.

I think I'm becoming jealous of tech workers in the US. Their salaries are 2-3 times what I'm paid here (for the same job), and the cost of living is overall much lower there (other than rent in specific cities). I'm wondering why I'm staying here, and then I realize that my lack of degree makes it very hard for me to move to the US.

Every day, I'm thinking of starting a company. I have tons of ideas. I have a vision. I'm obsessed. I want to change the way people communicate, through technology. I'm convinced it's one of the most important problem of our time, but I struggle to find people that share this opinion, or care enough about this problem to do something about it. Finding investors would kickstart the process, but they're not as generous and risk-tolerant here as in the US. It's probably going to be difficult anyway, as it's way up there in term of risk.

I'm not sure I want to be a programmer anymore. I'm not comfortable using archaic tools and methodologies, knowing that we're capable of much better. Programming is too manual, system architecture is more appealing. I don't get how most of what programmers do today is not automated. I like defining the ""what"", not fiddle with the ""how"". At work, I tend to envy the job of the designers, especially the UX part.

Am I delusional? Am I lazy? Am I asking too much? I don't know. What I know is that I struggle to find any opportunity to work on problems that I deeply care about. I feel like I'm wasting most of my time working on solutions to meaningless problems. I feel most developers are.

For the last few years I have been deciding whether or not I want to go to grad school or get a career in computer science. In my junior year I decided I wanted to get an internship that summer in comp Sci. Currently I'm a software engineer intern at a bank in the NYC area and I don't really like it. It is slow, it's boring, there is nothing here which grabs my eye and makes me feel like I WANT to work here. I was looking for an experience where I would want to put the extra time and hours to learn things. I wanted to be invested and challenged in what I'm doing. I wanted to work with people who would be invested in what they're doing, but it's as if once 5:00 pm hits, everyone adopts the attitude of ""Not my problem anymore""That being said, I am more confused than ever about what I want to do. I don't know anything about the work culture of west coast companies and how they approach things. I want to see what life is like there but I don't know if it will be right for me. What's it like over there?  How is the attitudes different from working at a bank? Will I actually get to learn or create things? What is the lifestyle like at a startup? Would I just be like a replaceable cog in a company, or would I mean something? Is it the sort of place where you put in more time not because you're expected to, but because you want to solve the damn problem before you go home and forget?As for graduate school, I love school. I love Learning, I love reading papers, and exploring new things. But I don't know if graduate school is right for me. A large part of me wants to get a phd so that I can work for cool companies like vicarious or IBM or some other place that's looking for researchers. That has been influenced in part because I look at all the cool research they used to do at bell labs in the late 80s and 90s and it sounds so awesome, like they were actually akin to mad scientists in a lab. Is this too immature of an outlook on graduate school? What is it like to go to graduate school? Would I be looked badly upon if I wanted to go to graduate school just because? Are there any benefits for going to grad school for vs,be it masters or phd?Finally, thank you guys for the time you took to read through this."

As a rising Junior, she went home for the summer to work and I remained in the city where we met, where I work full time like a good college graduate (I started literally the day after I graduated because I like making money and I love my coworkers). She’s not that far – maybe 3 hours or 4 hours driving from where I live (in the grand scheme, not TOO far).
 

Everything was fine, not perfect, prior to her leaving. It wasn’t honeymoon phase by any means but it was good. I trust her completely which is new for me. However, there are some problems I think. Not all of my friends are big fans and even though they won’t tell me I can tell because I’m not bad at reading body language. She also can’t go out much because of her age (US). She’s going abroad in the fall as well so it isn’t like, “make it until August”.
 

I was a big proponent, and so was she, at giving it a chance over summer. We figured we’d visit each other. I have my own place with friends and am moving into another nicer place soon with my best friend. She lives with her parents and drives into work every day with her parent whose company she works for. Her internship was supposed to last until about July 15-ish (we’ll get back to this) then that weekend she was to go on a family vacation. She came to visit me once for about one day (a Saturday) before having to leave to attend some ceremony for her family. Every weekend is seems like there is something she has to do, and that I’m the last priority, “if nothing else is happening” is how it seems to me. I went to visit her about two weeks ago but her parents won’t give us a minute alone together and she had out of town family there as well.
 

She recently told me (aka today), and I sort of knew this was coming and hoped it wasn’t, that she would be staying at her job until she would be going on her family trip – and therefore couldn’t visit me. I asked her why, asking if it was because there was an unfinished projected, and there was no such thing. She’s basically staying because she thinks the company will be unable to function without her. I was incredibly hurt by this because it means I will not see her until mid-to-late August (when she is planning on coming to visit for a decent amount of time, but again the core reason for these dates wasn’t me, but she will be spending time with me). The only other weekend that would potentially work she said was a no go because then, “I wouldn’t see part of my family for 4 weeks” (let’s ignore that her making this decision means I won’t see her for nine!).
 


 I'm incredibly hurt and upset. I feel like I'm not a priority (note, I don't want to be top, I just wanted to be a priority). It will be three full month between physical contact and also two between any face to face interaction. I want to bring this up to her but I don't know how to do so without sounding immature and clingy. I also recognize we're at very different spots in life. I love her immensely and want this to work but I don't know how to do so. I want this work, but I'm nervous and if I spend the money to go visit her abroad, that's a lot of money if I'm not a priority...


What are your opinions? How should I approach her about this? Is it a lost cause? I don't want to think it is nor do I, since I very much have a, ""I will make this work"" attitude towards problems. I would prefer brutal honesty to ""making me feel better"" though I could use some of that too since my life isn't going swimmingly outside of this...


TL;DR: guy struggles to figure out to do with girlfriend as she's so far away from him and doesn't feel like he's a priority in her life which makes commitment to an international trip difficult"

So this company just sent out this internship opening to my school's server, and they want a full-time business or biomedical engineering student intern to do some sales data analysis.

29i8gb,3,2014-06-30,Credit Utilization Question,pcthrowaway35,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/29i8gb/credit_utilization_question/,"What should your Credit Utilization Percent be?

While in college I have been lucky enough to have my parents pay for my college books and help with finances. We opened a credit card in my name that I put basic needs on they pay off in full, just to help me get a jump start on my credit.

Now here is where the question comes into play. 
I am a student with a relatively high paying summer internship. So i opened up my own credit card to put other things on(like rent and utilities) and I pay them off completely at the end of every month. I checked my credit report on one of those free sites online. I know its not exact but it helped me get a better understanding. My question is, they rate your Utilization in brackets,1%-20% being the best 21-30 being the second best, and so on. Should I be paying down my debt mid month to stay more near 10% at the end than building up to like 50% and then paying it all at the end of the month?

EDIT: Second quick question: The free credit report website says I have an account that is 17 years old(started when I was four) my family doesn't know what it could possibly be. Any idea what it could be? Or is it just a flaw in the report. "

I am a recent graduate with a finance degree from a highly credited business school, and I am am looking for advice on how to get into equity research.

A little bit about me:

I am an introvert, I like working with numbers, I like being able to make decisions, and I like being able to take a creative approach to solving problems. I have been trading stocks for four years, and have a strong interest in due-diligence research.

I have had two internships, one supporting financial advisors at Merrill Lynch, and another doing due diligence type work for a botique equity research firm. 

I have been interviewing for equity research associate positions, but haven't been able to land a job. It seems that these type of positions are more focused on cold calling, and less on modeling, which I am willing to do, but it is hard for me to be enthusiastic in an interview when I am told that 90% of what I will be doing is calling a bunch of people that don't want to talk to me. 

That being said, I like the autonomy of equity research, and the rapidly changing environment. However, I find it hard to show enthusiasm for a job that consists of mostly cold calling.

Am I applying for the wrong type of job? What can I do to make sure the next time I get an interview, I am able to get the position?"

A lot of the names have huge amounts of possibilities, so I may have missed some- such as Daniel Sturridge who has 100,001 possibilities according to the site.

This takes quite a bit of time so I've done most of the bigger teams for now and some of the other last 16 teams, I'll try and do more tomorrow! If you find any others let me know and I'll edit them in and give you a shoutout! A few of the players with long names (especially some of the Spanish/Portugese names instead of just using Neymar/Hulk) are problematic with the website's server speeds as it only works with 15 average characters at a time depending on how busy it is.

I've gone on to work on child welfare policy in Congress and share my story around the country. Ask me Anything!",lleexxiiie,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29igqx/iama_i_am_a_21_yr_old_foster_kid_who_has_lived_in/,"**My short bio:** I became a foster kid at the age of 14. Due to my older age, it was impossible to find a foster home. Everyone only wanted cute, little babies and was worried about the ""trouble"" with having teenagers.  At the time, policy dictated that I had to change schools every time I changed placements. I found out that a law, called the McKinney Vento Act, would allow me to remain in the high school where I had started. To be protected by the law, however, I had to be homeless. I ended up spending most of my high school years in youth shelters in order to qualify under this act, but I was able to graduate from from the same school where I started.

 was warehoused in shelters and group homes until deadlines forced them to move me to another temporary placement. As you can imagine, shelters were very scary.  I was subject to a lot of violence and witnessed stuff that was worse than my biological home I was removed from.  Group homes were terrible.  It was impossible to connect with any adult because they constantly changed shifts, and most of them were pretty burnt out.  I wasn't allowed to see friends or have a cell phone because they were scared we would run away.  Group homes were like institutions and it was really hard to go through high school without a stable place to live.  It felt like being a prisoner for a crime I did not commit.  I put all my energy into my education and graduated with good grades.  I went on to a notable university where I will be a senior in the fall.

Last summer, I was selected to be out of 15 former foster youth from around the country to intern in Congress.   During that time, I published a report on school instability, entitled ""From Homeless to the House of Representatives: How a Stable Education Saved a Foster Child"", and testified to Members of Congress about my report at a bicameral briefing last summer.

I've been able to use my story to influence policy in Congress, publish reports, and have been featured in various media outlets such as CNN.  
I also still work in the the United States Congress.

Also, I'm still in foster care.  In my state, we can stay until we graduate from college!  But that doesn't mean it's been easy  - I've struggled with homelessness and PTSD since starting college, and I've gone through this pretty much on my own.

It's important for me to share my story as many people don't know about foster care, and it can be pretty bad. So I use my story to raise awareness! I hope I can educate you on the Child Welfare system and inspire you to take action to help the 500,000 children currently in need of a forever family.

I bolded some things and made sections for easier reading.

**Some context about me:**

I am 21 years old. I have had clinically diagnosed anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. In recent years I have been able to function OK without meds or weekly therapy, while in college. I somehow was able to self-motivate enough to do really well academically, and am about to graduate.

However, college is over. As of tonight at 8, when I'm submitting my last paper. And I'm FUCKING TERRIFIED.

I actually wasn't so nervous before, because it looked like things were all set up. I just moved back in with my dad in his apartment in New York, and he's happy to put me up, that's the reason he has a two bedroom apartment. It's really not that bad of a living situation. And I had a paid internship lined up, although I wasn't super jazzed about it, but it was ok.

**The Internship**

The internship is the main problem here so here's some more context. Last summer, I was a paid intern in the marketing department of a small magazine. I did super well there, and they liked me a lot. However, by the end of the summer, I was SO drained and SO sick of working there, and I remember feeling so grateful that the summer was over and I had to leave. My boss gave me a lovely goodbye gift, I parted on great terms, and I got a few guaranteed references for the future.

My duties as a paid intern were almost entirely at my desk. I helped compile spreadsheets and presentations, organized files, helped compile metrics on campaigns we were running on our website, and did research on current events for my boss for speakers' panels she was trying to organize. It was all cerebral and officey and fairly straightforward, which is the stuff I'm good at.

What I'm NOT good at, and what drives my anxiety WILD, is any of the traits that one would need to, say, be a waitress at a highly trafficked restaurant. I'm not good at remembering lots of complicated instructions or being on top of a bunch of little tasks. Maybe I'm a moron. I just get SO ANXIOUS. I just am good at doing tasks that are dictated to me or involve something I know well, or learning one thing and doing that thing consistently without having someone breathing down my shoulder yelling at me when I mess up.

Side note: What I actually WANT to be doing with my life, and what my major was, is being in the creative department of an ad agency or helping with branding for a company. I have been studying communications and graphic design.  I'm good at that, and have gotten a lot of encouraging feedback on my portfolio but know it needs work before I get jobs in that field. This internship was almost totally irrelevant to what i want to do sans the word ""marketing"" in the title, which is vaguely related to advertising.

ANYWAYS. **I was contacted out of the blue around six months ago by the HR lady at that magazine, saying that my old boss wanted me to come back this summer, full time.** I didn't really expect to be offered the same position again, but eventually decided to accept- I mean, it's money, and I was good at the job last time.

**How The Internship Has Slowly Transformed into a Terrifying Monster I am Afraid to Face**

In the following months, as I finished up my college classes and summer approached, I learned more about how different the company is since I left. Basically EVERY person I worked with last summer has been fired or quit since I was there, and theres' been a ton of restructuring and moving around of people and positions. So that's already making me anxious, because it's change. THEN I learn a couple months after I accepted the job that my boss--the whole reason HR hired me back in the first place--has ALSO LEFT now. Meaning my old boss, the entire reason I'm being welcomed back with open arms, is now gone. So I'm already SUPER anxious just thinking about all that change.

THEN the bomb gets dropped. My start date for the job is supposed to be next monday, July 7. Last week, a woman who works for the magazine contacted me to say I needed to discuss the job with her. I thought it was just going to be standard procedure.

The news was broken to me that this company is SO FUCKING DISORGANIZED that the marketing department accidentally HIRED SOMEONE ELSE for the job I'm supposed to be starting in a week. And that person just started a couple days ago. Somehow, HR didn't know about this and didn't know to tell me until two weeks before my start date.

**So, there goes the familiar, comfortable desk job that I was already anxious about. And instead??? I'll be responsible for literally almost NOTHING regarding the magazine or marketing or ANYTHING. I'll be the person who has to: 
1. Make sure the office vending machine is stocked 
2. Make sure we have all the different Keurig cups stocked in the office kitchen, and utensils and napkins and cups 
3. Answering phones at the front desk and 
4. Probably cleaning closets and organizing shit for people
5. Whatever other errands get thrown at me.**

And the worst part: **They don't even really have space for me.** The woman on the phone told me how the office is going through a huge transition so I wouldn't even really get a consistent desk, and they don't even have a space for me on Wednesdays so it wouldn't be a full time job as I was offered. She basically seemed to be trying to make it sound as unappealing as possible. At first, I was still upbeat in tone: she'd say ""I'm really so sorry to drop this on you"" and I was like, ""Oh, no, it's ok!"" and she basically corrected me saying ""No, really, I understand if you want to back out."" I told her I'd let her know the next day and she said ""No, no. Take a week. It's really understandable if you change your mind."" The more she talked, the more I realized she was basically trying to gravely tell me not to take the job.

So now, naturally, I AM FREAKING OUT. I CAN'T do these things. I am going to fuck up. I can already see myself getting yelled at for dropping a call while transferring it wrong or forgetting to put out a flavor of coffee or something. I'm not going to know anyone and I'm not even going to have a desk. I'm just going to be an errand girl. And IT WAS MADE VERY APPARENT that I'm basically entirely unwanted. **I was hired by accident, essentially. My old boss asked me back, but she left, and now I'm the unfortunate leftover mistake they have to deal with.**

I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE, and now I'm going back under the worst conditions possible. I have until tomorrow to change my mind, but my parents aren't really supportive of me turning it down, because I need money and I get that. But I literally start crying every time I think about this. I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR** Graduated college, and the job I have lined up that I was already dreading is actually going to be way worse than I even expected. I've been relegated to office bitch work, and they have heavily implied that they want me not to come back, because the woman who asked me back (my boss from last summer) has quit, and there's barely room in the office for me. I don't know if I can handle being in that unwelcome environment, or handle the stressful and unrewarding job that's not what I signed on for.

I can't stop crying, seriously. Someone help.

I graduated this winter (2013), but I did not get the diploma, because I couldn't pay the tuition up to this moment. Situation is little more complicated than simply getting a loan and it is a major problems from getting a job, but it is not the main reason why I am asking for help.
I had to stop going to school for financial and family reason (2008), but came back to school after few years. After getting a 2nd chance, I believed and had pressure to ace my performance in school then job market, but it miserably failed. When I barely graduated school, all I had in me was loathsome body, chronic illness, depression, and financial problem. I lost will to live, avoided everything, and hid in the cave for awhile. It's bit hard to describe how I felt back then, but I can say for sure that it felt horrible and I do not ever want to go back to that time.
With my friends' help and some changes in mind, I've been working at the temporary job to support myself and payoff some personal debts first. I would say it did more than I expected. I've been sleeping regularly, slowly working out, and struggled to fix my habits. I got more problems to fix, but I believe I made good progress. Moreover,although there are many fears still in me, but my head is more clear and I remembered what I really want to pursue in my life. I've trying to keep doing something so I do not give time for myself to get eaten by guilt and shame, and I made some general goals and plans. However, there are some insights and information I need to stand up again. Here are some long term plans and situations.

1.I'm going back to my country within this year. And I want to be physically and mentally prepared when I go back because it will hit hard.

2.As a first step, I'm trying to apply to interns either in U.S or my country most likely. Applying should happen soon. (Aiming for U.S companies that has branches or business in my home country because of few brief experiences.)

3.Tuition situation will be also solved hopefully within this year.
4.I majored international studies(BA), and my knowledge is well-rounded but not too deep.(Economics, history, and etc.)

Some of them are bit unrealistic, but I need a goal so I don't stop and keep gaining momentum. What I would like to ask are

1.I'm currently starting to study again to expand myself, but I would like to know what would be good for me to study for interviews as well. 

2.I still feel sick from time to time and still under pressure, fatigue and fear. It would be not easy to get rid of them especially because I've been carrying them for many years. To the people living with good self-discipline, how do you motivate and restrain yourself with long-term persistence?



Writing this down actually made me feel better somehow. Now I got to run to work, but I will be back to check soon. Hope you guys all have a good day."

My local college offers two courses; Computer Game Development, and Software Development.

I think I'd be more interested in Computer Game Development, but I feel like the modules might limit me a little? It has an internship aspect to it though, and they generally gets good places for their students oin the industry. I'll post the modules for both below.

I remember seeing people talking about Computer Game Development courses in a negative light previously, but I think I'd much rather Computer Game Development than your typical IT job. 
Any feedback you could give would be much appreciated. Thanks.

29ijcv,1,2014-06-30,"Me [mid-20s F] with my boss [30sF] and coworker [40sM] of 1 month - Depressed, unclear roles, no leadership, do I stay or go?",notaninternthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29ijcv/me_mid20s_f_with_my_boss_30sf_and_coworker_40sm/,"I recently graduated with my masters, moved , and began a new job. I was totally excited to have this job all lined up - I had interviewed over spring break, they were excited to have me join them when I graduated, yadda yadda.

I started earlier this month -I feel like I was set in my office and kind of just told ""Okay, do work, I'll be back later"". The entire department was gone on and off that week - some days it would be just me in my office, with near nothing to do because I had not been introduced to the rest of the facility, and had been told nothing about my real responsibilities/expectations besides the basic ""Don't be late"" type stuff.

I get assigned a major project, which is what I had thought my job would be. I start into it, but I'm anxious because it's a huge project, and I have nobody to really consult or ask any questions.

I've already had 2-3 meltdowns at home with my fiance over how lonely my job feels, how little guidance I'm getting, etc. I feel somewhat out of my depth on the size of this project, with nobody to help or even consult. The thing that's pushing me to post this, though, is the meeting I had with F, the coworker from the title, this morning.

F has been generally pretty condescending to me. He's been hand-holding me through basic tasks and information, lecturing me on ""what I need to do"" when I already know or was trying to tell him my plan, telling me why I was wrong about considerations I was thinking about in the plan. The final straw was when he was talking to somebody who stopped by briefly, and referred to me as ""his new intern"". I was NOT hired as an intern, especially not HIS intern. I'm unclear on if he couldn't just think of my role or not, but I'm so frustrated that my role is so undefined that he somehow thinks that.

I feel like I can't trust F, because my boss, Z has mentioned to me that 1) he's was recognized by the facility for the work he did on the plan I'm scrapping, and 2) boss also mentioned F wanted to keep the duties I'm supposed to be taking over. 

I would go bring the issue up with Z, but I don't necessarily trust her leadership skills to step up to this and solve it. She doesn't really seem to do much managing besides going to meetings. The people ""reporting"" to her don't really report, we just kind of drift in our own bubbles.

I know I'm not an expert in the field yet, but I was expecting to be a little more than an intern. (If I am, I'm the highest paid intern ever.) But I just don't know what to do. Not to mention the commute eats up at least 2 hours of my day. I was so proud of having this job RIGHT after graduation, and now it's feeling like a bait-and-switch. Do I cut my losses and apply to jobs closer to my home? Or do I stick it out and hope it gets better?

My fiance thinks I should just make a kick-ass project and show them what they've been neglecting, and that I should stick it out and hope it gets better. I dread going to work, and have been thinking about quitting off-and-on since week 2 of the job.

Apologies for the vagueness of some things - I'm trying to be, I know some Redditors at work.

tl;dr: Boss isn't leading well, coworker seems to think I'm his intern (I'M NOT!), hating my work social environment. After 1 month, do I stay or do I go?

29ijk3,1,2014-06-30,"College car with emphasis almost entirely on fuel economy, $10k max?",Wailord,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/29ijk3/college_car_with_emphasis_almost_entirely_on_fuel/,"Hey everyone. I found this sub last night and I've spent a solid four or five hours reading through past posts, but because nothing aligned exactly with my situation, I figured I'd post it.

I'm entering my third year of college and up until now I haven't had a need for a car (or a license even). However, I now have a full-time internship this summer, and taking the family car will run me about $200/mo in gas.

Getting a car now would be a financial hit (though my parents may help out), but I would then have a vehicle for school, too, instead of relying on my roommate to drive me around (it's been the agreed upon rearrangement for the last two years).

**I can probably go as high as $10,000** (lower the better, obviously!), and I'd like this car to last me for the last two years of college and the immediate years following (until a family necessitates a larger vehicle or something).

Really, **my biggest concern is gas mileage**; it doesn't have to be flashy or anything or ""fun"", I'd just like something that doesn't drain my bank account as school is doing a wonderful job of that anyway. Of course, **reliability is also a concern**, as I don't want to be paying for repairs, either.

The **driving will be split evenly between city/highway** both locally and when I go back to school. **There will be a ~1500mi trip (round-trip) made twice a year** when I go home for the holidays if that impacts the decision, and **there will need to be room in the car equivalent to a 2013 Ford Fiesta** (which gets us home now). **I'm also living somewhere with snow in the winter** and below-zero temperatures for what it's worth.

From what I've found, **a used Civic Hybrid or Prius seems to be a decent balance** between not being too pricey and getting killer mileage. Am I looking at the right vehicles, or possibly overlooking some better valued vehicles?

Thank you all!"
29inxw,3,2014-06-30,Just a couple of questions,tyeyeyeru,uofdayton,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofdayton/comments/29inxw/just_a_couple_of_questions/,"Hi, I'm attending UD this fall for engineering and I just have a few questions for current engineering students and engineering graduates.

Current Students:

1. Can you tell me all about your internships? For example location, when(e.g. freshman, sophmore, etc.), company, field, what you did, ease/difficulty of finding it, how did you dress to work, anything else that you want to share.

Graduates:

1. How hard/easy was it obtaining your first job?

2. Did you have any trouble finding jobs outside of ohio and surrounding area because UD isn't well known elsewhere?

3. Were you prepared for your first job?



Thanks for any and all responses!
