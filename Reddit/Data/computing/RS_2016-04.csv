4cswev,411,2016-03-31,My (22 F) dad (54 M) just had a rage fueled attack and destroyed my stepsister's (16 F) and my personal posessions. Everyone is backing him up and we don't know what to do,Thisisprobably,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4cswev/my_22_f_dad_54_m_just_had_a_rage_fueled_attack/,"
I'll try make this short. My dad and I have a pretty shitty relationship. I moved out when I was ten to live with my mom after they got divorced and I don't think he's ever forgiven me. Recently I graduated university (top marks, did an amazing internship afterwards) and had to move back home to live with them for a bit before I head on to another country to get my masters. I've lived here for a few months now (with my dad's family) and things have gotten progressively worse.


He constantly berates my stepsister and I and criticizes everything that we do. We are constantly told our clothes are awful, we don't look put together enough, and none of our accomplishments matter. He says all of these things in front of my little sister (10F), and she has begun to berate us in the same way.


Tonight he came home and up to our bedrooms (we're moving houses soon) and told us our things weren't properly packed. We reminded him that a few essentials had to be left out so we could use toiletries, etc. He completely lost his mind and began to kick my stepsisters boxes she had packed for moving, along with her cabinets and belongings. He destroyed a few things all while yelling that we were disrespectful and useless and didn't deserve to live here. I'm at a loss for words. My little sister witnessed the entire thing, and then my stepmom proceeded to back him up.


Nothing I ever do is right. I got into one of the top universities in the UK for my masters and he constantly criticizes me and tells me I'm lazy and am wasting my money. On top of this he talks sh*t about my mom, which drives me insane. Living with her isn't an option right now because she is working all over the place in different countries. As for talking to him, I have tried to multiple times and he tells me I'm playing the victim for everyone to see, so they can think poorly of him.


And the most annoying part is: he scared my tiny dog senseless. He has literally been shaking for hours.


What do I do, reddit?


TL;DR: my dad is emotionally abusive, had a fit and destroyed our things. My stepmom is backing him up on this, we are at a loss on what to do.

I want to know what kind of materials I can look over to study up on Offensive &amp; Network security.

I'm struggling to decide between two really good choices and thought I'd get some input from people online..


So recently I got accepted into UC Berkeley for CS but not UCLA or USC.  I also got a job offer from this company I have been working at for about a year now as an iOS developer which will pay 65k for part time (~25 hrs) so I could go to school as well.  However, the thing is, my work is located down in LA so I couldn't work from Berkeley (full remote might be a possibility but I'd rather not since it might be too distracting).  I'm going to try to appeal to UCLA first and see if I can get in.

However, if I still can't get into UCLA through appeal I'm trying to decide between these two options:

1) Go to Berkeley full time and focus on my education (get a few internships as well if I can)

2) Go to Community College for 1-2 years (depending on how many AP's transfer) and then switch into UCLA for CS all while working at this company part time as an iOS dev.


My question is, what do you think would be better for my career/which of these would be easier to get a good high paying job after this one?

Thanks for helping!"

Is there a way to go about asking when I can potentially get an answer?

How many people are in the CS program? 
What's the process to get an internship? 
Is it possible to get one frequently? 
Is it possible to earn one at any point in the 4/5 years you're there, or is it something only upperclassmen do?

For my second round and third round interview at this company, we spent a good chunk of those interviews talking about TPP and Pokemon in general. I have running the TPP subreddit listed on my resume usually as an extra curricular, and for my second round interview the first thing my interviewer wanted to know more about from my resume was how I was involved in TPP. I really lucked out. My interviewer happened to be a fan of the TPP stream and was really into Pokemon so I was able to connect with him and break the ice.

4cud02,1,2016-04-01,I never expected to live past eighteen.,shadowsoflace,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4cud02/i_never_expected_to_live_past_eighteen/,"I made this account just to post here.  I'm currently tapering off cymbalta and I honestly think that this withdrawal hell on top of my preexisting symptoms may be the last thing I can handle.
&amp;nbsp;

I have always been the smart, quiet kid who was bullied in school.  My mother tried her best but always preferred my younger brother  and I knew it.  I was frustrated but okay until I turned 13 and developed alopecia (autoimmune disease that causes hair loss).
&amp;nbsp;

Losing my hair gradually over the course of three years was hell on top of the hell that already was being a teenage girl.  I was self-harming and blatantly depressed and while my family did their best, they were less than helpful.  I don't remember a lot of this period of my life.  I wasn't planning to live past eighteen.
&amp;nbsp;

All my hair went when I was sixteen and I started wearing wigs.  This wasn't so bad - wearing wigs was easier than covering bald patches.  I threw myself into music groups and got my life back under control for a little while.  I was admitted to the college of my dreams and the finances worked out so I could live on campus.  I was ecstatic, and the first four months of freshman year were wonderful.  No one cared about my hair loss, I had friends, and my classes were great.
&amp;nbsp;

Then my grandmother - my only ever grandparent, my alopecia buddy - got cancer.  I was the only one who understood her diagnosis, the only one who knew she would be gone in eight months.  I called her every day for those eight months and was in the room when she died.  I was devastated but grieving, not depressed.
&amp;nbsp;

I got close with him when I returned to school for my sophomore year.  I missed my grandmother terribly and he listened to me.  He promised the hole in my heart would heal.  I was nineteen, he was twenty-eight, and I believed him.  I fell for him and we started dating in December.  Things were wonderful again until May.
&amp;nbsp;

He went across the country for an internship over the summer; I stayed home in an internship I had never wanted.   Long distance was tough, but the emotional abuse started and my depression returned here.  I was able to fly out to see him and then drive back across the country which was amazing, but I was always second priority to his whims of the moment.   We were back at school in September, and he strung me along for three more months before I demanded to know if he was committed to us and he ended it.
&amp;nbsp;

I was devastated; finally admitted the depression and found a doctor.  I can't remember the sequence of events anymore here.  He didn't actually break things off - we half-dated and he emotionally and mentally abused me (""narcissistic abuse"" is the best descriptor I've found)  for the rest of my time at college.  Three years of abuse.
&amp;nbsp;

I started the meds game.  Passed out on one, more suicidal on another, no feelings on a third.  Finally got a psychiatrist in May - they picked another med, but now I couldn't sleep and still had the mild anxiety attacks and just slightly less depression.  Five more meds - testing, waiting, weaning - no luck.  Crying every night and learning to tie a noose and finding the local train tracks and just watching the train go by.  I needed my degree and had no expectations of living past graduation.  I got through junior and senior year knowing that if things got too bad, it would only take me twenty minutes to be dead.
&amp;nbsp;

He told me he cheated on me with a nineteen-year-old five days after graduation.  This was rock bottom.  Family dragged me home in May.
&amp;nbsp;

They finally ""got the meds right"" and I slept enough to function.  I got a job in July by pure luck and hated it by September - I quit in October.  Got another job two weeks later; loved it, but it was seasonal and they didn't keep me.  My meds are ""right"" but really not.  During this time, I was playing in a music group he was in; I saw him weekly.  After he tried to intimidate me and I had to threaten him to leave me alone, he was no more a problem than my head could create on its own.  I hated seeing him but refused to let him drive me away from the music I needed in my life.
&amp;nbsp;

I've been unemployed since February.  I have realized that the degree I have is not the one I wanted; he was controlling me when I had figured out I didn't like my career options and I didn't get a chance to change it.  I can't find a job, I still can't sleep, and the cymbalta was giving me migraines.  I lied to my doctors - don't we all?  if I told them all my truth, I would never see the outside of a padded room - and they halved my cymbalta dose.  Four day migraine, mood swings like I've never had, and the depression is drowning me.  I'm crying every night again.  If I had a way to simply cease to exist I would take it.
&amp;nbsp;

I'm living home and my parents are starting to think I'm just lazy.  My mother doesn't even understand how my depression is related to my unemployment, but how do you find a job when you can barely motivate yourself to get up?  No one will hire me anyway without ""3-5 years of experience"" and with the wrong degree.
&amp;nbsp;

Who knows what the point of this post is, or why I bothered writing it, or even if I was specific enough to be clear in any way.  I can't proofread it because I just finally stopped crying and rereading will make me lose it all over again.
&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I should close this out somehow since it got so long, but I only have emptiness."

This post is very serious actually :D

Is POTD not enough for you? Do you want the satisfaction of victory over the toughest challenges without the shenanigans of the triple-crown-solo playstyle? Here's a guide to make your life miserable and awesome.

Unleash your inner scrub, assemble your team of broken legs, we're going outside of the box, on a trip to Nightmare Difficulty Mode!

Here are the rules:

1. **Play on POTD.** Trust me, you don't want Trial of Iron. This playstyle is going to ramp up in difficulty really, really hard, but only after a good while.
3. **Sell your Gaun's healing ring** first thing in the morning at the camp. The gold from this alone will let you buy gear and fill up your party with custom characters without a hassle. Do the prologue anyway you choose. We don't want that part to be difficult - we want the *end game* to be as difficult as possible - and still win through sheer force of will and skills.
2. **Be a poor strategist**, be a poor character builder, on purpose. Make your characters jack of all trades. Ignore synergies. Roleplay your stats. Twelves and fourteens are the way to go. Tens and Sixteens if you want more variations. We want your characters to have no build plan, only style.
4. **Avoid specialist characters.** You don't want a tank, you don't want a buffer, a mesmerizer, an AOE specialist or a crowd control powerhouse. If you're going to play with a Chanter, make it a backstabbing bard. If you're going to play with a Priests, play them as drunken fistfighting Monks. Fighters would be intern Wizards rather than Ladies of Pain, Rogues with Charm and Attire rather than weapon focus. Roleplay the hell out of your party at the character creation screen.
5. **Make sure you don't have a go-to battleplan**. This is important: we want every character to be as versatile as possible. We want you to be *forced* to think outside of the box and adapt to the situation in order to defeat a strong enemy.
6. **Do act 1 as you see fit, as a completionist.** Act 1 will be of moderate difficulty anyway, since every character is born equal. Try to take this as an opportunity to roleplay your plan for the rest of the game. If one of your character gets a shoulder injury during a fight, don't be afraid to think about the painful arm later on before making him a dual-wielder - maybe he'd rather use a stiletto than a war hammer in this hand.
7. **Breeze through Act 2.** Develop your party in weird, but focused ways. Roleplaying doesn't mean to waste your level-ups by picking, I don't know, weapon and shield specialization on a character who only uses bows, but rather to see a weird individual path of *character progression* and to seize it.
9. **Enter Stalwart only at level 9 and upscale it**. Be sure to reach level 9 before leaving act 2. This is where the very, very long end game begins. This is where the real Nightmare begins. Now you're behind the power curve by a hefty margin, and probably will be for most of the rest of the game: defeat the Ogre invasion! Put *all* your efforts towards completing WM part 1. Enjoy your descent into madness, but resist the urge to respec!

You're going to be done with Part 1 at around level 11. Now's the time to complete Act 2 and **unlock everything in the game upscaled for high level**. Defeat the strongest of enemies any way you can! But remember: **no strategy, only tactics**.

For the past couple weeks If you’ve been following my posts or comments I’ve been lining out a lot of innate weaknesses of human nature. Weaknesses we all have, things we all share, and I've been helping some of you to stifle and overcome them. I’ve made detailed comments like, *”Reveling In Discomfort”*, teaching guys how their fight or flight activates, how to control anxiety, how to not attach yourself to an identity or label and the pitfalls that come with that and everything in between.

Most of my writing lately comes from introspectively analyzing this sub. I notice correlations in the readers and try to help them understand the pro’s and con’s of their logic praxis. I then dissect and try to understand their line of thought and correlate it to how I think and my logic praxis. Once I gather enough info I see the strengths and weaknesses of not only them, but myself. This sub has taught me more about myself in the past few weeks than the past 10 years of introspection of myself*(I’ve been doing self improvement a long fucking time)*.

&amp;nbsp;


Why do I do all this? Because I understand;

&amp;nbsp;


##You Can Learn Something From Anyone

&amp;nbsp;

_______________________________

#What I Learned From a Racist

I talked to a European racist for 3 hours a week or two ago. While most people attacked and dismissed him I was intrigued. I want to figure out why he thinks the way he does? What made him this way? What was his background? Could he have merit to his beliefs? Could he be right? I want to dissect his internal monologue and figure out where he derives his beliefs and ideals.

Why? Because I know i can learn something from anyone if I look long enough. He eventually showed me a glimpse of the thought process behind a bigot. His first comments where as you'd except from a racist; brash, short and not very detailed or explanatory, just half baked assertions. My knee jerk reaction was to say, *""You're a fucking Idiot""* but I consciously stopped myself. I remembered I might be able to learn something from him.

&amp;nbsp;

 I had no idea what I'd learn but I started looking none the less.

&amp;nbsp;

When i learn about someone I can use that knowledge. When i see a similar thought process again, my mind will correlate it and I’ll know how to effectively understand them, reason with them, meditate with them, use them or utterly wreck them if needed. 

&amp;nbsp;

*”Know yourself and know your enemy”*- Sun Tzu.

&amp;nbsp;

His weakness ended up being using outdated science to justify his fringe beliefs. Now, If I run into another bigot, all I have to do is root out his shaky foundation and utterly destroy him with it. If you want to look at it like a video game, I gained experience and knowledge on how to handle a bigot. 

I should note that going into the conversation I had no preconceived notions of what I would find. Basic outcome independence. If he had given me scientific proof that backed his claims then I would have revised my own personal beliefs and idea's behind the topics at hand. But that isn't an outcome that happened.

While he didn't teach me anything directly. I actually learned a lot by him challenging me and my beliefs. I had to double down and research my beliefs. This, in itself was valuable. I can also use this knowledge in the future if ever needed. 

People that you disagree with can help you grow, they will probably help you more than those in agreement with you. The word *""sycophant""* has a negative connotation for a reason. The mere fact that he challenged me forced some personal growth.

&amp;nbsp;


_________________________

&amp;nbsp;


I’ve been watching /u/IamGale for the past two weeks also, I’ve addressed this post with him before hand.

Every post he makes I see correlations, every piece of information he gives me Is knowledge that can be used in vastly different ways. From the 48 laws, *”the more you say, the more can be used against you”*.

Now I have no ill-intent or malicious plans for Gale, I'll actually be talking with him later today on skype to help him out. He’s merely my sticking point, aka guinea pig for this topic today. 

&amp;nbsp;


#My Correlation Praxis

For anyone that doesn't know, a praxis is an accepted practice or belief. This is my somewhat chronological method of analysis with any situations, problem, person or environment.

&amp;nbsp;

The correlations I see in gale;

&amp;nbsp;

* Inexperienced in writing to a specific audience. It shows through in his copy/paste style format. His marketing 101 techniques he used in his intro. 

* Hustler. He posts a new topic every day, shows he’s dedicated to what he likes. He even makes a post about hustling and he’s dead on with it.

* He covers vastly different topics each post. This shows fascination, intrigue, willingness to learn.



* Young. Shows through in his writing and eventually he states his age.

* Shows discipline, understanding, mediator. Can receive criticism without taking offense. Impressive for a 22 year old.




&amp;nbsp;

I can seriously relate to IamGale, I see a young version of me in a lot of ways.


But lets now look at TRP as a whole and what correlations I see;

&amp;nbsp;

* Enjoys a bit of humility, self depreciating humor, satirical humor. I can use this.

* Most readers are fairly self aware. They’ll see right through bullshit and call it as it is. TRP is not for the thin skinned. They won’t take well being played as fools.

* They like pragmatic advice. Applicable advice. Shit that works and can be proven. They don’t care about feelings, emotions or morals. Show me the HoeFax or GTFO.

* They will be more acceptable to renown posters*(Endorsed guys)* than random new guys.*(Social hierarchy 101)*


&amp;nbsp;

Now, combine these two completely separate observations together and you’ll easily see something I can sell to someone.

Who’s that someone? IamGale of course. I contacted him and lined this exactly out for him. If I wanted to I could charge him for it. This is the basics of consulting. Identifying weaknesses, correlations to clients and their targets and helping them achieve their goals. 

Im seeing things he isn’t. I can be his adviser and help him. I now just need to have an effective pitch. His faults are;

&amp;nbsp;

* he doesn’t know his enemy*(figure of speech here, you dense fuckers)*. Enemy as in his audience.
 
* He failed to see that his copy/paste *”10 things to Make you Awesome”* and advertising 101 won’t work here. 

* TRP isn’t run of the mill masses that will blindly believe everything they read. They will fine tooth comb every one of his posts.

* He didn’t see they like pragmatic advice over theatrical advice. 

* He didn’t correlate that his age might negatively affect him when writing an article like, *”How to Make Fuck You Money”*. An article about millionaires and how to make millions won’t be well received by being written from a 22 year old that sounds like he’s trying to give you a sales pitch.

* He shows a lot of eagerness and willingness to learn, but he doesn't seem mindful of it. This can cause you to jump the gun and not think things through. Probably thee most common trait i see in the young and eager. Ever been told to slow down or pace yourself? If you've heard that before you suffer from this.

* All these observations together can then be used to deduct that he doesn't realize the importance of renown in a community. He's acting like an endorsed member without first earning the endorsement. He's the new guy on the block that's overstepping himself.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



But now it’s time to help you, time to be the TRP audience’s adviser. Let’s get back to IamGale's post, but first lets put some context in.

&amp;nbsp;

IamGale's post contained 2182 words which comes out to about 8 pages on standard 11x8.5 paper. He had 35 different cites all of which where links to highly successful people. The post itself was a mash of a bunch of different careers and processes to making money. Different industries, careers, methods and practices where used as examples. However the post itself was half baked. Wasn't formated well for the delivery he was posting. He didn't really address his thought process or reasoning behind *""why""* he was posting or it's importance to the reader. Which is bad as the reader is left to make his own interpretation of the value and importance of the post. And readers will have drastically different interpretations when you fail at this.

&amp;nbsp;



Now onto this quote;

Everyone that upvoted this comment doesn’t understand that,

#You Can Learn Something From Anyone

At face value, /u/IamGale didn’t have a great format or direction for his post. But you know what his post has a shit ton of? 35 cites to a ton of extremely successful individuals that everyone here could learn a fuck ton from. 35 cites that he personally scoured the internet for. 35 cites that he's probably all read and see's some value in, which he thought would be useful or beneficial to the members of this sub.

 Most of you attack him for the face value of his post without seeing that he’s basically spend a ton of time collecting a ton of resources for you. He’s the intern you send out to go find a bunch of shit that you can use. You give the intern a problem, in this case he thought you guys should learn about highly successful men, and then presented it all to you. Some of you got it, some of you didn’t.

I’ll personally back his post just from the sheer amount of cites he linked and I’m going to personally read through every one of them. His post before this one was about Neil Patel and his 12 month venture into a brand new blog which he is using as a case study. I’ve read every single one of them and have learned a lot from them. I’m going to continue reading and learning from Neil Patel because he has shit I can use.

&amp;nbsp;

TRP 101, *""Use what fits you and discard the rest""*.

&amp;nbsp;

Most of you might not find his cites useful. But just like the racist, I didn't know if I'd be wasting my time or actually learn something. Just because you don't see an initial value, doesn't mean its not there. And it terms of a forum, down voting it deprives that possibility to someone that might find it useful.

Now, here is **why** most people focus on face value and why IamGale got ripped apart.

&amp;nbsp;

There is an innate design of humanity to focus on the worst possible outcome. I’m sure there is a name for it in some psych book but the point is, if you are human, you like negativity. There is a reason the Colosseum is one of the 8th wonders of the ancient world. There is a reason UFC is one of the tops sports in the world right now. There is a reason every time you get on facebook, it’s mostly a bunch of people bitching about how hard their life is. There is a reason this correlation is shown throughout all of human history. There is a reason IamGale’s post was received negatively.

##Human’s will focus on the most negative thing they can find

When you look at it through evolution's point of view, this is a perfect design. 100,000 if you didn't spot and focus on a negative stimuli like say, a fucking lion, guess what, those ancestors don't have any offspring today. But this psychological relic is from a bygone era. It wasn't designed for higher cognitive thought. It was design to keep you alive, not to be used when you are verbalizing random words together to form a sentence to some other random person. *(Cognitive thought only evolved 50,000 years ago. Our much older subsystems from millions of years of evolution still have some integration and bug-fixing to go through)*

Now that you know this. You can stop yourself from attacking things at face value. Gale can be conscious of these pitfalls when writing to the masses and learn that they will tear apart any of his post whenever they can spot a weakness, because it's human nature to focus on the most negative aspect.

 Now you the reader can literally learn anything from anyone, even a racist. All you have to do is be conscious of your knee jerk reaction and your evolutionary design to do so. you can find value in almost anything. Sometimes it’s a waste of time, but not if you think abstractly enough about it. I could learn something from a 4 year old if I wanted to and spent enough time on it.


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

____________________________________________


A lot of my writings are to teach you about your past evolutionary design and how it can help or hinder your personal progression. Some of these psychological designs are useful, but like this one, it can be detrimental for self actualizing and learning.

#Lessons Learned




&amp;nbsp;

##Human’s will focus on the most negative thing they can find

&amp;nbsp;


##You can Learn something from anyone

&amp;nbsp;


####Combine these two teachings and you can quickly open yourself up to new ideas and apply them in abstract ways for the benefit of yourself or others

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


I do this every day. My job was built around identifying completely unrelated things and applying them in abstract ways to produce a superior outcome or process. This is the basic building blocks of invention. Take two completely separate things and combine them. If you want to be more creative, this is where I'd start.

&amp;nbsp;


Curiosity drives growth. If you lose your curiosity, if you can't be intrigued by those you don't understand, it will stunt your growth. I can teach you that you can learn something from anyone, but it's up to you to apply some self discipline on your knee jerk reactions. To use your head and apply some abstract thought and unconventional methods to make it worth something valuable. It might end up being valuable to you, or someone else. If it's someone else then you can probably make money from it.

&amp;nbsp;


I could have easily deducted nothing from the Racist even after 3 hours of talking to him, dismissed it as a wast of time. I could have easily given into my knee jerk reaction and taken his comment at face value, just like those in IamGale's post. But I remembered i might learn something. Instead of letting my emotions drive my response I let my curiosity do the talking. I detached myself from the conversation. Then I learned what I needed from the racist. Now I can remember that conversation and use it in the future. 

Him challenging me also allowed me to grow and gain more knowledge. Just because someone isn't overtly giving you something*(overt as in knowledge, a produce or service)* you can still covertly grow just via them challenging you. 

*(Take a look at SJW's for an example of when you refuse to be challenged and what type of person that line of though produces)*

&amp;nbsp;

##The Loaded Gun of Value

Just like the loaded gun analogy, this teaching is the exact opposite. Expect to learn something from anyone, even if at first they don't pose much value. Just like treating the gun as if it is loaded, even if it's not, treat the new info as valuable, even if you can't see it yet.

4cvd4h,0,2016-04-01,"I dislike my family, sometimes I consider cutting off contact with them",Thr0w4w4y_12345,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4cvd4h/i_dislike_my_family_sometimes_i_consider_cutting/,"Hello,

I'm 20 and I'm originally from a small village in the southern part of Poland, currently living on the other side of the country (~450km or ~280 miles away).

My problem I have is that I don't like my family. In fact, I dislike most of the people so that isn't really surprising. But let me tell you more about them:

- mom - she always was overprotective, very demanding, for example about school (explained later), hypocrite, nosey
- dad - alcoholic, usually not aggressive but dumb as fuck. He always knows better and holds to his position even if it's clear for everyone else he's wrong. Further disagreement may end up with him shouting. I basically hate him for being a fucking asshole. We barely talked in my entire life.
- grandparents from mother's side - they lived with us, so I will add a few words about them too. They're nice people, but we rarely even talk as they're totally different for me and we don't have common topics (I'm not the kind of guy who talks about weather)

As a kid (8-12) I was suffering from separation anxiety disorder, and later (12-now) from social anxiety disorder. My parents never helped me with my mental health, they even haven't had any idea that something could be wrong with me (crying every day at kindergarten or not having any friends in high school is normal, right?). When I was in the last grade of high school I have self-diagnosed myself and started working on improvement. But to this day I'm still missing many years of emotional development. A girlfriend? Nice joke, I have never held girl's hand. At least now I can eat in public without a fear of someone laughing at me, it used to be a problem for me just few years ago.


About that school thing - I was (and still am) good at learning, and after elementary school my mom was so used to me getting 5s and 6s (grade scale 1-6) she would get really mad if I get a bad grade (like 3, though it's not necessarily bad). Then I discovered programming and felt like it's my thing, something I want to do, so I didn't want to spend few hours every day to learn about the fucking mitochondria (don't get me wrong, I love to learn about almost anything, including biology, but not when I'm forced to). She wasn't demanding because she wanted me to achieve something, she was demanding because she didn't achieve anything and was just projecting her issues and regrets onto me. She thought the fact that I'm more intelligent than an average person means I have to know EVERYTHING. I was never allowed to have problems. Continuous homework and learning caused I didn't know shit about social stuff as I never went out (it was especially difficult because, as I mentioned, it was a small village and there was simply nothing to do and only 1 of my school friends lived nearby).

I was also forced to go to parties organized by school. It was fucking HELL. As I didn't have any social skills, all I could do was stand in the corner hoping no one will take notice of me. The last party I was forced to go to was ""komers"" (I can't find any translation, it's a party organized at the end of middle school, kind of like prom). Luckily I wasn't forced to go to the prom although I had to deny that I have any desire to go there for months.

Oh, and they're all catholics. I never really believed in any god and when I told them I'm an atheist (I was about 14 back then) there was a real shitstorm. That's when I came first to the conclusion ""fuck them, I don't need them"". I was forced to go to church, confession and to religious education at school (yeah, in Poland we have lessons in school about ~~religion~~ catholicism) until I was 18.

I always was kind of rebellious, questioning authority and whatnot. Whenever I stood up to my parents, no matter how right I was, the consequences were bad. They always knew what was ""better"". Let me give you an example - I wanted to buy a TV, I had some money and I found the model I want. My mom told me she will go buy it at local consumer electronics store. It turned out they didn't have the model I wanted so she ordered a different one (she didn't buy it yet). So I told her to cancel that order and that I'll buy one online. The answer? No. Why? Because fuck you, that's why. I was young back then and after some emotional blackmail (crying) I let it go.

First step into the right direction was me getting a job - I was 16 and got a remote internship as a programmer. It allowed me to make some money and get experience.

Almost 2 years ago (day after I received results of high school final exam) I moved away to a big city and it really helped me starting to live the way I want to. Now I have a well-paid job and I'm doing great on my own (there's no better feeling than coming to your own home and doing whatever you want after a long day). But it's not over. My mom is now a bit nicer to me (mainly because she no longer has control over me), but demands to see me often - twice a week on Skype and about every two months she wants me to visit her or wants to visit me (6 hours travel by a train), despite me not wanting that. She's not asking, she's just demanding. She also wants to know everything about my life. She's fucking annoying and always wonders why I'm so harsh towards her. I have better things to do than answer the same questions over and over (because that's what she mostly does). Now I can at least talk back, the worst she can do is get mad and cry a little bit, but I don't really give a shit, emotional blackmail no longer works on me. I am aware she might have mental issues (probably separation anxiety disorder too), but I'm not going to do whatever she wants.

I feel like they fucked up my life pretty good and I don't want them to take any pride in me, because all I achieved was done by me and only me. Sometimes I have a desire to cut off the contact with them and disappear because it's probably the only way they would fuck off.

So... yeah, I think that's all the important info. Please let me know what do you think about my situation. I would like to know if cutting off contact is the right thing to do."

4cwxgr,54,2016-04-01,In defense of Sapienza,MasterMaple,HiTMAN,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/4cwxgr/in_defense_of_sapienza/,"I must say, I'm a tad irritated with some of the complaints surrounding the new Sapienza release date.  A lot of it seems to be 


""What! So late in April, what the hell, IO!""


I take issue with this sort of complaining for a number of reasons;

First off, we've been demanding a concrete release date for Sapienza practically since the game shipped. Well, now we have one. And it's not the one we wanted, BUT

It's the one we were all expecting. Everyone on this subreddit seemed to predict that it would be out **in late April**. Last I checked, April the 26th is **late April**. So I find a lot of the complaints about how ""IO lied to everyone"" with the release date are, for want of a better term, counterfeit. IO promised us it would release in April. Sapienza is confirmed to release in April. There you go. I know it's disappointing, but that's how a lot of software releases work.


Which ties into my next point. The game has a lot of issues right now, especially for our PC gamers, and I'd rather have a solid user experience for everyone when Sapienza rolls around than watch as the fanbase is further divided between those with consistent online access and those without. 

I guess the point I'm building to here is that word of mouth about Hitman is **atrocious**, and I personally don't think this is good for the game. And I've seen a bunch of comments and threads about this, but I think that both HitmanForum and this subreddit are playing a healthy part in destroying this game's appearance in the public eye. Because people go online to research the game and find post after post talking about the same bugs and connectivity issues, and people talking about the lack of content. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to see the game go down that lonely road, lined with the corpses of other decent games with bad word of mouth. 


People are frustrated and angry and (to quote u/White000, who I think put it best) fragile. Being on this sub is enough to make my head spin sometimes: one moment I'm full-on backs-to-the-wall there-will-be-no-retreat defending this game to my friends, because I really think that this could be one of the best *Hitman* games ever if only the game was a bit more stable, but at the same time I put well over an hour and a half into the world's best-disguised shitpost about the state of the game. I mean, I drew it script-style and everything. And it's weird moments of flip-flopping like that that make me gloomy whenever I think about the game and it's direction. And that's not what the game needs, it's not what *IO* needs.


I know we all have very valid complaints about the game and its direction, and I have no issue with seeing these issues brought up for reasonable discussion, provided I can look at the list of new posts and not want to play solo Russian roulette with a fully-loaded gun. And IO, as has been said before, *really needs* to step up their communication game. Do you hear me u/TravisIO and u/RubberDuckInSuit? ***TALK TO US***, for god's sake. You don't have the luxury of turning your back on what might quickly turn into an angry mob. You might not think it's a big deal, but consistent communication would make a lot of that bad press go away. Find a designer who's not doing anything, find a PR rep, find an intern, find *someone*, but it cannot be overstated how vital this is to the future of your game. You might think we're not ready, or that you have more important things to do. Trust me, we're ready, and no, you really don't.


But at the same time, I'd also like to extend my sympathies to you. It must be hard, having to spin plates, juggling hotfixes, escalations, elusive targets and the new maps, and then coming online and seeing angry post after angry post. And I think this is where I'd like to send a personal message to all you guys; You're doing a good job. A lot of the comments you receive might make it seem otherwise, but you are. We just think you can do *better*, and you're *so close* to making a truly amazing Hitman game. Just...*Listen* to us.


But at the same time, I have a message (more a request, I suppose) for *you guys*, and it's going to sound kind of blunt; can we *please* lighten up? Just a little bit? Because if this game's still going to be around six months from now, it'll be because we defended it even when it was flawed and imperfect. There's a lot to enjoy in Paris, and now most of us are done with it, it's time to do something positive with the memories, to try and have some positive Yin to counter-balance the critical Yang. Of course, you could just ignore me. I've been on a slump lately in terms of post quality so my karma's already in ruins. But *please*, can we try and look on the bright side, starting with this thread. Reminisce and tell stories about Paris without fear of spoiling, since we've all basically completed the level by now. Wax nostalgic about *Hitmans* past (I'm on *Contracts* now. The second Rotterdam mission is kicking my ass). Discuss characters in the game, possible leads for the future. Theorycraft while the game's young and the plot's still clay waiting to be molded. Express your hopes for the game's future. You have the comments for this thread, and you have the whole damn subreddit. 


Let's do something *positive*, yeah?  "

Have questions on my future career.,samanor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4cyd6c/im_a_fresh_graduate_with_a_software_consulting/,"I've been offered a job at a consulting company, Sogeti (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention the name, mods if its in violation I'll remove), and I like the offer. However my goal in life is to be a developer, and not to stay in consulting for long. If i were to take this job, I would have many opportunities to study up on certificates or other skills when I'm not on a project. I understand there is a lot of travel involved, but my main current concern is if I were to work here for a year or so, would I be limited in trying to translate my career back into development? From what I understand, I wouldn't be too far from development in the first place, the sales team is who bring clients in and the consultants are the ones who are placed on the projects. I would be building a skill set through varied projects, but I would have the ""Jack of all Trades"" syndrome and wouldn't ""master"" one. 

Some background on me, I've never had an internship, but I've held a job for all of school. It was a computer lab job, so semi-related to the field but hardly technical. I'll be graduating this May, and the job offer is for after I graduate. 

If anyone has some experience with starting out in consulting, or has any idea on the impact this may have on my future career, please chime ."

My boss just gave me my official offer to come on full time and it's 70k a year! I've never made more than 9k in one year and I'm flabbergasted at the amount of money I'll have. I am currently in the process of buying a condo (140K), I plan on enrolling in their 401k (10% matching, SCORE) when I'm eligible, and putting 5k in an IRA so I can stay in the 15% tax bracket for the year.

This is all great but I'm not sure what what would be the smartest way to save/invest my money. I'm going to talk to an advisor but I thought reddit would be helpful as well. Currently I make 1200 after taxes a month minus rent, I will be making 2600 after my mortgage once I go full time. That gives me about 1400 per month that I wouldn't miss if I saved or invested. 

So reddit, what should I do?"

What can I do over the summer that will look good to both corporate employers and academia (I'm planning to do a masters as well, eventually)?

I am pretty good at R already, I know some Python. Will doing research with R and Python on my own and putting it on my personal site be beneficial in any way? 

I'm so bummed out right now. I have a final coming up next week and I'm not motivated whatsoever. An internship isn't going to hide my low GPA but I was happy because it would have looked excellent on the CV and it might have taken some weight off the GPA. Plus, more attractive to employers."

What I'd like to do is get a vector map of the streets within the city and import that into illustrator, but I can't seem find any sites that work. Most sites I've found have either been wrong, or include such insane level of instructions that it's frustrating.

The first (and major step) is to ""be large enough that street names are visible for at least most of the streets of the city"", which requires the streets to have a width rather than single line.

My opinions are based on my experiences and should not discourage anyone getting the help they need. 

When I was pregnant, I was 17 (I'm now 21) and I struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts on a regular basis. I knew I needed help, and so my doctor sent a referral to a psychiatric team to help me. The wait list was 1.5 years, but due to cancellation I was able to get in a month after the referral was sent. 

Initially, I met and saw an intern for the psychiatrist on a weekly basis. She was amazing, fully understanding, attentive, and helped me realize I wasn't a bad person for feeling the way I was, that it was normal with hormonal imbalances and such. I felt great leaving her office every day, and felt like the depression was ebbing away because I learned how to deal with it. She also recommended, post partum, I get put on antidepressants since talk therapy won't help like pills will when it comes to PPD like she figured I would get.

After 2 months, her internship was over and so I switched to seeing the psychiatrist I was supposed to see. From day 1, it was horrible. She told me once I sat down that she will not be giving me medication post partum because she believed talking for at least a year will help. She ordered blood work to check for chemical imbalances as well as drug use because of my age. The results came back that all i had wrong was a B12 deficiency, leading cause of depression. She refused to diagnose me with depression or anything aside from separation anxiety and adjustment anxiety. She didnt even recommend I take vitamin suppliments to correct it. She said nothing about fixing it.

 She was dismissive of most everything I said, barely interacted with me, and showed her true uncaring colors after I had my son.

She saw me weekly after I had my son, and continued seeing me after he showed signs of illness and was admitted to a local children's hospital. We didn't find out a diagnosis until November, when he was 3 months old, which showed it was a genetic disorder causing chronic kidney disease.

 I turned 18 in October and so couldn't see that psychiatrist anymore. When I saw her a final time, I was a wreck. I thought I had somehow done this to my son, my depression and suicidal thoughts were at an all-time high, I was terrified of losing my child to an unknown disease and I was ripping at the seams. I asked her to send a referral to an adult psychiatrist because I knew I needed help and she refused. She said I was perfectly fine and don't need to waste a psychiatrists time when there's nothing I need except a venting mechanism.

How can you talk to your loved ones about wanting to end your life? How could you explain to them the feelings mounting inside you when you don't really understand them yourself? How can you face your family with that elephant in the room every time you're around them? How could someone expect you to do that when it'll make everything worse for you mentally and emotionally?

I never got the help I needed because a psychiatrist who was full of it wrote in my file that I was over exaggerating what I was feeling and she ""does not recommend I see anyone"" about it. One month later, my son crashed after major surgery and we almost lost him. I almost lost myself. I needed help which wasn't there for me because of my age and a doctor who doesn't believe in helping people who actually need it.

It took a long time, but I trained myself to feel better. I rewired my train of thought and the first thing to go was the suicidal thoughts. I overcame them by remembering that my son needs a mommy, that my fiance needs the love of his life, that my parents need their little girl, that everyone in my life needs me for one reason or another.

I haven't felt suicidal in about 2 years. I haven't felt majorly depressed in about 1 year, but I still am depressed. My anxiety has strengthened, but I'm dealing with it. All of the negativity and anxiety has been severely reduced because I, myself have helped me. I still have flare-ups, I still get in depressed moods, but I can talk myself up from it and feel better quickly.

I have supports in my life that help if I need it, but I never tell people how severe it is or what exactly is happening so they can't help more than what they try, because I have too much anxiety to divulge in such things.

Canada may have free health care, but at the end of the day, it's yourself that changes the way you think. It's your mindset, your emotions, everything that you're made of. I embraced my negativity and worked on rerouting those emotions to positive ones, thank God my man is understanding about it and knew I was trying, because he's stuck by me through all of my mood swings, break downs, psychotic episodes and everything. I feel like I'm a better person now, a better mother, soon-to-be wife, daughter and friend, and it is absolutely no thanks to Canada's mental health care."

Compared to UMBC's  program(which I am still considering, as they gave me a 10K/year scholarship [w/no honors college]), what advantages does UMD's program have above the competition?

Also, does being a ""small fish in a big pond"" make it harder to compete for internships and the likes? Or do most students get an internship by means of the program reputation and connections? 

Just some background on me. I have a good deal of programming experience. Although I don't consider my self amazing, I think I'm fairly good at it-- although at UMD, I fully understand I may be in the middle of the pack. 

 Although I am strongly leaning on going here, I just want to know what I'm getting into before I sign up.

A lot of these phone interviews I seem to have failed, but I do not know what I'm doing wrong. The phone interviews basically just tell me about their company and then ask if I'm interested. These interviews don't last very long, probably 10 minutes top. They don't seem to ask any questions at all. When I say I'm interested, they say they will email me back on details of a potential face to face interview. Their email about 2 days later say they have moved forward.

I will be a summer intern for 10 weeks from early June through mid-August. The site is in southeastern Phoenix, near Tempe close to the baseball stadium. I'm flying in from the Midwest and will not have my car with me. I've heard that it's not easy to get by without a car in Phoenix; however, a rental car is out of my budget sadly. 


I've been looking on craigslist for housing options within walking distance, but it seems like the vast majority of sublets for rent are student apartments by the university, 3-4 miles away. If anyone here knows someone who is renting out of southeastern Phoenix, I'd definitely be interested!


I've looked at the public transport system but it doesn't look like the metro goes by my area at all. I did find two bus routes that might work, but they only go down literally just one street, so it wouldn't connect me to where most of the housing is. 


I was also considering just biking to work, but I haven't ridden a bike in years (I'm more of a runner, heh) and I'd probably be out in 100+ F weather. Also, I've heard the streets aren't very biker friendly. (Or maybe that's the drivers.)



My last option would be to Uber to work, which I've looked up would be $5-11, so I'll say $10 each way on average. This would still be cheaper than renting a car.. However, I'm wondering if there are enough Uber drivers on the roads to consistently find rides to work on time. I'm also a little worried about the traffic.


If anyone has input on this, I would really appreciate advice! Right now I'm just focused on how to get to work and back. I've looking through the sidebar link but it seems like it's written for people who have cars. "

I've done a bit of research on the CS professors at Boulder, and it seems like the department has a lot going for it. Any word from the inside about that? Also, I'm somewhat concerned that the intro classes in CS won't be as engaging as I might hope, given that I already have a reasonable amount of programming experience. Are the some related electives that I can take alongside those? In the same vein, how far ahead will credit from AP CS get me on that track? 

I've heard that Boulder is thriving in terms of tech related businesses. Is it possible to get an internship after my freshman year, and how is the support network for job opportunities and such?

So I am graduating with my bachelor's in electrical engineering in a few months and am scouring for a job still. I never thought I'd have this much trouble finding a position because my grades are good, I have internship experiences, and I've been told my interviewing skills are great.


My main issue is that I would love to stay in the area I'm living in (Dallas, TX area) as I have friends and family here. Looking around on sites such as Glassdoor though, it looks like salaries (especially entry-level salaries) are very low for this area. I realize this is partially due to differences in cost-of-living, but I'm seeing average salaries here being $15k, $20k, sometimes even $25k less than other states. I really do think I am work being paid well due to my skills and experience, even though I am a new graduate.

Anyway, I interviewed at a company today and things went well. After interviewing with multiple people on-site, I was emailed a questionnaire including a question about salary expectations. I'd imagine that they looking for an actual figure or range, correct? I've done quite of bit of research today, but the salary range I'm finding is quite large. I know entry-level salaries typically depend on size of the company, and it is a small-ish subsidiary of a huge international company ($5-10 billion/year).

I guess I'm looking for some advice on how to approach this situation, perhaps where I should go from here and where to look. It's difficult making huge decisions on how to start my career path, for example knowing that switching jobs typically results in a new higher salary based on your old salary, so wouldn't it be more beneficial then to start working in an area with a higher cost of living?

I need your opinion on this. Since I graduated from my Master's degree in business (3.5 years ago) I've been working as a freelancer in writing novels. I've been VERY successful, been making about 3000-10.000 Euro (I live in Spain) per month, and I love what I do. I love writing stories, I love being flexible with my time and people like my books (I even have fans on my Facebook fan page). 

I'm 28 now, and I start worrying a bit. The money is still great, nothing has changed, BUT I'm worried if I will be able to do this my entire life or not. I'm scared that in a couple of years, my books won't sell anymore and then I won't have any source of income. If that happens, I won't have practical experience from working in a company, which means no company would employ me (I guess my Master's degree won't matter anymore since I don't have any practical experience except of my internships during my studies). That means I would probably have to work as a waitress, in a call center, or something like that. I really don't want to do that.

I'm still young and I know that now I could still get a good job in a company (I've even had a few companies contacting me through LinkedIn), but I think it won't always be like that. So I could take a job in a company now, but that would mean I won't be able to do the writing anymore, at least much less frequently (since I'd be working full-time). Plus I wouldn't be able to manage my own time and be flexible anymore. If the future didn't count at all, I wouldn't take a job in a company because I love what I do (writing) and I love my life. Also, living in Spain means not very high salaries, so my salary right now through my writing is higher than it would be in any company that would offer me a job now. But the future really worries me. I don't wanna be 40, suddenly unsuccessful at writing and be dependent on a waitress job (no offense against being a waiter, it's just not what I want).


I would really appreciate your advice. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Take a job in a company to be more secure, even though that's not really what I want? Or keep writing and do what I love, even though that could mean a risky future?


Thanks!"

I feel like I'm frozen, I can't make a move to start learning something because I may not like it or it may be a bad career move and then I would have wasted all of my time.

I have interests in AI, security, space (possibly doing simulations), embedded systems, molecular modelling, neuroscience.. you name it and I think it would be cool to work in the field. I know people will say 'just jump in and start working with one', but I can't justify doing that in my head without an end goal, hence me being frozen. The most important thing to me is that I'm challenged, but I also want to make sure I can get a job and that I'm actually interested in what I'm working on (the pay isn't terribly important). 

Does anyone else have this problem or is it just me being indecisive? I've been known to change majors my fair share. "

I am a chemical engineer fresh out of college last June. I started an internship with a process safety consulting firm last May which gave me a full-time offer last June. However, I was later let go in September and took the opportunity to move across the country from the west coast back home to the midwest. 

I immediately took the first job offer I could get as an Environmental, Health and Safety Engineer for a manufacturing company in November and was told I would temporarily work as a technician, then move on as a full-time engineer. In short, this job ensures that all chemistry is fed to all of the machines in the plant, operating our batch treatment and ion exchange units and operating our Reverse Osmosis units which feed all of the machines in the plant; it is a very important role and the area cannot be neglected for very long. It is now April and I have been told that what they meant was that I remain a part of the shift rotation as a technician, but 'put off' tech work for the other shifts while I 'do engineering’ and ‘let things idle.’ I have been trying to make headway by convincing them that this is impractical / not possible, which the other technicians and operators of the plant agree with, but they are convinced that I can make things so efficient I will not have to spend much time operating the equipment. I have been able to reduce my time spent on ‘tech work’ from 90% to about 70%, but I strongly believe I have reached a cap. 

I am having an incredibly rough time due to anxiety issues / insomnia and being a part of a shift rotation / working odd hours. I am looking to put in my 2 weeks notice and try to move on. I really was / am trying to stick it out to find a job while employed, but this is simply tearing me a part.








**tl;dr** had an internship for 1 month then offered full time position, was let go after 4 months. Now currently at a job I am struggling immensely with and not enjoying after 5 months and was mislead about the position. Want to move on.








**My question is:** Do I now look like a job hopper? Right now on my resume I have my first job with no job title listed, just the company. For my current job, the title and company are listed. Would it be dishonest to list the internship title under the first job and omit the full-time job title I had? Or should I omit the first job/company entirely? Or should I keep it the way it is with no title listed at all then answer any questions they have?

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4d2kx2/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

4d2lon,2,2016-04-02,"I don't really know much about internships/co-ops, so I figured y'all would be the best place to turn.",fitzjack,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4d2lon/i_dont_really_know_much_about_internshipscoops_so/,"So I transferred into a computer science program at another university here in Kentucky. Upon completing the application and acceptance forms I had to run a degree audit, I have 41 credits left, 3 of which are a required co-op during a summer semester. 

I may be able to knock all of the credits out in two semesters, I've always had high credit hour loads so far so it isn't a huge deal. So would a co-op leave me struggling to find a job without an internship or would they look at the co-op as sort of an internship?

I of course plan on doing a side project during my next couple semesters. One of my classes I'll have to take is Mobile Development for iOS, so I actually have a plan for a project already thought out. I've been keeping relatively decent grades, around a 3.5 GPA, which is only getting better now that I'm doing good in school. 

So basically I'm curious if I'm going to be hurting in the job market if I do graduate in two semesters?

For me this decision is between UIUC and UMD and I'm having a tough time figuring out which school I'd rather attend. Here are the factors in play so far:

Major

* At UIUC, I'd be in the #5 ranked CS program in the engineering school as ranked by US News
* At UMD, I'd be at the #15 ranked CS program, but because it's not an engineering school, it could be easier to double major and I could also major in the #10 ranked Applied Mathematics program

Location

* I live in New Jersey, so UIUC is much farther from home than UMD
* UIUC really doesn't have anything nearby besides cornfields 
* UMD had DC close by which is pretty awesome 
* In terms of culture, I might feel more at home at UMD because it's east coast whereas UIUC is midwest.

Opportunities 

* From what I've heard, people at UIUC have a much easier time finding summer internships and jobs 
* UMD is near DC so there would be a lot of opportunity in the government and with government contractors. 

Price and Honors 

* UIUC didn't give me any scholarships and I didn't get into their honors program 
* UMD is giving me $12k a year and I was accepted into the honors college 

That's what I've considered so far. Am I missing anything? What's your guys' opinion on this?"

Let's assume all of these schools are the same price since I don't have financial aid details yet.

USC:
Pros - California. Good racial diversity. Lots of undergrads yet small class sizes.

Cons - I heard they use grade deflation. Also there are a lot of students I'd have to compete against for internships and research opportunities.



Dartmouth:
Pros - Obviously the name. Strong alumni group and small class sizes. Large endowments.

Cons - Freezing winters. Strong Greek presence (I don't want to rush). Almost in the middle of nowhere



Emory:
Pros - Fantastic medical school nearby. Pretty campus. Fun things to do in Atlanta

Cons - In the South (I'm from the South). Sciences aren't ranked as high as the other two schools.

Can anyone provide insight? Thanks!"

* Awards: National Merit Letter of Commendation, some other random MUN stuff (irrelevant)
* Extracurriculars: Basically I did not have a variety of clubs, but rather leadership positions in few clubs that I continued through my HS career. Had a great summer internship over the summer--I think this DEFINITELY helped me since it made my interest in business clear. I wrote about this internship in any supps that asked about ECs, and my boss wrote me a supplemental letter of recommendation which I believe helped my app a lot.
* Essays: These were probably what made or broke it for me. The schools that I got into I wrote really good essays for that I was proud of. The schools I didn't get into were essays that I reused without tailoring it to the prompt. The only school I got rejected from that I believed I had amazing essays for was Princeton, but Ivies are always a toss-up so I'm not in any way disappointed. I changed my Common App essay entirely from my early cycle to my regular cycle, but I don't think it really made that much of a difference (other than give me piece of mind).
* Teacher Recs: My two teacher recs were probably excellent, and my counselor rec was amazing. I doubt these hurt me in anyway.

**Final Notes**

Listen. The college process sucks. My #1 tip: DON'T DO THE ESSAY FOR YOUR DREAM SCHOOL FIRST! My first essay was for Penn and it was definitely my worst, even though I spent months on it. The essays I wrote for Georgetown, even though they took me about a day or two, were incredibly strong (in my opinion). Another tip, have a balanced list. I'd like to think my list was pretty balanced, I threw on a couple reaches at the end (Harvard &amp; Dartmouth) just because I didn't want to regret not applying there, and I had already gotten into two great early schools (U-M &amp; UChicago). But I have friends who applied to seven Ivies with less-than-stellar stats and now they're incredibly unhappy. On that note, MAKE SURE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY GO TO YOUR TARGET/SAFETY SCHOOLS. USC was a target for me, and I would've been happy to go if it was my only choice. I was so lucky to get the Trustee scholarship, and now I might be getting a $20,000 stipend. It's amazing when a college makes you feel wanted, especially a college that you want. Make sure you apply to places you WANT to go to, and at least a few of those places will return the feeling.

CollegeConfidential is definitely a source of stress but for me stressing about college was my way of having control. Make good decisions folks, and I promise your hard work will pay off. Think about finances when applying to college, because colleges do NOT give as much FA as you think in most cases. I always thought I'd go to Georgetown over USC, but FA might change that for me. To seniors reading this, congrats WE MADE IT! Now is the first time in the college process where WE have the control, where we send colleges OUR decisions on THEM. To juniors, good luck. Be organized. Don't leave your essays for the very end. I finished all my essays early and ended up scrambling to help all my friends edit their essays. AND ALSO TRY HARD YOUR SENIOR YEAR--your grades that year matter a lot. To sophomores/freshmen, keep in mind where you want to apply. Maybe start visiting colleges now-ish, so that you don't have to when you're busy junior/senior year. Think about what you want to do. If you don't know, that's alright too. A lot of kids apply undeclared to colleges, and a lot of schools (particularly liberal arts schools) allow for a flexible curriculum/changes of majors.

And on that note, I'm out."

He will be graduating college in computer science soon and will likely be guaranteed a job paying between 40-60k CAD upon graduation. She is on paid internship at the moment for a few more months, and has a year left of an engineering degree. It's going to be difficult for her to finish her degree after the baby is born. We're both pretty much debt-free, and we each have about 10-20k saved up, although some of it is an educational fund. We would much prefer to buy a house than to live with our parents if it will be financially worth it in the long run. We need advice! 

What next steps should we take? 
How can we deal with the judgment that will inevitably come? 
Is it too early to look into buying a house? 
What costs do we need to prepare for? 
Will we be able to start saving for our child's education right away? What are the best books on parenting? 
What habits should we get into before the baby is born?
How can we break the news without freaking people out too much?
Do we have too much on our plates to look into getting married before the baby is born?"

**Age:** 20

**Resources/Assets:** Having turned on her Master and Trainer, she has lost a vast majority of her income, and now lives a day to day by pocketing people and the occasional mugging. She restocks on Ammo and weapons by hitting up criminal drop points, and often clearing them of life and stock. She lacks any permanent vehicle and instead just takes anything thats open or available, be it pedal bikes or helocopters.


**Species/Race:** Meta-Human


**[Physical Description](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b2/f5/7e/b2f57e4a1bc2434ffddc7dc1a19739e2.gif):** Chidori is a slightly tan women with purple hair and eyes, though one is heavily injured and has white splotches along the bottom of it. Her hair is a purple color that hands to about her mid back, she often does it up in a large bun when out and about. Her outfits generally consist of tank tops, to show off her tone arms and to allow a freedom of movement, while her lower half is generally wearing a baggy pair of cargo shorts. When she is prepared for a fight she dons a armored [mask](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/njDnbT_t9gg/maxresdefault.jpg), a [scarf](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/1200x/32/6e/a1/326ea14077ce8e7042e06fdec7db4836.jpg), and a set of Kevlar woven outfits, allowing for some added defense while maintaining mobility. 


**Mentality:** She has a outward appearance of a joy rider, someone that looks for adrenaline rushes in the most dangerous situations, and takes every challenge as a personal one. On the inside she is a ball of anger looking for a outlet in every way, with a inability to trust anyone to get close since her trainer betrayed her, she can allow her self friends but she will never let herself be completely open with someone, so she masks it with her action junky go lucky up beat vibe. She wishes to make something good of her powers, but al she really knows is the way of killing, so she will try to stop crime in a vigilante and punisher-esque style. When Oda or Meme are mentioned she is likely to enter a rage filled mode, and is easy to upset with the names of those two. She will attack them on sight despite various other dangerous factors.

**Backstory:** 

**Basil** *laid there pinned under the rubble, the buildings around him collapsing, and a smile on his face. His free hand reached for a cigarette in his breast pocket and placed it in his mouth, as a figure stepped through the flames.*

'Thats funny, where on the 30th floor' 

*Basil chuckled as the cigarette fell out. The figure stood with a aura of light coming off it.*

""You are the Rider arent you? My people thought you where something of a demigod, you fought so many things, and we find out you are nothing more than a regular mortal man. Now i will claim your helmet, and your life.""

*The unknown man raised his hand, and a dark violet orb formed in it.*

""Hehehehehe- hahahahahahahaha""

""What is so funny?""

""You bad guys and your speeches, i've held your and your freinds long enough for mine to get here.""

*In the distance a helicopter could be seen landing on a roof top as other heroes arrived, and several others flew in. The robed mans face lost all semblance of calm, with red filling in his pale face.*

""Well it seems you did one last good thing, no i must even say impressive, before your d-""

*Basil raised his fist up and interrupted the mysterious man.*

""You might be good, and they might be impressive, but i'm Basil fucking Deltree.""

*and with that, basil opened his fist and revealed, a handful of pulled pins.*

----

**Chidori Mitsuki** *A prodigy in the world of crime, be it theft or assassination, she was destined to be something of a big wig in the underworld if not for her master and trainers betrayal. It was supposed to be a regular assassination, the only oddity was the target, there was virtually no info on the target beside his location. She wasn't aware that this mission would be her intended last, until she opened the door to the should be empty public library, standing in the middle of it all was the very man that raised her.*

*For a little back story, Chidori was the out of wedlock and illegitimate daughter to a Japanese bank owner, who effectively controlled the economics of the island. His wife was barren, and failed several times to birth a son, so he took matters into his own hands and slept with a array of his interns. As a result, he won the genetic jack pot when his dormant mutant genes and a interns mixed to create a beautiful baby girl without a birth right. It wasn't long after the birth that her father forced the women to put the child up for adoption, then threatened her with her job to ensure she never spoke of the daughter.*

*Picked up at the young age of 5, a man who went by Meme(meh-meh), chose the child to be developed into his protege. Her powers had yet to be realized, but Meme knew she had potential, or some kind of tie to a other power. Over the years Meme trained her in hand to hand combat and weapons familiarization, it became apparent that he had chosen the right child as her actions quickly became fluid, every muscle moving with intention. She could move like a cat in the air, and hit with the form of a world class boxer, it was artistic watching her move, but it worried Meme how fast she learned everything. After years of training, up to the age of 17, Meme turned her over to another man, with whom she would work for. His name, or the title he was known as, was Oda.*

*Her first mission was to topple the lower level rankings of the drug lords in the local area, the mission was planned to go over the course of a month ans she completed it with in the week. Impressed with her work, Oda continued to push her missions to higher and higher difficulties over the course of 3 years. Without chidori knowing, she was tasked with the assassination of her own father, she was not aware of who the man was until she had stuck him. A quote about her eyes being familiar sparked her interest into investigating her own past, all she had ever known was this assassins life, and she had assumed Meme was her father. As she dug more and more and realized she was a orphan, she began forming a ground work around her mother, someone she had never known and assumed died after her birth. She searched out for the women that birthed her, and used the little relation she new of her prior target to connect the dots, asking prior and employee and secretaries about thier relation to the man who ran the banks. Each one announcing they had not had a child with the man, but were aware of a change in the life style of one of the interns during this time. Chidori met the women, now living in a private home in the upper class area around tokyo, and she heard the story of her life and the curse she was to her father. Enraged at this she asked Meme and Oda if they were aware of her past, at which Meme answered he did, he went on to explain how much better he life had become with this change and how fate favored her. In a act of passion, chidori struck her Trainer, and the two began to fight. While he seemed completely calm and at ease on the outside, Meme was vary aware of how his life time of training had been picked up in a few years by this girl, he was aware of the threat she would be with much more training. He forced her into a submission and calmed her down, talking to her in a fatherly way, and bringing her closer to him with every word. Meme felt the inner workings of her potential begin to activate, her destined powers would come soon, and when they did they would lose control of her, they needed to end her despite the loss it would bring.*

*Chidori opened the door to the library, to see her Trainer standing the the center of the library among the tables, the large circular window in the ceiling casting a blue moonlight on him. He stood smiling, waiting for chidori to fully understand what was happening, and as the realization grew across her face he attacked. Something she had never seen before in her training with her master, a speed unlike anythign human, he appeared before her wielding his cane like a blade and striking her along the shoulder. Pain racked through her like she had just stuck a fork in a outlet, and her eyes flashed with anguish. But her body was merely a puppet for her mind, and she reacted like nothing had happened, quickly turning her body into a swift kick to her father-figures face. He was taken aback that her speed had again increased. The two traded blows for several minutes, as sudden images flooded Chidori's mind. Glowing figures and cities on fire, the collapse of a roof pinning her to the ground, a hand grabbing a set of pins on a grenade. With each image she recoiled, opening her up for a strike. With the final image Meme used on of his abilities, as a whirlwind seemed to form around the cane, he lunged it at her face catching her just above the cheek bone and along the eye. She fell back in a howl of pain, then for some reason a smile formed on here face.*

""I must say Chidori, your actually quite good-"" *A violent Maelstrom formed around Meme, as Oda stepped in to witness the final blow. A image of pins falling from her hand seemed to fill her mind* ""-, i'd actually say impressive-""

*Chidori felt a surge of energy fill her body as she stood up to oppose her attackers.*

""Oda might be good, You might be impressive, but im Chidori Fucking Mitsuki!"" 

*In a flash of light Chidori awoke on the rooftop of a nearby building, a set of bandages wrapped around her injured eye, and the pleasant sensation of someone watching over her.*

**In-Character Reputation:** For a time her name was up and coming among various assassins groups, with many looking to recruit her, but after Oda and Meme composed a full fledged smear campaign on her she became a target instead. 

**Relations**- Chidori and Cecilia have met before, blade to blade, neither of them really like the other.

#Powers, Abilities, and Equipment

**Proposed Tier:** Tier 4 

**Powers:**  

*Badass/Dimensional Heritage*- At the moment of Chidori's birth she was attached to a being in another universe, like a locked door she held powers that belonged to the other being, and when she died those powers would unlock and be given to the other host. Instead of that happening though the other host, Basil Deltree, passed away and like a cross universe version of the highlander, his power crossed over to her. As she already hosted a superb control of her own body, the passing of basil hyper competency only further increased her talents. Her physicals are above peak human, with a agility only matched by the most athletic of felines, able to turn her body every which way in the air. Just off of her physical capabilities, at 10 meters she is able to perceive something moving at 68m/s and possible dodge it, her powers enhance this per 2m. With her powers and Basils combined she gained the superhuman ability to basically avoid being stopped by her environment, able to run up walls or along liquid surfaces for a brief period of time. Her ability to learn and pick up martial arts and weapons knowledge as quickly as she did was partially due to her connection to basil deltree, it continued to increase with Basils passing allowing her to learn new martial arts by fighting someone using a style she wasn't aware of(as long as her physiology allows it)and allowing her to quickly strip down new weapons and learn its characteristics(if she has the tools to do so). ([Hypercompetency](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Hypercompetence), [A weaker form of Unresticted Movement](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Unrestricted_Movement))

*Time Dilation*- One of the powers that awoke after Basils passing, during her fight with Meme, was a manipulation of time around her. She is able to make Bubbles of dilated time, that can act as force fields of sorts bringing bullets to a halt or [slowing a incoming object](http://www.xboxar.com/img/2015/20388-Xboxar.com.gif). She is able to upscale her own time allowing her to increase her speed by up to X^4. She can create bubbles that Slow all things in it, a technique she often uses is to fire into them building up a wall of bullets and then releasing them all at once. When she activates a bubble/field, it can be expanded to up to 50m, but can be as small as a 2m radius sphere. The larger a field the more powerful it can be, as things are slowed down by X^2 per 2m. For example, lets take McNabs Luancher, which has a muzzle velocity of 7500m/s. As it enters the field its speed is dropped to 3500m/s and as it travels another 2m into the field its dropped to 1875m/s(48m), 937m/s(46m), 468m/s(44m), 234m/s(42m), 117m/s(40m), and so on up to 25 times. Due to Chidori's relation to this power, she can see this effect as it happens, but to outside perspectives it appears normal. 

*Spatial Existence*- As if being able to control gravity or tug at the fabric of space itself, Chidori is able to manipulate her own spatial existence. She is able to floor tilt her self, making her reaction with gravity change meaning she can walk up anything, and even stand upside down. This power is potent enough that things in her possession, or her range, follow her rules, meaning if she pulled out a phone while upside down and dropped it, it would fall towards her feet and not the conventional direction gravity would demand. She is also able to shift her self for brief periods of time(holding her breath basically), to a spatial location just outside of this worlds, meaning she is intangible. She can also teleport distances, within the range of her eyesight, meaning her teleportation is eyesight dependent. The use of her spatial displacing abilities (teleportation, Intangibility) require her to be able to breath, so when she is intangible she is not able to breath air, and when she is teleporting its similar to her doing a high jump. Chidori is able to Displace other people and things within her eye sight, without damaging them, such as teleporting the gun out of someones hand, or by moving someones hand to another location without it harming them. Chidori is able to place things in a pocket dimension, like weapons or vehicles. 

**Resources /Equipment:** When she is looking to combat others, she enters the battlefield with a Scar-H, with a 4x scope and a laser sight, and a belt full of .40Cal S&amp;W. In her boots she is likely to have knives hidden away, or a knife strapped to her leg. After her power awoke she began to take a liking to motorcycles and owns two now.

**Miscellaneous Skills:** She is skilled in cooking, pick locking, programming, and is knowledgeable in field medicine. 

**Strength:** Chidori's peak strength stands at about 4 tones, but her usable strength in combat kinda stops a around 800 lifting pounds. With her fist she can punch through a half foot of concrete with ease. 

**Movement:** She can sprint with out losing momentum at 90 mph, and is able to use the Spatial powers to  teleport. 

**Defense:** Outside of any body armor, and dodging, and phasing, Chidori doesn't have any beyond human durabilities. Due to her link with Basil she has a heightened defense against psychic and mental manipulating abilities.

**Perception/Awareness:** Her actual senses are at peak human, meaning she can smell things like gun powder or oil from a distance she can't just track by scent like a dog.

**Fighting Ability:** She is skilled in Krav, Teakwondo, MMA, Keysi, Capoeira, Boxing, and Jeet Kune Do. Able to wield several forms of blade, use staves, knives and throwing weapons with expert level proficiency. Familiar with a large variety of fire arms ranging from Javelin missles, to the Taurus Judge, to the ps90, to a Boys Anti-Tank Rifle(which she actually has one of in one of her safe houses.)

**Danger:** Her talents make her a massive threat to any regular human and most meta humans, but she is not likely to wipe out cities over night, let alone large portions of its infastructure without the use of military weaponry.

**Weaknesses:**

4d33fz,9,2016-04-02,One year mark and I still miss you as much as day one,swagnarlothbrok,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/4d33fz/one_year_mark_and_i_still_miss_you_as_much_as_day/,"It's been a long time since we have spoken. You'll remember that throughout the months after you broke up with me, I tried to cut you out of my life. I decided that enough was enough and I gave you my last goodbye. You told me that you'd love me forever, and I still think about that from time to time.

The truth is I'm still not over you. Dreams come to me at night where we finally cross each others' paths and I get to bask in your company one more time. In fact, that's what happened last night, and that's why I'm writing you right now.

It's interesting how the hole you left is still there. It's healed, but only a cover over a cavity. It's not just you; it's everything we built. Your sister was becoming my sister, your brother my little brother I never had, and your parents were nothing but kind and loving towards me. My time with you was the most fulfilling time of my life.

My life is becoming whole again. My career is taking off, I'm doing great in my new university, I have my second internship, and I'm really applying myself like I have never done before. I just wish everything we built was here to complete the picture.

There are feelings I've never felt before meeting you and after parting with you. They're fleeting, and I can't wait to feel them again someday. You're feeling them with your new boyfriend, and I'm just here with no SO. I'm not sure if you're still with that guy, but if you were, you'd be together with him just as long as we were together. And that's tough to think about. I wish I could find someone new, but the universe doesn't want that for me right now.

I thought I'd be in a much better place, emotionally, than I am now. A year is a long time and the pain will disappear, right? Well, not so much. I've learned that much. The pain isn't as sharp, but its still there. Hitting me with a hammer instead of stabbing with a dagger.

I find it pretty amusing that the universe guided you (a dedicated Christian) to me (a staunch atheist), and we had 99% of it worked out. After breaking up with me for your god, it just goes to show that couples need to be completely compatible to work in harmony. Thank you for coming into my life and assisting in teaching me this lesson.

I've lost friends and family. You know that better than anyone else, and none of it compares to what I lost in you.

My side of our promise to each other is a promise I'll keep, whether I want to or not: I'll never forget you and the impact you had on me.

December 2017 I graduate with my undergrad, and I plan on moving across the country. And as much as I love you, I can't wait to get as far away from you as possible.

Goodbye once again, friend"
4d3d3n,3,2016-04-02,"Graduating in one month, job offer on the table. Unsure about situation and need advice.",CuriousOysters,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4d3d3n/graduating_in_one_month_job_offer_on_the_table/,"Hi all. I am graduating from a mid level state school in one month and I'm not sure what to do with my current situation. I have always wanted to move away from the state I currently live in but have had no luck finding jobs in other places. I have been working as an intern for a little over 6 months while attending school and the company I work for recently gave me a full time offer.

This seemed great to me, except the pay was lower than expected (around 10k less than the average for graduates of my school/entry level jobs in my area). I tried to negotiate the offer with no luck, but another ""perk"" they have offered me is a signing bonus. The signing bonus is a ""significant"" amount of money for me (around 10% of the salaried offer)

My initial plan was to take the job offer and search for jobs in other locations until I found something really attractive, but I am now having second thoughts. Is it terrible to leave a job after only a few months of working there if I find something better? Should I turn down the job offer and hope to find a job in another state in the next few months? The money isn't really a big deal to me but I would like to maximize my value and earnings potential.

If I do end up staying with the company how early is too early to leave? Should I feel guilty about taking a signing bonus and leaving too soon after? I believe it will be easier to get a job when I already have a job but I don't know what the best thing to do in this situation is. Any advice would be helpful and thank you for reading!"
4d3hyq,3,2016-04-02,Personal and professional inadequacies,rooowdy,depressed,https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/4d3hyq/personal_and_professional_inadequacies/,"So lately I've been feeling more down than usual. I was absent from work the entire last week because I felt so miserable and this week I took two more days off just to calm down and have some rest.

Yesterday and today were a really great days. It was sunny and warm and I had a good time.
Then as today progressed I just got more and more depressed again. 

At least I have some kind of idea what triggered this episode.
I was talking to this girl today and I just realized that I am just not good enough for her (or anybody else for that matter). So from there on I got into this spiral of negative thoughts and I just can't get out of this mess I got myself into.

And it's not that she made me depressed or anything like that. I usually enjoy talking to her and it just brightens up my day, makes me feel like a normal person. But today I just thought that it would be nice to have a gf like her. At the same time I realized that I will never be good enough, not just for her but for basically every other girl as well.

I just don't see positive traits in myself. This post is just another proof of this. Why would anybody want to be with a downer like me.
Honestly, I don't even think I have any redeeming qualities.

But lady problems is not everything I am facing.

On monday I am starting an internship at a new company for my apprenticeship. I am just overwhelmed with anxiety and insecurities about this. Problem is that I really believe that I am not cut out for the job and lack the necessary skills (social and professional) I need. So far it went all really good. I got decent grades and I had little troubles. But now I am at a new point. A completely new situation and I don't feel that I can handle it.

All this is stressing me out really badly and makes me feel like just quitting it all. I doubt that I can handle the stress and just the work in general and getting to know all those new people and a new environment. 

I wish I could just hide away and not have to deal with all this.

Today I really considered just getting the rope I have in my trunk and call it quits. I really don't feel like I can go on like this.

Sorry for the rant."

* Work on making my website www.resoorce.com popular.

4d4ebj,1,2016-04-02,F4M - Law firm.

You're a big shot lawyer who is nothing short of shining star to the firm. Closing cases left and right, drawing in clients with that charming smile of yours and pretty much dropping the panties on whichever intern you pleased. Everyone loves you.

Except me. I see through the expensive suits, those bright cocky smiles and your flirty behaviour. I'm not a fan of it. As a secretary, I've had to deal with you more times than I count. You've had the nerve to ask me to make photocopies, fetch your clients some coffee (which is a job for an intern!) and many other annoyances. And each time you had that stupid grin on your face. But the biggest one that got to me? The nicknames and back-handed comments. 'Sweet cheeks' was one that got under my skin. Along with your numerous comments about my backside and even when you had the audacity to slap my ass when I walked by. 

So, I did what any self respecting woman would do. I decided to return the favor of making your job miserable. Remember the time you had a meeting with some A-list celebrity and I *accidentally* spilled my drink on you? Or how about when I completely neglected to inform you of a meeting with your superiors? That was fun. Whenever I have some free time, I try my best to at least make your job harder once a day. Whether it's shredding some documents you researched or repeatedly bringing you the wrong case files, I can't stop myself. It's too much fun.

We go back and forth. You won't give in and neither will I. While we might completely loathe one another, there's no denying a physical attraction between the two of us. You're an ass-man and you made it obvious... and you've seen my eyes roaming quite a few times when I look your way. So... we can keep this childish game going until one of us has enough, or... you can finally establish who's in charge the one way you now how. 

With me bent over, begging for more. 

---

I love a man who knows how to take care of a good ass. I can't think of anything better than feeling a warm tongue lapping at my tight, little pucker before sinking right inside of me. I love the sensation of a man's mouth buried between my thick, bubbly cheeks as he smothers himself against my backside. If a man doesn't love tongue-fucking a tight asshole, I have no interest in him. I need a stud who gets off on kissing at my little hole and spanking my big, plump cheeks.

I'm also a smaller gal. Most women aren't happy being short, but I absolutely adore it. A lot of men seem to love it, too. I'm a petite girl with nice curves and a tight body. While it can be intimidating to be around tall girls, I'm comforted by tall guys. They seem to enjoy flirting about how much bigger they are than me, or how easy it would be to pick me up and other things along those lines.

What guy wouldn't want to have a girl he can move around with ease in bed? I could be pinned up against the wall, or bounced on your cock without much effort if I was riding you. I get off on it. Being teased about how petite I am, yet how I manage to have such a big ass. My main weakness is tall guys. The size difference is very hot to me. Plus, I know when people see me with a tall man, their immediate thought is about us having sex. How the size difference must come into play, or how I'm most likely moved around like some ragdoll by him. 

The requirements however, are... You **must** like talking dirty and be an ass man. I have many more kinks but those are the main ones. The **limits** are feet play, watersports, beast, scat, blood and having myself written for. (Small actions such as positioning or moving the plot forward are okay but nothing more!) Light ageplay is okay, but nothing younger than 18, sorry.

4d4ht4,67,2016-04-02,Important Activism: Letters to the editor!,Classy_Dolphin,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4d4ht4/important_activism_letters_to_the_editor/,"Hey everyone! All the activism talk here is very exciting, but one valuable mode of activism that I haven't seen addressed much is letters to the editor. 


For those of you unfamiliar with this practice, newspapers will often solicit letters on a regular basis to be published in their papers.Many people who read online could be forgiven for not noticing the existence of letters to the editor, but many older voters, train commuters, and others do in fact read them! IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN ALONE, THERE ARE 10 NEWSPAPERS WITH PRINT CIRCULATION OVER 15,000. This is a simple and easy way to help reach voters. I've been lucky enough to coordinate letters to the editor for an environmental group in the past as an intern (so if anyone else has more expertise, chime in) so I'm going to list a few quick tips on letter writing and the basics. Tomorrow, I hope to make another post with a few example letters written and will hopefully update this one.... 


If you're not sure where to submit letters, just give it a quick google. For example, a quick search for ""Pittsburgh Post-Gazette letters to the editor submission"" turns up this link: http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/2014/03/04/Post-Gazette-opinion-FAQ/stories/201403040169 If you need any help, I'll do my best to help you figure out where to send your letters. It goes without saying that email and online submission are more likely to get your letter published sooner.


NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO SUBMIT A LETTER IN WISCONSIN, PLEASE DO SO TOMORROW OR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Editors sometimes publish letters on a few day delay. That means if you want your Wisconsin letter to show up in a newspaper before the election, you need to submit it very quickly.



Some key tips for your letter:

-Submit to local papers. This is key - if you're from LA, don't bother submitting a letter for a Milwaukee paper. The odds of it getting published are very low. Focus on local and regional papers - and local and regional issues (more later.)


-Keep it short. VERY short. About 100 words is best, and no more than 150 at the worst. Shorter letters leave more room for others and are more likely to get published. It may be worth looking at your local paper and seeing about how long the average published letter is. In most cases you will see letters between about 80 and 150 words. The guideline a paper gives you may be longer than they generally publish.


-Introduce yourself and your credentials if you have any. This includes where you live, and how long if its been a while. If the topic you're writing on involves some expertise of yours (you've held elected office, you studied a specific topic or you've worked in a specific field) mention it very briefly. This whole part should be one sentence at most.


-Focus on one issue. ""Sanders is good"" is too broad. You won't cover your material in any kind of effective way and your letter isn't likely to be interesting enough to get published. Focus on one thing - the more specific, the better.


-Try to focus on local issues. For example, if you are writing to a Philadelphia paper, you may choose to focus on Sanders' consistent opposition to the Bakken oil pipeline, a key part of the plan to expand fossil fuel refining in Philly and dramatically reduce air quality in predominantly poor, black neighborhoods which already have very high levels of Asthma and cancer. If you're in an area with bad drinking water, talk about Sanders' infrastructure plan. A public university town? You can guess where I'm going. Get local, get specific. Papers are flooded with generic letters. They want to publish something interesting.


-Include a few hard facts. Not too much - don't go into technobabble mode - but a little in the ways of numbers or specific details people might not know will go a long way towards improving your credibility.


-Sign off briefly and get your message in. Wrap it all up with a bow, and include the date of the election. Make mention of voter ID or registration deadlines if applicable. Try to have this part of your letter consume as little of your word count as possible.

-DON'T WORRY IF IT'S PERFECT OR NOT! Any letter is better than no letter. In many cases, time is of the essence. That, and no one expects ""hamlet"" in a hundred words. Don't be too hard on yourself, and no matter what, submit something.



 Here's a good example letter taken right from the Wisconsin State Journal out of Madison.

&gt; In my nearly 50 years living on the North Side of Madison, I have come to know many fine, dedicated people, but none more so than Dane County Sup. Michele Ritt.
&gt; 
&gt; She is rooted in the tradition shared by so many of her predecessors who knew the best way to help all people is to help the most needy among us. This is exemplified by her work on behalf of the homeless while on the Dane County Board as well as her chosen profession as a special education teacher in Madison schools.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is what sets her apart from her opponent. This is what sets Madison and Dane County apart from most of the rest of the state. Vote for Michele Ritt for county supervisor in District 18 on April 5.
&gt; 
&gt; -- Jerome Joyce, Madison

Since this guy was introducing a candidate he didn't focus too much on a single issue in a strong and direct way, but even still he managed to weave in local issues of poverty. Because you're writing about a presidential candidate, you'll want to get more specific - most people who read papers will at least know the names of the candidates and won't need your help there.

I'd just like to reiterate that for everyone who lives somewhere that has yet to vote, writing a Letter to the Editor of your local newspaper is an easy and effective way to bring our message to more voters. We're talking about basically free newspaper ads, when it comes down to it. YOU all have the power to put Sanders in your local paper. I urge you to do so as soon as possible. 

If you would like, feel free to post any letter drafts here and we can all give you feedback. I'll be trying to check back as often as I can. I'll also probably make a similar thread in the future.

That's all for this week, pretty excited for Cow Chop. Couch Op. Couch Op. Huh, who knew.

At any rate, gotta make a super serious request. Starting mid to late April I will be unavailable to write these updates as I will be on a two month long training cruise. Should be back mid-June, but during that timespan in-between I'd like someone to help Moose with the updates (sucks to be doing these by yourself, trust me). Ideally you'd only have to do only four weeks of updates, or less than that if multiple people want to help. 

That being said, if you think you'd be interested with helping writing these updates, send myself or /u/StreetLampLeSeaMoose a message. Thanks guys - Leon

Stay awesome, Critters!

I was fortunate enough due to my programming skills, to get a software engineering internship at a bulge bracket bank and that turned into a full-time job.  I've been working for about 10 months now. What can I do to increase my chances? I read that the GRE is not required but can I still submit my score and have it taken into consideration?"
4d5t8u,7,2016-04-03,[Question] CHRONEXT - Purchase Pitfalls,probablymorebullshit,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/4d5t8u/question_chronext_purchase_pitfalls/,"Morning r/watches,

I am in the market for my first luxury (to me) watch to celebrate a number of big life events that have seemed to come in quick succession. After a lot of research, far too much time browsing this subreddit and a trip to the local AD I have settled on a particular Omega. Now to the question of where to purchase? 


I had already made a few decisions:

* I would like to purchase a new piece

* I don't want to go down the grey market avenue - mainly because I want the piece of mind of having the manufacturers warranty and to have a 'proper' complete set - papers &amp; all.


Wanting to find the best price I did some further research (read: google) and stumbled across a couple of sites in the form of MONTREDO and CHRONEXT both German based businesses as far as I can tell - I am in the UK and wouldn't be subject to import duty if I had an item shipped from them. Specifically around CHRONEXT (for reasons I will go into later) I wanted to check my understandings of who I am dealing with and what I should expect with my purchase in hope that someone with experience could shed some light and / or point out any gaping holes in my understanding before I jump in too deep.


My understanding is that CHRONEXT act as a broker / middleman between me and ADs who are looking to sell off excess stock so that they continue to meet contractual requirements with the watch manufacturers of taking x amount of stock per *whatever*. From what I can tell they actually hold very little stock themselves and when ordering through them, they intern have it shipped from the AD to yourself (though they claim to inspect the watch prior delivery, I am sceptical), hence longer leadtimes.


I have spoken to them and they have assured me that the piece will come with an AD stamped card and in turn the manufacturers warranty - though they also offer a 24 month warranty (which in my opinion has 0 value) as standard and I am not sure why.


The outcome is that the watches are generally much cheaper - in this specific case 25% - but without the drawbacks of going down the traditional grey market route. This of course seems too good to be true so I am hoping someone can speak sense and either shoot me down for being so naive or support their business?


One last comment on why CHRONEXT specifically. I am UK based and they have a store in London. I have the option of paying a 10% deposit, have the item shipped to their store and for me to inspect the item and either pay the balance or walk away and have the deposit refunded. If I do take my business to them, this is the only way I would do it.


A penny for your thoughts?

Are these 3 - 400 Level CS Classes Manageable in One Semester?,xlFireman,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/4d66jo/help_are_these_3_400_level_cs_classes_manageable/,"Hey all, I am a rising senior and I currently am in 451 and 420 for my upper level CS classes. I have only taken one other upper level (411) so far. I am going through some personal issues and I don't think I can handle the workload of 420 right now (plus I am currently failing the class) so I am considering dropping the course. This would mean that I would have to take the remaining 5 CS classes my senior year - so 3 next semester and 2 the last semester. I am also planning on having an internship this summer (deciding among offers) so summer classes isn't an option right now. My question for you guys is, does this schedule seem manageable:

CMSC 421 (AI)
CMSC 423 (Bioinformatics)
CMSC 434 (Human Computer Interaction). 

I have advising Monday with Meesh so I would be able to ask her more before I decide to drop but I just needed some advise from some fellow CS majors. I would be taking these 3 CS classes on top of an upper level GEOG class and EDHD 400 (Online Education class about Gerontology). I appreciate any advice you guys (or girls) can give!"

It's going to cost 2100Lira (almost 700 euros).

My friend, Uma - a very lovely girl is just a student studying economy and mathematics, has barely any money.
We lived together in Prague when she stayed here to do an internship, where she was paid the bare minimum (for full time work) -It saddened me to the point I tried to offer her free acommodation because she had barely any money but still sent her parents money every month to make sure they could afford to buy food for the cat while she was away.

Frida is Uma's best friend, and a lovely companion - without this surgery Uma will have to pay for the Cat to die. And Frida doesn't need to die, please help if you can and fast!

Chicago native currently finishing an MPhil program at the Paris School of Economics. I'm more trained in macro than micro. Writing my master thesis on Bayesian estimation of a New Keynesian model. I have a couple years of professional experience.

Are there any Chicagoans on here? I'm curious if anybody knows of a place I could look for a job this fall that fits my profile. A lot of places seem to either offer bachelor's, entry-level jobs (required: proficiency in microsoft office!) or a PhD. I know the sexier jobs, particularly in research, require a Phd. But in other cities I do see a fair amount of recruiting for people with masters degrees. In Chicago I seem to see a little less. But it's my city and I love it. I'm not willing to sacrifice everything to move there, but if I could find a fulfilling job there where I can use my brain a little bit, I'd be a happy man. I'm very comfortable in stata, functional in MATLAB, a little less so in SAS and R, although I am about to start a 6 month internship at the Bank of France and apparently I'll be using R a lot.

Not so much looking for connections as I am places to look. Thanks a ton in advance.

4d6o79,0,2016-04-03,My Boss Welcomed Me By Giving An Amazing Head (19M/32F),havegoodnewz,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4d6o79/my_boss_welcomed_me_by_giving_an_amazing_head/,"   I've been here reading all of your amazing stories before. Never thought of posting anything because I didn't have any 'amazing' experiences before. Until yesterday, I still can't believe a tall, beautiful and sexy woman who I call 'boss' degraded herself to satisfy my sexual needs.

   It happened in her office room, which I got in to present myself as her new intern on my first day here. Before that, I was waiting outside trying to get myself ready for her questions. I also got to peek inside her room through the window blinds. I was so relieved as I saw a woman was alone in the room because I thought the boss was a male. So, I got called in, as I opened the door, there was this sexy lady, wearing a tight blouse and a thigh high skirt.

   To be honest, I never thought my boss would be this sexy when I saw her in that room. I took a seat, still trying to admire her amazing curves while answering her questions. So, that's that. I was shown to where I'll be working and to be honest, I couldn't forget about her body. Brown hair, probably 34c, plump lips, great figure, 5'10"" and kind of seducing.

   As I was doing my work, some of the male workers came to my cube and said "" You should work properly here, if you want some bonus from our Miss Claire. (our boss)"". I was like "" Well yeah, isn't that what everyone gets if they show good performance?"" They only answered "" You should really know what the bonus is."" and went away. So, the day was over and suddenly I was called to enter the Boss's room. I wasn't so worried as this is my first day here. All the lights are dimmed and most of the cubes are empty.

   I sat on the chair, hearing her comments for my first day, mostly positive. "" Not a bad start for an intern, you did your work on time."" she said. All I did was smile at her. "" I've been thinking about giving you a reward for your first day here."" she said more as she stood up and walked around her table in front of me. I could only reply "" Miss Claire, I think it's too early to give any rewards for me."". Her breasts and her curves really caught my eyes but I had to maintain eye contact with her. That was also the time my penis went a little bit hard.

   I was nailed shut as she went down on her knees with a slutty face and moved her hands to my zipper, "" Nope, I still wanna give you something so that you how kind your boss is."" she said. She did all the unzipping and my 9"" penis popped out. The next thing I felt, was her soft strokes, "" Mmmm, your size are quite big for someone your age. Most interns I sucked wasn't this long."" she said. As i was about to answer, she put the tip of my dick between her lips and keep stroking, "" I do this to all of my interns."" she answered it before I even asked her. I probably leaked a few drops of pre-cum onto her lips, because she licked her lips a few times before starting to thrust her head slowly on my penis.

   As she bobbed her head, her eyes were just amazing. She kept eye contact with me for a few moments before popping out my penis out of her mouth. ""Haha, you really don't talk much, huh? Come on, talk dirty. Call your boss names!"" she asked me. I was enjoying her skills too much. She suddenly place my hands on top of her head. ""Make me swallow you dirty dick right fucking now."". She kept sucking a few times, then I stood up getting ready to fuck her beautiful face. ""You asked for this, slut."" I decided to be more dominant. As I put my hands around her head she said ""Have my throat however you like, fuck it like you mean it."". It really turned me on, seeing her talking with still a few strings of her spits connecting my dick to her mouth. Without any mercy, I thrust my penis into her mouth. It took a few thrusts to finally getting her swallow my entire dick. I held her down for a few moments, I could feel her tongue was fondling my balls.

   I released her head for a few seconds and kept going with it again, her mascara started to drip down, her red lipstick started to leave a stain on my dick. Until I was done fucking her amazing throat for around 5-10 minutes. "" Fuck, I wanna cum. Where do you want it?"" I asked her quickly. She wrapped my dick head with her lips tightly and stroked it quickly. I couldn't hold my cum any longer as I felt her tongue was swirling around my dick hole. That's it, I gotta cum. I don't know how much cum I've shot in there, but her reaction told me it's a lot. She had to tilt her head up to show me. And fucking hell, I couldn't even see her tongue anymore. 

   She closed her mouth, gargled it and gulped it down good. ""Now that's a massive load. Fucking love it."" she said as she licked her fingers. ""Fuck me, you're amazing. What does it taste like?"" I asked her. ""Pretty salty. But that's why I love young balls. They produce young healthy salty cum."".

   As I zipped up, she said ""Show me good performance, and you'll get more of me."".

Do you guys make any long, tedious calculations or deal with any hard-to-use systems that could be more efficiently done with the use of CS? Would a mainstreamed unit operation database (for things like pump selection &amp; process design) help at all?

I have a few ideas of what I could do based on the chemE internships I've already had but I definitely want to hear more opinions, especially from people that been in the industry for longer than I have. In your day-to-day work and your projects, what could be made simpler?"

I haven't missed one with this deal in my four years out here. Here's where the pens become dicks. So most Pitt students are from philly so a huge amount of the student rush tickets go to flyers fans out here for college. So yesterday when they sent out their text reminder the shadiness started instead of saying how many tickets will be available like they normally do (there's normally about 200 tickets available) they just said limited tickets available this was my first concern. Then I'm sitting at the computer from 9:30 to 10:15 this morning hitting refresh trying to get one ticket and I can't even get one ticket. So I ended up texting my friend who interns in ticket sales for the pens and she says that no one was getting student rush tickets cause they actually didn't set any aside.

So now as a graduating senior after seeing every flyers pens game since I've been out here. The pens organization has screwed me (and countless other Pitt flyers fans) out of getting to see my last flyers pens game before graduating and moving back to philly. Sorry this is a little ranty but I'm just a little extra pissed at the pens tonight. 

So in conclusion FUCK THE PENS!

Edit: To add to this I'm just realizing it's Sunday so all the bars are closed so I can't even watch the game.

This is what I'm looking for in your initial message to me. If any of these are not present, I will simply discard your message:

* Effort - seriously, if you don't plan on putting effort into your message, please don't bother messaging me!
* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries. 

That's all I can think of for now. One thing you do not need to do is give me a real life physical description of yourself. I don't care how tall you are, where you're from, your age, the colour of your hair, none of that. We're roleplaying with made up characters, so our real lives are irrelevant in this world we create.

Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...

I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

I really hope that I get some worthwhile responses for this. I'll be back in a couple of hours to see what I get. Thank you!"
4d7d3y,2,2016-04-03,Summer classes kind of killed an internship chance- good alternatives?,boredcentsless,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4d7d3y/summer_classes_kind_of_killed_an_internship/,"I'm a ME sophomore taking 2 (maybe 3) courses this summer that I need for my junior year (Diff EQ and mechanics of materials). I didn't fail them (My GPA is 3.71) it's just the way my schedule played out. I'm not going to postpone graduating for these two classes, but it means that my July is about 16-18 hours per week of classes, plus more time to study for those classes. It's been a huge stumbling block in getting internships because I can't commit to 40 hours a week for the whole summer. I still have one more summer, so I'm not panicking, but I don't want to waste a summer doing nothing, so I narrowed it down to a few options:

* try and get a research position with one of my professors
* cold call a few machine shops and try to get some unpaid industry experience
* learn programming/arduino 

No matter what I choose, I also plan on getting some Solidworks certifications.

I don't think I've learned enough actual engineering to take on a whole project of my own, so which of those three would be best?"
4d7fqu,150,2016-04-03,My SNL studio audience experience.,cookiemonster62,LiveFromNewYork,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/4d7fqu/my_snl_studio_audience_experience/,"Yesterday I posted a picture of my white standby ticket for the live taping of SNL. Someone on that thread asked if I could share my experience, so here it is. Sorry this took so long u/fuckmattdamon, I was on a plane with no internet.

Seriously, if you're in NYC for the weekend, drop everything and try to get tickets. Its honestly one of THE coolest experiences of my life to see my favorite TV show be filmed in front of me.

Since I didn't enter the SNL ticket lottery in mid-August last year (and since this trip was pretty spontaneous) My mother and I decided to try our luck in the standby line. Friday was a pretty gloomy/rainy day in terms of weather for most of the day, so we figured we had a solid shot.

We got to the spot where NBC handed out tickets (48th st. between 5th and 6th I think) around 8 pm. A small line of about 30 people were in front of us when we got our spot in line. If you plan on waiting in line, try to remember to bring a lawn chair or warm clothes because you're in for a LONG night. There was a Walgreens right up the street where we were lucky enough to find a couple of lawn chairs. Trust me, you'll want something to sit on other than the pavement. Especially if it rains during the night like it did for us.

The first couple of hours were spent shooting the shit with some pretty awesome people we met in line. Talking to the people around us made time seem to go a little faster. Until about 1 am, you'll spend a lot of time fending off 30 Rock tourist wondering what the hell we're all doing waiting in line in the rain. A good 30 people asked us.

I found it to be pretty difficult to sleep. This city truly ""never sleeps"", so be prepared to get no rest unless you can ignore constant honking and loud drunks coming back from the bars. If there's even a small chance of rain, bring an umbrella and poncho. They saved our life that night.

The people we sat by pulled out a couple of sets of cards against humanity around 4 am, and from then until 7, we played. Promptly at 7, a few NBC interns came out and began distributing standby tickets for the live show and the dress rehearsal. Having waited in line for 11 hours, we weren't about to sell out for the dress rehearsal, so we chose the live show. Our numbers were 17 and 18, and at that time, there were close to 300 people behind us (according to a Rockefeller center security guard).

From there we went back to our hotel and slept until like 4. The whole thing was exhausting, but worth it.

The standby ticket told us to return to 30 Rock before 10:30. The queue was actually formed inside the NBC experience gift shop. At about 10:50 an NBC employee informed the now very large crowd that they would be first taking taking 30 people up to the studio. I freaked out at that moment, we had made it. 

They took us into a room were we went through a metal detector and then went up some stairs to a sort of waiting/green room for the audience. Being standby, we were the last to step onto the elevator that took us to the 8th floor. 

The hallway leading to the studio is awesome. I had seen it once before when I attended a taping of Seth Meyers a few years back. On the left side were a bunch of photos of the current cast in the more notable sketches, and on the other side were black and white photos of classic sketches of the past. 

We walked past studio 8G (where seth is filmed) and then we were there. It was abut 11:15 when we walked though the doors into that hallowed studio. I just stopped and looked in awe. It was beautiful. 

A paige directed us to the next available seat (which are actually old stadium seats that you would find a a baseball game) in the far left corner of the studio audience. I could see the entirety of the left side of backstage.

At this point Michael Che came out in some casual attire and warmed up the crowd with some pretty solid standup. Once he finished firing us up, the band began to play ""Gimme Some Lovin"" and Kenan (In a black suit), Vanessa, Kate, and Sasheer (In flashy red dresses) ran and sang the tune. I think that was honestly one of my favorite parts since it was entirely for the entertainment of the live audience and wasn't being filmed. 

Amazingly in the middle of the song, Questlove (of the Roots) was escorted into the audience. The paige moved two people from their seats in the direct middle to accommodate him, and were sent to stand in the back. 

The show started and I noticed a few cool things. One: The clock they always show at the beginning is actually stored in the ceiling, and they send it down just for that one shot. Two: The minutes before showtime are FRANTIC. The crew is running all around, the cast is being directed back and forth, and Lorne just kinda walked around nonchalantly. He didn't stay on set for long, he just made a few appearances during the taping.

I'm also pretty sure I spotted Paul Rudd and Adam Sandler hanging around behind the floor audience before they went live. A few other people confirmed they thought they saw them as well

In regards to Jon's big fuck up during the show, I watched that all play out. There was like ten seconds until they went live, and it looked like Bobby and Pete were visibly frazzled. When they went live they went to Bobby and I think Beck, Jon sprinted int from stage right and joined Pete. I didn't think too much of it, but it was clearly not how it was supposed to go. 

I think my other favorite sketch was the fish tank sketch, mostly because I was able to see behind the window at Taran and Jay. While Taran was ""floating"" around, the crew was strapping Jay into the ceiling cable to make in fly around. Jay was having a ton of trouble not losing it while watching Taran, and as they hoisted him up he looked at me and laughed when I gave him a thumbs up.

After the show, the cast actually came up to where the audience was exiting. Most of them were trying to find people they had invited to the taping. I met Beck, Kyle, and Aidy, and my mom saw Michael and Quest as well. I would be remiss if I didn't mention strong aroma of weed in the air. Oh Pete... 

All in all, I would've honestly waited in line for an additional 11 hours to see this show. It was an amazing spectacle to behold, and I can't wait to come back and try for it again, perhaps this time without dragging my poor 51 year old mother along. She's a good sport. If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask.

TL;DR Seeing SNL as a studio audience member is fucking awesome.

For the first year it served me well and I have to give it credit for helping me begin my Music production career.However recently I have found the battery life to be awful (2-3 hours) and it simply is not powerful enough for me to produce my songs anymore- they stutter frequently especially if I try and do any streaming via Twitch where I'm beginning to get around 75 followers. So it's been advised that I switch to a desktop so I'm looking at the highest spec Imac 5k to give me the performance I need to produce and stream at the same time.
But I'm also in my final year at School so I need something portable and with a very good battery life for simple note taking and Word editing - this is where I would do schoolwork.
If any of you could tell me whether this Imac will be powerful enough for my needs- that would be reassuringly brilliant !
Also if any of you could inform me of what Apple device I get for my schoolwork- would have to be cheaper since I have a budget of around 4'000 pounds through my internship last summer.

It would be way more cost effective for me to switch to Microsoft-but the OS is too damn gorgeous to leave!!

Edit: Currently looking at an Ipad pro..

Many thanks all!! This subreddit is great

//--&gt;&lt;!Na-TECC: Worth Its Salt
Shannon Yee, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, is developing a technology that leverages the isothermal expansion of sodium and solar heat to directly generate electricity.“It can also be used with other heat sources such as natural gas, biomass, and nuclear to directly produce electricity without boiling water and spinning turbines.”
Funded by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) SunShot Program, the research is being conducted in collaboration with Ceramatec Inc.
 
 Funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and working in collaboration with Stanford University, the researchers have developed a technology that is similar to photovoltaic devices with one big exception: Instead of using photons from the sun, it uses high-energy electrons emitted from nuclear byproducts.“The nonlinear harvesters also have secondary resonance behavior,” Erturk said, “which could enable frequency up-conversion in MEMS harvesters that suffer from device resonance being higher than ambient vibration frequencies.”
Although electrical output from vibration energy harvesters is small, it is still enough to power wireless sensors for structural health monitoring in bridges or aircraft, wearable electronics, or even medical implants.Photo: Rob Felt
 
Optical Rectenna
Researchers led by Baratunde Cola, an associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Mechanical Engineering, have developed the first known optical rectenna — a technology that could be more efficient than today’s solar cells and less expensive.








Georgia Tech Associate Professor Baratunde Cola measures the power produced by converting green laser illumination to electricity using a carbon nanotube optical rectenna.If commercialized, the technology could transform desert areas into fuel farms, Loutzenhiser said: “Instead of pulling fuel out of the ground, we could pull carbon dioxide from the air and use the sun to convert it with water into a long-term storage medium that could be shipped and used around the world without changes to transportation infrastructure.”

Monolithic Microscale Heat Pumps
Proving that good things come in small packages, researchers led by Srinivas Garimella have developed a novel textbook-sized cooling system that operates on waste heat rather than electricity.“Yet this requires higher operating temperatures — 800 degrees Celsius compared to current temperatures below 600 degrees — and current heat exchangers literally can’t take the pressure.”
To resolve this, Henry and Ranjan are working with Purdue University researchers to develop a new breed of heat exchanger that can withstand extremely high temperatures and pressures, a project supported by DOE SunShot funding.Photo: Gary Meek

About 1/2 years ago I started my own little longboarding webshop in the Netherlands called Dodoboards. I started this because of the love for the sport, the sport that you helped me get in to by answering all my questions and helping me with gear choices.

Now a few months ago I had a 40 hour per week internship and I couldn't handle it all at the same time. So I didn't really have time for Dodoboards. Now that that's over I made a new logo, website and concept!

First Dodoboards was a webshop that got brands to our webshop that weren't already available in The Netherlands or even Europe. Now we made the choice to let the crowd vote on which brand we have to buy!

You can see it all on my new website: www.dodoboards.com. If you're any compliments or feedback: send me a message. I made the site without much experience of building websites.

Last but not least, thanks again for all the help you gave me in the past. /r/longboarding is a great community.

Cheers!"

I worked there as an intern already. The office is really relaxed and casual: trainers, jeans and T-shirts all the way, managers wear shirts at best and I can't remember seeing the boss in a suit. We don't have any customers in the office and the only enforced rule is no shorts (had shorts day when it was meant to be hot, but that doesn't happen often in Scotland). 

It just got me thinking... What is an appropriate beard for the office? I am not planning to become a Jesus, but I would be coming there with 4 month beard by that time. I really don't want to have an awkward conversation with my manager on a first day. 

I take care of my beard already (but don't trim, just wash/oil/wax/balm and comb/brush) and 2 month beard doesn't look too bad (imho) so far. So it looks fairly tidy. "

4d7vqv,3,2016-04-03,F4M - Law firm. Your rival... is a petite girl with a big ass.,PerfectBigAss,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4d7vqv/f4m_law_firm_your_rival_is_a_petite_girl_with_a/,"You've been with Myers and Smith for a year. You're a big shot lawyer who is nothing short of shining star to the firm. Closing cases left and right, drawing in clients with that charming smile of yours and pretty much dropping the panties on whichever intern you pleased. Everyone loves you.

Except me. I see through the expensive suits, those bright cocky smiles and your flirty behaviour. I'm not a fan of it. As a secretary, I've had to deal with you more times than I count. You've had the nerve to ask me to make photocopies, fetch your clients some coffee (which is a job for an intern!) and many other annoyances. And each time you had that stupid grin on your face. But the biggest one that got to me? The nicknames and back-handed comments. 'Sweet cheeks' was one that got under my skin. Along with your numerous comments about my backside and even when you had the audacity to slap my ass when I walked by. 

So, I did what any self respecting woman would do. I decided to return the favor of making your job miserable. Remember the time you had a meeting with some A-list celebrity and I *accidentally* spilled my drink on you? Or how about when I completely neglected to inform you of a meeting with your superiors? That was fun. Whenever I have some free time, I try my best to at least make your job harder once a day. Whether it's shredding some documents you researched or repeatedly bringing you the wrong case files, I can't stop myself. It's too much fun.

We go back and forth. You won't give in and neither will I. While we might completely loathe one another, there's no denying a physical attraction between the two of us. You're an ass-man and you made it obvious... and you've seen my eyes roaming quite a few times when I look your way. So... we can keep this childish game going until one of us has enough, or... you can finally establish who's in charge the one way you now how. 

With me bent over, begging for more. 

---

I love a man who knows how to take care of a good ass. I can't think of anything better than feeling a warm tongue lapping at my tight, little pucker before sinking right inside of me. I love the sensation of a man's mouth buried between my thick, bubbly cheeks as he smothers himself against my backside. If a man doesn't love tongue-fucking a tight asshole, I have no interest in him. I need a stud who gets off on kissing at my little hole and spanking my big, plump cheeks.

I'm also a smaller gal. Most women aren't happy being short, but I absolutely adore it. A lot of men seem to love it, too. I'm a petite girl with nice curves and a tight body. While it can be intimidating to be around tall girls, I'm comforted by tall guys. They seem to enjoy flirting about how much bigger they are than me, or how easy it would be to pick me up and other things along those lines.

What guy wouldn't want to have a girl he can move around with ease in bed? I could be pinned up against the wall, or bounced on your cock without much effort if I was riding you. I get off on it. Being teased about how petite I am, yet how I manage to have such a big ass. My main weakness is tall guys. The size difference is very hot to me. Plus, I know when people see me with a tall man, their immediate thought is about us having sex. How the size difference must come into play, or how I'm most likely moved around like some ragdoll by him. 

The requirements however, are... You **must** like talking dirty and be an ass man. I have many more kinks but those are the main ones. The **limits** are feet play, watersports, beast, scat, blood and having myself written for. (Small actions such as positioning or moving the plot forward are okay but nothing more!) Light ageplay is okay, but nothing younger than 18, sorry.

4d88za,3,2016-04-03,Filipino Computer Science graduate in UK &gt; Germany/US,ragdolls,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/4d88za/filipino_computer_science_graduate_in_uk_germanyus/,"Tl;Dr: I am a citizen of the philippines currently studying Software Engineering masters in the UK, currently considering my options in terms of getting away from the UK and the Philippines. Considering Germany and the US. Help?

I studied for Computer Science for three years in the Philippines, where I was getting exceptional grades – I was consistently on the dean's list and the president's list, which allowed me to get accepted into a university in the UK studying for a Masters of Engineering in Computing (4 years) degree. I still get good grades, although I'd be lying if I said that I'm doing as well as I did in the Philippines, mostly because the education is to a much higher standard, and I’m finding it more difficult even with prior experience. I’m coming up to the end of my third year now, and am considering options. 


Some points:

* I have plenty of work experience in diverse fields: cashier at a fast-food restaurant, technical support in a call centre, barista, waitress, accountant and graphics designer at a café (family owned), computer science student ambassador (current). I have good relationships with my lecturers within the university who will be more than happy to endorse me by providing glowing references. The problem is that I don’t really have personal projects of my own nor have I worked for a company that is directly linked to my degree. Internships are hard to come by where I live (Wales) and I’d practically have to move to London and live in a shoebox for a few months to get an internship. 


* I’m a woman, and as sexist as it sounds, I’ve heard from multiple sources (professors and colleagues alike) that women in Computer Science are valued as there aren’t many of us in the field and employers want to keep the workplace as gender-neutral as possible. How true is this in the “real world”? 


* I’m lucky enough that my university is within the top 15 Computer Science universities within the UK (7th in the 2016 Times University Guide, 11th in the 2016 Guardian University). It’s quite a small university and not very well known, but we’re not far from Oxford and Cambridge. 


* This particular degree is also accredited for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status by the British Computer Society. 


* I can borrow money from my family, Although I’d like to refrain from doing so as they’re already sponsoring my degree. They live in the UK and are quite well off so money is not such a big concern.  


* Being a holder of a Philippine passport, I practically have to have a visa before landing in another country. This makes it difficult as all job applications/interviews will have to be done online. 


* I have a very generous and loving boyfriend who is British but can claim German citizenship. We’re eager to learn if our relationship can help my chances at possibly working and living in Germany. Something similar to the UK’s unmarried partner visa, without having lived together formally? 


* The UK’s current government seem to be working to keep a lot of foreigners out, or at least make it as difficult as possible for us. I find it rather distasteful to work and pay taxes for a country that would rather keep me out when there are countries who embrace talent no matter what nationality. I really want out unless it significantly affects my career negatively. 

How difficult is it to find a job abroad? Currently I’m considering the US and Germany, which would be a better choice for my degree? I am willing to learn German, and have excellent written and spoken English skills (I scored 8/9 on the IELTS test before I came to the UK, I'm sure I'm more fluent now!). Will my being a fresh graduate hinder my chances at finding a job abroad?

Would staying in the UK be better? I’m afraid I won’t get hired as I have British friends who are switching to a master’s degree because they haven’t been able to find jobs. If it’s that hard for them, how much harder would it be for me? It’s not just a matter of nationality either, I have friends who achieved higher than myself and do better at university, yet have not been able to even land an interview.

4d8ahn,6,2016-04-03,Introduction,Aventine,Methadone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Methadone/comments/4d8ahn/introduction/,"Hello /r/methadone !
As a newly appointed moderator I thought it would be a good idea to introduce myself a little bit. My name is Aventine and i'm currently a Alcohol and Drug Counselor in the state of Minnesota. I work at a methadone clinic that services about 150 patients at a time and have a case load of around 40-50 patients. I've been with my clinic for about 14 months, and a counselor for about the same amount of time. I did my internship at an outpatient facility that was mostly alcohol/methamphetamine users.  I have a bachelors in Counseling Psychology and Biblical Theology as well as my LADC. I'm also 24 years old, which I thought would deter me from starting a career, but has in no way really held me back at all.

If you have questions regarding methadone/buprenorphine please feel free to contact me. My clinic does not allow us to do suboxone but does allow buprenorphine (which is silly, because a lot of insurance providers won't pay unless naloxone is involved). I work for a fairly large methadone/bupe provider that has clinics in about 20 states, so if you're transferring or interested in getting into a clinic, please contact me and i'll help you locate one.

Looking forward to getting to know you more!"

I've been teaching myself Java for about a year now and I have a couple of questions about the industry. 
1. I know that once you learn one language, it's easy to pick the rest, but I'm wondering what language to pick up next (I'm a sophomore in High School and I'm looking to go into Computer Software Engineering/Computer Science). 
2. I feel like what I'm doing is pointless right now, and I want to apply my skills to the real world. Is there anyway I can get an internship as a High Schooler?
3. Whats the difference between Computer Software Engineering and Computer Science majors?

4d8qn5,1,2016-04-03,Advice about internships/co-ops for someone in my situation,MathOrProgramming,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4d8qn5/advice_about_internshipscoops_for_someone_in_my/,"Long story short, I was a computer science major for three years. I did quite well (4.0 GPA), but realized that computer science was not what I really wanted to do. Fast forward to the next year and I am at a new university studying ME. So far, I've put a year into the program and have a pretty solid GPA (Anticipating 3.7ish after this semester). In the best case scenario I would graduate in 1 more year, but this is very unlikely to happen. In reality, I'm looking at 1.5/2 more years to complete my degree.

Now, this worries me because I do not have an internship or co-op at all. My resume has a couple of pretty GPA numbers, but nothing else of any substance. If I were to end up being able to graduate next spring I would be fairly unprepared. I applied for internships and co-ops for this summer, but have come up with nothing so far. 

Of course, I would like to graduate sooner rather than later as well. I'm already going into my 5th year, possibly looking at six, and feeling pretty burnt out. An internship over a co-op is looking better and better simply because it wouldn't delay my graduation even more. A co-op would likely be more beneficial though. Student loans are something creeping up as well, but those aren't too bad yet.

If it looks like I'm going to have to do a sixth year I will definitely be looking for internships again, but I'd like to know what you guys think I should do if this isn't the case. Anything that I would do this summer that wasn't an internship would also have to work around my work schedule. At this point I plan on working as many hours as possible serving tables (I've worked at the same restaurant for almost 7 years now) to try and avoid taking any private loans out for the additional years of school. That would leave me with just part of this summer to put something useful onto a resume. 

So, what do I do? What should I look for? How can I make myself more desirable from an employer's perspective in a short amount of time?"
4d8rs2,0,2016-04-03,Question about how I list my major on my resume.,TheRealNeilTyson,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4d8rs2/question_about_how_i_list_my_major_on_my_resume/," I am going to change the name of my major on my resume from ""Petroleum Engineering"" to ""Petro-Chemical Engineering"". 
One, because most employers never heard of petroleum engineering outside the industry. 
Two, the job prospects are null for new graduates right now unless you have a parent in the industry. 
Three, I have extensive programming and I am getting my minor in computer science, I am even getting a computer science related internship this summer; but, when the time comes to apply for jobs, I don't want to scare away potential employers with a ""Petroleum Engineering"" degree because they may not know what that is.  

**Any thoughts on this?** I am sure some of ya'll may have some ethical issues with this but technically I am doing enough chemical engineering to include the name in my title. Oh, and petro-chemical engineering sounds more badass than petroleum. I'm open to all criticism.

Takes up most of my time.
* Multicultural Club, Dance Group Leader - Multi is a club at my school that celebrates cultural diversity through dance. There are several cultural dance groups at my school and I'm a member of several of them. We spend the entire year practicing/rehearsing for an annual 2-day show held in the Spring of every year.

In addition to these activities, I also program/code in my spare time and have a lot of side projects I can talk about/discuss.

**Hooks:** First Generation (This I think was a big factor for a lot of my acceptances), Low Income (Pell Grant eligible)

**Essays:** My common app essay wasn't anything out of the ordinary but it at least demonstrated my personality and my passion for computer science. My supplements were alright too. I did my best to avoid being cliche and I took some risks by going with some non-conventional essay topic choices and I guess it worked.

**Strengths:** First generation, low income, competitive GPA/courseload, high success in AP course load, strong passion for computer science, unique EC list

**Weaknesses:** My SAT score could've been better, lack of STEM related school activities

**Reflections:** Admissions are totally a crapshoot. I wasn't expecting to get into Brown or Johns Hopkins nor was I expecting a half-tuition scholarship from USC (Which is my #1 choice as of right now). At the same time, I wasn't expecting to get deferred or rejected/waitlisted from Illinois and Chapel Hill. I'm glad I gave these competitive schools a shot and now I have some difficult decisions to make down the road.

I will most likely end up enrolling at USC if their financial aid package is anything close to what their NPC estimated. It offers a computer science/business administration major that is pretty unique and I was accepted for that major. In addition, I was awarded a sweet merit scholarship with awesome benefits along with being selected for their engineering honors program. When I visited the school, I fell in love with it and I believe it offers the best environment out of all my schools and is in an ideal location for me to develop myself at. Still, I need to weigh my options cause these other schools are just as great, it's all about finding out where I fit the most at this point."

I'm a second year computer engineering student and I've been looking for an engineering internship for this summer. I have not had much luck.  

I have applied for about 50 positions over the past 4 months and have not heard back from anyone.  I'm starting to worry if there's something I'm missing in my resume.

4d8w9r,1,2016-04-03,Undergraduate Computer Science Degree from Liberal Arts College or Research University,Citiesskylinesexpert,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4d8w9r/undergraduate_computer_science_degree_from/,"I'm currently deciding between two very different schools to study computer science this fall. Option one is Gettysburg College, very small and focuses on a liberal arts education. Option two is Penn State University Park, very large research based university. I'm mainly worried about the merits of a liberal arts college's computer science focus to employers. Is the degree competitive? What will my opportunities for research and internships be like? 

I hope to eventually pursue an MBA or a MS I'm computer science (not sure yet). 

In all likelihood, I will end up at Gettysburg because it is much cheaper with scholarships and financial aid as compared to Penn State. If after one year and I feel like the program won't take me where I want to go, I may consider transferring to a large school like UT Austin or University of Maryland (again, that would be based on financial situations.)

Thanks."

I am a senior that should've graduated this semester but changed majors late and as a result, I haven't taken real coding courses until 1 semester ago and will graduate after an extra semester at minimum. I am not confident in my coding abilities whatsoever yet and have very little hope of landing a summer internship (especially since the last career fair in my school had passed) but I plan on studying and working hard on my own during the summer (doing decent in classes (actually doing well, but they are only theoretical classes with no coding...) but quite depressed at the moment, though I'm confident all I need is time as I'm willing to put in the effort).

I'm not sure if a fall internship while in school is possible but it is very unlikely (a fall internship would at least give me time to brush up on programming knowledge), since most are during the summer and career fairs focus only on summer ones. Also, now would probably be the time to apply for them and get an interview, but again, my programming knowledge is lacking at the moment.

I am super depressed because I keep hearing stories about internships being a must just to have options at entry level jobs and without an internship, there is no ""easy"" path to an actual job. I understand this but I also have no chance of an internship given my lack of experience with coding at the moment.

Any tips or information is much appreciated--I will benefit from seeing a different perspective.

I'm a senior, and I will be graduating in about two months. My life by all means is going well, but I'm just not certain of anything. I'm someone who likes to have a clear plan in life, but whenever I plan these things they always fail. But I need this plan or I will never accomplish anything. Currently, I'm deciding between two colleges, neither of which I'm really interested in attending (I was sadly rejected or waitlisted at many of the schools that I wanted to attend.) In either event, this problem mainly stems from me not applying to engineering schools, because when I originally applied in the fall, I had a stint and lost interest in engineering, but I've regained it again. I'd consider going to one of these schools and trying to transfer after a semester or a year, but that sounds so rough (meeting new people again, difficulty gaining scholarship money from out of state schools (my parents would probably be against it because I'd go too far away or we wouldn't get enough money for me to attend)). 

To add on to this there is this girl that I've had a semi-crush on for a long time. To preface this, I had a girlfriend in my junior year, which was disastrous. I've known this current girl since elementary school and she's amazing, beautiful, and intelligent. I finally worked up the courage to ask her to prom and we will be going at the end of May. I actually like her though and I would love to date her, but I'm too worried about going off to college and losing her then. She got into four schools one in Texas, one in California, one in Maryland, and one in Pennsylvania (the same school that I could go to but the much less likely choice because my parents don't want to pay the tuition.) Ideally, I would like to go to this same school as her, but I also don't want to be too interdependent on her in college. Long distance relationships seem to work sometimes, but I'm also worried that I'm too much of the jealous type (at least I was with my ex-girlfriend). I'd be willing to try the long distance relationship, but I'm too worried. I'd even consider transferring to one of the schools that she attends (partly because I could be with her and partly because it is a school that I had actually wanted to attend but I didn't have the opportunity to apply to.) Again, I'm doing this thing where I'm planning my life out on something that could possibly just never even happen. We could go to prom and she could be not interested in ever dating me afterward, I have no idea. But I'm someone who gets too attached and thinks of these things for some reason. It's probably a blessing and a curse. 

On top of all this, I know that I need to be happy in my life. Generally, I am. I think its mainly the worry of everything else going on that affects me. It's the things that I can't control. I don't really know what to do. I'm sad to be leaving my high school, somewhere that despite not being entirely fond of I have friends and family that are pretty good. I think the choice of colleges has made my life pretty dismal too, but again I can't really change any of that. 

Just as a possible interest for anyone, my life plan would be to do the following:

-Attend college probably either University of Texas at Austin or University of Maryland (both of which I would need to transfer into now) (I will likely have to attend Gettysburg College because they gave me a ton of scholarships, but they're not really known for engineering which is what I want to pursue. I could transfer, but both of these schools are out of state and will give me like no money). At these schools, I would get a B.S. in Computer Science. Ideally, I would go to the same girl as this girl from my high school that I like.

-In college, I would pursue research positions in computer science as well as two internships.

-After graduating, I would work for a company as a software engineer for a few years and ideally marry the girl from high school at this point.

-Then, I would attend Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business for my graduate MBA.

-Then, I would take a job in either finance or technology. 

-Have a child (at max two)

-Establish a great family home with a stable job preferably in the New York City, Austin, San Francisco, Los Angeles, or Philadelphia areas.

-Then, I would love to travel the world with my family and enjoy life to its fullest.

I know that this is a lot. I'm just trying to let things out. I think I know my flaws, but I don't know what to do. The idea of letting go and saying ""to hell"" with a plan and ""just let it flow"" is horrifying to me. If you can give any advice on these problems, in particular specific problems, please let me know. I am open to advice. Thanks!"

I want to achieve my ultimate goal, which is to go to Vanderbilt law and become a lawyer for a labor union I really like. After getting through it, I threw myself into academics and extracurriculars in college and have gotten dean's list every semester and am president or an executive member of many organizations, as well as juggling sports, an internship, and research. I also have a full time job and school during summers to pay for tuition not covered by grants/fed loans, an apartment, and a car. For the first time ever, it feels like I have my shit together.  Although it sounds like a lot, I enjoy every bit of what I'm doing and all the progress I've made as a person from being unable to get out of bed to running things and events. I'm also able to schedule everything out and although it's a tight schedule, I'm always able to move things around for whoever need be.


Personality wise, I'm described by many people I've come across as confident, friendly, someone  ""who doesn't take a lot of shit"", which is true to an extent. I've never had a problem making friends in college, and run across people on campus all the time that greet and talk to me happily and getting dates from guys isn't that difficult compared to before.


Since I've finally become comfortable enough to start dating again, I'm finding it a problem to keep any guy around long enough. We'll have amazing chemistry connection wise and sex wise, but when they start to find out more about my life/academics and get to know me more, they either cut me off, want to be friends, or say I'm too good for them (which isn't true- I have a lot of faults). 


tldr: I think my life and who I am is scaring off guys I'm really into. What can I do to fix this?"

I am trying to decide between either living in Seattle and commuting using public transport/Microsoft-offered transport, or living in Bellevue and walking/biking a couple minutes to work. 

I would love to hear from some of you that might be in a similar situation with your full time jobs or even have past experiences working and commuting in the Seattle area. 

I feel like living in Bellevue will cut out a daily commute and allow me to access the main campus while still being able to get to Seattle for weekends/events.

On the other hand, living in Seattle puts me closer to the city where most things happen, and I don't have to worry about getting back to Bellevue late at nights. Getting out to the main campus might be more of a struggle.

Any thoughts?"
4da2q4,2,2016-04-04,Should I quit my part-time job (which is relevant to my career and would look great on my resume) to focus on school (graduating in 1 year)?,helpmehahhh,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/4da2q4/should_i_quit_my_parttime_job_which_is_relevant/,"I know that this is a pretty common post on here, ""should I quit my part time job to focus on school,"" but I feel like my situation is different because the job I have is directly related to my career and would look *awesome* on my resume if I could just stick it out for my last year of school. (If anyone's curious, it's web development for a university-funded start-up.) But I'm worried that if I ""stick it out"" longer, my grades will suffer and I will take longer to graduate. (I have already been here for 5 years and am feeling ready to graduate and get on with my life.)

Another worry is that the company I work for is a small start-up made up of one professor and a few students, so it feels much more personal than it would feel to quit, for example, a retail job at a larger store. I'm worried that other professors will know I took a web dev job and couldn't handle it. :( I feel like I have wasted their limited university funding since they will have to hire and train someone new. Not only that, but I tried to quit a few months ago and was given a compromise: I could bring my hours down to 10 hours a week in the hopes that eventually I would be able to do all 20 hours again. And I just don't think I can promise that, and it makes me feel guilty that they are just waiting on me to start working all the hours again.

Experience-wise, I could probably get by fine not including this job on my resume at all, since I have already had 3 internships during college (which is why I'm going to need nearly 6 years for my ""4 year degree""). Financially, I *could* scrape by without it, but might need to get a temporary, less-skilled job for my last term or two here (probably something through the university, like working in a dining hall or TAing). I guess I just feel bad because most students are stuck doing something less-skilled and not at all related to their degree to get through college, and here I have a job that's challenging and relevant to my career, but I would rather do something more mindless (as awful as that sounds) because it would be less stressful. I miss having a job where I could go somewhere, not worry about my career for a while, and then come home and *just* worry about studying. That's the other part of this job that sounded great but ended up not working well for me; it's completely WFH, so when I'm home I constantly feel stressed because I ""should be"" working AND I ""should be"" studying. Yes, I should just become better at time management, but I'm just not good at it.

Sorry this turned into a word vomit!

**TL;DR:** This job would be great for my career, but I could get by without it and it's causing me a lot of stress and could delay my degree. I am a bit ashamed that it didn't work out as well as I hoped and am worried about how quitting would look to other professors and affect my career."

4da52o,2,2016-04-04,"Ticket question: Did I fuck up, or will I be right next door to hell?",double00stevin,GunsNRoses,https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsNRoses/comments/4da52o/ticket_question_did_i_fuck_up_or_will_i_be_right/,"Dear GnRedditers, 

I'll preface this by saying I won't be able to buy tickets when they go live this Friday morning. I'll be in class, unable to access the internet, and, additionally, I think tickets will vanish quicker than a handle of Jack backstage during the UYI tours. 

I'll be in Dallas this August, and fortunately, GNR are playing the city. As I'm in my 20s, I never got the chance to see the band grace a stage. Because of my summer internship, money will not be an object. Also, if I see a band I love, I need to be by the stage for a more visceral experience. So, I purchased two Pit, General Admission Ticket 2 tickets, which, based on the stadium schematics, will be right up against the stage. The total cost was $1,237.70 via StubHub.

This is more money that I've ever spent for tickets. I want to go, possibly with a friend who's also a huge GNR fan. In the event my friend can't come with, I figure I can sell the second ticket. 

My question -- did I make a huge mistake in purchasing these tickets? I assumed that a) the tickets would go fast this Friday, b) it'd be hard to secure a pit ticket right up against the stage, and c)prices would skyrocket (with four months left) especially after Coachella, which should - if all goes well- make GNR the red-hot ticket of the year. Thoughts?

edit: for UYI tours"

4da6t1,17,2016-04-04,[Serious] looking for (mental?) advice about university life &amp; family(parents),lostcsstudent,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/4da6t1/serious_looking_for_mental_advice_about/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons  

Some backgrounds: I'm in my 2B term in regular computer science. I've had some coop experience back in high school, and I just came back last term from a tier-1 software company in SF bay area as my first internship. I'm also Asian but I grew up here, and both of my parents are divorced &amp; have remarried. I live with my mother &amp; stepfather, having said that  

I feel no love and joy whatsoever in my life. I feel guilty when living with my parents, and I treat all my relatives as if they're strangers. The only (kind of) joy I have is when I'm looking at my C++ code. I know they all love me, but I simply don't love them back. I never noticed this until yesterday my mother called me a cold-blooded person and mentioned I seems to have started behaving this way after I started university. I'd happily demand rent from my cousin &amp; grandmother and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that  

I avoid girls, literally. To me the path looks like this: look at girl -&gt; love a girl -&gt; have girlfriend -&gt; married -&gt; have kids -&gt; divorce -&gt; financial ruins (look at Donald Trump's 1st wife). I couldn't come up with a single reason why people want to live together as lovers  

Sometimes I feel like getting away from my parents as far as possible (like for the next 30 years) or just commit suicide so that I don't waste their money &amp; stop making everyone around me unhappy. Part of me says ""they're your parents who loves you unconditionally, you should be happy"", while another part of me says ""you're already 18+, they have no legal obligations to take care of you""  

Is this normal for university students? I have never had this kind of dilemma in high school.Have anyone had similar experience? Should I consult a doctor or counsellor?

She telephoned me and in the course of one short conversation (short, because I'm getting good at gray rock!), I figured out her MO. Can any of you relate?

1. Anger/criticism - ""I find out more about your life from your grandfather than I do from you"" ""You talk to your grandparents more than you talk to me"".

2. Belittling achievements while feigning misunderstanding - ""Your grandfather said you got an internship.. but that's still not a promotion, is it? You still haven't got the job you want, have you?""

3. Trying to peak my curiosity - ""Your grandmother has been seen by the doctors. Don't say anything. You shouldn't ask about it and I shouldn't tell you, really."" ""Ok, Mom, I won't mention it."" ""Yes, your grandparents have a lot going on right now, so you shouldn't bother them with any of your stuff, or pile anything on them. They need space."" ""Ok, Mom, I'll give them space"". ""I've got the whole thing under control. There's a lot going on that you don't know"". ""Well, I'm sure if Grandad wants to discuss it with me, he will"". (I'm getting so good at not taking the bait!)

4. Guilt trip (untrue) - ""Your little brother misses you"". ""He does? I've been Whatsapping him all day"".

5. Faux-niceness - ""You really shouldn't bother your grandparents with any of your troubles or worries"". ""I don't have any troubles or worries"". ""Oh, well... I hope your life continues in the same vein"" (said with a sarcastic, annoyed tone - shouldn't she be happy that I'm happy?!)

6. Tears - after a conversation of the above and none of her tactics working, I get silence on the phone, and then muted sobs. I ask ""Are you alright?"" and she says (her voice broken by tears), ""Yes, [sob] I'm sure I will be fine [sob]"". ""Ok, speak to you soon, Mom"". 

I'm still getting the hang of Gray Rocking, but it's working well! 

Can any of you relate to the above tactics used my by Nmom to make me engage with her?

Management has assigned you to God's office.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4dabx2/wp_as_per_the_company_policy_every_office_has_to/)

I stood outside the door, pacing, with a mind full of childish excitement and fear. What if *He* didn’t like me? A white, wooden, double door led to his office. Nothing grand, like I expected.

I found no trace of the pearly gates in all my time here. Instead, after I died, I opened my eyes next to a river with water so clear that I could see the color of the fishes that swam near the shore.

There was a line of about a hundred people ahead of me, and a woman that walked up the line with a tray in one hand and bottomless bottle of red wine in the other, pouring drinks for those who awaited their final baptism. In my case, it was my first too.

One thing I don’t remember is it being strange. My spirit felt as if it was preprogrammed to know exactly what occurred around me, and strangely, I felt as if I had been here before. On the patch of grass to the left of me, a circle of men and woman in white, with crowns of daffodils on their heads, danced to music only they could hear. *They were choosing their parents.* I knew this with certainty and didn’t even stagger when one of them disappeared in the blink of an eye.

I turned the round, golden handled of the door to God’s office, feeling the cold metal heat beneath my grip. He sat upon a chair made of white clouds. The large windows of his office shone with bright rays of heavenly light. There was no sun here, but the day was always—well, sunny. Like a clear skied summer afternoon.

“Vera!” He beamed, his long white hair combed back and hanging straight down behind his ears. “Come here, you have to see this.”

The glass desk of his table had a large screen at the top. It was hovering over a Westboro Baptist Church gathering by the side of the road. I narrowed my eyes reading the poster signs and wondered exactly why he would have any interest in them whatsoever.

“Okay, here it comes, this black car—watch it!”

The window slid opened. A woman sat inside, minding her own business, while eating an ice-cream cone. God raised a finger, at the same time a they drove past the gathering.

A man leaned closer to the car, opening his mouth to chant, “God hates—

At the flick of God’s hand, the ice-cream went flying out of the woman’s hand. It landed right between the man’s eyebrows and slid down over his nose. God rolled back in laughter, shaking his head.

“You can say what about these people—he heaved trying to break the next wave of laughter—but they have the best expressions!”

I smiled, only because his laughter was contagious and watched as the screen of his table reverted back to glass. “Now, the clues for that double homicide in Lindon Street. I need to you make sure Warren Blake forgets to rub off the bloody fingerprint on in the bath.”

I blinked. Was this something I was meant to know how to do? Afraid to ask how, I nodded. “Alright.”

“And then the Brooklyn household on Holis Street, I need there to be traffic on their way home. Enough to delay them for about ten minutes. That Lisa is going to be a fine president; I don’t want her to be present for Blake’s visit to their house.”

I opened my mouth, still wondering if I was allowed to ask right as the words tumbled out of it “But can’t you just remove Warren from the equation altogether?”

“I will,” he said, scratching his beard, “but in due time. The man has earned a chance to repent through the horrors done to him when he was a child. If all the bad weren’t allowed the chance to be good, the world would be half empty. Remember, child, pain is temporary.”

“But it is still pain.”

“Do you remember you death?”

“Ye—” I stopped, trying to remember. Of course, I had to… But I certainly didn’t.

The screen opened up again, in Warren Blake’s home. Water ran over his bloodied hand’s and turned a light red shade as it ran down the sink.

“Look at his face.”

My breath caught. I didn’t need to see his face, for it was his hands that had strangled me, and beat me until my body went ragged.

“What do you feel?” God asked, pointing at the blood on his face that he had just scooped water for to rinse.

“Nothing. Not for him. I feel—” Strangely, I felt unburdened by what he did to me, so much so that I hardly remembered what had happened to me in the first place. His actions, that horrid face as it hovered over mine dripping with sweat that landed on my face and mixed with tears, those hands—strong as rock—none of it moved me. “I feel joy.”

We just returned from a 16 city tour and played a sold out show at the Gramercy Theatre. We have 3 residencies throughout the city including being one of the house bands for the off-Broadway production of SLEEP NO MORE. 

Our recent appearance on Good Day New York -

Live Performance/Interview - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_brD-AR2-eQ 
Live Busking Performance - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZf_YvRBRes
Music Video: http://youtu.be/6de05pvfHhA 

We are a highly successful trio looking for a new drummer. Our current drummer is leaving for personal reasons. We are comprised of 8 string electric bass, cello, 2 glockenspiels and drums. The band's name is 'YOU BRED RAPTORS?' It's a question. Wanna fight about it? We have been quite successful in the NYC area for the past 5 years playing shows at the Gramercy Theatre, Mercury Lounge, The Manderley Bar, Knitting Factory, Public Assembly, Galapagos, Jacob Javits Center, The Rock Shop, The Cake Shop etc etc. We have opened up for Spoon, Steve Jones (the Sex Pistols) and the Protomen. We have a MASSIVE online following (10K on Facebook alone), steady income at every show, seasonal touring along the East Coast/Midwest and connections to open up for other touring bands in NYC. 

We are in the Music Under New York program (MUNY with permits) playing both weekly subway shows as well as venue shows all over the 3 boroughs (no one counts Staten Island as a borough anyway). Busking has provided this band with everything. We have not had to pay out of pocket for any band expense for almost 4 years and we intend to keep it that way.

We have been featured in Bass Guitar Magazine, New York Magazine, The Atlantic Magazine, The Economist, Strings Magazine, the Deli, The New Yorker and the AV Club as well as various and numerous online publications/blogs. The music is instrumental, gratifying, challenging, and has a Post-Rock feel with elements of Classical, Jazz, Metal and Hip-Hop. If you know or like any of the following bands, you might get a musical boner for what we do.

- Explosions in the Sky
- Hans Zimmer
- Royal Blood
- Animals as Leaders
- Russian Circles
- Wintergatan
- ISIS
- Scale the Summit
- Pelican
- Buckethead
- Primus
- Mogwai
- Tortoise 

Yes, we wear masks on stage. We play to a very large amount of people during subway performances (50k+) and hit more demographics than any other touring band because of that. This translates to a huge built in audience for venue shows/other events. We have released three LPs and an EP, all of which have been very successful in sales. All of the songs you will be learning have proper audio and video recordings

Here's what we need from you:

- NOT a hired gun. We need a full time member who gives a shit about the project and isn't just looking to get paid. We have the money, we just don't have the time to print out an I-9 and W-4 form for you.

- A Flexible Schedule. Lots of shows and rehearsals. We reside and practice in Astoria. We also have a monthly residency here. 

-Ability to listen and to adhere to a looping pedal. This is integral during live shows.

- Proper Gear. The band will provide you with a subway busking kick drum/glockenspiel/dolly but the rest is up to you. You will be using what you can carry into the subway so the ability to Macgyver a good travel kit is essential. It's tough work but incredibly rewarding and lucrative most nights.

- Musical Versatility. Don't be one of those wiener priests who can only recite one style of music. We love all types of music and while we use elements from each, this position is all about pushing boundaries of the unusual and striving to make new and interesting sounds.

- Reading music is a plus but not mandatory: The former drummer has parts written for glockenspiel and drums that we are used to. Look at it, make it your own, high five... out. 

- Willing to learn glockenspiel is a plus but not mandatory. 

You will get paid but the band fund is always the favorite child. We have a bank account, an accountant, interns, are card-carrying ASCAP members and will be a fully licensed LLC quite soon (paperwork pending). We are stupidly professional. If you are a hobbyist, please move on and don't waste our time. We don't want to do this every six months. We don't want to get bogged down by unnecessary bullshit. Long story short, this is a serious commitment and is demanding of attention/effort, all of which will be paid for in dollars, friendship, and great times playing/creating music.

If this sounds awesome (and it is), don't be shy.

Please contact us at youbredraptorsdrums@gmail.com! Please respond with video and audio links of your drumming and current band situation. 

Sincerely,
You Bred Raptors?

4dbm0w,21,2016-04-04,Been a developer for two years now. Should I go for a Master's in CS? I majored in Info Sci.,narett,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dbm0w/been_a_developer_for_two_years_now_should_i_go/,"When I was in uni, I wasn't able to complete a CS major at the time since I was a sophomore by the time I knew that CS was an actual thing I could major in (I came from a very small high school in a very small farming town). I managed to graduate with a B.S. in Information Science from UNC as well as getting a double major - B.A. in comm studies where I basically made video game demos for projects.

Now I've been a developer for two years professionally. I somehow netted an internship for a data storage company for 6 months. A few months after that, I got a job at a local credit union as a junior dev maintaining teller software. Now I've been at a Fortune 100 company for a whole year as a web developer mainly doing Node work with a hint of Flask.

The reason I'm interested in getting a Master's in CS would be to finally get the CS education I feel I never got. I always feel like I'm lacking knowledge. Yes, I can code, but I feel I can be better than what I am now. Throughout the past, I've tried to hodge-podge together self-guided dive into CS theory - of which I only have the barest fundamentals of, if even that. What's worse is being a web dev kind of invalidates much of what I sat down to study, such as thinking about efficiency of code. Also, a part of me found CS theory to be kind of fun, but again that was outside of the class setting. Back in school, I remember hating learning about data structures, but I think I was too young and immature back then. I'm 26 now. I find reading about them quite fascinating.

As for a career guidance, I don't know where I want to go. When I think career, my head draws blank. I just want to make things. Those things, so far have been videogames and I've been having a difficult time getting back into them due to personal doubt, but web dev is getting quite boring.

I don't think getting a Master's in CS is the only resort, but it's the only one that comes to me. I also feel that, though mad expensive, I'd be able to get out of the 'real-world' a bit and dive back into education with stronger resolve than I had back as a undergrad.

All this said, any advice would suffice. Cheers!"

I am a male engineering student, recently got an internship in Cambridge, Ontario and looking for a place to live. 

I do not own a car and do not plan on getting one so I am looking for a place that is in the Preston area so that I can hopefully walk or transit to work. Ideally, I would like to be close to the Cambridge Centre as my work is close to there and a lot of amenities are around. I don't mind living in a basement solo or having roommates but location is key for me as I do not want to be spending &gt;45 min going to work everyday. 

Currently I am looking at the renting at the Auburn Towers (250 Lena Crescent / 750$/m+utilies) but as that requires a roommate I am looking elsewhere. 

Please let me know if you know of any housing opportunites within the area. I am active on craiglist and kijiji but I understand that some places are by phone only so if you have friends or family looking to rent out then feel free to PM or contact me. 

Thank you. "
4dbxt1,1,2016-04-04,Useful CS courses to take during the summer? Tips from those who were at Rutgers?,immortal192,NJTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/NJTech/comments/4dbxt1/useful_cs_courses_to_take_during_the_summer_tips/,"I'm a Rutgers student and a CS major in my senior year but I'm going to graduate on Fall 2016 (changed to a CS major 2 semesters ago). I want to take summer classes to lighten the load on fall so that I can do my own projects and build a portfolio (no internships or CS-related experience, unfortunately). I am currently taking CS 280, 288, 332, and 356 and I find I'm struggling on the coding part but breezing through everything else.

I was wondering if there are any useful summer courses to take (whether at Rutgers or at NJIT, although the latter has much more options). Any thoughts on the following? 

* **CS 491 - Computer Science Project (Eljabiri Osama)**--no idea what the course entails. Is it code-based? What is the group project like? Any presentations or active participation? Might just save it for fall semester as I'm not confident in my direction yet.

* **CS 490 - Design in Software Engineering (Nicholson Theod)**--same as above.

* **CS 431 - Intro to Database (Vaks Leon)**--it seems somewhat more useful but I couldn't find any info on the professor at all, so I'm a bit hesitant. Trying to avoid bad professors and group projects, if there is any. 

* **IS 331 - Database Design (WIll Todd)**--it fulfills a required elective but I'm pretty sure it isn't useful for a CS major.

* **IS 350 - Computer Ethics**--seems like a free A with zero effort, doesn't seem useful at all so this is the last resort (still want it to lighten fall course load, since CS 490 and CS 491 seem to require some significant time investment).

* **MATH 333 - Probabilities** (Ionescu Adrian)--couldn't find anything about this professor--I know that there is a good one that teaches this semester and possibly during fall.

If there is a really good coding-based course available then I might also take it even if it doesn't contribute to my graduation requirements. I only started C++ and C programming this year and last time I took Java was a year and a half ago at Rutgers.

Any tips or recommendations on how the course is like and how best to succeed is much appreciated. Thanks.

P.S. Rutgers only offers B.A. for CS degree. Is it worth switching over to NJIT for the B.S. degree? Not sure how many additional courses I will need to take. I was glad I was done with Calc 3 but linear algebra/matrix computation seems quite useful if I want to be competent in my field. Will probably talk to my advisor soon.

4dclho,22,2016-04-04,"I'm [29/m] and my 3 friends [23, 24, 26/m] are hanging out/traveling behind my back...",RobotChikin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4dclho/im_29m_and_my_3_friends_23_24_26m_are_hanging/,"Hello redditors, 

This is a complicated story. I have a best friend (let's call him Tommy [23/m]) and I met him at community college. We also met 2 other friends (let's call them Jim[26/m] and Ben[24/m]). Now, Tommy and I were inseparable, despite our age difference. We spoke on the phone almost every day, and went on spring break together almost every year. We were also friends with Jim and Ben (kind of a friendship circle) and we did a lot together. I secretly wasn't too fond of the others (especially Ben) but I put up with them because I wanted a friendship circle and because Tommy was one of my best friends. It was obvious when we all hung out, however, that Tommy and I were closest.

Things Tommy and I did were play Smash Bros, play beach volleyball, travel, etc. However, one year, I hurt my back very badly and started on medication. My personality started changing and I became more serious. I became depressed and more aggressive. One year, at Panama City Beach during spring break, Tommy and I were running toward the car and he pushed me lightly and I fell on my elbow. I was on meds, so I flipped out, put him in a headlock, and almost punched him in the face. Everyone told me to calm down so I let go and relaxed. Later, I apologized profusely. I'm not sure if it rattled him, but he acted fine.

That summer, Tommy had an internship in Chicago, and he asked me to visit him. At this point, my health was bad and because of my back I couldn't sit in a plane so I declined his invitation. So Ben went without me to visit him and I was a bit jealous. Later that summer, I went on a cruise with Tommy and a few other friends. Tommy and one of my other friends, that he hadn't met before, hit it off and I was acting mean and jealous the entire time. I confronted Tommy about why he was ignoring me, and he said it was because I was being mean to him the whole time. I apologized. 

I must mention that also, I haven't been able to do things with them like play volleyball, see movies (because I cant sit), etc... all things that we used to do for fun, I now couldn't do because of my chronic pain. Ben gives me a hard time. He calls me ""old man"" and ""cripple"" - it bothers me a lot. 

That Halloween, Tommy, Ben, Jimmy, and I all went to visit Tommy for halloween. While we were playing flip-cup, Ben hit the cup out of my hand and I flipped out and poured water on his head. He slapped me and I slapped him back and it almost became a fight. Everyone calmed us down and we relaxed. The entire weekend, however, I kind of distanced myself from the group because I felt - and because the meds gives me a new personality where I dont feel very social.

That Christmas, back at home for break, they all invited me out, but I was busy with drs appointments. Eventually, they stopped inviting me and I saw them all at the mall hanging out. I was mad. I confronted them, and they said, ""you've been busy with drs so we didn't invite you"". I said fine and left.

This semester, Tommy and I have barely talked and he only calls when he needs help with homework. I saw that he and Ben were at a music festival together from pictures, and I asked why he didn't invite me and he said, ""it was last minute. He already was driving up"" or some bullshit. I forgot the excuse to be honest. Anyways, I called Ben just to see if he and Tommy had been in touch, and he said, ""yeah. Im driving up with him to California to drop him off at his internship"" (we live in Florida). Then he said, ""Jim has an internship in New Orleans and we're going to visit. Want to come? I miss you buddy"". I forgot to mention that Ben, although he gives me a hard time, likes me and asks me to hang out. But I dont like him because he does give me a hard time and threatens me because I dont want him to become best friends with Tommy instead of me, but its too late. They're all talking and making plans without me.

I cant seem to think this is all the fault of my chronic pain and meds that limit what I can do and make me act differently. Is there any way I can save the friendships at this point? I have to say that Tommy did invite me to Seattle next December to go to a job fair, and he tagged me in a facebook post (I was the second person he tagged, he tagged Ben first, then me, then his other best friends, so maybe he still considers me his good friend?).

I know I sound like a little girl but this is one of my best friends. EVERY friend I've ever had this happens too. We either lose touch or I get nixxed out of the group. I'm so sick of it happening, I have few friends left. It makes me want to kill myself...."
4dcnaf,0,2016-04-04,This is the last straw. I need to pick up a car and I need advice.,somerandomlurkerguy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4dcnaf/this_is_the_last_straw_i_need_to_pick_up_a_car/,"So I'm currently a college student doing an internship, and something real shitty happened last week and today.

I usually take a bus after work (free of cost) so I can take the train afterwards so I can go back to college or my house.

Problem is: I had to wait more than an hour for the bus to arrive when it typically took me like twenty minutes. I got to my class about twenty minutes late. Luckily enough, it was marketing class, so it wasn't anything too important. 

Therefore, I had the following concern: what if something even worse happens? Public transportation in my country is horrifically inconsistent. I don't want to have to go take a slowass bus after work only to take yet another slowass bus because an emergency happened to my mother or sister.

So I was thinking of buying a used car. Currently my parents are paying for my tuition, but they can't afford anything else and their credit score is far from ideal. I'm currently being paid $10 an hour, 16 hours a week with biweekly payments. I've lurked a bit in some subreddits, like PF, Frugal, and cars. But last week an issue happened at my workplace that forced me to stay two more hours, and public transportation was completely closed. 

90s Corollas, Accords, Crown Vics, and Miatas are some of the top picks. Luckily there's some cars I can get from there that are perfect, but I don't have the money right now. Seeing how I'm planning in going to more internships that will require me to go from one place  to the other (other than the fact I'm 21 years old), I'm going to need to get this money as soon as possible. Is it possible for me to apply for a loan at this point? Should I with my current salary? 

I'm sorry this is a really lengthy and dumb question, but I've heard the horrors about purchasing used cars from car dealers, and I'd like to not have to deal with that at all. I was thinking of applying to a credit union, but I don't think I apply. 

What do you guys think?"

Got lasik 1.5 years ago. Everything was great until last summer (9 months after surgery), I had an internship and I'm a programmer. My eyes got super super dry during the day and into the night, even though I'd try to exercise after work. About halfway into the internship I started noticing these large floaters falling into my vision that would just sit there and wouldn't move away if I flicked my eyes. I figured after the internship it would be alright and they would go away or something.

It's been about 7 months since the end of that internship and I still have the large floaters, and I definitely have a good amount. My eyes aren't as dry as the internship but I can't stay up at night at all looking at my computer so they get zonked, and they're sore if I stay on the computer for an extended period of time during the day. I went to a family care eye doctor and he said everything looked fine back there, but I can't help feeling a bit paranoid that my eyes are going to get worse and worse. 

Do you think it's worth it to go to another eye doctor? Any thoughts?

Is making an app (with no experience) a good way of having something to offer to employers? Or am I reaching out too far?

I worked hard to get where i am at the firm i work at. this included sometimes 60 hour work weeks but most of the time i was only working between 30-40 hours depending on the project w/ weekends off. she meanwhile just worked as 9-5's and never finished school up. we were members at a fitness club and she would increasinly spend time there more and more even though she just used it for the spa part and never really worked out. soon it was getting ridiculous she was also more and more guarded about her phone. so one night we were drunk and she passed out. then her phone buzzed and an unknown number popped up asking if i was gonna be at work the next day. she was smart and never had any messages saved over 2 days from him, but the texts were damning. i forwarded them to me and kept the information. the marriage was done right then and there, and to think we were gonna try for kids. i immediately withdrew us from the club which pissed her off and caused a huge fight but i said, ""we have to save up for the baby and a new house"" she reluctantly agreed. she never did have the best metabolism so this was bad for her. i then set up cameras in the house for future use of course in court.  i just needed time to collect my thoughts and my evidence and plot. i went on ""business trips"" and recorded her fucking the guy in our bed. that was it for me i hated her. i spent the next 6-8 months buying greasy foods, more and more beer and loading our dinners with fatty foods and pasta/bread. each morning i would wake up early and get us donuts every morning for that time. she easily gained 25 lbs over that time-i gained like 10 lbs..totally worth it. i also did what i could to be the best husband ever over that time. i called her all sorts of things and treated her like a princess so she wouldnt suspect a thing. i made the most romantic gestures and made our 4 year anniversary a dream vaction of hers. i did everything she wanted in bed and indulged in her deepest desires. i brought her shopping almost bi-weekly and took her to the best restaurants. i wanted her to know how much i loved her, and would say things like ""i would never hurt you, i would always love you, youre mine forever, were a team, etc and you feel the same way right?."" i dont know if it was the extra weight or the romantic gestures but she seemed to stop going to him and was spending more and more time with me and ""re-fell in love i suppose"" now was the time to strike. after saving up quite a bit we had a serious talk about starting the process of having a kid, it sucked becuase this could have been one of the best conversations of my life but instead it became the focal point of my revenge. we would do this thing where we would send eachother a text about what we were thinking even if we were face to face, it originated in all that time in the library together and was reserved for romantic lovey dovey or sexual texts. long story short this kind of communication was very intimate and special to us. so right when we started to talk i said ""sharron take your phone out"" she knew what this meant and was grinning ear to ear, she probably thought i was gonna say something cute...instead i sent her a video. the look on her face was priceless. she couldnt speak she couldnt move she was paralyzed. she began bursting in tears and said she stopped seeing him 2 months ago, and that it only happened a handful of times. and that i worked too much and she was lonely and she was sorry and that he meant nothing and that we could move past it and have kids. she was a wreck. i told her she shattered my heart and that i could never forgive her and that she was everything to me. she was ecstatic. begging me to stay, saying she would do anything. i simply said no and that i already had a lawyer and that she could damn well bet that infidelity clause was gonna bite her harder than a bull shark. in the divorce i let her keep her car that i bought and all her assets, we had a split bank account since it was easier. i gave her the last 5 months on our lease and that was it. she got even bigger, and looks like shit now. she tries to contact me all the time but i just never respond best part she can see that its ""read"". i really dont have feelings for her at all she was in retrospect so selfish and only looked after herself and others if they suited her needs. her parents were class acts and were so sorry to hear what she did to me i doubt they even talk to her, my ex MOL loved me. shes alone as far as i can tell and struggling, tbh i pity her and feel bad because she used to be beautiful. currently im not looking to date I'm 26 and in the best shape of my life making great money. i post  all my fun times and frequently with with beautiful girls from vationing or clubbing or whatever im up to that given weekend. my new single life is actually amazing and ive found a new part of me that would have been lost with her. i shattered her soul, body, mind and heart by giving her everything and taking it away at the perfect time. nothing too elaborate but enough to inflict lasting damage. the revenge doesnt feel that good now since i barely think of her, but its nice everynow and then to see my greatest enemy be diminished to a spec.

4ddb46,15,2016-04-04,How much of a guarantee should universities have for employability?,AetherThought,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/4ddb46/how_much_of_a_guarantee_should_universities_have/,"A friend of mine, /u/SometimesICryAtNight, posed this question on Twitter a while ago, and though we had a short discussion on it I think there's worth in talking about it at greater length.

So essentially, should going to university provide some guarantee (however small) on the employability of the people who graduate from their programs?

At first, I want to say no - you can make the argument that university is a purely academic institution, and the theoretical knowledge that you earn during your time has no effect on your employability. But thinking about it further, there's a few reasons to believe why this might not be the case.

1. Almost every non manual labour job requires a degree of some sort or other. 
2. With additional programs like co-op, it's almost undeniable that schools like ours market our programs to potential students purely on the value of internships on potential employment later on.
3. Nowadays, it's rare that people want to pursue strictly academic career paths when they begin an undergraduate degree - though it's just anecdotal observation, the majority of people I know in my program (and others) are in it with the view of a stable job in mind.

So if the answer is no to any sort of guarantee, should this apply to colleges or technically-focused institutions? It's not rare for things like programming boot camps to offer some sort of employability guarantee, so would it be correct for universities to do the same?

And finally, is it even fair or honest to market your school based on the employability of its students?

I'd love to know what you all think about this, I think it's a very intriguing topic.

Edit: So is it responsible or reprehensible that the university uses things like its co-op placement statistics to imply that there are many job openings in all sectors when the placements are skewed extremely heavily by the popularity of the tech sector?"
4ddc2g,3,2016-04-04,I [29F] pay all the bills for both me and my bf [25M] and it's just now starting to get to me.,xxxthrowaway11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ddc2g/i_29f_pay_all_the_bills_for_both_me_and_my_bf_25m/,"Apologies in advance....this is going to be long.

A little background:  My boyfriend was a junior at a private, top engineering school when I met him.  I was finishing up a second degree at a state school in the same town.  We met playing ultimate frisbee, and I was blown away by his athletic abilities.  I then realized how amazing he was in other areas of life as well.  He was working on a double-major in electrical engineering and mathematics.  He was VP of the Robotics club and he volunteered at both a local center for underprivileged youth and helped with his church's youth group.  He was (and still is) sweet, caring, funny, witty and goofy.  He also writes very well, and it was his writings to me that made me fall hard for him.   

He got an incredible internship with a top company the summer before his senior year (Summer 2013) and had a job offer from them before starting his senior year.  Then it started to go downhill.  It seemed like a taste of the working world caused him to hate the idea of being unpaid, and being a student.  We started living together following the internship, and I noticed he wasn't always going to class.  He would say things like ""I looked at the lecture material, and I already know everything they are discussing today.""   Since he is insanely smart, I just went with it and would watch him miss class.  Sometimes I didn't know he skipped, because I would be working.  

He really struggled to get through his classes in the fall, but I was hoping the spring semester would be better since he would be ""almost done.""  I was constantly a cheerleader for him, encouraging him to do his school work, make it to class, etc. Worst case of senioritis that I've ever seen.   I knew it was bad, but I didn't know how bad until THE WEEK OF HIS GRADUATION, when he admitted that he had unfinished credits, failed a class, and didn't complete his senior project.    He told me he would have to finish over the summer.   All of this actually didn't affect his new job too much, luckily, because he was waiting on a top security clearance anyway, and that process was all backed up due to the whole Edward Snowden situation.   At this point I had been working full time for about a year (I graduated from a different school the summer he had his internship) and had been paying for everything since he was a student.  I thought it would be ""no big deal"" because he would finished school over the next couple months, graduate and start working soon.  What ended up happening is he didn't do anything AT ALL for 6 months other than play ultimate frisbee.  He didn't work.  He didn't try to finish school and officially graduate like he said he would.  Nothing.  Then, his student loans were about to kick-in and he got some extensions and then started working part time as a pizza delivery driver.  All the while he was still in the same town as the engineering school and he did nothing to finish it.  

The security clearance for his job is still not done yet, but it cleared him to a point where he could work for the company doing non-clearance work, so in June 2015 (a year after he was supposed to graduate), he moved to Maryland for his new job.  The company seemed to care more about his knowledge and capabilities than a degree, so that has worked to his advantage.  I'm wondering if down the road it will matter that he doesn't have a bachelors degree.  This job is states away from the engineering school and I don't think he could finish his degree anymore anyway if he tried.  It'll be 2 years in May since he should have graduated.  

I moved to Maryland for him in December.  Got a good job out here too and thought I'd try something different.  We rented an apartment that is close to our jobs but the rent is nearly triple what I was paying before.   Shouldn't be too big of a deal, because he had talked about splitting the rent.   He had never been able to help before, but now that he has a high-paying job, I figured he could help with this place.   But it is now April and he has yet to lend $1 for rent.  I have paid the entire security deposit, all rent, groceries, electric and internet bills thus far since December.   I calculated (what could have been) his share the other day and it was over $10,000 for just rent and electric alone over the last couple of years living together (in both the old apartment and this one).   And that's not counting the amount I paid each month for groceries or other things for us/him.  

I am starting to obsess over the fact that if he had been able to split rent evenly the last few years, that is $10,000+ more I could have saved for myself.  He says he has no money, and that basically everything he is making right now is going towards his student loans.  Am I a total sucker for believing him?  I don't have any student loans, and I went to a state school.  His tuition was like $50,000 or more a year.

In the past I was telling myself that we were going to get married someday, and it would even out, but now I'm not so sure.  I am 29 now, have very little savings for myself because of this, and have not officially/seriously discussed marriage with my boyfriend.  I am starting to worry that things might not go that direction, and all I've essentially done is hurt myself and help him pay his loans off faster.  

I've left personal feelings and other information out about him.  But I do love him, and he is very good to me in other ways.  He feels very bad about not being able to help financially.  I trust him and don't think he is using me, although I know it sounds like it. 

Just don't know what to do.  I've brought this up to him but all it's done is make him feel bad since he still can't help.  Instead of asking for half the rent, should I just ask him to give what he can afford to?  I am at a loss.  I can't talk about this with family and friends because they will tell me to ""loose the mooch.""   All they can see are the facts.  I guess that's all you guys will know, too.  Besides this detail our relationship is actually pretty good.

   
**tl;dr**: I've been with my boyfriend for 3.5 years, living together about 2 years of this time, and he has never once given me $1 for rent.  "

I chose CIS (Computer Information System ) over computer science because I liked coding but it wasn't a thing I imagined to do forever. (JAVA is like love and hate relationship) anyways.. I browsed some stuff what I wanted to do and was really interested in Database Administrator and Security. I really want to do Security since I want to be the hero of the company fighting hackers! spammers! and the bad evil guy on cyberworld. ^^ 

Since CIS is a very broad major, it really didn't prep me for a particular career. So my question is what can I do to prepare myself for a career in Security or database?

For security I know there are alot of certifications like Network+ and cissp. Will those help me land a job? Of course internship is a must too.

Two internships under my belt, good relations at both places, I spoke with a recruiter whom I knew from one of them and got an interview at a local shop. 

Interview goes very well, I ended my morning speaking with the CEO who told me ""if engineering doesn't offer you a job, come talk to me, and I'll offer you one."" The recruiter comes to pick me up after our meeting and he flat tells her ""give him an offer.""

So I had a good interview, the company clearly wants me (both CEO and engineering) and based on my performance they are skipping entry level and bringing me in as a level 2 dev.

Offer details:

Base Pay: $65k.

Stock options (though company is currently private) and benefits. Potential 10% bonus annually. Unlimited PTO as needed.

However, I've done some research, and (according to Indeed and Salary.com) median pay for SD2 in the area is $72-76k.

So clearly I want to negotiate a little higher. How does the following email sound?

&gt;Hey Recruiter!

&gt;Thank you for offering me a Software Developer II position! I would like to express again how excited I am to begin working for [company].

&gt;However, before I can accept, I would like it if we could discuss compensation. As we have previously discussed, my background is quite strong, and I have a wide set of skills that brings a lot to the table. Overall, I think I would be a great fit for [company]. 

&gt;All of that said, the research I’ve done on comparable salaries show that a base salary of $72,000-$76,000 would be the median market value of a Software Developer II position for the area. The current offer of $65,000 is notably lower; Based on the above, I would like you to consider as a compromise a base salary of $72,000.

&gt;I can certainly see a future for myself at the company, and I’m confident that I can bring a lot of value. I know that we can come to a mutual agreement on an acceptable salary.

&gt;Thank you for your time,

&gt;Potential Hire


Is my offer too high? I am expecting the recruiter to come back with a lower number."

I have a 4.0 GPA, and 33 score on the ACT. I have completed intro to programming, and currently enrolled in AP CS. I am also in an honors math class. I self taught myself python and learned java from school. I do not have many extracurricular activities as I have a job and was never very good at sports.

I recently applied for an internship, and got an interview, but was not accepted. I also did a job shadow there and learned some very important things about the job. First, they use SQL a LOT to interact with the database in their insurance company. I also found an internship for mobile dev, but it wants college students.

What could I do to make myself more employable for these businesses and IT in general? I was thinking of getting certified / taking a class on SQL after seeing it's use. I was also thinking about making an android app (I already know java). What are things could I do to make sure I can get an internship / job, to get the VERY important work experience needed? Also, how could I go about getting certified in SQL or making an android app ( I was just thinking a YouTube series or online class, plenty of those for Android development fortunately!) Also, how to get into the security area, as its very intriguing to me.

4ddsig,2,2016-04-04,"Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 3.5 years, she has lost her sex drive and decided that it is not important part of a relationship",throwawayaccount_987,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ddsig/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_22f_of_35_years_she/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years.  The first two years together were great.  We were both virgins when we met, and we lost it to each other.  We would usually have PIV sex at least once a week and usually do oral or something else once or twice a week.   However last summer she went across the country for an internship and when she came back last August she had lost her sex drive.  We rarely had sex last semester and when we did she was not into it.

Que last week, she came to see me at college (she graduated early and I changed my major) and we had a good time together.  When we ended up having sex (first time in 5 months even though she has been here multiple times this year), it consisted of her rubbing herself on me and then letting me have sex with her.  I say let me have sex with her because afterwards I noticed she had been in tears from it.  I felt like a horrible human being for hurting her, but she told me that its not a big deal cause she did it for me.

We later had a heart to heart and she explained that if she had her way then we would have sex only once in a blue-moon (ie even more rarely than we are doing now).  She feels like sex is not very important to her and it is not pleasant for her (she says I am large and it hurts).  When I tried to explain that I feel like I am nothing other than a best friend most of the time since the loss of her sex drive, she counters that she doesn't feel the same way.

I know that I probably haven't always approached this situation the best way with her but I have gotten better about it and frankly I am tired of this.  I love her and she is my best friend but I am tired of her lack of interest.  I've tired everything that I can think of and I don't want to have sex with someone who is just doing to make me happy.  I want someone who desires me in every way including sexually.  There are so many great parts in our relationships but this one part is really bothering me.  

She is on the pill (she started after we started having sex) and when I suggest that maybe that could be the problem, she is quick to point out how much better it has made her feel.  I don't suspect her of cheating or anything happening while she was away for the summer so that's not the issue.

Am I shallow for wanting her to be interested sexually in me?  What am I supposed to do?

I got broken up with at the end of freshman year of college with this girl I was dating for a while. In high school and for most of college while we were dating I felt really happy with her and I felt like we would stay together for years to come but then I started to get paranoid about little stupid stuff. After awhile my paranoia turned into heated arguments and eventually I guess I just wasn't the person she once liked and we ended up breaking up. After we broke up I was really sad and I guess I started working a lot and girls started paying more attention to me but inside I felt worse than I ever had. It was like any girl that liked me after that was trying to trick me or something. I also a time consuming internship with an accounting firm in the summer so it helped me stay distracted but I thought about a lot of dark stuff during the summer even though I had close friends with me. It was like no matter what they said or how many people were helping me I felt worthless.

Flash-forward to the start of sophomore year of college I started liking this girl at my college but the entire time in the back of my mind I kept telling myself I was worthless and that I didn't deserve to have anyone like me. I distanced myself from her and I feel like shit for doing that but I had already made the decision to study abroad in the Spring (I really regret this decision, even though studying abroad has been a good experience I have reverted back to dark thoughts and being depressed) so I tried to distance myself from people who liked me. 

During study abroad I've messed around with random people and every single time afterwards I feel like shit. I feel like I've become the thing that I hated so much when I was dating my freshman year girlfriend and I don't know what to do. I feel like every poor decision I've made in the last couple of months is going to come back to bite me all at once and I don't know if I can take it.

Sorry for the long post and if anyone made it this far, thank you. I guess I needed to get it off my chest."

*In a conference room with doors locked several members of the LNHI board (Hani Khadem - CEO, Omar Hassan - CFO, Fredrick Reed - Marketing &amp; Strategy and Rafiq Ahmed - President Of the Company) to discuss how to catch up to their main competition, MHI. Several options were thrown around but one arose in the end.*

**Omar Hassan**: It will be a mistake, I'm warning you guys right now. Once it's done there is no turning back.

**Hani Khadem**: The plan will work, nothing of it's kind has been done in Libya at such a high level!

**Rafiq Ahmed**: Perhaps we should consider his plan Omar, after all you yourself said we need to get something on the market soon.

**Fredrick Reed**: From a legal standpoint I wouldn't advise it, although there is no law regarding it, that doesn't mean nothing bad will happen.

**Rafiq Ahmed**: Fredrick, what other path do you suggest?

**Fredrick Reed**: Anything else really, everything from taking an extra loan to speed up R&amp;D to buying foreign motors. Just anything other than this.

**Omar Hassan**: Including foreign parts would hurt our margins, you know as well as me that wouldn't help. As much as I don't like this plan, we need to have high sales on our release to stay afloat.

**Fredrick Reed**: Perhaps, but…

**Hani Khadem**: Can we all agree that this company needs an ambitious move in order to stay afloat?

*The table is in agreement*

**Hani Khadem**: Now that we all agree on that, lets continue.

**Fredrick Reed**: Alright, say I'd go along with the plan, how exactly would we pull this off? MHI isn't actually hiring everyone who shows up at their door?

**Omar Hassan**: Indeed, we shouldn't have them have any connection to us.

**Hani Khadem**: That and access. Access takes a while to get at MHI to their core files and you have to be fairly qualified.

**Rafiq  Ahmed**: If we get someone on their design team we may be able to gain access to the specifications and blueprints.

**Hani Khadem**: Indeed, however we can't send anyone from our design team off, we can't afford to lose anyone, it'd push back our own launch.

**Fredrick Reed**: A longterm person at MHI could rat on us, a design team member would be our best option.

**Hani Khadem**: Indeed, and that'd be a PR and legal nightmare.

**Rafiq Ahmed**: That'd be the end of us, for sure.

**Hani Khadem**: So what do we do then?

**Fredrick Reed**: Omar weigh in on this, what do you think?

**Omar Hassan**: It wouldn't be all that bad, the design team idea is. However using a cut-out would be risky, it'd have to be someone close to us.

**Rafiq Ahmed**: Any suggestions anyone?

**Hani Khadem**: I may know someone, but it'll be a few days before I'd be able to hear back from them.

**Rafiq Ahmed**: That'll work, anyone else?

**Omar Hassan**: Theres someone I used to know, I could still see if they're around.

**Rafiq Ahmed**: Fredrick?

**Fredrick Reed**: I left Spain for a business opportunity and moved here less than six months ago. I'm not exactly what you'd called connected with the local community.

**Fredrick Reed**: Ok that was a bit harsh, but really I don't have all that many friends.

**Rafiq Ahmed**: So it's settled, I'll ask my secretary to schedule another board meeting in a week's time.

**Fredrick Reed**: Hold on for a minute, I've got an idea.

**Fredrick Reed**: What if we made it look like we kicked an employee out of our company and under appreciated him. He intern took his work to MHI in an attempt to *get us back*.

**Rafiq Ahmed**: Interesting…continue

**Fredrick Reed**: That way there is zero deniability, we could even write this person off with poor performance records and indicate some form of personal bias.

**Hani Khadem**: That's quite a scheme…would you be able to do that within a week?

**Fredrick Reed**: Probably.

**Omar Hussan**: To make it even better, we could frame MHI for attempting to use our property sending the plans we own with this person. He could even explicitly say some stolen stuff is on here.

**Rafiq Ahmed**: Theres a bit of room for error, but I like it. Khadem?

**Hani Khadem**: I think thats just what we need to get on top and finally beat out MHI.

**Rafiq Ahemd**: Then it is agreed. Have a nice evening everyone, I hope to get this moving soon, and remember, not a word."
4de46s,8,2016-04-04,Found out it's going to be a bit longer then I expected till I graduate. Are there such things as part time developer jobs out there?,Itsaghast,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4de46s/found_out_its_going_to_be_a_bit_longer_then_i/,"CS student here. I know summer internship jobs are a thing, but is there such thing as part time grunt work in software development? At this point I'm desperate enough to take just about anything.

I'm pretty desperate at this point: I absolutely hate school. I'm a re-entry student who has already put in a lot of work in different majors but I don't have enough gas to put my life on hold for another three years. If I could get the ball rolling professionally

I was thinking that it's viable to get the technical skills to apply for an internship job, next summer at the latest. If I can land an interview I feel very confident in my ability to compete with the majority of other applicants. But what I would like is the possibility to work part time in anything related to software development.

So does such a thing exist? Is there bitch work out there that a student could do? So far what I've seen available is either internship, then full time entry level positions.

If it's possible, I can do what it takes to get it. I eventually want to become a full stack web developer but I'll do anything to get any kind of experience at this point. And anything is likely to pay more then what I'm doing right now. I got some good coding chops but everything has been school projects up to this point. 

I know these kinds of posts are common, and I appreciate the responses. I'm feeling the depression spike up at the thought of losing an additional three more years. I appreciate the people who don't agree with this perspective, but my situation is such. I won't bore anyone with the details, but take my word for it... it ain't great."

I was admitted into UIUC and Cornell for mechanical engineering. However, I plan on changing my major to computer engineering at whichever school I choose to attend. I am OOS and the costs will be about the same for both schools.

I am leaning more towards UIUC because the strength of their ECE department, even though everyone else is telling me to go to Cornell because they've never heard of U of I.

Is it hard to change majors, in particular into computer engineering, at UIUC? 
Is there anything you wish you knew before coming to UIUC? How are the professors? Class sizes? Advisers? Opportunities for research and/or internships? Would you say one school has an advantage over another? If you had the make the choice between UIUC and Cornell, which would you choose?

I realize both are good schools and I don't really have a bad option here. I'm just looking for more insight into UIUC. Thanks!"

4dehxq,1,2016-04-04,Will My Weed Conviction Ruin My Chances of Having a Career?,rk1892,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4dehxq/will_my_weed_conviction_ruin_my_chances_of_having/,"Last summer, I got arrested for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. A friend of a friend had gotten into trouble with the law for possessing some weed (or some kind of drug, I really have no idea). He decided to snitch on me in order to make his charges go away. The thing is, I was never even a ""drug dealer"" per se, just someone who liked to smoke who would sell his friends an eighth once in a while. So basically, this guy (who I had sold small amounts to a few times in the past) texts me and asks if I can get him 2 ounces, cause his friend is coming into town, and they need a lot cause they're going on a trip, etc, etc. I should have realized what was going on but I didn't and I feel like an idiot. I was 23 years old at the time, by the way, and I'm 24 now. When he asked me for the 2 ounces I had just finished school for the summer and was living with my parents in New Jersey. I never should have agreed to do it, but I was already working as many nights a week as I could waiting tables, and this was an easy opportunity to make a few bucks. So I go to meet this guy in a parking lot with it, and as soon as he gets out of his car, a whole bunch of cops jump out of unmarked vehicles. They pretend to arrest him and ""take him away"" immediately. I'm sure they uncuffed him and patted him on the back as soon as they were out of my sight.

So now I'm outside my car, the weed is inside my car, and it reeks. They ask for permission to search my car, which I of course politely deny. They start getting angry, saying they're going to have to get a dog, and that I'm wasting their time by making them stand around. I again refused the search so they called for a dog. The dog shows up, and after good five minutes of being walked around the car, finally indicates that there's drugs in the car. It seemed very sketchy...the dog took forever to do anything and then only signaled after a cop told me to turn around and briefly uncuffed me to sign something.

So they search the car, find it, take me downtown, fingerprint me, and put me in the holding cell for like an hour. They of course ask me to give them names of any drug dealers that I may know, and they ask about where I got the weed from. They tell me they can help me out with these charges if I can give them information. Again, I politely refuse, because at the end of the day, I can go to sleep at night being a guy who sold weed to another consenting adult; I can't go to sleep at night knowing I potentially ruined another human being's life. The cops are annoyed that I won't give them anything, but they don't press it. Then they release me with a court date, but no bail (thank God).

I have a lawyer who says that they pretty much have all the evidence they need in their favor, and that I should just plea guilty so that the sentence will be less. At this point, it could be as little as 6 months probation or as much as 3 months in jail, and my lawyer says that if he were a gambling man, he'd say there's about a 70% chance I'll do time in county jail this summer. What sucks is that in almost any other county, this would have been reduced to a misdemeanor and there wouldn't be jail time, but because this county is in a relatively low-crime area, they are pursuing this as if it were a bigger deal. If I do a little time in county I guess it's not the end of the world, but my real concern is that I am graduating college (Fordham U) in December, and I have a shit load of student loans to start paying back once I graduate. I'm worried that even with a degree from a respectable school, I will have a very hard time getting hired with this felony conviction, especially since the conviction will officially go on the books this summer, just months before I start applying for jobs.

I'm a communications major with a business minor who will be looking for media jobs in New York City. I'm hoping most employers in TV/Radio jobs wouldn't care so much about something weed-related, but I think the fact that it says ""intent to distribute"", the fact that it's a felony, and the fact that there might be jail time associated, might scare off potential employers. I can get the conviction expunged in either 5 or 10 years, depending on certain factors, so at least I won't be fucked forever, but I'm mainly concerned with getting my career started when I graduate college and being able to pay back my student loans sooner rather than later.

I should probably mention that I do have my foot in the door at a really exciting place that would be a dream job for me. It's a major radio broadcast out of New York that's known for its irreverent humor, and I was an intern there last spring. Growing up, I always dreamed of being a comedy writer, and I told this to some of the writing staff I had gotten to know there. They encouraged me to send in ideas for bits to the show, so since that time, I've been pitching ideas and writing scripts via email. 4 of the bits I have written have aired during the past year, so when I graduate in December, that is the first place I will be applying. I figure having interned there and getting my material on the air affords me some advantage during the hiring process, but I'm worried that the felony conviction will negate all of that. What do you guys think?

tl;dr - got snitched on and now I'm going to have a felony conviction for intent to distribute marijuana (2 ounces), when everything finishes up in court this summer. I'm trying to get a job in TV/radio when I graduate school in December, will this conviction completely fuck me over?"

Anyone that has applied, what was the process like? Was it hard to get past the CV stage to the interview? what was the pay/hours like?"
4deqqb,4,2016-04-04,"Today my sister texted me to tell me [28/m] she and her husband are putting down their dog. When confiding in my gf, [25/f], she started talking about her late dog...",diamondmage,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4deqqb/today_my_sister_texted_me_to_tell_me_28m_she_and/,"So today my sister told me that she has to put one of her dogs down. I've known this dog well as I stayed with her for an internship years ago. Well I texted my gf to tell her the bad news, and she texted back how they had to put her dog down, and how she couldn't watch, and how it still makes her sad...And it made me sad that she just made this situation about herself. I told her I'm sorry and that losing her dog must have been really hard. She agreed and said she was sorry that my sister was going through this, but my nephew wouldn't even remember the dog. This made me sad. 

I just asked my gf if I could talk to her about something that made me sad (this event), she said okay, and I told her I was sad that when I mentioned my sister putting down her dog, I expected sympathy but the conversation shifted to her late dog. She came back saying, ""I didn't realize it was selfish to say how I have felt the same feelings your sister is feeling. I didn't take anything away from (Dog). I don't know enough about him to talk that much so I pivoted to my dog. I'm sorry.""

She then went on to say, ""I don't think I did anything wrong but I'm sorry I hurt you. I could tell how you felt, you know.""

Since then, I've gone quite and she is apologizing a lot and trying to reach me. I'm just so sad, I don't want to talk. I'll make myself better. And after typing this all, she's said she did do something wrong...It feels insincere to me, but I'm also super butthurt, so she probably means it.

This isn't the first time the conversation has been changed to talk about my SO. Most days we talk about her shoulder which is always in pain, and how she hates her job, and how she's sad because her mom has cancer. She talks about how she's so sad, and I make her happy, but I feel like it's not always reciprocated. I don't feel right being sad because I like my job and things are finally going alright for me. I would like to talk about how my day went but I'm never asked. I've requested this before but it doesn't happen. Similar things happen with sex. She tells me to tell her what to do, and I do, but they don't happen. 

This may be part of a bigger problem. I don't usually hold my ground, until things build up and I pop. I'm working on that. I've been working on that my whole life. This isn't the first time she's held that she's done nothing wrong. Recently I found out she told her friends about one of my medical conditions, and when I asked if she could refrain from doing that, she said it's not a big deal. This was an hour after a fight that resolved with a conversation where we concluded that I need to be more assertive...So I went to the bathroom, came back, and said, ""how about you don't fucking tell people my private business?"" She shut up, and then said she would respect that. She was sorry and now understood that that meant something to me.

I've also been having a problem with her using her phone when we are out at dinner, texting her friends and family. I've politely discussed this with her, saying how it doesn't feel good, but it still continues. Driving a conversation is really hard when we are alone, and at times, she'll look at her phone while I'm telling her something. If I call her out, she'll say she's just texting X about Y. If I get really sad, that's when, she'll become very affectionate which makes me happy.

We just hit 6th months, and things are feeling heavier and heavier. The things I ask for don't happen. I bought a new game for us to play, but she forgets or can't play because she has a shoulder that it always in pain. When I reminded her of her promise to play last week, she said I should have been more assertive and pushed the point. I was shitty and said, ""okay, I'm sorry, it's my fault.""

I'm very affectionate, and when I show up at her place, I don't get a hug or a kiss. I've asked if she could be more affectionate, and she said she'd try. When I try to talk politics or philosophy, I'm met with reductionist arguments that lead to a dead end (e.g. well that's the way the world works). We do have good times, but it's usually drinking or watching TV and chilling with beer, and she drinks heavily, which is when she becomes affectionate. This is the first girl I've dated who is a beer geek, and it's been cool to share our beer, but we've also talked about losing weight, and 1-3 beers a day with eating out most meals on her isn't trying to lose weight. I'm no angel either, I've had anxiety attacks at the last 2 concerts with her because her ex hung out with us for a bit, and it made me really uncomfortable. They are still friends and trade beer, which is cool. I've just had past experiences that make this sort of interaction hard. This is something I can get over.

So relationship_advice, am I being too sensitive? I've done a poor job of being objective, but I'm really down. How do I work on some of these problems? Unfortunately I just moved out to a new place for a new job since graduating and I don't have any friends here to talk to, and I've learned to limit airing relationship issues to friends, as they may come to not like my SO(and me!), but the problems with my SO aren't resolving, and I need external help. I'm thinking of going to therapy again; the tricks of asking for permission to discuss how I feel aren't working here. If I say I'm sad because of X, my SO gets defensive. If she says I've messed up, I own up to it and say I'll do better.

I'm trying my best, but not succeeding. What can I do better?"

Confront Valkorion in the wilderness of Odessen as the Alliance prepares to undertake a life-and-death cutscene in the ~~heart of the Eternal Empire~~ Zakuul. That's right folks. We are excited to announce that **EVERYONE** knows the planet is called Zakuul at this point. The name is so Za-cool!    

Players who forgot to unsubscribe by April 1st have access to this new Chapter. However, the bug-free version will be available for all other Subscribers on Thursday, April 7th.   
   
**Ranked Warzone Arena Season 7 has started**! Get in there and go ber-Sorc!  
  
**New Warzone: Alliance Proving Ground!** Train with another mixed-faction Alliance team by ~~vying for control of multiple control sectors~~ death-matching near mid in this new Odessen-based Warzone! Use power ups if you actually needed the commendations!    
  
**New Warzone Arena: Rishi Cove Arena!** This new Warzone Arena hosts 4v4 Death matches until ~~both~~ Ranked ~~and Unranked~~ queues die down next week.    
  
**New Gameplay Option: Focus!** Both PvP and PvE instances are now available on any server, allowing friends who prefer any gameplay type to ~~play together~~ be on the same fleet on the same server like they normally do! We added a visual toggle for focus via the mini-map icon for the players that were unaware that it wasn't still GU1.2.
  
**Forget what we said about being on the same fleets!** Unlock additional Strongholds! You can now AFK in all 5 Strongholds for your Legacy!
  
**More Flagship Decorations!** Starting hook count for Republic and Imperial Flagships has been increased to 300 Decorations (+50%) for leaders that HATE it when people AFK in certain spots.  
  
**Set Favorite Mounts and Vehicles!** Players can now select their Favorite Mounts and Vehicles by right-clicking it or by going to the Mount or Vehicle tab in the Ability window. The “Summon Random Mount” ability will only use your Favorites once they are selected. This should reduce confusion and optimize keybinding for Sorcerers that did not quite understand why hitting certain buttons indiscriminately did not always cause the deaths of the entire enemy team. 
  
**Bounty Contract Week Returns!** Hunt wanted criminals in this returning event. The event bugs April 19th at 04:00 PST/12:00 GMT and ends April 19th at 04:30 PST/12:30 GMT.  
  
**General**  
* Guilds can now have up to 1000 alts (up from 500).   
  
* Guild Members can now be sorted by Legacy in order to group Characters that share a Legacy together for faster teasing. ""Really, Groundrunner Legacy?""    
  
* Guild Leaders can now mark individual Characters as a “Main” Character of a Legacy.     
  
* The Guild tab has been removed from the Social UI.  We have already alerted the 4 people that used this feature.   
  
* Added additional information to the Guild UI if a Character is not currently in a Guild.  
  
* Fixed a bug that caused Guild Bonus Tooltips to not close when the Guild UI is closed.      
  
* Players can now add a single space in their character name, e.g. ""Looq Skaiwaukker""    
  
* Common Decoration limits have been increased to 999 (up from 50). Limited Decorations have not been changed because that is to be added as an unlock in the next cartel pack.    
  
* Maximum Character name length has been increased to 20 (up from 16) to give credit spammers more room for creativity.
  
* When using the ""/who"" command, if there are less than 10 results, the results are returned to the chat window instead of opening the Search interface. This behavior can be changed in Preferences by those that can't stand change.    
  
* The “/who” command retains the previous search information in the Search interface. The Intern spent months implementing this, we have awarded him with a Grand chance cube. Great work, Leonard.
  
* Start @ 60 Characters that were incorrectly granted the Chapter 3 Legacy Unlock for that class (and the associated Legendary Status completion credit) have had it removed.   
  
* It is no longer possible to use Conquest-exclusive mounts outside of conquered areas. This is to eliminate use cases where people accidentally forgot to buy packs containing our re-skinned mounts that did not have this restriction.
  
* Using Alt-Tab to unsubscribe from the game while using an Intel HD 4600 on Windows 10 no longer causes a crash. Apparently this feat...bug...didn't fall under the legal gray area like we had hoped.
  
* Koth’s whining in the first scene of Chapter IV now plays as expected in French and German clients.
  
* Missing Herald of Zildrog and Knight of Zakuul over-the-top lines from Chapters VII and VIII now as expected in French and German clients. 
  
* Corrected the description of Hylo Visz’s Rank 20 Achievement to indicate that it requires Rank 20. We have revoked the cube from Leonard and put him back on the community relations team.
  
* Aric Jorgan is now listed in the correct Alliance category with the other companions you forgot about. 
  
* Reduced the brightness of the light flicker on the Quick Travel ability. We are not joking. Someone actually complained about this.  
  
* The K’lor’slug Soldier Companion stats and health have been increased to match other creature Companions that you don't use. 
  
* Fixed a typo in the description of the K’lor’slug Soldier’s Deafening Cry ability. We had asked Disney if we could rename the species while we were at it but were told they are not ready to commit to further retcons until the toy manufacturers caught up to current demand. Sorry.
    
**Items + Economy**    
* Dark Matter Catalysts can now be purchased from the Smuggled Supplies Vendor on Odessen. 
  
* All HK Subscriber Rewards have been added to Collections in case you change your mind, guys...no pressure. 
  
* The Commemorative Statue of Revan that dropped from the Temple of Sacrifice has been renamed the “Commemorative Statue of Revan the Returned.” 
  
* The ""Commemorative Statue of Revan the Returned"" has been renamed to the ""The Returned Commemorative Statue of Revan the Returned.""
  
* ""The Returned Commemorative Statue of Revan the Returned"" has been renamed to ""The Returned Commemorative Statue of the Temple of Sacrifice Revan the Returned"".
  
* Somewhat unrelated, we would like to take the opportunity to memorialize the Developer that *possibly* suffered a stroke while working on the renaming process. Be sure to check your in-game mail for an exclusive ""Commemorative Statue of John Brhajevndaredurned"" decoration! 
  
* The Zakuulan Information Terminal Decoration no longer stops rotating! For no reason! Forever rotating! Won't stop for anything! Will always rotate, the Zakuulan Information Terminal Decoration, all the time rotating! Infinitely rotating! 
  
* The SI-04 Imperial Scout Paint Job now correctly unlocks in Galactic Starfighter.  Though we were surprised how anyone noticed given that no one remembers that it exists...
  
* Our attempt to market re-skinned companions have failed. *Sigh*...Players who lost HK-51 and Treek customizations after updating to 4.1 have had the items returned to their inventory. :/"

The title mostly speaks for itself. On Thursday I worked a little bit late (I'm actually an intern) and I stayed late to finish a mailing because I didn't want my coworker to have to do it the next day. It was 5:30PM and as I was leaving, a man approached me. I should have known that something was off about him, and in hindsight, something was, now that I reflect on what the interaction was like. 

He asked me if I could please let him into the back area/kitchen/break room with my key card. I didn't even think anything of it and figured he worked there; I hadn't seen him before but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I assumed he worked there. I didn't consider the fact that if he had worked there, he would have had a key card like everyone else. I didn't consider the fact that this is in a downtown location and some sketchy people hang out downstairs; many of them homeless. I was being fucking negligent.

Today I was informed via email that there will be a new rule prohibiting interns from being there alone, and that there will be heightened security measures. Just as I was putting two and two together, my boss talked to me. 

She told me everything that had happened and that the person I let in was in fact mentally ill and that some theft occurred. From what I understand, things went missing or somethings went down (I'm unclear) and then they saw surveillance footage of me letting the person in. I'm unclear on most of the details right now. 

Everybody at my work is so upset with me right now. When my boss stepped out, I spoke to my coworker and asked if I was being fired; she told me they had had a meeting about it before and that I'm not. I am so upset with myself. I kept it together when I was there and actually got a lot of work done. It was a productive day but I wanted to die the entire time. I'm a horrible and negligent person and I'm still afraid of being fired. I'm there 4-5 days a week and don't know how I'm going to handle being around people who are so angry with me.

This is the last time I will be telling this story at length; I have spent so much of today crying and panicking and I am at a point where I am so emotionally exhausted. 

I have apologized (but not profusely; I've tried to be as professional as I can). I also have offered to take full financial responsibility if need be. I think I made things worse when I attempted to return my last paycheck to my boss. I told them that it was in case of any damages incurred. I think my boss took it as an insult but I didn't mean it that way... I just want to do whatever I can to fix this. I am happy to cover damages. But it only made things so much worse. Even though it doesn't look like I'm going to be fired (right now), I'm still terrified. My coworker has told me in the past that an intern hasn't been fired from our workplace. I would have been (and still could be) the first to break the rule. I hate myself. 

Also, what if he had been an active shooter? What if he had been violent? How could I be so careless? I hate myself and I don't think I'm going to feel better about this for a long time

TL;DR - I let a mentally ill thief into the back area at work and he stole stuff. "
4df9tj,15,2016-04-05,What is a good pre-entry-level job?,xianbaum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4df9tj/what_is_a_good_preentrylevel_job/,"Hi! I'm having a lot of trouble finding an entry-level/junior position in programming. I recently graduated with bachelor's degree in computer science, and I have a portfolio website, an active GitHub, and side-projects. I've applied to a lot of jobs, some of which I have been interviewed for, but for the most part, I have been completely rejected. I'll admit, my interviewing skills aren't the best because I am shy and nervous.

What I especially seems to be really hurting me is lack of internship experience. I did apply to a couple of places in college, and I did get interviewed, but I was rejected for all of them, and I just thought they were optional then, since my degree didn't require it. I still search for internships, but all of them require ""actively-enrolled students only"", and, well, I'm already graduated.

Anyway, I am a little upset that I can't find a job of course, but if I can't find an internship, is there any other job that can count as some good experience before an entry-level job? I have been a janitor for almost two years, but employers seem to be very unimpressed by that. Besides that, I am doing other things to help my resume. I am still working on more side-projects and I'm also going to meetups, mostly in hopes of networking. Also, I will continue to apply for entry-level jobs. I think what I lack the most is professional experience. But I'm not sure what I can do to get experience for an entry-level job."

BOSTON – A for-profit school with locations in Norwood and Wilmington has been sued for engaging in unfair and harassing sales tactics and misleading students about the quality of its Computer Network Systems program, and the success of the program’s graduates in finding jobs, Attorney General Maura Healey announced today.

The complaint, filed Thursday against ITT Educational Services, Inc. in Norfolk Superior Court, alleges that from 2010 through at least May 2013, ITT aggressively enrolled students in the Computer Network Systems program based on misleading information.

“These students were exploited and pressured to enroll with the promise of great careers and high salaries, but were instead left unable to repay their loans and support their families,” AG Healey said. “Our office has a history of going after predatory for-profit schools and will not stand for students in Massachusetts being treated simply as a source of income. We will continue to investigate and act against these deceptive practices and work hard to get the relief these students deserve.”

ITT’s two campuses in Massachusetts offer a variety of technology-related associate degree and bachelor degree programs. The Computer Network Systems program is the largest program at each campus, with enrollments exceeding 100 students per campus annually.

ITT’s admissions representatives allegedly told prospective students that anywhere from 80 percent to 100 percent of graduates obtained jobs in or related to their field of study. Real placement rates were actually 50 percent or less at each campus. ITT did not disclose that its placement rates included graduates with jobs outside their field of study and graduates with internships or short-term, unsustainable jobs who never received permanent, sustainable employment – including any job that somehow involved the use of a computer. ITT claimed that jobs simply selling computers at big box stores counted as placements, and even counted a graduate as placed who provided customer service for an airline checking travelers into their flights.

ITT’s recruitment strategy included soliciting prospective students in Massachusetts through advertisements, its website, direct phone calls and in-person communications. Former admissions representatives were allegedly expected to call up to 100 prospective students per day and were publicly shamed or fired if they failed to meet their quotas. Students were allegedly persuaded to visit a campus as soon as possible, where they were encouraged to apply, take an admissions exam, and complete a financial aid pre-appointment that same day. Admissions representatives pressured prospective students to enroll regardless of whether they were likely to succeed in the program.

ITT also advertised and promoted hands-on training and personalized attention through its program, but students said their experience involved the use of outdated technology, absent teachers, or being told to “Google” the answers to questions.

According to the complaint, federal loans accounted for most of the students’ debt, but ITT also extended short-term loans to students. When student borrowers were unable to repay, ITT steered them to expensive, private loans that they were unable to afford. The loans had high interest rates and high default rates.

The AG’s complaint seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief and restitution, including the return of tuition and fees to eligible students targeted by ITT’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices to enroll in the Computer Network Systems program.

The case against ITT is the most recent in a series of actions that AG Healey has taken against predatory for-profit schools. The AG’s Office is currently in litigation with for-profit schools Corinthian Colleges and American Career Institute for alleged unfair and deceptive practices. The AG’s Office reached settlements worth more than $6 million with four additional for-profit schools in Massachusetts – Kaplan Career Institute, Lincoln Tech, Sullivan &amp; Cogliano and Salter College. In February, the AG’s Office sued an unlicensed for-profit nursing school operating in the Boston area for misrepresenting its training program and targeting students from the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

In November, AG Healey announced action against student debt relief companies and the launch of a Student Loan Assistance Unit to assist borrowers who are having trouble paying their student loans. Students looking for more information or assistance should visit the AG’s Student Lending Assistance page or call the Student Loan Assistance Unit Hotline at 1-888-830-6277.

This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Lydia French, Division Chief Glenn Kaplan, Legal Analysts Diana Hooley, David Lim, John-Michael Partesotti, and Jenna Snow, and Division staff member Michael Beaulieu, all of the Attorney General’s Insurance and Financial Services Division, as well as Investigator Kristen Salera.

Essays: 

I don't know. Some creativity in some of them, but I suppose I can fairly solidly say they were bad, or at least the majority of them were. Even though I poured my heart and soul into my Cornell supplement, I looked at a rejection the other day, and my main Common App essay was painstakingly crafted. However, I don't really see other things that could have been the real weak point, even though my extracurriculars aren't great, I thought the way that I structured my essays could help with that. I had a LOT of feedback on them from peers and teachers, and was told they were great, but it seems like they kind have missed the mark.

Thoughts: 

I really was hoping to get into a private school, and I tried extremely hard during app season to get write essays that'd get me into one. Unfortunately, it didn't pan out, and all of the private schools I applied to rejected me. I'm satisfied going to Berkeley, and it was my original dream school, but my girlfriend got waitlisted there and my best friend got into stanford and will be attending there instead of berkeley, so it seems like I'll be going at it alone, which dulls a little bit of my happiness. I don't want to sound entitled, because I think berkeley is an amazing school, and I'm honored to have been accepted, but I put a lot of work into trying to craft a good application and to see every single common app school reject me was just a sad event. Even making sure I got solid A's on all of my midyear grades, pulling all-nighters to balance the 5 APs and the 2 DE classes that I'm taking this year, was for naught. None of the schools that I was accepted to care about midyear grades. I did learn things about myself and about life through this process, and I'm glad I did exert the effort to succeed during the first semester and to craft my applications, but seeing all that effort mean literally nothing is a little bit disheartening. 

I'm assuming I'll get a bunch of people telling me about how amazing Berkeley is as a school and I shouldn't let it bring me even the tiniest twinge of sadness, and you're absolutely correct, but that's not really my point. The rejections sting, and adversity is only ever interpreted contextually, so comparing what I was hoping for to the reality of the situation is a little bit upsetting.

If I have any advice for current Juniors reading my post, it's that you should work on your essays primarily over summer and have them all completed for the most part, then get critique over the course of the months leading up to deadlines. Also, don't be afraid to not use an essay, even if you've worked on it for 30 hours, if you have an idea that seems more creative and more fitting. And, after you've written your essays, gotten critique, and been satisfied with them, submit your applications and stop worrying about it. 

There's so much in this process that's unpredictable, the best thing to do is just ride it out and try to occupy your mind with other things after the applications are submitted. People can say that undergrad doesn't matter, and while it's somewhat true, what's most true is that it's useless to concern yourself with that that is unchangeable. I wish I could be at MIT this fall, but I'm not going to MIT. I'm going to an amazing public school. It might not be exactly what I want, and I'm looking at 6 (basically 7) rejection letters, which is definitely not what I want, but I won't worry about it anymore. This post is my way of reaching a sense of finality with my decisions, understanding that sometimes life doesn't work out the way I'd hope it would, but that everything is still fine regardless. I've been happy at my low-income public charter school I've attended, or at least somewhat happy some of the time, so it's fair to say I'll be significantly more happy at an amazing public university that's better than my highschool in almost every way. And, really, putting aside my goals for success, what I want is to be happy. I won't let rejection letters limit my happiness. I won't give the schools that didn't like me that power over me.

After all this, I can say that I'm truly excited about Cal, and I'll see all my fellow Golden Bears there on Cal Day!! Thanks for helping me out on here and on /r/applyingtocollege throughout this process, you all have been amazing! I'm glad I got to ride through this insanity with the help of all of you nice folk on here."

“These students were exploited and pressured to enroll with the promise of great careers and high salaries, but were instead left unable to repay their loans and support their families,” AG Healey said. “Our office has a history of going after predatory for-profit schools and will not stand for students in Massachusetts being treated simply as a source of income. We will continue to investigate and act against these deceptive practices and work hard to get the relief these students deserve.”

ITT’s two campuses in Massachusetts offer a variety of technology-related associate degree and bachelor degree programs. The Computer Network Systems program is the largest program at each campus, with enrollments exceeding 100 students per campus annually.

ITT’s admissions representatives allegedly told prospective students that anywhere from 80 percent to 100 percent of graduates obtained jobs in or related to their field of study. Real placement rates were actually 50 percent or less at each campus. ITT did not disclose that its placement rates included graduates with jobs outside their field of study and graduates with internships or short-term, unsustainable jobs who never received permanent, sustainable employment – including any job that somehow involved the use of a computer. ITT claimed that jobs simply selling computers at big box stores counted as placements, and even counted a graduate as placed who provided customer service for an airline checking travelers into their flights.

ITT’s recruitment strategy included soliciting prospective students in Massachusetts through advertisements, its website, direct phone calls and in-person communications. Former admissions representatives were allegedly expected to call up to 100 prospective students per day and were publicly shamed or fired if they failed to meet their quotas. Students were allegedly persuaded to visit a campus as soon as possible, where they were encouraged to apply, take an admissions exam, and complete a financial aid pre-appointment that same day. Admissions representatives pressured prospective students to enroll regardless of whether they were likely to succeed in the program.

ITT also advertised and promoted hands-on training and personalized attention through its program, but students said their experience involved the use of outdated technology, absent teachers, or being told to “Google” the answers to questions.

According to the complaint, federal loans accounted for most of the students’ debt, but ITT also extended short-term loans to students. When student borrowers were unable to repay, ITT steered them to expensive, private loans that they were unable to afford. The loans had high interest rates and high default rates.

The AG’s complaint seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief and restitution, including the return of tuition and fees to eligible students targeted by ITT’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices to enroll in the Computer Network Systems program.

The case against ITT is the most recent in a series of actions that AG Healey has taken against predatory for-profit schools. The AG’s Office is currently in litigation with for-profit schools Corinthian Colleges and American Career Institute for alleged unfair and deceptive practices. The AG’s Office reached settlements worth more than $6 million with four additional for-profit schools in Massachusetts – Kaplan Career Institute, Lincoln Tech, Sullivan &amp; Cogliano and Salter College. In February, the AG’s Office sued an unlicensed for-profit nursing school operating in the Boston area for misrepresenting its training program and targeting students from the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

In November, AG Healey announced action against student debt relief companies and the launch of a Student Loan Assistance Unit to assist borrowers who are having trouble paying their student loans. Students looking for more information or assistance should visit the AG’s Student Lending Assistance page or call the Student Loan Assistance Unit Hotline at 1-888-830-6277.

This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Lydia French, Division Chief Glenn Kaplan, Legal Analysts Diana Hooley, David Lim, John-Michael Partesotti, and Jenna Snow, and Division staff member Michael Beaulieu, all of the Attorney General’s Insurance and Financial Services Division, as well as Investigator Kristen Salera.

4dfh6w,10,2016-04-05,first year CS major help,csquestion12321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dfh6w/first_year_cs_major_help/,"Its 4am and I'm contemplating life/super stressed so im just typing whatever pops into my head right now (sorry this is gonna be a mess).

Hi I'm 18 y/o and a 2nd semester freshman at uni.
just some random concerns i've had so far... (idk where im going with this)

I've pretty much screwed around in since my last few years of highschool (where I completely senioritis'd APCS) and my first semester of college. I took a basic Java course during my first semester at uni, and really found myself uninterested/unmotivated to do the labs/projects. I barely got by in the course and chose not to take the proceeding CS course the next semester. I didn't look into any internships because I felt i didn't have many technical skills other than basic java and I was a first year. Basically, I had an epiphany and realized that i should probably start taking college seriously, but i feel like I'm a bit behind. Now its almost summer time, and apart from working full time to pay next semesters tuition, what should i do to catch myself up with everyone else? (assuming I want to continue down the CS path)

TLDR;  I fucked up and learned nothing about CS so far in college. What coding languages/opportunities should i learn/find this summer to catch up to other ""second year"" CS majors?

Also is it normal for first year CS majors to feel completely useless? We have these coding labs and problems that we do in our courses, but how does all that translate to ""real"" cs work?

thanks :)

4dgps1,61,2016-04-05,My sincere thanks,[deleted],fbhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/fbhw/comments/4dgps1/my_sincere_thanks/,"I didn't want to make this TOO long but I would be remiss if I didn't leave a few words here. (Sorry)

I interned with FBHW from January 2010 through June and forced my hand into part time work at the station to be around the guys still. In January of 2012, I officially started as best-of host. What isn't public knowledge is how I stayed there. Toward the end of the internship, Gregg made a call on my behalf and request to another radio company in town and got me an interview to be a part time board op across the street. I received a call offering me a job with that but had second thoughts. I walked into the office and told Gregg I got offered a job. He was happy for me but I couldn't shake the idea that I didn't want to leave. I liked, knew and enjoyed my time at Townsquare Media GR. Gregg took it upon himself to walk into JT's (program director at the time) office. He called me over a minute later and just like that I had a job. The man went out of my way to help me stick around. The loyalty he showed to a former intern is unbelievable to me. I can never thank him and the entire crew enough for that chance.

A listener forwarded me an e-mail during a conversation with the show about something and somehow I got brought up. There was a response implying I had a good chance of making it in radio and had some talent. That was hard for me to believe then and even now to a degree. I still have that e-mail.

I sent a note of congratulations and hearty thanks when they hosted The Dan Patrick Show. I received a note that may have kept me in the business and kept me from not giving up telling me if I stuck to it, it could be me in that chair. I still have that e-mail.

I board opped for a while, blogged for the digital side for a while until coming on board with FBHW full time. My interactions with the show, the guys and everyone there will be cherished memories for me forever. They 100% gave me an opportunity when they had no reason to. They trusted me with their entire network of stations when they were on a live broadcast. They trust me with their syndicated Saturday show for the past 4+ years. They never had a reason to do that outside of blind faith and seeing something in me that I really didn't think.

Part of that crew was Eric. As I posted on here, I was affected when Eric was let go from the show. As I said, it felt weird to shed tears about a radio show. I reached out a few times to Eric to send him my thanks for helping me along the way and asking how he was. That progressed to where we are now. I won't give all the details of how this thing went down (we'll save that for our show!) but just know how insanely lucky I am and privileged to have this chance. It is weird going up against the old show but there is no reason it will be acrimonious or spiteful at all. I have all the respect and love in the world for everything the guys did for me there. This is just an opportunity for me I cannot say no to. This is my chance in radio, my one chance. I could never imagine being a co-host with a proven talent who wants me by his side. We cannot wait to get this thing going and show everyone what we have in store for listeners!

I spoke with the show regarding my departure and they were beyond gracious, as they have all been since day 1 of my internship there. I don't know how many would be as encouraging as they were to somebody leaving their own show to start up at a competitor across the street. They wished me nothing but well and are very excited for me.

I will miss working with the boys. I hope myself and u/steve_fbhw will still be able to hang out. Things will be different but I will always have a huge gratitude for everything they did for me.

It's just time for my next adventure.

Thank you for everything. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

ITT also advertised and promoted hands-on training and personalized attention through its program, but students said their experience involved the use of outdated technology, absent teachers, or being told to “Google” the answers to questions.

According to the complaint, federal loans accounted for most of the students’ debt, but ITT also extended short-term loans to students. When student borrowers were unable to repay, ITT steered them to expensive, private loans that they were unable to afford. The loans had high interest rates and high default rates.

The AG’s complaint seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief and restitution, including the return of tuition and fees to eligible students targeted by ITT’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices to enroll in the Computer Network Systems program.

The case against ITT is the most recent in a series of actions that AG Healey has taken against predatory for-profit schools. The AG’s Office is currently in litigation with for-profit schools Corinthian Colleges and American Career Institute for alleged unfair and deceptive practices. The AG’s Office reached settlements worth more than $6 million with four additional for-profit schools in Massachusetts – Kaplan Career Institute, Lincoln Tech, Sullivan &amp; Cogliano and Salter College. In February, the AG’s Office sued an unlicensed for-profit nursing school operating in the Boston area for misrepresenting its training program and targeting students from the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

In November, AG Healey announced action against student debt relief companies and the launch of a Student Loan Assistance Unit to assist borrowers who are having trouble paying their student loans. Students looking for more information or assistance should visit the AG’s Student Lending Assistance page or call the Student Loan Assistance Unit Hotline at 1-888-830-6277.

This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Lydia French, Division Chief Glenn Kaplan, Legal Analysts Diana Hooley, David Lim, John-Michael Partesotti, and Jenna Snow, and Division staff member Michael Beaulieu, all of the Attorney General’s Insurance and Financial Services Division, as well as Investigator Kristen Salera.

BOSTON – A for-profit school with locations in Norwood and Wilmington has been sued for engaging in unfair and harassing sales tactics and misleading students about the quality of its Computer Network Systems program, and the success of the program’s graduates in finding jobs, Attorney General Maura Healey announced today.

The complaint, filed Thursday against ITT Educational Services, Inc. in Norfolk Superior Court, alleges that from 2010 through at least May 2013, ITT aggressively enrolled students in the Computer Network Systems program based on misleading information.

“These students were exploited and pressured to enroll with the promise of great careers and high salaries, but were instead left unable to repay their loans and support their families,” AG Healey said. “Our office has a history of going after predatory for-profit schools and will not stand for students in Massachusetts being treated simply as a source of income. We will continue to investigate and act against these deceptive practices and work hard to get the relief these students deserve.”

ITT’s two campuses in Massachusetts offer a variety of technology-related associate degree and bachelor degree programs. The Computer Network Systems program is the largest program at each campus, with enrollments exceeding 100 students per campus annually.

ITT’s admissions representatives allegedly told prospective students that anywhere from 80 percent to 100 percent of graduates obtained jobs in or related to their field of study. Real placement rates were actually 50 percent or less at each campus. ITT did not disclose that its placement rates included graduates with jobs outside their field of study and graduates with internships or short-term, unsustainable jobs who never received permanent, sustainable employment – including any job that somehow involved the use of a computer. ITT claimed that jobs simply selling computers at big box stores counted as placements, and even counted a graduate as placed who provided customer service for an airline checking travelers into their flights.

ITT’s recruitment strategy included soliciting prospective students in Massachusetts through advertisements, its website, direct phone calls and in-person communications. Former admissions representatives were allegedly expected to call up to 100 prospective students per day and were publicly shamed or fired if they failed to meet their quotas. Students were allegedly persuaded to visit a campus as soon as possible, where they were encouraged to apply, take an admissions exam, and complete a financial aid pre-appointment that same day. Admissions representatives pressured prospective students to enroll regardless of whether they were likely to succeed in the program.

ITT also advertised and promoted hands-on training and personalized attention through its program, but students said their experience involved the use of outdated technology, absent teachers, or being told to “Google” the answers to questions.

According to the complaint, federal loans accounted for most of the students’ debt, but ITT also extended short-term loans to students. When student borrowers were unable to repay, ITT steered them to expensive, private loans that they were unable to afford. The loans had high interest rates and high default rates.

4dgyj6,6,2016-04-05,My boyfriend [23M] of 2.5 years just told me [22F] that he kissed another girl while we are temporarily long distance. We now have 2 months to re-work our entire futures.,ughfuckmethrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dgyj6/my_boyfriend_23m_of_25_years_just_told_me_22f/,"(Throwaway, long story, sorry, blah blah blah. Posted a couple hours ago but was mistakenly taken down.) Backstory: My boyfriend and I met in college and dated consistently for junior and senior years. We spent the summer together after I graduated (he still had one more semester in college) having the most fun we had ever had together, and we decided to stay together despite him staying in school and me moving away for an internship. That was in August. At the time I brought up my feelings about how I thought he should have some time to himself in college, since we had been together for so long and we are both adventurous people so the timing made sense to me, but he decided we made more sense together so we began dating long distance (first it was just 3 hours away, then I relocated so it's been more like 7). We've always had our own lives and our own friends, and I love that about us.

We always made a point to talk on the phone every few days, text/chat constantly, visit alternating weekends when possible, do only fun things together when we saw each other, etc. Our agreement from the start had been that if at any point it stopped feeling fun for either of us, we would say something and move on. I've been burnt by shitty relationships in the past so I've lost a lot of patience for games. He's a pretty logical guy when he wants to be, so this made sense for him too. We have always had a ton of fun together, and he's agreed that literally every visit has been awesome and felt like a vacation, and that he feels great talking to me.

He really is my best friend, and being with him has been so much more fulfilling than I could have ever imagined a relationship being. We always make a point to talk about our relationship as an affirmative thing -- we are constantly agreeing to be with each other through our actions. I have not felt, personally, like being in a LDR has detracted from my own ""real"" life in the least, and I don't resent the distance at all because he's literally the best match for me I could have ever imagined.

He graduated in December (after 3 months of distance) and has since been working his own internship near our college town for this semester, before he wants to move on to a real job. We still remained long distance after that move because it didn't really change much for us logistically, so now it's been around 8 months that we've been on this every-other-weekend schedule of seeing each other.

It is wearing on us, but I think we were doing fine with it, aside from the usual missing each other stuff. None of that felt resentful. At the end of this semester, we had vague plans to move somewhere new together to live together for the first time and finally enter adulthood together if we both got jobs we wanted in the same place. I had been nagging him a little about applying for jobs in the same cities, but I also haven't secured a job yet for that time either so he's not all to blame.

Last week, he went out with a mutual friend and her friend who he had never met before. This is normal, we both have our own lives and tend to be only jokingly jealous about who the other hangs out with of the same sex. This was last Tuesday. I know now that he kissed the other girl, who he had just met that night, when she gave him a ride home. He then added her on Facebook and has also been texting her throughout the week. Again, this is the first incident after around 8 months of long distance, just two months before we were planning to hopefully move in together.

He brought this up to me last night, only after he started bringing up his own fears about being too curious for his own good while we were apart last week and hinting at having some serious doubts, which I had been talking him through all week. I know now that he only brought these up the day after he kissed her. We spent so much emotional time throughout the week discussing where we stand on issues and hypotheticals about the future, where we stand on issues that would of course be relevant to talk about before we move in together. I was a little peeved because I had made a point to talk about these issues before, and felt like his answers were changing at an inconvenient time, but both of our answers made sense and our conclusions kept being the same.

He still sounded hesitant to accept that the conversation was over at any point when we agreed, and like he had some other issue looming, but never anything like this.
At no point last week did he bring up this incident, or even the possibility of that type of situation in our hypothetical talk. We've always been super realistic about things like this and have basically in the past said that if either of us feel like we are falling for someone else, it's our responsibility to end it right then and there. He didn't fall for this girl exactly, but it also isn't like he was drunk and it was a mistake. It also isn't like he felt so overwhelmed with the action that he called me that night. And then he's been talking to her all week. He did not tell her he has a girlfriend, although the mutual friend of ours of course knows.

I am basically the only girl he has been with, and this has come up in our conversations about our future and we've always been really reasonable about it. We considered opening our relationship up to new partners at one point during our long-distance portion but we never got to the point that we felt we needed to do so or wanted to discuss it in real terms, because we were both busy enough with life and work and one relationship. So this was of course something he started bringing up again recently, and it definitely made sense to me as moving in together would be a big deal in those terms. But previously we had kind of come to the agreement that if he did indeed want to see other people, graduate school (a year from May) would be the time to assess our situation and think about opening it up / taking a break. So it's not like this was a miscommunication.

It's not just that he did it, or that he lied to me. It's that he did it, lied to me blatantly for a week (reassuring me nothing was up, saying at one point something like ""I know you worry about that sometimes and I promise I haven't done anything with anyone else""), talked to his parents and his best friend about it, went to visit friends for the weekend rather than making time to talk on the phone about it, and all the while tried to talk out my thoughts and feelings on what turned out to be imaginary issues -- then didn't even have the sense to come at me using those answers I had given to make any sort of case for himself.

He seems creepily detached from the situation, and like he doesn't know how I'm going to react to each thing I say (despite the fact that we are best friends and know everything about each other). He doesn't know what he wants. I didn't want to give him an ultimatum, but I also feel like a sucker if I take him back like nothing happened.
Throughout the course of our phone call last night, his conclusions ranged from : we should break up, I don't deserve him, we should take a break for the time that we are still apart and then move in together, we should stay together and act like nothing happened, he should date this new girl instead, etc ... eventually I told him I have zero patience for a dude who could lie to me for a week and still doesn't know what he wants after all that time to reflect.

I should note that once before, when we spent a spring break apart in college, he ""met"" a girl on tinder while visiting a friend in another state (I knew he had tinder downloaded, like I said -- we were casual, and trusted each other enough to know it was only for fun) and went on to text her secretly for a month or so, only bringing it up after I saw her name on his snapchat best friends list (lol). That was a big deal when it came to our trust, but it never felt like actual cheating because he had never met her. Our conclusion with that was that he acted on some stupid feelings because he was considering our future and thought we might get married, and then felt trapped.

We had never talked about marriage before. So obviously, he does this thing where he lets his emotions build up sometimes and comes to irrational conclusions. I don't think this instance was a case like that, but I do think he was trying to make me think it was by bringing it up only after he laid a foundation for his doubts. But I know now those doubts didn't really exist before he did this, and that I was doing a good job so far of addressing those doubts all along with our monthly check ins about the relationship. Up until the point that he did this, our relationship had remained a great, fun, loving, caring, affirmative decision, and we wanted to spend our lives together for at least one more year.

What the fuck do I do? I'm so hurt about how he has handled this whole situation, and it breaks my heart to know that this guy who is/was my best friend, who talked about everything with me all the time, had the capacity not only to casually cheat on me, but lie to my face about it for a week. That's not any basis to build another year on, especially if we live together, but neither of us can get over the fact that this is the very best relationship that we've ever heard of anyone having. We constantly validate and affirm each other, and love each other so deeply. We've had so many amazing times together and now neither of us understand why he could/would just throw that all away so quickly and effortlessly, and then not know what he wants.

**tl;dr: Most trusting, loving, fulfilling relationship of my life was sabotaged despite my best efforts while we were long distance. Now he won't tell me what he wants. We have to decide what to do with our lives in the next two months, before our internships end and we both move somewhere new.**"

To sum it up, I've only started programming 1.5 years ago and have taken not too many CS courses. I've completed the intro to Java courses, object oriented design, and data structures and algorithms. I haven't done much programming in my free time since I wasn't so sure about CS in the first place. I also have no retained much from the courses. 

I'm don't have much interest in programming, but I am looking to find something that I can do. I've only recently smartened up and began reviewing my prior courses and started doing treehouse courses in Android and web development. I've completed one class project, and have no outside project that I've done in my free time. This leaves me with not much to put on my resume, but I am still looking for an internship to gain more experience and knowledge about programming in the industry. 

I've read posts for a few weeks and saw that QA is a good place to start for an internship. I don't believe I have the skill set to reach for a entry level software developer. If I do not get an internship, it seems, from reading posts, that I should work on a program or something over the summer to show off my programming competency. Is my line of thinking correct? Anything else that I am missing? I am looking to get back on track so any advice is much appreciated. "

I want to study in a business school for undergrad and these are my top three choices at this point. 

WashU has an amazing community/environment. I was there for a scholarship weekend and everyone was so kind. I honestly love it there. I also will be getting some scholarship money, which is a plus. Cost of attendance isn't an issue for my family though so it's mostly just the fact that I already am so close to a group of friends there that are so talented and amazing... I really would love to spend the next four years of my life with them/at WashU. The major problem I have with WashU is that it is not well known, which could put me in a bad position after graduation when I'm looking for jobs. Also during college, when I'm trying to find internships and stuff I feel like the connections/opportunities at WashU wouldn't be as strong as some of the other schools I've gotten into. Also, their business school isn't as highly ranked - they seem to be known mostly for premed. 

NYU also accepted me to Stern, which is SO GOOD for business. I do want to go into finance, so the job opportunities and internships there are wonderful for my future career. I definitely don't want to stay in the midwest after graduation, and apparently 57% of graduates stay in the midwestern area after graduation from WashU. Also, NYU is in the vibrant city of New York! I feel like you can't go wrong with that... However, I don't really like the campus feel - I want more of a traditional college campus... 

I also got into Berkeley (in state) and it's a really good choice I guess but I just don't like it. I know the type of kid that goes to Berkeley, and I really don't want to spend four years of my life with kids like that. The competitiveness/the asianness (i'm asian and I've spent my whole life around other asians. I want to branch out and explore! meet new people!) Also, it's too close to home. I want to be in a different environment! However, the business school is TOP RANKED, and it's near silicon valley which has amazing job opportunities, and I would have a much higher chance of getting a job on the west coast, which I think is ultimately what I want.  But I feel like going to Berk is such a typical choice, like everyone I know that does decently well in high school ends up at Berkeley. I kind of want to go somewhere else; take a risk for once in my life! 

Sorry for the long post, and thanks in advance for your advice. I really appreciate it! "

BOSTON – A for-profit school with locations in Norwood and Wilmington has been sued for engaging in unfair and harassing sales tactics and misleading students about the quality of its Computer Network Systems program, and the success of the program’s graduates in finding jobs, Attorney General Maura Healey announced today.

The complaint, filed Thursday against ITT Educational Services, Inc. in Norfolk Superior Court, alleges that from 2010 through at least May 2013, ITT aggressively enrolled students in the Computer Network Systems program based on misleading information.

“These students were exploited and pressured to enroll with the promise of great careers and high salaries, but were instead left unable to repay their loans and support their families,” AG Healey said. “Our office has a history of going after predatory for-profit schools and will not stand for students in Massachusetts being treated simply as a source of income. We will continue to investigate and act against these deceptive practices and work hard to get the relief these students deserve.”

ITT’s two campuses in Massachusetts offer a variety of technology-related associate degree and bachelor degree programs. The Computer Network Systems program is the largest program at each campus, with enrollments exceeding 100 students per campus annually.

ITT’s admissions representatives allegedly told prospective students that anywhere from 80 percent to 100 percent of graduates obtained jobs in or related to their field of study. Real placement rates were actually 50 percent or less at each campus. ITT did not disclose that its placement rates included graduates with jobs outside their field of study and graduates with internships or short-term, unsustainable jobs who never received permanent, sustainable employment – including any job that somehow involved the use of a computer. ITT claimed that jobs simply selling computers at big box stores counted as placements, and even counted a graduate as placed who provided customer service for an airline checking travelers into their flights.

ITT’s recruitment strategy included soliciting prospective students in Massachusetts through advertisements, its website, direct phone calls and in-person communications. Former admissions representatives were allegedly expected to call up to 100 prospective students per day and were publicly shamed or fired if they failed to meet their quotas. Students were allegedly persuaded to visit a campus as soon as possible, where they were encouraged to apply, take an admissions exam, and complete a financial aid pre-appointment that same day. Admissions representatives pressured prospective students to enroll regardless of whether they were likely to succeed in the program.

ITT also advertised and promoted hands-on training and personalized attention through its program, but students said their experience involved the use of outdated technology, absent teachers, or being told to “Google” the answers to questions.

According to the complaint, federal loans accounted for most of the students’ debt, but ITT also extended short-term loans to students. When student borrowers were unable to repay, ITT steered them to expensive, private loans that they were unable to afford. The loans had high interest rates and high default rates.

The AG’s complaint seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief and restitution, including the return of tuition and fees to eligible students targeted by ITT’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices to enroll in the Computer Network Systems program.

The case against ITT is the most recent in a series of actions that AG Healey has taken against predatory for-profit schools. The AG’s Office is currently in litigation with for-profit schools Corinthian Colleges and American Career Institute for alleged unfair and deceptive practices. The AG’s Office reached settlements worth more than $6 million with four additional for-profit schools in Massachusetts – Kaplan Career Institute, Lincoln Tech, Sullivan &amp; Cogliano and Salter College. In February, the AG’s Office sued an unlicensed for-profit nursing school operating in the Boston area for misrepresenting its training program and targeting students from the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

In November, AG Healey announced action against student debt relief companies and the launch of a Student Loan Assistance Unit to assist borrowers who are having trouble paying their student loans. Students looking for more information or assistance should visit the AG’s Student Lending Assistance page or call the Student Loan Assistance Unit Hotline at 1-888-830-6277.

This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Lydia French, Division Chief Glenn Kaplan, Legal Analysts Diana Hooley, David Lim, John-Michael Partesotti, and Jenna Snow, and Division staff member Michael Beaulieu, all of the Attorney General’s Insurance and Financial Services Division, as well as Investigator Kristen Salera.

I am casting for a one act political comedy called ""Politically Challanged"" it's about four campaign staffers who must work together to save a candidate from self-destruction after he makes some offensive comments during a speech.

I have 2 parts that need to be cast, and am having auditions in Studio City this Saturday April 9th. The two roles still available are as follows:

RANDY CARVER - (male/female any ethnicity, 18-23) A college intern working on the campaign as part of an extra credit project. S/he is the social media staffer and helps inform the staffers of what's happening outside the office walls. Often cracking jokes and not taking anything too seriously s/he is still a valued member of the team.

MADISON PIKE - (female, Caucasian, 32-60) The campaign coordinator and a veteran of politics whose father is a former senator. Deciding to work behind the scenes she is a no nonsense and blunt coordinator who wants victory for her candidate regardless of actions. She is however not without her principles and works hard to keep the campaign as focused as it is effective. 


If anyone is interested in auditioning for these parts please message me or reply here. The play will preform at the Complex Theater on June 11th, 17th, 19th &amp; 25th. All cast will receive a cut of box office sales.

Hope to hear from ya'll soon!"

It is in Hayes Valley near Ivy Street, large bedroom with a king bed and private bathroom in a pretty luxurious looking apartment (w/ doorman and roof deck). The kitchen and living room are shared.

The location is 2 blocks from groceries and a gym and a 17 minute walk to my internship in SoMa. I would be charged $2350/month for each of the two months I'll be there.

Does this seem reasonable? It seems like it is hard to be under $2000 and have your own bathroom and whatnot in mission/hayes/castro/SoMa, so based on what I've seen it seems ok.

I quit because I knew I would be drug tested for an internship, but I just discovered that this internship randomly drug tests, so my plan for this being a t-break is turning into quitting. My friends keep saying to me ""it won't be forever, most jobs don't actually randomly drug test after your first one, you can smoke after the internship"" and things like that. However, I'm starting to notice that something needs to change. I am on day 72 right now, but I might as well be on day 14. The only thing that has gotten me through the past 72 days was knowing that somewhere on the other end, I'd have a good internship and be able to smoke bud. However, that wasn't the most healthy way to go about this. The first reason why is because now that I think about it, I'll have more internships for the rest of college that will probably also drug test, and then after college I need to actually have a career. Also, I spent the past 72 days looking forward to the next time I can light up. I've realized that I don't remember how to be happy without weed (or the thought of smoking it soon), and it may have taken more of a toll in my life than I thought it would. I liked smoking so much because it was a social lubricant for me (and I have social anxiety so this is important), and because it allowed me to forget some of the problems in my life. If my friends ditched plans with me but I had some bud, I wouldn't care about a Friday night alone. When that happened to me the other night, I was so upset. And that is when I realized that weed didn't make my life better by actually making things better, it made my life better by masking all of the problems in my life and making me think they were gone. I am trying to figure out how to move on with my life and enjoy myself without weed again, even though literally all of my friends still smoke bud every day. "

I just smoke weed and stopped 4 days ago and i have roughly a month before the test.

So i already went on a binge reading about every different way i could pass this test, detox shampoo, bleaching your hair, getting your hair stripped at a salon, vinegar, and yes shaving everything off.

but i had an idea that i dont know will work but in my head it makes sense, please tell me if this is a crazy theory and im screwed or not.

so a hair test kind of relies on the premise that hair grows at a rate of roughly .25 inches a week. And everything I've read online is that once you detox your body and don't smoke anymore there shouldn't be any more traces of the weed going to my hair. So if i detox and am able to stimulate hair growth (im just looking on youtube and seeing 1000's of girls showing me how to grow 2-4 inches in a week with a lot of thumbs up) should that work? or am i screwed?

And i have no idea about this, but under alot of the hair detox products theres this statement ""Due to revised testing standards lowering the cut-off to 0.1ng on hair tests, this product is no longer guaranteed by xxx"" are these .1ng tests wide spread? 

any help would be appreciated, thanks!"

I have applied to around 30 internships online (a week ago) and i got 2 phone calls that went pretty good until they found out that i am available only for 3 months. Most of the offers are for ~web-devs, from startup companies and they are looking for a student that can intern for 6 months available for hire afterwards.

I also talked with one of my teachers and he offered me the chance to do an unpaid internship at my university in a research lab, i will be working with him, developing a project in Clojure. The thing is that i'm studying at a top university here in Europe and i'm burned out and this project isn't how i see myself spending 2 months of my summer.

I don't know if i should accept this internship if i don't get any offers or just use the summer to get some rest and learn the things that i never have the time to learn during my school year.

(Reading on system-developing, learning a scripting language [Ruby most-likely], learning LibGDX, continuing my compilation project etc)

I am trying to figure out what is the best thing for me here ...

4dipqz,5,2016-04-05,Help - what *should* I expect to spend on rent?,Bandit_Bunny,capetown,https://www.reddit.com/r/capetown/comments/4dipqz/help_what_should_i_expect_to_spend_on_rent/,"Hello all, I am a graduate student from Columbia University in New York city coming down to Cape Town to do an internship during my summer term (your winter). I'll be there essentially from June 1st through about August 27th or 28th, so about 3 months total. 

I've been looking on AirBnB for places, and so far I've found a lot of good options in the 9,500 to 11,500 price range, which upon conversion to my USD seems perfectly reasonable compared to what I spend on rent in NYC. However, I'm guessing that's a little higher than what folks in Cape Town would usually spend. 

Can anyone tell me what I *should* be expecting to spend? I'd like a place with a roommate or two, but with a lock on the bedroom door so that I'll know my stuff is safe and secure while I'm at work doing my internship. In terms of neighborhood I've heard that I should try to stay in the Tamboerskloof, Gardens, Greenpoint, Oranjezicht, Vredehoek, or City Bowl neighborhoods. What would be your advice in this regard? Any help will be greatly appreciated!"
4dipwe,1,2016-04-05,ITT Tech Sued for Deceiving Students About its Computer Network Systems Program and Success in Finding Jobs,ShaunaDorothy,AnythingGoesDiscuss,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesDiscuss/comments/4dipwe/itt_tech_sued_for_deceiving_students_about_its/,"http://boston.indymedia.org/newswire/display/223865/index.php Massachusetts AG Healey Seeking Restitution for Students and Penalties against For-Profit School

BOSTON – A for-profit school with locations in Norwood and Wilmington has been sued for engaging in unfair and harassing sales tactics and misleading students about the quality of its Computer Network Systems program, and the success of the program’s graduates in finding jobs, Attorney General Maura Healey announced today.

The complaint, filed Thursday against ITT Educational Services, Inc. in Norfolk Superior Court, alleges that from 2010 through at least May 2013, ITT aggressively enrolled students in the Computer Network Systems program based on misleading information.

“These students were exploited and pressured to enroll with the promise of great careers and high salaries, but were instead left unable to repay their loans and support their families,” AG Healey said. “Our office has a history of going after predatory for-profit schools and will not stand for students in Massachusetts being treated simply as a source of income. We will continue to investigate and act against these deceptive practices and work hard to get the relief these students deserve.”

ITT’s two campuses in Massachusetts offer a variety of technology-related associate degree and bachelor degree programs. The Computer Network Systems program is the largest program at each campus, with enrollments exceeding 100 students per campus annually.

ITT’s admissions representatives allegedly told prospective students that anywhere from 80 percent to 100 percent of graduates obtained jobs in or related to their field of study. Real placement rates were actually 50 percent or less at each campus. ITT did not disclose that its placement rates included graduates with jobs outside their field of study and graduates with internships or short-term, unsustainable jobs who never received permanent, sustainable employment – including any job that somehow involved the use of a computer. ITT claimed that jobs simply selling computers at big box stores counted as placements, and even counted a graduate as placed who provided customer service for an airline checking travelers into their flights.

ITT’s recruitment strategy included soliciting prospective students in Massachusetts through advertisements, its website, direct phone calls and in-person communications. Former admissions representatives were allegedly expected to call up to 100 prospective students per day and were publicly shamed or fired if they failed to meet their quotas. Students were allegedly persuaded to visit a campus as soon as possible, where they were encouraged to apply, take an admissions exam, and complete a financial aid pre-appointment that same day. Admissions representatives pressured prospective students to enroll regardless of whether they were likely to succeed in the program.

ITT also advertised and promoted hands-on training and personalized attention through its program, but students said their experience involved the use of outdated technology, absent teachers, or being told to “Google” the answers to questions.

According to the complaint, federal loans accounted for most of the students’ debt, but ITT also extended short-term loans to students. When student borrowers were unable to repay, ITT steered them to expensive, private loans that they were unable to afford. The loans had high interest rates and high default rates.

The AG’s complaint seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief and restitution, including the return of tuition and fees to eligible students targeted by ITT’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices to enroll in the Computer Network Systems program.

The case against ITT is the most recent in a series of actions that AG Healey has taken against predatory for-profit schools. The AG’s Office is currently in litigation with for-profit schools Corinthian Colleges and American Career Institute for alleged unfair and deceptive practices. The AG’s Office reached settlements worth more than $6 million with four additional for-profit schools in Massachusetts – Kaplan Career Institute, Lincoln Tech, Sullivan &amp; Cogliano and Salter College. In February, the AG’s Office sued an unlicensed for-profit nursing school operating in the Boston area for misrepresenting its training program and targeting students from the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

In November, AG Healey announced action against student debt relief companies and the launch of a Student Loan Assistance Unit to assist borrowers who are having trouble paying their student loans. Students looking for more information or assistance should visit the AG’s Student Lending Assistance page or call the Student Loan Assistance Unit Hotline at 1-888-830-6277.

This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Lydia French, Division Chief Glenn Kaplan, Legal Analysts Diana Hooley, David Lim, John-Michael Partesotti, and Jenna Snow, and Division staff member Michael Beaulieu, all of the Attorney General’s Insurance and Financial Services Division, as well as Investigator Kristen Salera.

4diu1w,6,2016-04-05,How much harder is it to land non-developer CS positions out of school?,CSStudentHatesCode,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4diu1w/how_much_harder_is_it_to_land_nondeveloper_cs/,"Hello:
I did a search but couldn't find anything directly related to my question, but I sincerely apologize if I missed anything.

I'm a sophomore CS student with a few CS courses under my belt. I have a 3.9+ GPA and did a development internship last summer and a co-op last fall at relatively respected non-tech companies. However, over the past 2 years I have realized that I strongly dislike coding.

Other people have been in my situation before and the typical advice is that they should pursue CS-related careers such as product/program management, software sales, business analysis, etc. I'm a people person and have decent business acumen so this advice makes sense for me. However, my questions have to do with the availability of these kind of jobs.

How much harder is it to land one of those ""orbiter"" positions at the companies that pay good money?

What are the ratios of developers to BA/PM/Presales people at the top companies?

Can you not be super into Hackathons/Side Projects/LeetCode etc 
and still get those kinds of jobs?

I go to a a big football state school and not a top school like MIT/Stanford/Harvard. How does this affect my chances?
Thanks in ton in advance."

I am having serious trouble with the Computer Science 1, which I'm taking this semester so I can take the foundation exam. After spending four years in school, the thought of possibly retaking this class, along with a bunch of science and math and classes I've already taken elsewhere without the credits transferring, is terrifying, as financial aid is starting to run low.

Could I switch to Software Development? I know that CS is more impressive and comprehensive, but my main goal is to get a Bachelor's so that I can work coding or web dev or something for some modest company, not trying to be a big deal in Silicon Valley or anything. I've had two internships at software companies, so I'm eager to just get out there and code for a living.
The thought of having only 21 credits left versus what amounts to half a degree is extremely appealing. Is it possible?"

Looking up, it seems that some people value industry-related internships a LOT higher than research-related ones, but is this more or less a bias, or is there a solid reason one would turn down a research internship over an industry-related one?

The research internship is also paid with a $5,000 stipend, and from what I've heard, most internships are unpaid, so would that also influence a decision over which you would pick (unpaid industry vs paid research)? 

Am I correct in assuming the topic matters as well? The area of research I'm doing is Parallel and Concurrent Programming, and the mentor I have has MANY publications and is very well renowned, so I was wondering if the person I researched under also held sway as well.

I'm not humblebragging (... okay, maybe a little) but I want to know if some people who hire would dismiss the research as being nothing. Would you?"
4dk524,0,2016-04-05,Appeal Chances?,Nasekoi,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/4dk524/appeal_chances/,"Sorry for long post:

Hey guys, unfortunately I was rejected from the College of Engineering under the biomedical engineering major. I think my low GPA is the main factor, but there were many circumstances that hindered me from being the best I could be. During the summer after my freshman year, one of my friends died due to disease, and that caused me major depression which led to declined performance throughout the year. Also, the fact that my father lost his job caused me to take on more responsibilities around the house, and thus lose time to study/pursue extracurricular, etc. In junior year, my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and this once again threw my school year into jeopardy. This situation was also one that caused me a great amount of depression, and forced me to do most of the housework. My mom's treatment, which was at UCLA Medical Center, cost a lot, and thus I had to find work in order to help my family pay for my AP Testing which again took up much time. All in all, those events in my life have caused me to mature and note the fragility in life, which caused me to choose the major of Biomedical Engineering to help people in the future. Also, the fact that my mom was treated at UCLA gave me a personal connection in that I want to give back to the school that helped her. During my senior year, my mother having successfully gone through chemotherapy and my dad finding a job allowed me to do better than before and have more time to pursue extracurriculars. I believe that my other stats are within the bounds for UCLA, and I hope that UCLA will consider me in a new context. I am also considering asking to be considered for the major of Biology within the College of Letters and Sciences because it is more related to my future goal of being a physician and is a bit less competitive.

SAT: 2130

ACT: 34

(xpost /r/depression),NothingReallyButHey,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/4dkkbs/im_having_the_best_year_of_my_life_yet_xpost/,"Late last year, I was hospitalised in a psychiatric ward for 6 weeks. I was discharged on December 31st, and was afraid and unsure of myself as I was transitioning back into the regular pace of life. 

I made the difficult decision of taking less courses at school, but still chose to work the same amount of hours as I did before. 

I made some really silly and awful mistakes the beginning of the year. They all revolved around boys and meaningless sex that resulted in me feeling dirty and replaceable. But, I am now feeling invincible. 

So far, even though it's only April, I have: 

* stopped taking my medications (with the permission of my psychiatrist). I no longer feel like I have the need for them. After 3 years of being constantly medicated, this is amazing. 

* done MUCH better in school. (I will likely end this term with 2 A's on my transcript. The first A's I've ever earned at university.) 

* found out that I'm going to have my poetry published, and will be receiving an honorarium for my work

* been asked to speak at a local high-school about mental health and recovery

* formed some really, really great relationships with new people 

* applied for an internship at the company I'm currently working for (with strong support from my store manager)

Later this month, I will be:

* attending 2 concerts

* going to a cat cafe

* meeting up with friends I haven't seen in years

* starting weekly group therapy at a hospital

I've come to the painfully vulnerable and sobering revelation that being depressed and having bipolar is no longer a prominent part of my identity. Of course, there will be moments in the future when I will feel sad, suicidal, and depressed. But now, I am opening myself up to new defining identities, and I'm excited. 

Coming from someone who first attempted suicide when they were 9, I would like to say that recovery is real, achievable, and an option for EVERYONE. 

All the best. "

This component is the main navigation menu of the application, and it's a recursive tree view, where each component instance contains a route to another component.

This component works well with few children, but in a real use case, around 300 children are recursively created. And when I click on an item of the menu to display another view, the application freezes. It seems to take a very long time to process the route, and I have timeouts.

The weird thing is that there is no problem with construction of the navigation menu itself, but it always freezes when I try to click on a route.

Age: 27
Height: 1.89m
Weight: 84kg
Nationality: German

Hey, I try to be as detailed and to write as little as possible.

Last year I did an internship in India, where I ate lots of spicy food, drank quite a bit of alcohol and lots of coffee as well, resulting -- as the doc in India said -- in ""too much acidity and gastritis"" thus he prescribed me Pantoprazol and MCP pills (I hope they are called MCP in the US as well). My symptoms were: severe nausea, burning sensation in the upper stomach area, having a lump in my throat (hope, that's the correct translation) combined with the feeling that I have to vomit, yellowish stool and a general discomfort in the stomach area. I stopped taking Pantoprazol after roughly a week because everything I ate seemed to lay for ages in my stomach and I got kind of depressed (although I am not really vulnerable for depression I think). The symptoms went away slowly after several weeks and when I was back in Germany four months later all of the symptoms were completely vanished (10/2015).

Everything regarding my stomach was fine until one and a half weeks ago (probably I have to state that my job was kind of stressful the last months). I ate one burger before going to bed, three hours later I woke up and felt an extreme nausea thus I had to vomit twice. Since then my stomach feels completely irritating (including nausea and a slightly burning sensation in my stomach). I went to see the doctor one week ago and he prescribed me again Pantoprazol and MCP pills. Since taking them I can't really see any benefit, my symptoms right now are: very upset stomach, nausea, ravenous hunger (and after eating feeling nausea again), bloating, abdominal pain and strong burping (that reduces the nausea a bit), feeling that my stomach is kind of distorted and since today a depressed feeling (something like an ""inner void""). It disturbs me that I am not able to work right now in this shape, but I badly want to go back to work but the nausea hinders me.

1) The doctor didn't really examine me but depending on my anamnesis prescribed me the medicine. Is a gastritis really likely in this case? I refused to get a gastrosocpy in India but now I am getting one on 21th of April, but still it's two weeks to go...
2) I don't think I have any clear acidity problems here in Germany. If the acidity is not an acute problem, could the Pantoprazol result in those (severe) side effects? I am quite sure that the bloating and burping could be a direct issue from Pantoprazol.

This situation really stresses me -- I am consuming only porridge, rusk, dry bread and tea since one and a half weeks and there is no sign at all that it gets better.

Thanks so much for your help and I hope that I was able to write in proper English."

4dlffu,99,2016-04-06,Birth story featuring a quick cop chase,bwab3,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/4dlffu/birth_story_featuring_a_quick_cop_chase/,"Baby 1 came at 40+6. Tldr version of her birth: went in, told I was in very early labour and was being sent home. Got strapped to monitors so an intern could see how it works and realised babys heartrate was dropping dangerously with each barely noticeable contraction. Suddenly I'm in a birthing room, on pitocin &amp; my waters were broken. She was born 5 hours later, 20 minutes after I received my epidural &amp; via forceps.


With #2 I was completely prepared to make it to my induction at 42 weeks. I had 0 labour signs before the day he was born. 

At 40+6 I started having mildly uncomfortable contractions at about 5pm. I feel my contractions in my thighs, so in hindsight I should have known this wasn't a drill and it was go time. 

At 7pm I decided to get into a bath and see if the contractions fizzle out. At this point they are  between 8-15 minutes apart and about 30 seconds long. Still not to painful and I was still not convinced I was in actual labour. 

I began timing contractions and started having to breathe through them. It was 8pm when I realised my contractions were at the magical 5-1-1and it was hospital time. 

I called my SO, he put #1 to bed with his brother and picked me up. Although my hospital was about 30 minutes away, as soon as I got in the car my contractions got bad enough that I was crying(sitting in a car seat is not an ideal labour position) SO absolutely freaked out and sped the whole way there... and straight past a cop car. On go his sirens, but because I'm moaning through contractions now SO decides they can arrest him at the hospital if need be. Luckily for us, as soon as we parked and both police men jumped out of the car and watched as I had a contraction bad enough that they decided a warning and a good luck would suffice. 

It's 830 pm by the time I'm in a birth suite and for some reason still not convinced its baby time (I told SO to leave the hospital bag in the car just incase we got sent home) my midwife gets me into a hospital gown and straps me to the monitors. 

At 9pm my midwife asks about my birth plan and I told her I want an epidural and a healthy baby. She informs me they need to do a cervical check and take some blood before they can order an epidural. 
At 930 I'm checked and blood is drawn. I was told I was 5cms and that my epidural had been ordered. 

I laboured with hope that relief was coming.I began feeling my body pushing and stupidly decide to actively try and stop it so I can get my epidural (labour logic)
 My midwife had caught on though because she was checking me during each contraction.
It was a bit after 10 when she told me this baby isnt waiting for the dr and I decided to accept my fate and push this baby out pain relief free. 

Push 1 breaks my water, push 2 births my sons head (so so weird by the way, just laying there waiting for a contraction with a head hanging out of me) and on my third push my son was born and placed on my chest! Born at 10:31, and almost 4 kilos!

Feel free to ask questions :)"

I'm working as an intern and one thing my supervisor has made me work on is a Project Metrics Tool. We have different project leaders managing various projects and I have all the data at my disposal. Project Management as a whole is very new to me and creating this tool in excel has been an uphill battle.

One of main confusion I have regarding EVM is calculating the Planned % complete and the Actual % complete. I have set up the tool on a yearly basis and I am calculating the Planned % complete based on the Budget. Now for calculating the Actual % complete, I am using the monthly actuals for now to calculate this value and it makes some sense as well (Comparing the money we have actually spent vs what we planned). But I'm not sure if I should use the Physical % completion (Values entered by the project leader based on what's happening on site) and use it to calculate other variables.

Any insight on this matter would be really helpful. If you could share any resources on this particular matter, that would be greatly appreciated as well.

Thank you!"

for people who didn't read my previous post i'm a 19 yr old uni student in australia and i've never had a job before and have been trying to find one since i finished high school. in all this time i've only ever heard back from 3 fast food places, got interviews at each and rejected each time. every time they ask about my lack of work experience at this age like it's some super suspicious horrible thing that i have to explain away and it's only gonna get worse as i get older. i didn't try to get a job in high school but honestly ever since i turned 15 i have felt like a ticking time bomb getting more and more worthless each year (bc workers up to age 21 get paid less the younger they are here) and gotten more stressed and pessimistic about my job prospects ever since i started looking, i should have just gotten a job back then, now i honestly feel like i ruined my life and i'll never be employable simply because i'm too old for fast food places which are basically the lowest starting point for part time unskilled jobs (trades aren't an option because i'm a short skinny girl). i know it's melodramatic but the more time passes the more i get stuck in this rut of feeling worthless and like my situation can only get worse, and i don't know how much longer i can stay unemployed before my self esteem gets so low that i will never have a chance at suceeding in interviews or even manage to fill out an online application without being completely overwhelmed by embarrassment at having the nerve to apply at something i'm so obviously unqualified for.

i can't even focus on my uni degree and i honestly haven't even thought about what i might do after it because i feel completely unworthy, how can i even dare to consider graduate jobs when i'm not even good enough to get hired at maccas? by this point even getting a minimum wage part time job feels so impossible to me that the idea of having any sort of ambition for an actual career is just a completely foreign concept that i can't take seriously because no employer in their right mind would ever take me seriously. i'm scared i'm gonna waste so many opportunities because i go to the top university in my country, am in an okay-ish field job prospects-wise (i think, like i said can't bring myself to research it properly) and have pretty good marks, but i'm never gonna have a chance at the graduate jobs all because i lack some kind of past employment and i'm so distracted by this i havent even thought about things like internships or networking, they just seem like some sort of bizarre fantasy concept to me. people talk and complain about sending out hundreds of personalised applications and struggling to find a graduate job within a few months, meanwhile here i am having sent out hundreds of applications over the past year to ever retail, restaurant, and fast food job i can think of and barely getting any response, i feel pathetic and humiliated and honestly the idea of having a career doesn't even register with me anymore because if i'm this hopeless at getting a minimum wage job that apparently most people can get with no effort then why even waste the mental energy that i don't have thinking about jobs that are actually competitive? it's another thing that makes me feel like time is running out because if i don't get anything before i graduate (and it gets more likely every day as i get older and have less excuse for not having a job and i get more and more pessimistic with each rejection) then i'm pretty much screwed for life, no place looking for graduates will want to risk someone who's never been employed before and no minimum wage place is going to want someone that old and inexperienced.

i did a short barista course to try and get a job at a cafe or something but everywhere wants 2+ years experience (yes i applied to all of them anyway, never heard back from a single one), i did a medical administration course that was absolute bullshit just intended to get a recruitment agency money from the government (they claimed there was a job at the end then i never heard from them again and the ""job listing"" is still open months later), i was a girl guide for ages which i keep hearing employers love but apparently they dont give a shit, plus i quit a year ago so it sounds even more pathetic to say ""i WAS a girl guide"" as the one slightly useful thing about me. i'm going to start volunteering at a cafe soon and honestly i would have started volunteering someplace earlier, i genuinely don't mind the idea of it and want to do something with my time except it feels like i'm accepting defeat - it's like the ultimate stereotype of someone who is basically unemployable, the first thing people suggest is volunteering and i feel like it's just going to be shameful to start volunteerig at a bunch of places now because it will be blatantly obvious that i'm just doing it to get a job.

i'm honestly starting to feel like i deserve all this, because i didn't work in high school while others were working from age 15 onwards and had no choice, i had the privilege of having more time to study instead and ended up being one of the top students in the year level and getting into a good uni, other students would have wanted a better uni/score but couldn't spend as much time studying due to work, i got what i wanted, to get into this uni, and i feel like i can't complain about not getting anything else even though i feel like not having a job is affecting every aspect of my life right now.

i honestly don't know what to do. i keep hearing fast food jobs are all about availability, at my mcdonald's interview the other day i told them i can work almost any hours, it was a 15 min walk from my house so i could easily and reliably get there, and in general the interview went ok (not great because as i said my self esteem keeps getting worse and its hard to really sell myself in an interview when i keep believing im a worthless piece of shit, but supposedly fast food places only want to know youre not really lazy or a complete weirdo anyway), i don't what else i could possibly do to please them other than............you guessed it, have prior work experience! i can't even rely on connections to get a job because none of my friends who live in the area have jobs either (makes me wonder if there even are jobs here??), they are in pretty similar situations afaik (although i get the impression not many of them are applying for fast food jobs because they think that's beneath them or something, tbh i didnt actually start applying to fast food places til about 6 months ago because so many of my friends had that ""ugh im not working at maccas"" attitude that made me kinda ashamed to apply, another thing that i wish i'd done earlier but can't take back now)

i'm not really sure if i'm writing this to get help or if i just wanna vent, either way advice is welcome, along with any commiseration or related rants you wanna make

TL;DR overdramatic 19 freaking out after a year and a half of job searching after finishing high school and never having had a job before, looking for a minimum wage part time job while at uni with barely any response (only heard back from a few fast food places, was unsuccessful), feel like time is ticking before i become completely unemployable due to lack of work experience, search for part time work is completely distracting me from actual career goals, situation is starting to feel completely hopeless and my self esteem keeps getting lower which only makes my chances worse"

A quick overview: I am in a CS50 class that so-far has taught me C, HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. I have loved and soaked up all of it. C especially. 


My question is to those that have lots of experience or even hire other programmers. What are some good ideas for gathering together a portfolio. Basically, if you were looking to hire someone into a paid internship (to eventually get a full time job) what would be some things that would impress you?


I am totally up for things that would help me dive further into C or just things that I'd have to write that would impress the person. I think- at this point- I favor software development over web development, but I like both.

“I *love* video games. Video games are the best entertainment in the world. I have wanted to make video games so much that I have spent an absurd amount of time learning. I have modified video games and I have used game development tools to create new and original things. I think I’m ready for the next step, but whenever I look for opportunities at my favorite game development studios, I can never find any openings for someone without years of experience and shipped titles already under their belt. That’s crap! I *know* I’m going to rock this and that I’m ready, but I need a foot in the door! I have been making cool things, but it’s time for me to go to the next level – to join a game development team and to be the best as I move forward and grow with the best. I just need a chance to prove myself!”

If you’ve said any of these things to yourself, you’re in the right place!


THE DOOR IS OPEN, WILL YOU WALK THROUGH?


The COGS program at Gearbox Software is designed for future game developers to get a chance to start their careers by becoming embedded with the veteran, professional developers at our world-class video game development studio and actually contribute to a commercial video game project. It’s the real deal. This is the foot in the door. This is the chance to prove yourself.

The COGS program differs from a traditional internship because Gearbox Software will actually pay you during your time at the studio. What?! Did you read that right?! Yes, we’re going to pay you to prove yourself. We must be nuts.

COGS stands for Contractors of Gearbox Software – you will get a contract and it will say that you have become an actual, official, paid professional inside the studio that is home of Borderlands, Duke Nukem, Brothers in Arms, Homeworld, Battleborn and Randy Pitchford’s flamboyant shirts. The contract terms can be for as little as three months or as long as a year, depending on the timing and the role. During that time you’ll get free soda.

Take it easy there, Moxxi. Not quite everyone can become a COGS developer. To succeed, you’ll need much more determination than the average person. You’ll need a team-work oriented personality and character that can take criticism and make others feel good about and even inspired by the criticism you want to offer them. You’ve got to have the heart of an entertainer – the basic need to give other people the kinds of feelings from video game experiences that are what convinced you in the first place that video games are the best form of entertainment our species has ever devised. And, of course, you’re going to need to be able to show us (and make it easy for us to see) some strong evidence of your progress and potential in the game development discipline you’re focused on – whether you are a programmer, artist, animator, designer or other game-development related talent, we’re going to need to see something that makes us believe you’ve taken the initiative to get started in developing some skills with a chance at going all the way.

Basically, you’ve really got to be a badass if you’re going to make it as a COGS developer. Are you a badass? I’m not talking about muscles here – who cares about that? I’m not even talking about your loud voice (or whether or not you even have a voice). Physical stuff doesn’t matter here. I’m talking about your determination to be the best and to help make stuff that blows people away. I’m talking about your passion for game development and your need to get better and better at it. I’m talking about grit, badass!

“I love video games. Video games are the best entertainment in the world. I have wanted to make video games so much that I have spent an absurd amount of time learning. I have modified video games and I have used game development tools to create new and original things. I think I’m ready for the next step, but whenever I look for opportunities at my favorite game development studios, I can never find any openings for someone without years of experience and shipped titles already under their belt. That’s crap! I know I’m going to rock this and that I’m ready, but I need a foot in the door! I have been making cool things, but it’s time for me to go to the next level – to join a game development team and to be the best as I move forward and grow with the best. I just need a chance to prove myself!”

If you’ve said any of these things to yourself, you’re in the right place!


THE DOOR IS OPEN, WILL YOU WALK THROUGH?


The COGS program at Gearbox Software is designed for future game developers to get a chance to start their careers by becoming embedded with the veteran, professional developers at our world-class video game development studio and actually contribute to a commercial video game project. It’s the real deal. This is the foot in the door. This is the chance to prove yourself.
The COGS program differs from a traditional internship because Gearbox Software will actually pay you during your time at the studio. What?! Did you read that right?! Yes, we’re going to pay you to prove yourself. We must be nuts.

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
___________________________________________________
Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

I have only 27 credits (or 9 classes) left until I graduate from my in-state university. This wouldn't have been my first choice of a university, but they offered me a hefty scholarship and in-state tuition was about all I could afford. Anyways, I spent 2 years in CS being force fed information on programming and scripting and feeling like I was getting absolutely nowhere. 2 classes on JavaScript, 2 classes on C++, and a lot of mandatory garbage (at least in my opinion) classes in between being taught languages such as Scheme, Prolog, how to create circuits and microprocessors and other weeder classes where I was just shoveled PowerPoint presentation lectures and regurgitating info back onto tests to get a letter grade and then forgetting the info afterwards. 1 year ago I switched to a new program within the art school at my university and my degree will be a BA with a focus in Media Processing. This degree still has me taking many of the same computer programming courses but a lot less of the 'garbage' courses I hated and a lot more courses that have more bottle-necked teaching: Mobile Application Development, Game Engine Development, Mac Development in Industry and for the Media Arts, etc. I have only been taking these classes for a semester or so and feel I am learning so much more than I did while in Computer Science. But the thing is, I spent over half my time in college (5 semesters out of 8 to graduate) in CompSci feeling like I was going nowhere and learning nothing of value, or at least that the things of value I was being taught were not engaging me enough to the point of retention. Coding classes where I read off a PowerPoint from a professor who spoke broken English left me with programming skills that I feel are fairly inefficient and severely lacking in depth as I only really know basic Java and C++, with a very minute amount of C#. No Perl classes, no Ruby, no Python, none of the bigger name languages had classes here, and even if they did I am skeptical to how efficient they would be compared to just looking up lessons online or buying a book. The only real skill I can honestly say I picked up from college is that my ability to work in teams is pretty efficient. But with college debt looming on the horizon, I feel like I need to start preparing myself for the prospect of actually looking for a career, and this concept feels so foreign and terrifying to me. I don't believe I have half the skill of some of my peers who were in their program for their full 8 semesters, and I only have 2 internships that I can really put on my résumé; 1 of which was working for a local firewall company where all I really did was disassemble old firewalls, reassemble new firewalls, flash hardware and prep the systems for shipping with a small amount of on-site troubleshooting with clients, and another internship with Mayo Clinic that is about to begin working on creating medical simulators, and I don't even feel qualified for this internship.



TL;DR I don't feel like I have picked up any/many worthwhile skills that will prepare me for the real world or a career from college. I also feel like I have to find a job after graduating college asap due to student debt and the pressure from that doesn't help. Am I alone in this? And to any of you guys who have felt this way before, any advice? Will I learn half my skill set for a career in the field or am I to be expected to have the skill set going into the interviews?"

*For Release to the Office of the Chilean President*  

As the Commonwealth of Australia continues stimulus of its advanced economic sectors, we have taken some interest in Chile's development over the past few years, and may be able to provide some assistance, most notably on the subject of the English language.  

Chile has planned to expand its IT outsourcing services sector by bringing in more global customers for some time now, but your country is going to need something to fuel that growth: more English speakers. When so much demand exists from American, European, and Indian firms, English is acknowledged as the language of business in the IT sector. The prevalence of English-based programming languages only enhances this effect.    

In addition to the sizable British minority there, English is already spoken by the Chilean ruling elite and the heads of industry, but current assessments put the number of proficient English speakers in Chile at 6 percent of the population, which is hardly sufficient for a growing IT hub. 

Chilean business leaders realized this fifteen years ago, and the government has expressed interest in pursuing various initiatives to boost professional English-language skills. Australia believes it can provide assistance in the following ways:  

+ English language internships: In conjunction with CORFO, the Chilean investment promotion agency, we would like to set up internships to help Chilean students interact with native English speakers in International Oceanic Union countries.  

+ Enhancing the [**""English Opens Doors""**](http://www.centrodevoluntarios.cl/) Programme: The Chilean Ministry of Education's current English proficiency plan is designed to make sure every student receives 1,000 hours of English-language learning during the grammar and high-school years, to gain a “working knowledge” of spoken and written English. Australia is willing to train Chile's 8,000 English teachers via educational exchange programmes to Oceanic Universities and will offer to send English speakers from New Zealand and Australia to help bolster this number. 

+ Further English Standardisation: The Chilean government has planned to institute standardized assessment of teachers’ English skills with a goal of bringing them up to international standards. We would like to offer our assistance with the creation of this curriculum.  

We hope you will take our recommendations to heart.

I am set to graduate in May from a state school with a STEM degree and zero student loan debt. I worked jobs and internships throughout college. I recently accepted a job offer in Dallas, Texas making $55k/year. They are giving me a $5000 lump sum to help with the move. I'm eligible for a 6% bonus in my first year. I will be traveling weekly for work. My company pays for flight, hotel, and give me a per diem while on the road (varies on client site, but around $60/day). I get 3 weeks of PTO and 1 week for illness. I get full medical/dental/vision coverage. The 401k matches 50% up to the first 6%.

After crunching some numbers through a paycheck calculator, I will be pulling in $1450/biweekly after taxes, 1 withholding, 6% 401k contribution, and medical/dental/vision.

Currently, I have $25k in my bank account, $5k in a Roth IRA, and $30k in another account that my grandfather left for me when he died.

I'm a bit overwhelmed with it all. I'll need to buy a car, get car insurance, find an apartment, get furniture, open a new bank account with a more Texas-focused bank, and probably some more things I can't even think of.

I've never really budgeted before because I kept my standard of living super low while in college and never spent much money. I've read this subreddit for awhile now and have learned a lot. I want to keep the $30k inheritance as my emergency fund for the foreseeable future.

So, /r/personalfinance, am I doing alright for a 22 year old? What can I do better? What do I need to do that I haven't thought of? Can y'all help me with a budget?"

We study similar topics, but are different enough. I applied for some big company internships for the summer and they all had me go through painful interview processes where you have to prepare presentations, do exercises, etc. 
Boyfriend didn't apply for those, then one of the people in our community who knows us both and is on my committee emailed him and an intern mentor in perhaps the most prestigious place for this type of work, and said that they think he is a good fit. He did just one video interview, no exercise, nothing, and got the offer from them.
This is while for the 3 other big companies that I applied for, I got rejected from one on the same day he got his offer, still waiting to hear on one and probably won't get it cause it's perhaps the biggest tech company, and got an unofficial offer from one that some people look down upon. So, not as prestigious as the one he got for sure. 

What hurts my feelings is that 1) the person on my committee did not recommend me (and that person knew we are partners), and 2) he got perhaps the best internship without much effort, and it was kind of handed to him.

Background: he is a white male and american citizen, and I am an immigrant female from the middle east.
He has more publications than I do, but we are both good researchers, and it's not like I don't have good publications, just not as much as he does.

So I don't know how to feel, and what to do..I wish I could be excited for him, but I can't still. I always have to try harder and harder, and most of the times it just doesn't pay off. Seeing how things work first-hand hurt my feelings so bad, and I feel hopeless about ever being successful, or at least as successful as he is, and I feel I will always be in his shadow. Had he gone through the process like I did, I would have not felt this way, you know..

Please help. I don't know how to feel or what to do :(

I came in as a bio major, however I knew going into medicine wasn't for me, so I changed to CS, with no prior experience in programming.

I wasn't learning much in that college, after two years I didn't even know what a method or constructor was. I really didn't enjoy CS, kind of just did it because I knew it would pay off financially. 

Fast forward to the end of my sophomore year(last year), I realized my current university wasn't cutting it, so I transferred to a top CS school in my state, even though it  meant I had to stay an extra year in college. The work load has been exponentially more difficult and time consuming, but I've actually grew a real passion for CS now that I'm finally becoming a great programmer. In a year I went from not knowing how to make simple codes, to getting an offer to be a TA for a upper-level programming class next semester. 

My issue is that I feel like it's getting too late to start putting myself in a good position to get a job after graduation. I can't take on an Internship this summer because I need to take summer classes( If I don't it'll take more than an extra year to graduate), and I wouldn't have time to take on an internship during the school year. I have no CS experience ( besides the TA job for next semester). I'm learning a new language every semester , but again, I feel like I need much more, seeing how competitive my university is. 

What should I start doing now to put myself in the best position to get an internship next summer, and potentially get a job after graduation?"
4dnbnc,1,2016-04-06,Should I bother negotiating internship offer?,negotiateinternship,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dnbnc/should_i_bother_negotiating_internship_offer/,"Background: I got an offer recently offering me $x per hour to work at a company that I am considering working for. 

This company is in a high COL area, and would require me to relocate for the summer. They don't offer relocation, and my apartment is still under lease where I live pretty much for the entire duration, plus my girlfriend will need to be living there anyways since we have our dogs/stuff there. This means that I will have costs both at my residence and during the summer.

The offer is probably *just* enough for me to scrape by if I don't do anything fun and literally pinch my pennies the entire summer, but that's even ignoring the cost to get out there. 

Should I bother trying to negotiate? I am still in the interview process with a few companies who I am more excited about and who probably pay better. Their hourly rate is equal to what I made last summer in my extremely low COL area, so I do think it would be hard to make it work. 

I know that internships are for the learning opportunity, but it would honestly be easier financially to just stay here at my current job (research), which pays only $1 less per hour and wouldn't require the extra rent and moving costs. They mentioned at least ten times how excited they were to have me there, so I know they really, *really* want me, but the money would just make it too stressful in my opinion for it to be worth it.

**TL;DR I was offered an internship that I don't think I can afford to take without significant sacrifices. I am in the final interview stages with 4 other companies. Is it worth negotiating?**

To also add in this is very long so please if you can read it all to give me the best advice. 

Lover 1 C.B: I met C.B in my freshman year of high school. We slight knew each other in middle school but grew closer in our freshman year because we had more classes together. C.B and I started to like each other enough she asked me out first during Christmas break but I declined because I received news I was going to move back in with my mom during the summer. I explained to her this and she was understanding. So during the rest of the school year we hanged out more and I got to meet her parents who she said the grew to love me like a son. During the day of my flight C.B and her family followed my family and I to the airport to see me off. I gave them all hugs and I kissed C.B on the cheek and told her I would talk to her always. So during the summer we would skype every night/morning, even with our three hour time zone difference, talking to each other until one of us fell asleep. During that time C.B kept expressing her feelings for me saying she would wait for me and that she missed me, it always made me choke up when she said these things but I constantly told her long distance relationships would not be the best thing for her and that she should find someone there to make her happy and that I will always remain her friend. She always declined on finding someone and said she wanted me and only me. 

Lover 2 E.H: My sophomore school year started and I was enrolled into the school my aunts and uncles on my mom's side of the family attended and graduated in. My family's sports and academic photos were on the walls and I knew they had high expectations for me to join the schools ""hall of fame."" I decided to go my uncles route and go for academics because I was not into sports. I joined the academics team and later I learned that was a terrible decision. The amount of stress school was putting on me, my mom at home with her drinking (which is a whole complete different story kn its own) and our fights, and my aunts and uncles telling me they expect me to be/do better then them was so great that I fell into depression. The depression became so great that I tried to take my life two times and I was put into a mental hospital. All during this time C.B was constantly feeling guilty that she could have done more to make me happy. During the time when I was in the mental hospital I met E.H. At first we just talked about each other's problems and what we needed help for and we some how grew to become emotionally dependent on each other, all the while I was still talking to C.B. Before I was released from the hospital E.H and I exchanged contact information in hopes to continue talking once we were both released. Once I was released from the mental hospital (around spring break time) to my dad picking me up from the hospital and not my mom. He cried to me saying he was sorry for making me move in with my mom and he would never do that again, I was just plain out suprised he drove from one side of the state's to the other to see me. I ended up driving back with my dad to the other side of the state's. By his request I did not attend school because it was so late in the year but instead I asked to be in therapy. I was close to C.B, or so I thought. The end of the school year rolled around (june) and I was in my routine visit with my therapist and my dad asked to come in for one session which he has never done before. Me and my dad always talked before and after sessions but never once has he came inside. Once he was in their he explained to me we were moving in with his step wife, he has been married with her for awhile now but they never moved in. It would mine I would be closer to my therapist but not attending the school with C.B. I was happy for my dad but I knew I had to be the bearer of bad news to C.B that we would not see each other. During the drive home my dad stopped by a grocery store and he went inside while I was  waiting in the car. While I was waiting a phone number called me and it was the same area code as my mom's but I did not recognize the number. I answered it and my heart instantly skipped a beat to hear it was E.H. We talked until my dad came back to the car and I ended up texting E.H. So the same cycle as C.B turned into E.H. I switched back and forth days in the summer who I talked to on Skype at night and E.H told me she had feelings for me because I was the only person she has ever known to completely understand her and her problems. I knew in my heart I was wrong to tell her I had feelings for her while I still had feelings for C.B. But I did it anyway because I wanted to make her happy because what she has been through (abusive sister, dad leaving her, mother who is cruel to her) she needed someone to make her happy and I would do anything to make that happen. But still, my feelings for E.H grew to same amount as C.B. 

Lover 3 H.D: H.D's situation came to me being in her own words, ""her saviour."" During my junior my junior year at once again a new school. Since I missed half of my sophomore year the school decided to put me in a freshman class. I was fine with it, a simple English class so I can cruise on by and get the school year over with. In the English class I met H.D. H.D instantly liked me at first based upon my looks. I was fine with her liking me but I always declined her because I was a junior and she was a freshman. I told her I would become friends and that was all. So for first semester and the beginning of second semester we were just friends, we would talk before school and occasionally hang out after school. She would ask me out and I would decline. I would decline on a relationship because I was in love with E.H and C.B. I gave them always my undying attention when they needed me and when ever I felt down I had them to bring me up. Everything was going great between H.D and I. She decide and my constant rejection that I would never be hers. There was a party going on during the weekend and I decided to go. I was wrong to go to the party because it had alcohol involved but I never been to a high school party before. I enjoyed myself and I began drinking. Next thing I know H.D showed up to the party. Once she showed up I instantly bailed and started walking home. About 10 minutes later H.D's friend calls me asking if I know where she is at because she can't find her. I start freaking out and I practically full sprint back to the party looking for her. I find her upstairs being raped by some guy while she is crying for help. People probably can't hear her because the music is extremely loud and people are drunk.  I pull him off and I beat him him enough he had to go to the hospital. I called my dad freaking out and he speeds over there to pick me and H.D up. She is crying in my arms and I am crying in hers saying that I was sorry I left the party and I should have looked out for her. My dad calls the cops and the guy who raped her ends up going to jail. After that H.D starts getting bullied in school because rumors have spread saying she wanted it and she was faking. I became so angry I just felt like I could beat anyone who even dared to say that. H.D ended up leaving the school to become home schooled and her and I started hanging out more. It turned into a daily basis after school and some nights I would sneak her in because she was crying from having nightmares of the day she was raped. I knew my dad knew I was sneaking her in because he always goes outside to smoke to see my window open but he probably knew why I was sneaking her in. My nightly basis from skyping E.H and C.B turned into having H.D in my room every night crying in my arms. I told her I would always be there for her when she needed me. I grew to love H.D and she grew to love me. I loved C.B, E.H, and now H.D all the same and I want them all happy the same way they all make me happy. 

Lover 4 A.G: Summer rolled around again and my dad exciting news he was getting a huge promotion but he was being transfered and that we would be living close to the same area as my mom. He told me I didn't have to see her I choose not to and he would put me into a better school. Once again I had to move away from one of my lovers and promised to her I would always be their for her no matter what and I would always talk to her. I started school an my dad and I decided it would be best if I did an accelerated program at the school to finish school in December. The first day I started school I met A.G. She was in every single one of my classes but the difference was her and I just started liking each other instantly. We would always sit next to each other, go to the same place to get lunch, study after school, just everything together. I instantly grew to have strong feelings for her and I didn't know why. During the entire time knowing her she was always mature and I assumed she was my age (at this point I am 17) but I was wrong. She was a freshman and I was a senior. But in honesty that really didn't matter to me. I cared for her. I talked about all the things I have been through my life (without adding in my lovers) and she told me about hers. She was in schools accelerated program and what normally takes 4 years to graduate high school she is doing it in 2. For her age she was acting as mature as as adult. We both expressed feelings but I turned down a relationship because I was graduating in December. She was fine with it and what turned into strong feelings turned into loving her the same was as H.D, E.H, and C.B. Once I graduated I applied to a internship for a job in a different state (the one I am in currently) and I got accepted. January rolled around and I moved once again and started working. My dad payed for my rent until my intership was over and I was living on my own before I turned 18. Since then I constantly talk to all four of them equally. I show them all the same undividing attention. 

The guidance: Now I need serious help. I am being transfered from where I live now to the area my dad lives in. He has already agreed that I can live their since his wife and him are retired and always on vacation traveling (they are probably gone 10-11 months out of the year) and I will basically home alone. E.H and A.G know I am moving back to the state they are in and they know I have car and my job does not limit me from seeing them. A.G is still in school and will be finished this June as well as E.H is finishing school this June as well. I have already made plans to visit C.B and H.D because their is a concert during the summer that is in that area in which I already paid for tickets, flight, and hotel during the end of the summer. In my previous post people were saying I should tell them about each other and I wait he to extremely bad. I them all to know about each other and them all to know that I love them all equally and would go to hell and back for them. But I am afraid that it will backfire on me and they will be very upset and hurt thinking that I was just using there emotions. How do I go about telling them. I fly to my dad's house on the 16th of this month and I know sooner or later I will slip up. I just don't know what to do. Please help me. 

I also want to add in a few things, I have not done anything sexual with any of them. Not even kiss em. No sexual talk or anything of that nature. I am currently 18 and their ages are C.B 18, E.H 17, H.D 17, A.G 16. I have already talked to my dad about this and he says I should tell tell all about each other but he knows that once I do he doesn't know himself if they all would still love me the same anymore. If you have any questions please ask. I will reply to comments as fast as possible.

TL;DR; I love 4 women and they love me the same. I want them to know the truth about each other but afraid it will back fire and they will hate me. "

I was wondering if there's good tips to get to know people in the business. I want to be able to intern for someone in the growing or product manufacturer industry and really get my name out there. 

I understand there's many people going to be there trying to do the same thing I'm doing. That's why I want to be able to take the extra step and let them know what I can bring to the table.

If this isn't the right place to do it, I'll take any suggestions on where I should really be looking.

How hard is the comp sci program here? 

Is it a really time consuming program here? - My friends at Stony Brook have projects that they spend 40 - 50+ hrs/class on. If that's the case I'm willing to quit my job, or hold off a year until I have some cash saved over.

Also 
What are the career prospects like? When I graduated SBU, it was hell to find a job. The career center didn't really do anything for you, especially if you weren't stem. I got my first job through networking my ass off. I really can't afford to go through that process again, mostly because I have many other responsibilities now and don't have the time. Is the career center good at developing internships and jobs? What types of companys recruit from QC?

How's the social life here?
- I'm Pakistani, I know many people that go/went here and they hate it. But I feel as if they weren't social/mature people to begin with. How do yo guys feel about it?

After working an internship last summer I felt pretty worn out and generally didn't enjoy the working life. I was on a team that wasn't doing interesting things and just kind of felt like if I were to continue doing software engineer for my career I would get really burnt out. I enjoy going to school though, despite not having stellar grades. 

My experience with the internship led me to seriously start thinking about going to graduate school. My lackluster performance however seems to be the biggest barrier to getting into a grad program. I also have not done any research. Does anyone have advice on what I can do to increase my prospects of graduate school? My course load has generally been 3 technical classes a semester with a couple of humanities mixed in. I always here the 3.5 number, is this referring to GPA of technical classes? Is grad school something I should even pursue with this type of GPA?"

I will be changing names for the sake of privacy. So i met Rachel last year at the beginning of the summer while at an internship. She was also working there at another department but we were together during training and immediately hit it off. For the rest of the summer we bonded a lot and discovered we had a lot of similar hobbies and likes and we talked and agreed on a relationship in the hopes of making it long term. As the summer ended, she began opening up about her previous relationships and about her most recent ex who she had broken up with a few weeks before she started working for the summer. (We were both staying at the same apartment during the internship as it was a few hours away from both our homes, but away from there, i live 3 hours from her in another city) her ex (18m) jason was really immature and she told me she broke up with him because of that and she was over him and he was out of her life. Well the summer ended, she didnt have a car so i drove her back home, and then i went home. We began a long distance relationship where we texted constantly and facetimed, as well as i would drive and see her every two weeks or so. This went on fine and we were having lots of fun and had a good relationship going but eventually we started having fights, the distance started wearing us down i guess. Well she began talking to her ex jason again. Nothing bad, just harmless small talk and they go to the same school and saw each other everyday. They werent exactly on speaking terms, she felt bad she hurt him when she broke up with him and wanted to apologize and be friends with him. This made me very uncomfortable and we had many fights about this. Eventually she confessed she was hiding that she still had feelings for him but it was me she wanted and she just wanted closure from him. We had another huge fight where she promised she would cut him off completely and be done with it. She did, and things went good. We had a few more fights but worked things out. This whole time because of money issues i took a year off school and got a job in marketing to make enough money for an apartment in the fall.  She also moved back in with her parents as her roomate moved away and she couldnt afford to live alone. I was making good money and helped her out with some expenses ie. Phone bill and the occasional care package. Because of backdoor political bs at my office,i was let go in february, and that same week i was scheduled to get my wisdom teeth pulled. Once i was fired i told her and was obviously very upset and down. She tried to cheer me up but couldnt do much over the phone. The next day she tries talking to me about how stressed she is over some tests and how money is tight and how she cant take her broken phone anymore and needs another one. She had been asking me to buy her one for a while but phones are pricy so i hadnt but had been saving for one to give it to her as a gift for her birthday coming up. I told her since i was now fired i wouldnt be able to get her that phone for a long time now that i didnt have an income and still had bills to pay. She said figures and was very passive upset about it. I got upset that she was more worried about the phone than me and one thing led to another and she broke up with me because i was being too unfair. She kinda figured we would make up and be back together by the next day after we calmed down  but i was so done with everything i didnt want to. I was hurt that she wasnt there for me when i needed her most and just didnt feel right to get back together and i just needed a break. Well we didnt speak for a few weeks. We started talking again, she hoped we would still get back together but i told her no and that it was for the best if we just stayed friends.  We still talk every once in a while and consider ourselves on good terms. She is going back to that same internship this summer but i am not. She hopes ill visit her so she asked me for my ipad so that she can use it at work and would assure her ill visit. She has told me she is scared and worried we wont ever see eachother again and that ill ghost her one day. She doesnt want that to happen and doesnt want me to cut her out of my life. She recently also bought a car but had to get all new tires. That took a hit on her bank account and now shes short for her insurance payment this month and asked if i can help her out a little. She says she still cares a lot about me and wants us to remain close and friends. She still hopes we will one day become a couple as shes mentioned shed be willing to try again but ive been the one distancing myself from that as an option. 

Do you guys think her borrowing the ipad is a good idea? I dont feel too comfortable about it since were not dating anymore, but i know i can trust her and she wouldnt be keeping it or breaking it or anything of the sorts. And about helping her with the payment its basically a one time thing. Its not a lot of money and since i still really care about her a lot i want to help. What do you guys think? Any productive advice is appreciated.

TLDR: had serious ldr, ended because of differences, were on good terms now but she wants to burrow my ipad and needs some money for a bill and asked me to help"

Both of these companies are fairly established but I do not have too much experience on their internship positions when compared to the tech giants. 

For this reason, I am curious to hear feedback on these company's internship programs. Has anyone interned at any of these companies before? How was your experience? How easy was it to convert to full-time? What sort of projects did you work on? How was the culture? 

The compensation is around the same. I know Cloudera is probably in better position (ton of VC funding, great revenue), whereas Pandora is in slightly unsure future - I heard stories of it trying to self itself. I am probably more interested in Cloudera's product (Apache Hadoop) than Pandora's music streaming service. I think Cloudera is definitely more innovative.

..

If you look @ the voting records, Hillary either:

A) votes in line with McConnell

or

B) skips the vote (god forbid she take a stance on a controversial issue)

Even in cases where she does something good (like co-sponsor the Fair Pay Act of 2009) you find out that the other co-sponsor was fucking Bernie.

Hillary's record is anti LGBT, pro Iraq, and a lot of skipped votes on important issues.

Bernie's record is pro LGBT, anti Iraq, and consistently votes for the right thing, like rebuilding infrastructure, protecting the environment, and helping our students and veterans.

He also voted against ""The Wall.""

19 - Jon Parnell Walker - Whitewater investigator for Resolution Trust Corp. Jumped to his death from his Arlington, Virginia apartment balcony August 15, 1993. He was investigating the Morgan Guarantee scandal.

20 - Barbara Wise - Commerce Department staffer. Worked closely with Ron Brown and John Huang. Cause of death unknown. Died November 29, 1996. Her bruised, nude body was found locked in her office at the Department of Commerce.

21- Charles Meissner - Assistant Secretary of Commerce who gave John Huang special security clearance, died shortly thereafter in a small plane crash. The plane had been tampered with.

22 - Dr. Stanley Heard - Chairman of the National Chiropractic Health Care Advisory Committee, died with his attorney Steve Dickson in a small plane crash. Again, tampering with the plane. Dr. Heard, in addition to serving on Clinton's advisory council personally treated Clinton's mother, stepfather and brother.

23 - Barry Seal - Drug running pilot out of Mena Arkansas, death was no accident.

24 - Johnny Lawhorn Jr. - Mechanic, found a check made out to Bill Clinton in the trunk of a car left at his repair shop. He was found dead after his car had hit a utility pole. Apparently he was dead before the car hit the pole.

25 - Stanley Huggins - Investigated Madison Guarantee. His death was a purported suicide and his report was never released.

26- Hershell Friday - Attorney and Clinton fund raiser died March 1, 1994 when his plane exploded. This happen two days after an argument with Clinton.

27 - Kevin Ives and Don Henry - Known as ""The boys on the track"" case. Reports say the boys may have stumbled upon the Mena Arkansas airport drug operation. A controversial case, the initial report of death said, due to falling asleep on railroad tracks. Later reports claim the two boys had been slain before being placed on the tracks. Many linked to the case died before their testimony could come before a Grand Jury.

4donw9,3,2016-04-06,Summer project for aerospace major?,justgorgias,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4donw9/summer_project_for_aerospace_major/,"I'm wrapping up my freshman year in an aerospace program. I'm doing pretty well for myself on campus, but I don't think it's realistic to think I'll hear back from any of the internships I applied for. I'll be going back home for the summer and trying to find a job, and I'll also be taking an online certification course for ANSYS. However, I want to have more than this to show for my summer. I'm looking for a project to work on over the summer.
What is a good project that I can use to build my portfolio?
I should mention that I have computer science and math minors and I am trying to teach myself Python right now. I have an interest in self-contained computers like Raspberry Pi and Arduino, so something involving those might be good too. I've thought about maybe trying to build a quadcopter or something like that, but I think that might be above my head right now.
Any suggestions are welcome! Thanks."
4dot91,0,2016-04-06,27M4F Be a bad girl tonight.,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4dot91/27m4f_be_a_bad_girl_tonight/,"OK, so I'm looking for some really naughty girls to RP with. I'm open to a variety of different situations/prompts, and if you've got an idea, I'd love to hear it. If you'd like a few ideas of mine, they're below, as is my kinks/dislikes list!

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) I've married older and into an open relationship. My new wife has a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. You come over somehow on a night where nobody else is home (my wife is getting fucked by at least one other guy, my step-daughter is elsewhere), and ultimately we wind up in a situation where one of us seduces the other. Why are you at my house? How do we get to that point? Let's figure it out together!

5) Any kind of party prompt you can imagine; nightclub, pool, bachelor/bachelorette, etc.

6) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking/smoking (also open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"
4dotme,0,2016-04-06,[22F] My boyfriend [23M] of 2.5 years just told me that he kissed another girl while we are temporarily long distance. We now have 2 months to re-work our entire futures.,ughfuckmethrowaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4dotme/22f_my_boyfriend_23m_of_25_years_just_told_me/,"(Throwaway, long story, sorry, blah blah blah. Posted on r/relationships too but got few responses.) Backstory: My boyfriend and I met in college and dated consistently for junior and senior years. We spent the summer together after I graduated (he still had one more semester in college) having the most fun we had ever had together, and we decided to stay together despite him staying in school and me moving away for an internship. That was in August. At the time I brought up my feelings about how I thought he should have some time to himself in college, since we had been together for so long and we are both adventurous people so the timing made sense to me, but he decided we made more sense together so we began dating long distance (first it was just 3 hours away, then I relocated so it's been more like 7). We've always had our own lives and our own friends, and I love that about us.

We always made a point to talk on the phone every few days, text/chat constantly, visit alternating weekends when possible, do only fun things together when we saw each other, etc. Our agreement from the start had been that if at any point it stopped feeling fun for either of us, we would say something and move on. I've been burnt by shitty relationships in the past so I've lost a lot of patience for games. He's a pretty logical guy when he wants to be, so this made sense for him too. We have always had a ton of fun together, and he's agreed that literally every visit has been awesome and felt like a vacation, and that he feels great talking to me.

He really is my best friend, and being with him has been so much more fulfilling than I could have ever imagined a relationship being. We always make a point to talk about our relationship as an affirmative thing -- we are constantly agreeing to be with each other through our actions. I have not felt, personally, like being in a LDR has detracted from my own ""real"" life in the least, and I don't resent the distance at all because he's literally the best match for me I could have ever imagined.

He graduated in December (after 3 months of distance) and has since been working his own internship near our college town for this semester, before he wants to move on to a real job. We still remained long distance after that move because it didn't really change much for us logistically, so now it's been around 8 months that we've been on this every-other-weekend schedule of seeing each other.

It is wearing on us, but I think we were doing fine with it, aside from the usual missing each other stuff. None of that felt resentful. At the end of this semester, we had vague plans to move somewhere new together to live together for the first time and finally enter adulthood together if we both got jobs we wanted in the same place. I had been nagging him a little about applying for jobs in the same cities, but I also haven't secured a job yet for that time either so he's not all to blame.

Last week, he went out with a mutual friend and her friend who he had never met before. This is normal, we both have our own lives and tend to be only jokingly jealous about who the other hangs out with of the same sex. This was last Tuesday. I know now that he kissed the other girl, who he had just met that night, when she gave him a ride home. He then added her on Facebook and has also been texting her throughout the week. Again, this is the first incident after around 8 months of long distance, just two months before we were planning to hopefully move in together.

He brought this up to me last night, only after he started bringing up his own fears about being too curious for his own good while we were apart last week and hinting at having some serious doubts, which I had been talking him through all week. I know now that he only brought these up the day after he kissed her. We spent so much emotional time throughout the week discussing where we stand on issues and hypotheticals about the future, where we stand on issues that would of course be relevant to talk about before we move in together. I was a little peeved because I had made a point to talk about these issues before, and felt like his answers were changing at an inconvenient time, but both of our answers made sense and our conclusions kept being the same.

He still sounded hesitant to accept that the conversation was over at any point when we agreed, and like he had some other issue looming, but never anything like this. At no point last week did he bring up this incident, or even the possibility of that type of situation in our hypothetical talk. We've always been super realistic about things like this and have basically in the past said that if either of us feel like we are falling for someone else, it's our responsibility to end it right then and there. He didn't fall for this girl exactly, but it also isn't like he was drunk and it was a mistake. It also isn't like he felt so overwhelmed with the action that he called me that night. And then he's been talking to her all week. He did not tell her he has a girlfriend, although the mutual friend of ours of course knows.

I am basically the only girl he has been with, and this has come up in our conversations about our future and we've always been really reasonable about it. We considered opening our relationship up to new partners at one point during our long-distance portion but we never got to the point that we felt we needed to do so or wanted to discuss it in real terms, because we were both busy enough with life and work and one relationship. So this was of course something he started bringing up again recently, and it definitely made sense to me as moving in together would be a big deal in those terms. But previously we had kind of come to the agreement that if he did indeed want to see other people, graduate school (a year from May) would be the time to assess our situation and think about opening it up / taking a break. So it's not like this was a miscommunication.

It's not just that he did it, or that he lied to me. It's that he did it, lied to me blatantly for a week (reassuring me nothing was up, saying at one point something like ""I know you worry about that sometimes and I promise I haven't done anything with anyone else""), talked to his parents and his best friend about it, went to visit friends for the weekend rather than making time to talk on the phone about it, and all the while tried to talk out my thoughts and feelings on what turned out to be imaginary issues -- then didn't even have the sense to come at me using those answers I had given to make any sort of case for himself.

He seems creepily detached from the situation, and like he doesn't know how I'm going to react to each thing I say (despite the fact that we are best friends and know everything about each other). He doesn't know what he wants. I didn't want to give him an ultimatum, but I also feel like a sucker if I take him back like nothing happened. Throughout the course of our phone call last night, his conclusions ranged from : we should break up, I don't deserve him, we should take a break for the time that we are still apart and then move in together, we should stay together and act like nothing happened, he should date this new girl instead, etc ... eventually I told him I have zero patience for a dude who could lie to me for a week and still doesn't know what he wants after all that time to reflect.

I should note that once before, when we spent a spring break apart in college, he ""met"" a girl on tinder while visiting a friend in another state (I knew he had tinder downloaded, like I said -- we were casual, and trusted each other enough to know it was only for fun) and went on to text her secretly for a month or so, only bringing it up after I saw her name on his snapchat best friends list (lol). That was a big deal when it came to our trust, but it never felt like actual cheating because he had never met her. Our conclusion with that was that he acted on some stupid feelings because he was considering our future and thought we might get married, and then felt trapped.

We had never talked about marriage before. So obviously, he does this thing where he lets his emotions build up sometimes and comes to irrational conclusions. I don't think this instance was a case like that, but I do think he was trying to make me think it was by bringing it up only after he laid a foundation for his doubts. But I know now those doubts didn't really exist before he did this, and that I was doing a good job so far of addressing those doubts all along with our monthly check ins about the relationship. Up until the point that he did this, our relationship had remained a great, fun, loving, caring, affirmative decision, and we wanted to spend our lives together for at least one more year.
What the fuck do I do? I'm so hurt about how he has handled this whole situation, and it breaks my heart to know that this guy who is/was my best friend, who talked about everything with me all the time, had the capacity not only to casually cheat on me, but lie to my face about it for a week. That's not any basis to build another year on, especially if we live together, but neither of us can get over the fact that this is the very best relationship that we've ever heard of anyone having. We constantly validate and affirm each other, and love each other so deeply. We've had so many amazing times together and now neither of us understand why he could/would just throw that all away so quickly and effortlessly, and then not know what he wants.

**tl;dr: Most trusting, loving, fulfilling relationship of my life was sabotaged despite my best efforts while we were long distance. Now he won't tell me what he wants. We have to decide what to do with our lives in the next two months, before our internships end and we both move somewhere new.**"
4dovtu,14,2016-04-06,"I have two interviews tomorrow. I've had 9 in the past six months, but no offers. Y'all got any tips?",LordLightning,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4dovtu/i_have_two_interviews_tomorrow_ive_had_9_in_the/,"The title's misleading, I actually did get an offer out of one of those nine interviews, but it was for a summer internship that I accepted. However, the other eight interviews were for co-op positions which I still haven't had any luck getting. These two interviews are probably my last chances of getting a co-op. I have tried other subreddits in the past for interviewing help, but they haven't been that helpful.

Objective: Obtaining a 10-12 month chemical engineering co-op.

Qualifications: [Here's my resume.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7r41zkeF5-sNm1ndlNIQzk5VE0/view?usp=sharing)

My problem: Obviously, I'm not a great interviewee, seeing as I was rejected 8 times. The four people I know who had co-op offers interviewed four or less times. From what I can tell, I'm great at getting interviews, but terrible at them.

Here are all the answers I use to prepare for likely potential questions **(if you don't care about this part, skip to the end of the post)**:

&gt; Tell me about yourself. (I more or less say this exact thing with some variation.)

- I'm a second-semester junior in terms of chemical engineering, but I'm actually a sophomore at [school]. I chose chemical engineering for two reasons: 1. My first reason is kind of bad, but I've always been really into disassembling and reassembling things and being innovative, but my dad's a mechanical engineer, my grandfather was an electrical engineer, and my great-grandfather was a civil engineer. I didn't want to do the same thing as them, so I chose it. And 2. My goal since I was young has been to eventually go into alternative energy and create something new, which, if you're familiar with Iron Man, was inspired by Iron Man's arc reactor and his suit. [Talk about possible career goals.]

- I don't know if I'd call them hobbies, but I play volleyball a lot as well as ultimate frisbee (even though I'm truthfully pretty bad at both). I make animals and trees out of dry-cleaning hangers, occasionally whittle, write, read, and cook. 

- Have yet to say this: I figure you guys are going to ask questions like how do I keep up with advances in engineering and I do that by reading the news and regularly check LiveScience and Discovery.

&gt; Describe a situation in which you were able to use persuasion to successfully convince someone to see things your way.

- Design team leader wanted us to meet three times a week, got her to make subteam leaders meet once a week, and individual sub-teams to meet once a week; in essence, compartmentalizing the process.

&gt; Describe a difficult co-worker you've had to deal with.

- Classmate who would never do work on time, so we just picked up his slack as a group of four. When the professor made us a group of three and assigned roles, he did not submit our work on time and we got a 0 for something worth 8% of our grade. Eventually got an 80% out of it after we appealed to the department head. It taught me a lot about being proactive and assertive.


&gt; Describe a time when you were faced with a stressful situation that demonstrated your coping skills. (Asked at least three times.)

- In high school, we were in a volleyball game where it was about 20-12, with us losing, in the second set. (In volleyball, it's the best out of 3 sets or 5 sets if it's 2-2 or a tournament.) Our coach was furious at us because we were constantly making mistakes and she was shouting at me and our outside hitter because we weren't focused and we should be leading the team. We managed to win the set - mainly due to our captain's jump serve - but then barely lost the fourth and fifth sets. I wouldn't say that the situation itself was extremely stressful for me, but the experience led to growth on a team-scale.

&gt; Give me a specific example of a time when you used good judgment and logic in solving a problem. (Asked this at least three times.)

- Firehouse wire networking problem. Supervisor thought the wire was fine even though the connection wasn't working since if you pulled on the bottom or top, the other end would respond. I thought something was up and had the wire pulled out. Come to find out that it was almost torn, but hanging by a few strands.

&gt; Give me a specific example of a time when you had to conform to a policy with which you did not agree. (Asked at least twice.)

- My process controls professor likes our homework formatting and answers to be written in a very specific way. I learned early on in the semester that it has to be done exactly like his instructions or you lose a lot of points. I ended up losing 9% for making an image smaller than average on the third homework assignment.

&gt;Tell me about a time when you had too many things to do and you were required to prioritize your tasks. (Asked once.)

- Most test weeks last semester. I usually had at least four exams over a period of two or three days last semester as well as homework. I would generally do the easiest homework, then study, then attempt a hard homework, then study, continue picking away at the hard homework, then study, then finish the last of the homework.

&gt;Tell me about a time you were able to successfully deal with another person even when that individual may not have personally liked you (or vice versa). (Asked at least twice.)

- A peer of mine kept badgering my study group last semester for ""help"" on the homework. Moreover, he'd sit next to us during tests and cheat. I told him near the middle of the semester that he needed to stop or else I'd report him for cheating the next time he tried to get homework answers or cheat. It probably isn't the best way to do it, but it was successful.

&gt;Tell me about a time when you missed an obvious solution to a problem. (Asked once.)

- I'm taking this coding class where I used to do the task in a long and convoluted way with five to ten more lines of code than most people. I was usually right, but the professor always had extremely short codes compared to mine. Over the course of the semester, I've gotten pretty good at minimizing the number of lines of code that I have.

&gt; Give an example of something you are proud of.

- If it doesn't have to be related to academics and if you're familiar with Pokemon, I once drafted a Pikachu in Inventor and then 3D printed it as well as painted it. It now sits on my desk.

I also talk a bit about my past internships as well as the design team that I'm on. My questions to the interviewer generally revolve around what the co-op does, projects, the environment and culture, product and development, as well as what question they'd like me to ask the most.

If you read my answers, what can I do to improve them? In terms of the lesser details, I dress very well for both interviews and everyday life, I have a firm handshake (they had a handshake booth at the last career fair), I smile a lot, and that's about it. Do you guys have any advice?"

4dp775,1,2016-04-06,"LDP Internship Offer, not sure if I should take it or keep looking",csstudent903599,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dp775/ldp_internship_offer_not_sure_if_i_should_take_it/,"I have one offer for a LDP (Leadership Development Program) for IT. I'm hesitant on taking the offer because the job description is pretty vague and the title itself seems a bit sketchy.  Apparently both the role and location have yet to be determined, so I don't really have any clue on what I will be doing. Because of the fact that neither of the two are determined, it kind of feels like a random position that the company could possibly fill up with anyone else. After talking with the manager for the program, I was told I was going to be doing some coding and business related things depending on the location. However, again I won't be told how much coding I will be doing. I'm worried that they may have me write one or two scripts and the remainder of the internship is more dedicated on the business aspects of it. 

I'm basically unsure on whether or not LDP internship is worthwhile. I looked on the subreddit couldn't find much and most things I could find on Google were stating it's not very useful. I was wondering if anyone else had experience with any LDP Internships. 

So the dilemma is, I'm a junior in college and I haven't had an internship yet. Since it's April I feel like it's coming down to the wire and maybe I should accept the offer and be safe as opposed to trying to hunt for another and potentially end up without an internship. 

tl;dr - Have a LDP IT - Internship offer, don't know if I should accept or keep looking. "

4dpbuh,19,2016-04-06,Alternate Interpretation: Was Soders right to be afraid?,MasterMaple,HiTMAN,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/4dpbuh/alternate_interpretation_was_soders_right_to_be/," I hope I'm not spoiling anything, but if you're one of the folks who hasn't finished the Final Test (perhaps there's at least one of you out there) this does contain spoilers for the tutorial levels.


Now that's out of the way, and my conscience is clear, let's get right into things: some of you probably remember Director Soders, but if you don't here's a brief rundown. Soders was a legendary ICA field agent before being forced into a training role. He can perhaps be considered HiTMAN's first ""antagonist"", because he fears 47's abilities and sets up a test deliberately designed for 47 to fail. A selection of his lines (paraphrased):



""Such skills and reflexes...They can only be the result of previous training.""


""A blank slate. Antisocial. Apathetic and unresponsive. No doubt the boy shows promise, but...""


""Power like that? With no moral restraint? He could be dangerous.""


""All agents have weak spots, Miss Burnwood. Pressure points...To keep them in check. But this one? Perhaps it would be better to just...""


""We'll keep digging, of course. But frankly, it's as if the earth just spat him out.""


""I hope you know what you've just done.""


 Now we know that dialogues like these are the games setting him up as a villain. After all, why would he ever doubt *you*, the future legendary assassin. I mean, Diana tells you *herself* that he set up the test to make you fail because his pride is-


Wait. Hang on a moment.


Let's consider this from Mr. Soder's point of view. Imagine you are in charge of the training for what amounts to a trade union for hitmen. Operatives come through. You train them, they go out into the field. The bad ones get killed, the good ones are modestly successful. Life is as it should be, and your former status as an elite agent means that you are an excellent judge of character, and create many successes through the ICA. 


*And then*:


Some random fellow suddenly wants to join your organization. He came out of nowhere. His skills are inhuman, the result of previous experience, but experience earned where? Working for who? You don't know. Then, he aces the initial test you set before him. Twice. When you attempt to do a background check on him, you turn up absolutely nothing. Someone has erased his steps. To quote the man himself ""it's as if the earth just spat him out."" I don't know about you, but I wouldn't be rushing to trust this guy.
But Soders actually seems to make an effort. He admits that 47 has great skills and reflexes and shows great promise. He seems on the fence about having 47 removed from the program, almost reluctant to let such a powerful asset go. But perhaps this isn't convincing enough on its own.


So, let's consider another one of Soder's lines. 


&gt;""All agents have weak spots, Miss Burnwood. Pressure points, to keep them in check. But this one..."" 


So this man with absolutely no background and inhuman skill and physical ability is nearly impossible to control. It makes sense the ICA would have ways of putting the heat on their agents in order to keep them in line; handlers for spies during the Cold War often employed the same strategy, for the simple reason that it's a lot harder to go over to the enemy when the group that employs you knows where your family lives and where they keep the spare key (hidden under the flowerpot nearest the front door). Evil and manipulative as Soders is meant to sound, this makes *perfect sense* for the ICA. Murder is a business, and you don't want the other guy planting sleeper agents or stealing your operatives. Plus, we've seen in previous Hitman games the damage done to the Agency by both [rival agencies infiltrating the ICA](/spoiler) and [47 himself during *Absolution*.](/spoiler). 


 Soders, in this instance, is the voice of reason. 47 is the most dangerous recruit he has ever seen, who passes their intense entry exams with almost contemptuous ease, and to top it all off, the Agency has absolutely no leverage over him. If I were Soders, quietly arranging 47's exit from the program would be well up there on my list of options. 


Hell, Soders knows just how dangerous uncontrollable assets can be because he *took down Jasper Knight*, and thus probably saw just how efficiently he managed to switch sides and force the KGB to comply to his whims. Having seen what happened to the most important target of his career, Soders may have filed that away for the future: it's better to be in control of your weapons and assets. You'll live longer.


(Umm... Spoilers for the Final Test, I suppose?)


[And then comes the Final Test. The aftermath cutscene is once again meant to paint Soders as childish, a petty bad guy who's pissed that 47 one-upped him. But remember that when he says to Diana ""I hope you know what you just did"", he's probably referring to the method most first-time players were likely to use to eliminate Knight; shooting him out of the ICA Test Tube on a rocket ejection seat. Likely with no parachute. While Knight's in a *suit*. Lost somewhere in a vast, *freezing-cold* mountain range. WITH NO FOOD OR WATER. Whether Knight even survived the fall is debatable, and even if he landed, he's most likely dead. 47 and Diana just conspired to kill off a paid actor (for all we know his real name was Gary and he was just the fucking intern) *for real, during a training exercise*. Imagine having to let a guy like that walk free with no consequences after shooting some poor bastard into the atmosphere, along with their handler, to whom you graciously gave the offer of backing away from the whole thing once you'd made the decision to force Bald Mystery Man out of the program for the good of the Agency, knowing full well that she cheated to get 47 through the course but being unable to prove it.](/spoiler) 


Already you were forced into retirement from an illustrious career. Now you're a laughingstock at the Agency with a very difficult report to give to your superiors about how [one of your training assistants was basically shot out of a cannon into the middle of the Arctic,](/spoiler) all because one bloody-minded rookie completely ignored your experience, rank and completely valid opinion so that she could hitch her proverbial wagon to a completely amoral faceless amnesiac with no past who is now out there doing god-knows-what.


What do you think? Maybe he doesn't seem so unreasonable now. Or maybe you have a counter-argument, in which case, I'd love to hear it.

4dpcf8,1,2016-04-06,High school junior questions about a potential career in computer science,Fraz161,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dpcf8/high_school_junior_questions_about_a_potential/,"Hello! I'm a junior in high school looking at becoming a computer scientist some day. First, a little bit about me and my experiences this year.

I moved from another part of the United States to the northwest last summer with the only computer knowledge under my belt being an understanding of Scratch and a built gaming PC. I took AP Computer Science this year and soared. I also took AP Biology to test the waters and see which science I preferred. Long story short, Computer Science has won. 

I've learned Java this year under Microsoft's TEALS program (current Microsoft employees coming into class to provide help and guidance). Already I know much, much more about computer science than my peers back in the southeast, and while I've not always gotten an A on tests in the class, I've always made clean, concise code (according to my TEALS volunteers). Recently my class went a trip to Microsoft and I got the opportunity to speak with a Google employee who also does hiring. She said that my knowledge of Java in my junior year is a good jumping-off point for a potential out-of-college internship at the company, pointing to a link with everything Google wants from interns (https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html). So, with all of this in mind, 

1.  I've learned Java and will continue to test out small projects to hone my skills. That's a good start, but not when my peers are talking about how they know like, seven programming languages. **After Java, what's the best language to learn next? C++ or Python? Which one is used more often in industry?** The Google representative said that from most used OOP to least, the order is Java, C++, Python. Is this true? **After this, what ""other programming languages"" should I learn first?**

2. What the Google employee said could have been complete rubbish and he/she might have sugarcoated my standing in CS to potentially increase my interest in working there. **Is only knowing Java in my third year of high school a good start if I want to work at one of the Big 4?** 

3. **Any thoughts on where I should move from here? What did your senior year of high school look like? What should I do that's computer science related before I go into college (most likely UW or, if the fates align, Berkeley)?**

tl;dr I'm a high schooler looking to advance beyond Java in the future and go big or go home in terms of getting into a Big 4 company. Thoughts?"

I thought it would be cool if we have a conversation about everyone's upcoming summer internships if you have one planned.

Also those who have them can communicate with those who don't.

I think it would be interesting if we could have some networking among ourselves as well.  So if you're up for it post the city and state your internship is in so we can pm and network if nearby.  

I can attest to the value of this as my internship this summer was recommended to me by a friend, and I likely wouldn't have gotten one without his recommendation.  

So I'll start.  

I got an internship with a major aerospace company doing software engineering in South Houston, Texas.

I'm super excited and I can't wait to get started.  PM me if you're in the area and want to meet for lunch over the summer or something."

In what other ways can a graduating student (therefore with no prior work experience) stand out among the other candidates when looking for a job?

I can think of: 
* studying on your own: better technical knowledge at interview
* coding on your own: better technical knowledge at interview + slightly better looking resume (i understand that having a portfolio barely matters to recruiters?)

Does these two things really make a difference? is there anything else to it or is there just not much that you can do about it? I want to do everything i can do from today til the day i graduate to ladder up.

4dpnuf,1,2016-04-07,Oculus,AccioIcarus,AccioIcarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/AccioIcarus/comments/4dpnuf/oculus/,"- ***Codename:***  Oculus

- ***Full Name:*** Jack Taylor

- ***Age:*** 24

- ***Power-*** [Heat Beam Emission](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Heat_Beam_Emission): He is able to generate concentrated beams of heat and light from his body. The beams appear from his fingertips.  He is able to generate up to two beams at once, one from each pointer finger. He can also generate optical beams from his eyes, like Cyclops.  When the beams are at their weakest, the temperature is at about 100-200 degrees F. The highest temperature is about 2200.   The range is about 500 meters at their weakest to 10 meters at the strongest.  They can also act as slight concussion beams, but require more concentration to do so.  He is immune to his own heat.  The beams produce a bright red light.

- ***Power Drawbacks-*** He needs to concentrate to use his powers. The beams are created by converting energy into heat, so he needs to consume thousands of calories a day in order to create the heat. Blasting the beams for too long drains his energy and makes him fatigued. He starts to get headaches as he starts using his power more and more, which make it hard to concentrate if he uses his beams for a long time. He often needs to buy new glasses if he forgets to take them off then using this ocular beams (they melt). Due to this, he carries around spares. Using his ocular beam tints everything a bright red and makes him lose vision for a few moments.

- ***Appearance-*** Tan and blue eyed, with dark messy hair.  His super suit, which he always wears, looks like nothing more than a dark blue trench coat over jeans and a black tee.  However, the trench coat and clothes are braided out of carbon fiber, making them ultra-resilient. He wears a pair of dark blue glasses.

- ***Personality*** Tries to come off as stoic, fun loving but tries to act serious. Quiet until you get to know him, loud once you do. Tries to fit in. Smart, and kind of bookish. Loves to eat. Has trust issues.  He tends to stutter if he gets emotional or nervous.

- ***Weapon-*** A Magnifying glass that attaches to his wrist and a small knife. 

- ***Backstory-*** When Jack was 6 months old, he was found abandoned in front of the local hospital with nothing but a note that said “Take care of my little boy.” He spent his childhood tossed around between various foster homes, finally settling with Greg and Marlene Taylor of Muncie, Indiana. He was bullied all throughout his school career: first for being from a foster home, then for living with the most overbearing couple known to man. They were sweet, but gave him the most sheltered existence ever. They would treat him well enough, but would never let him go anywhere. They were the best family he ever knew, but their dynamic seemed a little different than that of other families. Despite the outward appearance, there was obvious tension between the couple. One day, upon returning from school, he found a police barricade set up all around his house and people everywhere. Bodies were being carried out in stretchers by somber men in police uniforms. There had been a murder-suicide. Greg had shot Marlene 7 times in the chest, then turned the shotgun on himself.

 After that, the cycle started once more. For the next 8 years, he lived with the Kings. Despite their regal name, they were anything but. He’d walk home to find them smoking on the couch while watching reality TV, or downing a bottle of vodka. He would be beaten almost daily, often for reasons like not being able to buy alcohol for them or for not having any money to spend on drugs. As soon as he turned 18, he high tailed it out of there and into his own house.

 Due to his harsh upbringing, he became interested in the purity and consistent nature of hard sciences. He eventually became a genius at psychics. He graduated with high honors as a physics major at Indiana University, and was immediately accepted into Booster Tech Industries as a graduate intern. He worked with laser technology. One day, he remembers walking home from his internship holding a sandwich and a bag of chips. The next thing he knew, he was sitting in Doctor J’s base.

4dpo6e,1,2016-04-07,Ichor,AccioIcarus,AccioIcarus,https://www.reddit.com/r/AccioIcarus/comments/4dpo6e/ichor/,"Name: Sam Sharma

Codename: Ichor

Age: 20

 [Appearance:](http://i.imgur.com/a69IyUm.png) 

* Hair: Black, long, messy,
* Eyes: Dark Brown, hint of gold. They appear to be fully gold through his suit.
* Skin: light brown
* Body: Thin, lean and wiry, somewhat tall.  He has some scars on his body from his time kidnapped.
* [Supersuit:](https://i.imgur.com/BBsBgyF.png)  His supersuit is lightly armored with tiny gaps for the blood to flow through. His armored gloves have separated fingers, allowing him to have greater control of his blood manipulation. His legs are a little more armored because the majority of his attacks go through his hands.  The feet of his soles are made of a rough metal in order to get better grip on slick surfaces.

* When not wearing his suit, he likes to wear a graphic t-shirt and jeans.

Personality: Despite his macabre power, he is usually really happy and enjoys having fun and goofing off. He has a very odd sense of humor, and tends to speak first and think later.  Kind of nerdy as well, and loves videogames. He often doesn't know how to interact around people and can come off as a goofy slacker.  Despite this, he can be very serious if need be.  He’s a bit of a loner, but he can be really close to those he becomes friends with.  He's very trusting towards people he's become acquainted with.

Backstory: Growing up in Florida to immigrant parents, Sam was an outcast.  Despite being born and raised in Florida, he was always the foreign kid.  He didn't have many friends, either.  Except for a select few, everyone saw him as that one weird brown kid that didn’t know how to talk to people.  Instead, he turned to science and books.  He’d spend his days in the fantasy land of a book or game, or researching a new theory in biochemistry.  As time went on, he cultivated a reputation as the resident nerd of the school.  
All that changed when he was 13 years old, when Mexico and Canada declared war.  Like pretty much every place close to the borders, he was caught in the crossfire.  Suddenly, Canadian sympathizers were accusing him of helping Mexico.  Despite not actually being Mexican, he was caught up in Anti-Mexican sentiment due to his looks.  This drove him closer into his research, where he spent most of his time.  He graduated high school at the age of 17 and immediately began an internship with Booster Tech in the biological research division, where he studied biology based powers for potential artificial power creation.  

 The next year, war broke out once again: the Mexican-Canadian war became a world war when more countries joined in to support their allies. Living in Florida, he was all too aware of the effects of the war.  This time, it was the other side that hated him.  One day, while walking back to his place from work, he was ambushed by men shouting at him in Spanish.  When he woke up, he was more than 4000 miles away in Spain.  He spent the few weeks as a human punching bag for Spanish nationalists before breaking out.  

One day, upon waking up in the dark, humid cell that he was being kept in, something clicked in him.  He could feel liquid rushing through his body, pulsing with every beat his heart took.  After cutting his hand on a particularly sharp rock, he noticed that the cut on his hand wasn’t bleeding red.  It was covered with a shimmering golden substance.  His very blood itself had changed.  After a week or two of constant practice, he was able to control his new powers with some confidence.  The very next day, he escaped in a surprise attack.  Not one person was spared.

After a few uneasy weeks of blending in to the surrounding area and adjusting to his new life as a super, he received the news: The war was finally over.  Then, a few weeks later came another surprise: A large aircraft carrier had docked itself in Vigo.  It was definitely not a Spanish model ship.  His new neighbors had tensed up.  Did the ship not get the message that the war was over?  After a few days came another surprise: the identity of the sailors.  Emboldened by this new opportunity, Sam went to go check it out.  Finally, he would have a chance to be where he belonged.

_____
Power: Hemokinesis.

He can shape, control, and manipulate blood. He is even able to compact and crystallize the blood. He possesses overactive Bone Marrow, which replenishes the blood at faster rates than what would be normal. He has some conscious control of the blood while it is still inside his body, and is able to manipulate the flow of blood to different areas of the body. He is able to use this to bring more oxygen to different parts of the body to rapidly increase healing in some areas at the expense of others. Due to his mutation, his blood is an extremely efficient carrier of oxygen and an efficient carrier of nutrients. He is able to pull the blood straight from the pores of his skin.  The blood that he uses in battle is a golden color rather than a dark-red, as a result of his mutations. He uses his Hemokinesis in four main ways:

* Blood Blaster: He is able to shoot blood bullets of different sizes and shapes from his hands. This is one of his most used attacks, and can fire at speeds up to that of a Sub Machine Gun (about 1000 RPM) At low speeds he is able to change the direction of the bullet in midair. However, the blood cannot be reused once it hits its target.
* Blood Blade: He is able to create blades of varying size and shape out of blood that can attach to various body parts. He is able to create a sort of inner webbing in the blade to minimize blood loss while extending the blade. The blades are about as sharp and durable as swords, and can break. The broken end is still controllable, but it is difficult to turn it hard again.
* Blood Bulwark: He is able create protective armor out of the blood. The armor is as tough as steel and can be detached from his skin to form a mobile shield. He is able to create the armor on his arms, legs, or head. He often uses it on his arms as kind of an accompaniment to the protection already offered by the guards on the Katar that he uses.
* Blood Bullwhip: He is able to elongate his blood armor into a flexible whip that extends out of the front of his hands. The whip is about as tough as leather and is used to hold on to objects. He can also harden the end into a long bat or a spike, but it isn’t as effective as a weapon because it stays flexible. He prefers to use the blood bullets as a last resort.

Drawbacks: His Hemokinesis requires relatively warm temperatures due to him needing to maintain his body heat, so he is weakened considerably by cold temperatures. He finds it hard to use his blood manipulation in the cold because doing so drastically lowers his body temperature.  He can only manipulate his own blood or fluid that has been in contact with his own blood. With the latter, however, he has diminished control (about half as much control). He is unable to redirect that blood back inside his body, so it is lost after battle. He must replenish the blood naturally after battle through eating and resting. Because he is forced to use his own blood when battling, he has to be really creative about how to use it to minimize blood loss. He has a large appetite as a result of his taxing powers, so he is constantly seen eating or drinking something. When healing himself, he is not able to use external hemokinesis. Healing himself requires him to concentrate on the healing, so it is reserved for small injuries outside of immediate battling.

 The golden blood that he uses in battle is very distinctive and can be identified easily. 

Resistances: He is resistant to heat to a small extent.  He is resistant to slashing damage due to his blood closing up the wound easily

Weapon: He owns a [pair of Katar](https://i.imgur.com/JmKcRNE.jpg) that he uses as a short-range weapon and to extend the use of his powers.  

Special Skills: He is a good strategist and is an expert at biology and biochemistry/chemistry.  He is good at street fighting, but has no formal practice.

4dpozx,1,2016-04-07,Area to ask for at a large company for an internship.,SafetyNerd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dpozx/area_to_ask_for_at_a_large_company_for_an/,"So I (junior CS undergrad) have an internship at a very large company and basically have my pick of what area to work in. I have done a lot of web-stuff (full stack) before and want to try something else (plus I want to avoid doing CSS and templates all summer which I fear might happen as it did at a previous internship last fall). However, other than that preference (though I wouldn't really mind doing the backend) I'm not sure what are I should ask for. 

They have basically every mainstream language (C#, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, etc) which you can rank and also basically every mainstream application domain (Web Front, Web Back, iOS, Android, Desktop, Databases, Dev-Ops, etc) which you can also rank. I'm not entirely sure what criteria I should use to make my decision. Is there some combination that would be particularly marketable and/or educational? I'm interested in data oriented (so maybe python and databases) stuff but learning more about something I can pursue on my own like Android would be cool too (that was one of the reasons I got into web).

4dq0bg,102,2016-04-07,Incapable to turn off a printer,d4v2d,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4dq0bg/incapable_to_turn_off_a_printer/,"Hello TFTS,
&lt;insert first time poster bla bla&gt; &lt;insert English not being my first language bla bla&gt;
I work on a IT servicedesk for about 7 months now as an internship.. Yesterday we had some troubles with our Labelprinters (These are about as big, if not bigger, as your usual deskjet printer, and are a complete fucking disaster to work with.) Somehow the network configuration of printerY screwed up, all the sudden DHCP was turned on, this results in the ERP system not being able to print store labels or price tags. (Since the print server can't find printerY on it's static IP) 

With ease I found the IP that was assigned and remoted in to printerY webinterface, here I changed the IP.. Now comes the part where I fucked up: The store has another labelprinter(X) which IP ends .51. I meant to change the IP of printerY that had DHCP on to end .52 as defined on the print server.. I made a typo and saved the configuration. Great, now we have an IP conflict and both printers cannot be used. 

I phone call the manager of the store an appologize for the inconvience and ask him to unplug printerX that used to be working fine(ending in .51) so there wouldn't be two devices with the same IP. He asks one of the employees to walk up to printerX and unplug it. After about 30 seconds this seems to have happend, I remote in to the webinterface of PrinterY again to undo my stupidity.. Heh, I time out again. I call the store again and ask them to turn off printerX, they do so but the same thing happens again. 

Turns out employee was pulling the powercord, waiting 15 seconds and plugging it back in before I could undo my changes. 

**TL;DR made a configuration error on a printer resulting in an IP conflict - Asked store to unplug one of two printers so I can resolve the ip conflict - Employee keeps powercycling instead of turning it off.**"
4dq7zc,1,2016-04-07,I'm scared I'll never get a real job,chillbitte,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4dq7zc/im_scared_ill_never_get_a_real_job/,"So, a little background: I'm a 20-year-old college junior in the middle of getting an Environmental Policy degree from one of the better-ranked schools in my home state. (I was only 17 when I started college, so I didn't want to move too far away.) I'm fairly successful at school: I have a 3.55 GPA, I'm a good writer and critical thinker, and I'm involved in campus activities. College has been good. But as graduation draws closer, I'm getting more and more anxious about the future.

These days, it seems like every time I read the news-- or even go on the internet-- I see tons of thinkpieces about how terrible the job market is for millennials, how millennials are lazy/entitled, how anything except a STEM degree is useless, how college degrees are worthless in general, etc. Now, I know all of these commentaries are somewhat exaggerated, but honestly they're starting to take a toll on me. It's really hard to constantly hear that I'm probably not going to get a decent job after I graduate, that I might have to move back home and live with my parents, and that I fucked up my chances of ever making money by not majoring in a STEM field. (Seriously, not everyone is cut out to be an engineer. The bridge I built in middle school physics class fell apart immediately.) People keep telling me to have a positive attitude about the whole thing and I'm trying, but these messages are extremely discouraging.

To top my anxieties off, I can't seem to hold down a job. I'm currently doing an editorial internship with my school's environmental blog, which I really enjoy, but the likelihood that there will ever be enough money in the budget to pay me for that kind of work is almost zero. So far, I've had two paying jobs-- one at my school's cafeteria (which hires almost any student who asks for work), and one at a summer camp. I really enjoyed my camp job; I was originally hired as a substitute counselor and moved to full-time staff after my coworker injured her foot. While working there, I built a lot of positive relationships with the campers (several repeatedly said that I was their favorite counselor), and I felt like I got along well with my coworkers. My boss never gave me any negative feedback, and she praised me for being able to calm down upset campers and work through difficult problems.

I guess the straw that broke the camel's back, and the reason I'm writing this post, is that today I learned I won't be getting my camp job back. I reapplied several weeks ago (even though I worked there last summer, they require returning staff to fill out an application), and after not hearing anything back I sent my boss an email to make sure she got the application. She replied, ""Hi chillbitte, Omg, it totally disappeared into the void. It was mistakenly assigned to the Oakland CA location?? When I searched your name it came up though. I will follow up ASAP!"" Not even three hours later, I received a generic form email saying, ""Thank you for your interest in continuing to work with (summer camp name). We truly appreciate the contributions you made last summer. At this time, however, we are going in another direction for the summer staff position."" No explanation, no feedback on my performance. There was never an indication that I was unlikely to get my job back, yet just three hours after looking at my application (which I felt good about), my boss decided that she wasn't going to hire me again. I sent her another email politely requesting feedback on my summer performance, but she hasn't answered yet.

I'm feeling really discouraged because of this. As far as I know, I'm one of only two staff members to reapply (the other person was rehired.) If I can't even get a summer job at a place where I've already worked, where my performance was at least good enough to avoid negative feedback, and where there are very few returning staff members, how am I supposed to get a ""real"" job to support myself in the future? I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong, or why my boss didn't just tell me that my chances of getting my job back were low. To be honest, I feel like a total failure-- like my degree isn't going to make any money and like I'm such a loser that I can't even keep a temporary camp job. I'm really scared that I won't be able to get a job this summer, and worried that the potential gap in my resume will also hurt my prospects in the future.

TL;DR between news about the shitty job market for millennials and my inability to keep even a low-paying summer job, I'm having a bit of an existential crisis"

Since I can find no records anywhere of a Carol McCombie, I have come to believe this (relatively recent) case has been ""covered up"", due to the obvious ""lose ends"". To me, this is horrific, and it is worth risking losing my job (although I doubt anyone will notice this account for a long time) to tell poor Carol's tale.

Hey, new neighbours!
Welcome to the building! I hope you like it here as much as I do. Some people seem to think that us city slickers aren’t as friendly as country folks, but here we're just as friendly as anywhere else.
Just in case nobody told you, trash day is Wednesday, and you can get these green bags to put recycling in (if you want any right now, just pop round to apartment 732!)

P.S. In the basement laundry the machine closest to the door eats socks. You have been warned!

Dear Mark and Carol,
Please don't think I’m creepy! I got your names off your mailbox. I was just wondering if you’d like to swap spare keys? I wouldn’t want to be locked out of my own apartment, haha!

Dear Mark, Carol and Maisy,
Merry Christmas!
I hope you like the card! It’s funny, isn’t it, how so many people seem to want to spend Christmas in a snowy cabin like that. Wouldn’t it be so much cosier in an apartment, like ours, insulated (literally and figuratively) by happy families?
From Rich Candy
P.S. I overheard Carol talking about Maisy – so that’s how I know her name, I’m not just stalking you!


2 February
Dear Carol,
I’m afraid I have a dirty little secret to confess! I assume you’ve already looked in the bag, and you’re probably wondering what on earth could satisfactorily explain me having so much of your clothing!
Well, here it is: sometime before Christmas, I was cleaning my laundry in the communal room, and I must have been in a great hurry because somehow I managed to empty the drier into my laundry basket without noticing that those were your clothes. Not mine!
Anyway,  it took an embarrassingly long time to notice my mistake – I admit, I’m not always the best at staying on top of chores!
Hopefully you’ll just find solace in the fact that you eventually got your clothes back. I still haven’t found mine, haha!
Love, Richard Candy,

P.S. I think you should know, it is starting to come across as weird that you won’t speak to me. But don’t worry – I know how tough it is to be shy!


14 February
Dear Carol,
I feel secret admirers are somewhat outdated, don’t you? Therefore I hope you’ll forgive my decision to clearly reveal my emotions. I can easily see how happy your marriage is, and so please don’t worry – I know you love your husband, and wouldn’t want to leave him. Don’t feel pressured, but that just makes me want you more.
However, every single day I see you, I wonder, does anyone appreciate you like I do? The universe could not possibly adequately show its gratefulness for your beauty, grace and charisma. So I decided, a long time ago, to save you up some flowers, (I’ve been planning this since November!)
I hope it isn’t too weird that the roses are all dead. Since they’re so pretty, they’re so expensive, but I thought it would be sweet to give you a hundred, so I’ve been creeping around florists, and shoplifting for months. I hung each of them up to dry. That's how much I love you. All the effort is worth it whenever I imagine you opening your front door to a sweetened rustling and a torrent of red. And then you’ll have to dig though all that falling crimson, wondering just who cares enough to do all this, and eventually you’ll find this card...
It was me! I am the one who loves you!

Dear Carol, 
I hope I’m not embarrassing you with my determined notes, but I know not to take your lack of response personally! It's okay to be shy! I know how hormones can affect a girl in your condition.
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I’m free to babysit any night of the week. You seem pretty tried, and it's not surprising, running after a four year old when that baby must be due any week now!
Lots of Love

Dear Carol, 
Boy, is this embarrassing. I’m not really sure how to breech the topic, so I suppose it's best to be blunt. 
You will probably want to consider being more diligent about closing your curtains in the evenings. Of course, I was personally mortified to notice your nakedness, but it is my understanding that there is a building across the street with a very clear view, and I assume that is disturbing to you.

My Dearest Carol,
Finally, I’m sure! Aside from a declaration of my love, that poem was a... a kind of test. Judging from the lack of angry husbands smashing down my door, you’re just as keen as me to keep us a secret. Not that us has been allowed to develop much! I’ve kept my eye on you for a very long time, and recently I can’t help but notice the way you can’t look away from me either! Isn’t it so sexy, exchanging wide eyed looks in secret like this? I love these early morning ‘connections’ when you’re walking Maisy too and from preschool. I love watching you tense up in anticipation as the elevator doors open to the lobby, and you see me. I think you can tell I’ve been working out, right?
All my love,
Dominic Candy, no 732
P.S. the offer to come round my apartment still stands at any time, by the way!!
P.P.S. I’ve had to change my name suddenly, but don’t worry about it, just think of me as Dom now!

Dear Mrs McCombie
We are writing to formally acknowledge your harassment complaints beyond your official oral complains of April 2nd. We sincerely regret to inform you that we could not identify any local man named either Richard or Dominic Candy, nor could we identify any current occupants of apartment 732 in your building. According to the records belonging to your landlord, that particular residence has been unoccupied for over a year.
We assume this comes as a shock and we are immensely sorry, but due to the confusion involved in this case we have been forced to cease our investigation, at least until such time at which more information presents itself.
We encourage you to continue to record any correspondence from your harasser. If you believe you have further information regarding your case, please immediately notify your local precinct. If, at any point, you feel your safety is at risk, do not hesitate to call 911.
Yours sincerely,
Lieut. Nicolas Waterman

Carol

Accent wall papered in teal flowers,

Flowing through my mind for hours, 

Spent in my cube version of your room,

White walls make a peculiar tomb,

You have more than a hundred knick-knacks,

While I only speak with an axe,

Your daughter’s room, yellow, blue,

Mine is empty, lonely too,

Nursery decorated with Ted bears,

My cupboard is full of prayers,

But my closet is full of dried flowers,

Yours’ hold a fascists trousers.

Dominic, 732

Dearest Carol
I know, I know – it must be dangerous to leave notes stuck to your door this often – who knows what your husband would do! But I just couldn’t let your generosity be overlooked. You donated more than three hundred and fifty dollars worth of electronics to charity this week – who could overlook that?! I swear, no one else in the whole city is so selfless. I know I should be offended that you gave away my gift, but I am simply blown away by your charitable nature.
I worry if maybe you only gave it away because you were scared of your husband. I hope not! It would be horrific of him to hide your goodness from the world. And to keep such a treat from your children.
So much love, Dominic Candy, no 732


29 May
Dear Carol,
I’m so, so, sorry, Carol, I know you’ll hate this. But just try to remember how much it would hurt both of us to keep our love a secret, and I hope you’ll understand.
It was difficult – please don’t think I’m trying to show you up as a mother! Quite the opposite, I’ve been planning this ever since your bastard husband sent the cops round my apartment in April (can you believe he did that?! Did you even know?) but you’re such a good mother. I can’t wait for you to have my kids!
Anyway, don’t worry! Maisy is with me!
Looks like you’ve finally got an excuse to visit apartment 732 ;)
Love from Dom


5 June 
Dear Mark,
I’m sorry for the sudden gap in my correspondence.  Of course, that cannot compare with my regrets regarding that night with Carol.
Words cannot express my sorrow. I am so sorry, I genuinely believed that your wife loved me, as I did her. Obviously I was mistaken.
It was this belief which engendered me to commit acts which the law technically calls kidnapping. I do not agree with this terminology,  but I apologise for any distress which may have been caused by me taking your loved ones.
I am, in fact, rather sorry I took Maisy in the first place. Given what I now know, this must have cause Carol incomprehensible fear.
I am also sorry that I could not initially comprehend Carol’s emotions towards me. It must be understood that at this point I had spent several months dwelling on my dreams, of Carol and I absconding with both the children. I thought our lives would be perfect. Therefore, I find it quite acceptable that upon her (rather violent!) entrance to my home, I, in my shock, fought back, and I even feel justified in my choice to transport her to my second apartment across the street, and to transport her body later on.
It has been rather frustrating to me that no media outlet (to my knowledge) has commended me for my dedication in keeping Carol alive, which resulted in at least 36 hours of further consciousness. I felt this was a considerable achievement, given her physical state (I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but during the majority of that period her skull had the crushable consistency of a 3D puzzle. I should be in medical textbooks.)
Anyway, if you can accept my apology, both me and Maisy would appreciate it if you could publish a press release acknowledging my kindness. For example, even if you cannot forgive my continued custody of Maisy, I believe our relationship would be greatly improved if she realised the sacrifice I made when I left Ben behind. I think that if you just tell her it’s okay to call me Daddy, she’ll accept me and be happy. 
Yours sincerely
Dominic Spencer

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!
____________________________________________________
This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

The reason why I say sort of, is that it's for a family business.  I do all of the IT work here, I do a fairly decent job I guess.  I build the computers, manage the networks, the printers, yadda yadda, basically anything you would think the only IT person in a small business with 8-10 employees would do.  It's a Doctor's office, so I manage the EMR system and did some work on Meaningful Use netting us a good chunk of change.  I am pretty well versed on medical coding, billing, EMR systems, etc., but my problem is I really don't want to work in this field.  Not saying I wouldn't, but the medical field is brutal from what I see.  I am not sure if the IT departments within larger businesses are maybe a little more slow paced, but I am not necessarily intrigued by what I am seeing so far.  I have a lot of job security, obviously, with it being a family business.  

I am studying on the side doing small courses on Python Programming on Coursera and studying for a Network+ certification, as well as the Server Infrastructure part of the MCSE.  Ultimately I'd like to have a career in IT, but I'd like to write a particular piece of software that I have been thinking about, I just don't have the technical skills to do it.  I do not really think that I want to be a software developer, but I would like to know how to do it so that I can write applications for myself.  This has left me split between MCSE and MCSD.  I have not made up my mind on which one I'd like to try to get, or maybe both.  I am also light studying some programming languages like C+ and Python.

Without writing too long of a post, I am trying to get some advice on my projected career path.  

Basically, I want to get my Network+ so that I can have a bit of a leg to stand on to get into a career IT position.  I am thinking that my experience in small business might at least give me the ability to stay out of the entry level positions, though I am not sure.  I would either do that, and continue working here and try for some type of internship, or work with SmartSource or Valcom doing contracted IT work by email.  While doing this I would be working on passing either the MCSE or the MCSD, and once doing that, I'd like to work in the field for awhile, and move on to getting a CS degree.  Trying to see if maybe I could get an employer to pay for it.  I think this is obviously a long term path, but I wanted to know what people think about it, and help me tweak it and tell me where I might run into issues.

3 weeks ago I had 2 internship offers.

 One position was with firm A, and was relevant to what I studied, relevant to my previous experience, not very prestigious, mundane but stable internship.

One position was with firm B, and was totally irrelevant to what I studied, not a very prestigious position, but had all expenses (flight+accommodation) paid to go to Ireland (I live in Australia), for a month. I think having an all expenses paid month abroad is a pretty big deal.

I chose A... I wish I chose B because I feel that not everything is about career progression, and I should have gone with a 1 month all expenses paid to Ireland, because I have never been there and would have loved to experience the new culture. I have never left my city in Australia to go abroad before.... I have always been stuck in this country for the past 20 years of my life.

 When I was younger I told myself I will swear off the rat race. I chose A because I wanted to get a job in that field upon graduation. Only now when I'm clearheaded, I think that I don't want some glorified clerical job, I want to travel goddammit.

I know this is very insignificant based on the other problems here.. But I keep thinking.. What could have been.

I am currently in a rather difficult situation and would love some insight from more knowledgeable people. So currently I have two main internship opportunities, one in London and one in Hong Kong. I am a UK citizen however I have been doing a year exchange in HK.

The internship in London is with IBM and I am currently at the matching stage which is their final stage where I would wait until they call me for a phone (business) interview or outright offer me a position. This stage has no time frame as they told me that it could take a while and to remain patient.

The internship in HK is a 2013 start up that deals in cryptocurrencies/advisory services. Both placements would be software development. The HK internship has just emailed me with an offer which I have to accept/decline by 11th April. The problem I have is that I would rather go with IBM as a priority. I also wouldn't want to accept the HK placement as a safe choice to cancel it if I got the IBM offer because they would start with visa applications when I accepted. So if I decided to cancel that would be really bad.

What should I do? My sister told me to email IBM and say that I have another offer and worded correctly it would make me seem like a desirable candidate. I would really appreciate any feedback you have for me. Thanks!"

Despite consistently scoring the top grade in a certain prof's classes, he offered internships and assistant positions to everyone but me. I was the only person in my class who had to search for a supervisor instead of having a thesis topic literally thrown at them. This worked out for the best at least, as I had an awesome supervisor with a unique approach and definitely more investment in students than the other supervisors. She also happened to be the only woman qualified enough to supervise masters students in my department. All the women of this department (post docs mainly) have had to make significant sacrifices in their personal lives that evidently the men of equal qualification did not have to make. These examples I mention don't even begin to touch on the sexism experienced from my male classmates.

A few months in, she moved far away for a short internship and we long-distanced it for that time.  Now she's living 3 hours away for another job more in her major.  We see each other on the weekends.  

I visited her while she was away for the internship and she told me she loved me.  I was unprepared for it.  My emotions move at a glacial pace, so I wasn't anywhere near that place yet and I told her so.  She was disappointed, but understanding.  This is her first real relationship and I was wondering if she was being a bit starry-eyed. 

Now we are six months on from there and things have come to a head.  I still don't have the kind of feelings she has for me.  I think the right thing to do is to break up, but I can't figure out why.  

We have lots of fun when we're together.  She and I have similar interests and enjoy similar activities.  When we're together, we have frequent sex.  I care about how she feels (which makes this whole thing more difficult for me).  We have similar ideas about what kinds of places we want to live and what we want to do when we get there.  

But, despite all of this excellent compatibility, I still don't love her and I still can't see us living together.  

I could use some help figuring out what's missing.  It seems odd and worrying to me that I've loved women before who were much less easy to be with.  

She and I have talked about this and it usually ends with her in tears.  She has some self-esteem issues.  (She is actively hunting for a therapist, but doesn't have money for one and has terrible insurance.)  She is very worried that she is somehow unlovable and I want to let her know that isn't the case, even though I don't.  

Can you help me sort out what's going on and what I can say to her?

Hi all,

I'm graduating this May. The startup I intern at has offered me a job. Now everything is great but the pay is a little low. 

It seems to me that 50-55k is good for starting out in Pittsburgh (would you agree?). I was offered just a little under 50k. What I would call a trivial amount. Now, going to 55k...well that's a bigger gap there.

So I want to ask 55k and take 50k. How do I take myself up? I already know the system. I've learnt a lot this past several months. I enjoy the job, the company, etc. Is that what I say? Like I don't wanna walk in like I'm some asshole who thinks he's a genius programmer, I'm not. But I do think I'm worth enough to get the newbie average.

Worst part is. I'm doing this in person, since I work here all the time. I'm pretty damn nervous.

I think I am an hsp but not one that is very good at reading people, with the exception of my girlfriend. 

Anyways, I just got done with a yearly performance review and left it a bit frustrated. It is the worst one I have ever gotten. It was still good, I was ranked average, but I feel like I have been seriously put through the ringer in the last year. I think if my workload hadn't been so high that my review would have been better. I also feel like there are other employees with a lower workload that will get just as good of a review potentially better. 

I think that some of the difficulty comes from concerns being minimized a bit or my workload being minimized. I spoke to my supervisor a couple of times through the year about concern about keeping up with things and he has told me that he needs to even things out a bit and even admitted to me that he needs to give one of the other engineers more responsibilities.he literally said he has been giving him a bit of a free ride. But I haven't seen much come out of it. He put that other employee on a couple of my conference calls, but didn't give him anymore aside from the calls. I have even gained 2 more regular calls since then. 

My supervisor also when I mention some things I am working on says ""oh that should calm down soon"" or ""you don't have much to do on that"". Things have slowed down a bit for one project for a short bit of time but I am still working on things and it will pick back up a lot pretty soon here. My supervisor even admitted that one if the projects blew up into way more than he anticipated even though I told him that one alone takes up most of my time. 

I really don't know what expects of me and why he doesn't concern himself much about evening things out a bit. I was so swamped that I made a mistake on something that I am lucky didn't turn out to cost all that much to fix. It could have been really big. He has mentioned a couple of times that he is glad to have me because I take intiative and he knows it will get done right. Maybe he assumes things are easy for me and doesn't realize how much it takes. 

The thing is though he started off as an engineer, he should know a bit of what it takes. And i feel like everyone else knows I am loaded up. When our group has gone over project responsibilities there has been a few people make comments about my workload. The intern comes up to me asking to help because he needs stuff to do and said I am the busiest engineer. 

I am so baffled though, partially because I never trust my own opinion. I figure there is something that I don't know or maybe I am not good enough at my job or something. Some people say to manage your manager but to do that I would be competing with one person in particular that overstates everything. I am not that person though. Maybe I need to be a bit more like that or start disapponting people to get a fair shot. I will not get into an exaggeration competition. That will take everything I have. 

To wrap it up, i know it isn't a good environment for me. There are fumes that literally make me feel sick and cause asthma issues, but I am looking at a major career change that i have no idea what it is yet and will take some time. 

I need a way to keep my sanity in the mean time. 

Any help would be appreciated and I apologize for the rant.

4drt4q,3,2016-04-07,What do you think about my projected IT career path?,Slickester,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4drt4q/what_do_you_think_about_my_projected_it_career/,"I am a 30 year old who is sorta the Director of an IT Department. The reason why I say sort of, is that it's for a family business. I do all of the IT work here, I do a fairly decent job I guess. I build the computers, manage the networks, the printers, yadda yadda, basically anything you would think the only IT person in a small business with 8-10 employees would do. It's a Doctor's office, so I manage the EMR system and did some work on Meaningful Use netting us a good chunk of change. I am pretty well versed on medical coding, billing, EMR systems, etc., but my problem is I really don't want to work in this field. Not saying I wouldn't, but the medical field is brutal from what I see. I am not sure if the IT departments within larger businesses are maybe a little more slow paced, but I am not necessarily intrigued by what I am seeing so far. I have a lot of job security, obviously, with it being a family business.

I am studying on the side doing small courses on Python Programming on Coursera and studying for a Network+ certification, as well as the Server Infrastructure part of the MCSE. Ultimately I'd like to have a career in IT, but I'd like to write a particular piece of software that I have been thinking about, I just don't have the technical skills to do it. I do not really think that I want to be a software developer, but I would like to know how to do it so that I can write applications for myself. This has left me split between MCSE and MCSD. I have not made up my mind on which one I'd like to try to get, or maybe both. I am also light studying some programming languages like C+ and Python.
Without writing too long of a post, I am trying to get some advice on my projected career path.

Basically, I want to get my Network+ so that I can have a bit of a leg to stand on to get into a career IT position. I am thinking that my experience in small business might at least give me the ability to stay out of the entry level positions, though I am not sure. I would either do that, and continue working here and try for some type of internship, or work with SmartSource or Valcom doing contracted IT work by email. While doing this I would be working on passing either the MCSE or the MCSD, and once doing that, I'd like to work in the field for awhile, and move on to getting a CS degree. Trying to see if maybe I could get an employer to pay for it. I think this is obviously a long term path, but I wanted to know what people think about it, and help me tweak it and tell me where I might run into issues.

What do you think, Reddit?"

Any advice or someone else have this happen?",Feelsgood767,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4drx9s/old_manager_reached_out_of_the_blue_about_a_job/,"Recently out of the blue, my old manager when I was an intern reached out to me. They moved to my town and work in my field for the local government as a manager. They asked if I am interested in the position, which was work I am quite comfortable with. They were a good manger too, so I sent my resume and we scheduled an interview.

I like to plan, should I be expecting this to go through? I have only been at my current job almost 2 years. It almost seems too good to be true. Also what should I ask for, the range is $50-74k with good benefits. I currently make in the low $50s and think I am a bit underpaid. Should I go for low $60s since they reached out to me."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[It would be a dream job of mine to do what you do; freelance write (I am more privy to creative works\) and travel the world and attempt to enjoy all of the amazing offerings it bears.  My question is, what are the best initial steps towards making such a lifestyle a reality? What did you do before shipping off on your endless voyage and would you do anything differently?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tt2w7?context=5)|The initial steps that I took when getting started as a freelance writer was to create profiles on all of the writing sites such as Upwork and PeoplePerHour. I didn't have any previous writing experience, so I applied for any writing job I could and I took the bottom of the barrel jobs that really didn't pay very much money. I did great work on them, so that I could have at least something to include in my portfolio. Once I started to get a few things in my portfolio, getting the next jobs became a little bit easier.  I built the freelancing work up while still working part time - I would just write in the evenings and weekends. Eventually the freelance work started to grow to the point where I could go part time at my day job, then a few months later I was able to quite the day job entirely and make a full time income from writing.
 |Would I do anything differently? No, I don't think I would. The last few years haven't been perfect and we have gone through good and bad times and made mistakes, but I really have learned so much from everything I have experienced. I wouldn't want to change a thing, as I wouldn't be who I am today without the good and the bad. 
[Where does a freelance writer find the best bang for the buck?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1todjs?context=5)|When it comes to a destination that is very affordable but very rich in travel experiences to write about, you can't beat Southeast Asia. Of course, that means that there are a lot of other bloggers writing about it. There is also a lot of interest though.
[What's been your happiest moment while traveling, most humbling?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1todjs?context=5)|Back in 2011 we did what we called the ""Digital Nomad Experiment"" which was renting an apartment near the beach in the Algarve region of Portugal to try out this lifestyle and see if we could do it. When we realised it was working and that our dream could become reality, it was a very exciting time.
 |Most humbling? I think that seeing some of the poverty in certain countries was very humbling. It made us realise how fortunate most people are in the Western World, even if they are comparing themselves to their neighbours.
[How did you get started and how could i start? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tsiof?context=5)|I basically built up my freelance writing career while working a normal job (daycare). After a while I was making enough to go part time in my regular job and shortly after enough to quite and go full time freelance. This is the point where there was nothing stopping me from working on the road, so we decided to make it happen. I wrote a much more detailed post about it here: [How I Built a Successful Freelance Writing Business So I Could Work from Anywhere and Travel the World](http://global-goose.com/freelance-travel-the-world/)
 |Also, we have just launched a paid internship program on our blog. It's aimed at giving experience to novice travel bloggers and making our site more diverse. Check it out: [Global Goose Internship Program Launches](http://global-goose.com/announcement-global-goose-internship-program-launches/)
[Which is the longest journey you've been through train/road? You have a blog post about it perhaps?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tsq1a?context=5)|One of the longest journeys we were ever on was a 36 hour train ride from Winnipeg to Toronto. We boarded the train on Tuesday night and didn't get there until Thursday afternoon. :S.
[You staple diet?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tsq1a?context=5)|Our staple diet changes depending on the country we are in. Right now we are in Thailand, so it's a lot of rice and noodle dishes. Of course, we have favourite dishes that we always seek out when we can get them, like Indian curries and British meat pies. In Argentina we ate a LOT of steak and drank a lot of wine. 
[Where did you travel in Asia?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tpc3z?context=5)|In Asia we have been to India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Philippines, Hong Kong, Macau, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Sri Lanka.
[Any funny stories?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tpc3z?context=5)|A funny story that comes to mind is one that we were talking about today. We were in Sri Lanka during their New Year. We figured that there would be celebrations, so we went to a bar on the beach to have a few beers. There were a couple of people out, but the night was pretty tame so we went home around 1am. We just thought New Years in Sri Lanka wasn't much of a big deal.
[What was one of your greatest adventures thus far?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tohy9?context=5)|There are a lot to choose from!
 |There was the time we got [lost in the jungle in Malaysia](http://global-goose.com/destinations/asia-destinations/malaysia/lambir-hills-national-park/), took a [slow boat down the Amazon in Brazil](http://global-goose.com/a-guide-to-the-amazon-river-boat-between-manaus-and-belem-brazil/), [sailed from Colombia to Panama via the San Blas Islands](http://global-goose.com/colombia-panama-five-days-sailing-san-blas-islands/), hiked down into [Colca Canyon in Peru](http://global-goose.com/colca-canyon/) while being followed by a stray dog and the time we took a [4x4 across the salt flats in Bolivia](http://global-goose.com/salar-de-uyuni/). 
[Before you started your blog, what did you plan to do in life? When did you start your blog? And do you have any future plans except for traveling in the world? Thanks for the AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tst57?context=5)|I was totally freaked out about my future and what I was going to do with my life. I was pretty anxious and worried about making choices, but meeting Lee really helped with that. He was a calming influence on me and he really encouraged me to stop overthinking things and just put hard work into what I enjoyed.  We started the blog in 2011 - it's really grown and changed a lot since then! We still have a lot of work to do to get it to where we want it to be.  As for my future plans, we tend to take things one step at a time. However, we probably will settle at some point and maybe even have a family. That doesn't mean that travel has to spot, it just means that we will incorporate it into our lives in a way that works for the entire family. 
[Thanks for this answer! How old are you? And about Israel- have you been there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tuvcn?context=5)|I am 29. I was 22 when I went to New Zealand and this adventure began.
 |I haven't been to Israel... yet. :) However, we have met a lot of Israeli travellers in other parts of the world! 
[How do you afford to constantly travel? Where do you stay? What do you eat?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tkhk7?context=5)|We work. I'm a freelance writer and that provides the majority of our income. Lee also works remotely making websites.
 |Where we stay and eat depends on the place. We are currently in Thailand, a place we use as a central hub when travelling in South East Asia. We are staying in a guest house in central Bangkok for around $15 per night. You can get cheaper, but we like this one. It's pretty comfortable for the price and has reliable internet which is important for our work. We generally eat out, it's just cheaper to do that here. When we are in more expensive countries we tend to stay in private rooms in hostels that have kitchens to keep the cost down.
[What kind of things do you write about? Any jobs that I should look out for if I decide to travel and write?  P.s., I'm an undergrad from India!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1ttvil?context=5)|I write mostly about travel, but I also take on other projects as well. My advice when it comes to looking for writing jobs is to diversity when you start out and take any gigs that you can get. As you gain more experience you can start to establish yourself as an expert in a niche. Then, you will be able to market your experience and knowledge on a subject you are passionate about. 
[While working abroad sound like an awesome experience what downside have you encounter while traveling?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tke1n?context=5)|It's a rough job being my laptop, it gets banged around in transit, is exposed to extreme temperatures and gets a lot of use. We go through a lot of power cords. We learned the hard way never to put the laptop in checked baggage when one was smashed during a flight from Washington to Bangkok.
[Also if possible second question, what is the worst thing that has happened to you (laptop wise\)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tke1n?context=5)|As for the downsides... We really miss our friends and family when we are away and we often miss things such as birthdays, weddings and other events. I sometimes wish I could teleport myself around the world just for a night so we could be close to our loved ones on these occasions. 
[Do you guys go to any measures to get some fluency in the native tongue of where you're travelling to or more or less just figure things out when you get there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tlljg?context=5)|We try to make an effort to learn the basics of the native language such as ""hello"" and ""thank you"". However, we go to so many different countries that becoming fluent in all of them would be incredibly difficult. Luckily, English is spoken by many people all over the world - especially those who work in the travel industry.
 |When we were in South America it was mostly Spanish speaking countries for several months, so we managed to learn very basic child-like Spanish that got better with practice. By the end of our time there we were able to have simple conversations. 
[What places have you experienced the most racism?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tk754?context=5)|As two white travellers we are fortunate that we don't often experience much racism aimed against ourselves.
 |Lee's brother lives in Virginia and we noticed it was quite prevelent there. He's also from the north west of England where the odd pub racist is not at all uncommon.
 |You often notice it more in countries where you speak the language. Travelling through Brazil I felt it was very prevelent but could not fully understand interactions so could not really say.
[Prevalent*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tlm2x?context=5)|Thanks. I find myself typing pretty fast to keep up with these questions. 
[Which country had the friendliest locals?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4drav0/i_have_been_travelling_the_world_full_time_for/d1tqixa?context=5)|There are a few places that stand out in my mind, such as Colombia and Cambodia - but I think the friendliest was Sri Lanka. We were always greeted with big, welcoming smiles.
 |I think it might have been because there was significantly less tourism and travel in Sri Lanka in the recent past. It seemed like the people there were really excited to see visitors, rather than being jaded by them like some of the locals might be in other more popular destinations.

     I have an internship across the country this summer, and dont really feel like trying to ship my desktop, so I am looking for some games that would run on my laptop [i7 5600u @2.6 GHz, 8gb ram, intel hd 5500 integrated graphics, 256 GB ssd]. 

As for preferences, I am big into RPGs (fallout 3/nv/4, elderscrolls 3/4/5, darksouls). I really like games where I was able to get invested in who my character was (morrowind was the best at this). I also like linear FPS with exploration (metro, halflife, dishonored). I would also be open to MMOs, and I dont mind paying for a good experience, but I dont like pay to win. Any suggestions would be really appreciated. Thanks!

Some background: I'm at my second year at university, studying to become a computer engineer. I love my calculus classes, my physics classes and my programming classes. I can't get enough of learning more about the languages I know, but lately I've been feeling like the things I learned so far aren't useful, or are at a lower depth than necessary for the industry.

The languages I'm more comfortable experience are C and x86 Assembly. I've studied for a few months C#, C++, Java and Python,  but every time my interest fades, because I feel I'm just learning the basics and going nowhere and it impacts nothing on my life outside the university. I've considered applying to some internships in my area, but I feel like I know nothing that might be useful to someone.

I just want to make something using what I've learned that does something other than earn me a grade. I'm sorry for this rant, I just know what to do anymore.

1000$ USA

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Needs relatively good battery life, enough to last me throughout the school day.  

* **How important is weight to you?**
 I can take a decent amount of weight, just nothing overbearing.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows 10

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 N/A

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
Gaming, Netflix, Day to day school work.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 Total War, Xcom, eclectic range of steam games, often not too graphics intensive. The most taxing would probably be ARMA 3, as it seems to lag even on my desktop. If i can play all at medium-high graphics, I would be more than happy.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
No crazy looking laptops(Alien Ware),as I have to use it at Uni and summer internships, and do not want to attract attention. Solid build quality, never really cared for a touch screen, but I'm willing to look.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I'm currently eyeing the [Dell Inspiron i7559-763BLK 15.6""](http://amzn.com/B015PYYDMQ). I was wondering if I should wait for a new line a gaming laptops to be released? I am willing to do so if I would only have to wait a month or two, maybe even longer if suggested. Thanks before hand for the help!"

4dt8fb,1,2016-04-07,How to get into supply chain without a supply chain degree?,SocratesRevenge,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4dt8fb/how_to_get_into_supply_chain_without_a_supply/,"First, thank you for taking the time to read my post!  Any guidance you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

So, here is my current situation.  I am graduating with a degree in Technical and Professional Writing at the end of this month.  My work and internship experiences have been in marketing and research(with a touch of analytics).  Through work and other activities I've realized that my professional interests lie in supply chain rather than in communications and marketing.  I was wondering if anyone with experience could give me any guidance on how to enter this field.  

I am interested in hearing answers for these questions specifically:  

* Is it possible to get an entry-level position or internship without a supply chain bachelors or general business degree?  

* What would I have to do in order to get hired for those positions if not?

* Should I get a post-baccalaureate certificate from my undergrad university in additional to an APICS certification?

* Should I get a job as a warehouse associate while I look for entry-level jobs in specific areas like procurement and logistics?

* Are there any other things I can do to augment my experiences and resume for roles in supply chain?

* For those currently working in supply chain, what is your current role and what got you to that point?

Thank you!"

I responded with my availability, and I never heard back until about late last week. He asked me for my availability this week (it's now Thursday) and now that the week's almost over, he sent me another e-mail apologizing (again) and asking for my availability for next week. Once again, I sent him my availability. Is this a bad sign, or am I just overlooking things? I have other internship opportunities and interviews going on, I'm just not sure if I should consider this one or if I should follow-up or anything. 

Also, I did give very flexible availability times (about 3-4 hours out of 4 days of the week during business hours) - and basically one-hour blocks in between all of my classes.

Does anyone have any advice? Thanks! "
4dtdhg,7,2016-04-07,Mom does a lot of shady stuff to try to get me into a better college,amonaroll,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4dtdhg/mom_does_a_lot_of_shady_stuff_to_try_to_get_me/,"**Just to clarify: my mom isn't actually a narcissist, so I refer to her as ""Mom"", and even though her behavior isn't nearly as bad as actual narcissists I could really use some support from people who understand right now. Sorry if anyone gets offended that I posted in this subreddit; if someone feels that it doesn't belong here then I will remove it**

Anyways, I'm a highschool sophomore atm, and my mom will lie and drag me into it so my college app can look better. For example, my piano teacher's students have recitals at nursing homes a lot, and my mom made me create a website that talks about this piano ""club"" where I am the president. She's like, you need leadership and when you put this on your resume the colleges will find the website and see that you are the leader. This is just straight out lying since all I do is play piano...and it's not even a club. It's just my piano teacher's students.

She also applies to a lot of piano competitions online with pieces that I played like 3 years ago, but doesn't even let me go to the winner's recital because ""it's too time-consuming and too much work; you should be focusing on tests"". She only applies for them (without my knowing) so then I can put it on my college resume. And ofc she's too arrogant not to hide my accomplishments, so whenever I win something she brags about it to my piano teacher. And then they get into these huge arguments about why I'm not going to these winner's recitals. And ofc my mom makes me look like the bad guy and tells my piano teacher that ""I don't want to go"" and ""I want to kill my mom for sending these applications"".

Also she started a research project just for me, to make it seem like I was actively involved in it when I don't do jackshit (she's doesn't even want me to help out, because ""I have to focus on tests and grades!""). Also I can't even really do anything anyways because the research is done in China and written in Chinese soo...

What really pissed me off was when I applied for an internship (my mom actually told me not to do this at first, since ""it takes up time that you should be using to study!""), she wrote a recommendation letter pretending to be someone else. Basically, having no idea what the application even asks for, she writes a recommendation letter saying that she's the director of a research thing and that I'm such an amazing candidate for this position blah blah blah. The app doesn't even ask for a fucking recommendation from a random adult.

I know that my mom's trying to increase my chances of getting into a good college, but I really want to do it genuinely, not with all these lies and shady stuff involved. When I point this out to her she tells me that I'm retarded and don't understand how the real world works, and that all successful people lie and whatnot.

She also always complains to everyone that ""I'm a very oppositional daughter"" and ""I hate Ivy Leagues"" and ""I hate my mother"". So I get these random friends of hers telling me to behave and that my mom knows what's best for me. It's so fucking annoying, and I know that the only way she'll stop is if I let her control my life but I don't want to. I wish that my mom could just fuck off and let me do what I want with my life. And then when I actually try doing something for myself like joining clubs/competitions and stuff, she's like ""It's such a waste of time! You should be studying!"" I don't think she understands that extracurriculars actually require effort...she probably thinks that every Ivy League student lies in their app or something. I don't even know.

tl;dr mom does a bunch of shady stuff to help me get into a better college, but i want to do things authentically. how do i get her to let me be?

4dtkfe,3,2016-04-07,Choosing a major?,pocket-tree,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/4dtkfe/choosing_a_major/,"Hi everyone, 

I am currently a high school junior. The plan I thought I had was to major in chemistry and then apply to medical school. But, my mother is adamantly against it because of dangerous chemicals, and she says that if I can't get in to medical school, I won't be able to get a good job. And lately I've been doing more research and it's pretty depressing hearing about how hard chemistry/chemical engineering is, the few job prospects, the low pay, etc. My mother wants me to do business but I've never even thought about that. I've taken every AP science and I have a biotech internship lined up for this summer. It seems that the only well paying jobs for a bachelor's are computer science related, which I have no experience in (but am planning on taking classes next year.) Sorry for the long post, but I'd like to hear some thoughts on this. I don't even know if I would like chemistry when it gets really hard, or if I even want to be a doctor, and I know nothing about business or coding. I know colleges like to see students with *some* sort of direction in life and I'm just lost."

4dto7k,15,2016-04-07,"Addicted, in a bad way.",HazzMadd,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/4dto7k/addicted_in_a_bad_way/,"I kind of need to clear my head so to speak, and this seems like the place to do it. I'm not sure any other community will understand this.

I'm twenty one years old and in college for, of all things, politics. But each and every summer since I was 18 I've worked in a kitchen. All higher-end places, from the kind of place you might take the family as a special treat to the kind of place you'd find a Kennedy or two. I didn't ever intend to get into cooking, it just kind of happened. Before I graduated highschool or turned 18, my father told me: ""Son, I'm glad you got into college. But if you're going to stay here you're going to need to get a job.""

I thought that was fair and started looking. Now, my father worked in kitchens nearly his whole life (starting as a dishwasher back in the day and eventually opening and running his own restaurant for years until family life forced him to sell the business and become a carpenter), so naturally I looked towards restaurants as a first choice. The place that ended up hiring me just needed hands for anything, and on my resume I said I would take anything. I liked food so I ended up taking a position as an oyster-shucker and lobster-killer (depressing job but I can kill ~200 of those suckers in no time). Over the next three summers I kept working my way up: prep cook, line cook, (briefly) ceviche chef, and finally garde manger for one of, if not the, nicest place in town (people dropped 1k on meals there regularly). My friends spent the summers being camp counselors and Chili's waiters and I had this amazing accomplishment under my belt, even if it was still fairly low on the totem pole. It probably helped that there was frequent labor shortages, so I got a lot more experience and responsibility than I otherwise would have. I could, and can, see myself getting really far in cooking. Without knowing what I was doing I started a *goddamn career* at seventeen years old.

Honestly I've fallen in absolute love with cooking and the industry. I've never felt so fulfilled as being the first or third person in at eleven or noon and being one of the last people out. I love the catharsis and routine of prep-work in the morning and the push during service, and at the end of it hearing the sous shout ""let's get out by 11!"" (never happened even once). I love the feeling of really *working* during the day, as opposed to academic ""work"". I love the orchestrated chaos and the camaraderie, I love being a part of this little world that most people have zero knowledge about. I love the talents I've developed and I love working with people who can in six cuts show me that I still have so much more to learn. I've been exceptionally luck to have worked with and for excellent people and under excellent mentors. 

But its fucking *killing* me. Its so detrimental to my health. I've spent each summer working 60, 80, and even (rarely, thankfully) 100 hours a week. And I know its the norm and that guys higher up are working more than me. I had basically one square meal a day and was consuming enough caffeine to noticeably boost Gutamala's GDP (trying my best to avoid boosting Columbia's). I hardly slept and my social life essentially didn't exist (probably not helped by the fact I've been underage most of my culinary career). My single off day was spent making up for lost food and sleep during the week, helping my father jump start his new restaurant, or watching my younger siblings to let my parents focus on their business.  While I was working it was fine, I could kill the stress with work. Something about the pressure of service and the calm before and after made the stress vanish. I took pride in everything I plated and as much as I hated the commute into the kitchen, the second I stepped into that building I was full of purpose and, honestly, happiness. 

But the season ended, I went back to school, and all that stress and all those poor habits caught up with me. I nearly flunked out from one bad semester, and in retrospect I think it was some kind of mental break. I could never have recognized it while it was happening though, since I have zero history with mental health. 

I planned on getting an internship for my studies this summer instead of working, but that didn't pan out. I've been thinking about summer classes or working something other than a kitchen job, because I've realized just how bad it is for me. I've told myself that at most I'll spend a few hours a week (&gt;30) prepping for my father's new restaurant because I can say ""no"" more easily if he tries to put me on the line, and because it would let me see my family for a few weeks between semesters. 

But today I texted my chef/employer about my W2 because I hadn't gotten it in the mail yet. And he asked what my plans were for summer and said he would love to have me in rotation this season.

And I feel this *pull*.

I've never had any addictions or substance abuse problems in my life. No cigs, I basically gave up on weed two years back, and I've only been seriously drunk three times. I've always joked that I don't have an addictive personality (like the Sheenster).

But I felt a **pull** when I saw those words offering me a job. I keep telling myself I can't do it again, that no matter how much I love the industry and cooking its just going to kill me. But I want to say yes. Desperately. I *like* working myself to death. My first or second week in a kitchen, I had a chef ask me if I was in culinary school or just a masochist. I said, I guess I'm another masochist. I thought he was just joking about the nature of the job - now I know it isn't a joke. I like working myself sick.

___

This turned into a wall of text. I don't care if no one reads it, I needed to get it off my chest. Maybe someone here's had the same feelings, idk man. I'm gonna try and take my mind off it with homework.

**TL;DR** I'm good for kitchen life, but kitchen life isn't good for me."

And damn did you guys wrecked my inbox.  I spent most of the next morning secretly sorting through the messages at work, replying to some of the more interesting ones.  (Tip guys... don't assume that just because a woman is 43 it means she's a MILF.  I heard that term a lot.  I'm not a MILF because I don't have kids.  It kind of turns me off when you make those kind of assumptions.  If you used that word, you blew it.)  

Anyway, there was one guy in particular that caught my eye, partially because when I looked at his post history, he had submitted something to /r/BSDMpersonals that described exactly what I was looking for.  So I sent him a message, and we ended up exchanging Kik usernames.  It was a slow day at work, so we messaged back and forth a lot, and it really seemed like we were a good fit for each other.  Plus he worked right near where I lived, which made things super convenient.  After a few hours of texting, I could tell that this was the guy, so I figured why draw this out any longer?  I was horny right then, and I knew I'd be more likely to back out of it later, so I decided to throw caution to the wind and invite him over after work yesterday.  

I have to tell you, I was on edge the whole rest of the day.  The idea of having a guy come over and use my mouth as a fuck hole had me so nervous, but also so wet that I admit I had to rub one out in the ladies room later that afternoon.  

So anyway, the end of the work day finally rolls around, and I get home, and try to mentally prepare myself for this adventure.  He had requested that I wear the same thing that I was wearing to work that day (one of those sexy suit ensembles that projects confidence and authority).  The idea of using and degrading a powerful, professional woman really seemed to turn him on, and it kind of played into one of my fantasies of being dominated by one of those cute, young, big dicked interns.

After anxiously waiting for the buzzer to ring for about an hour and drinking a glass or two for courage, he finally shows, and I let him in.  I was relieved to see that he was the same person I had expected, and even more pleased when I saw a bulge start to grow in his pants as we chatted on the couch and sipped wine together (guess he was pleased with what he saw too!).  At this point I was a little tipsy and so ready for him, so I finally just moved in close and gave him a long sensual kiss.  

We made out for a little bit, and then he whispered in my ear ""are you ready for this?"".  I gave him a seductive nod, and he stood up in front of me and began undoing his belt.  I took off my suit top and undid my blouse to give him a nice look at my big fake tits.  By this point he had taken off his pants and was down to his underwear.  I could see by his huge bulge that he was ready to go, so I leaned forward and slipped off his briefs.  

Fuck, what a beautiful cock he had! It must have been around 7 or 8 inches, and it was the perfect thickness.  It wasn't one of those big floppy cocks either.  This thing was rock hard!  The head of his cock was huge and swollen and dripping with precum.  I took it in my mouth and teased it a little with my tongue, and I remember thinking that I never tasted anything so good in my life (or maybe it was just the wine talking).  I also licked and sucked on his enormous balls, which he had been kind enough to shave beforehand.  

After a few minutes of teasing, I looked up at him as I stroked his shaft, already slick with my saliva, and I gave him a look as if to say, ""We both know what we're here for.  Do it"".  He immediately understood, and took me by the back of the head, slipped his cock back in my mouth, and pulled me in towards him.  He was too big to take all the way in my mouth, but god he tried.  He had a fist full of hair in both hands, pulling my mouth toward him while he simultaneously thrusted into me.  I was gagging, drooling, barely able to catch my breath in between having my mouth full of big thick cock.  I was in extacy.  

Although I had told him a lot about what I wanted, he seemed a little reluctant at first to get too rough.  That changed quickly when I looked up at him and said, ""I'm sorry I can't get you all the way down my throat.  You should punish your little whore.""  Immediately he had me by the back of the head with a fistful of hair, and I felt a hard slap across my face.  I think I about came right there.  If there was any hesitation left in him, it was gone when I looked back up at him and said ""thank you sir!"".  

This went on for about 20 more minutes, and I loved every minute of it.  Whenever he had to slow down from fucking my face, he would force my head down between his legs to suck his balls and lick behind them.  

Finally, he got to the point where he couldn't take it any more and needed to cum in his whore.  He had me lean back over the edge of the couch, my head hanging off backwards.  He grabbed my by the throat, and eased his cock in as far as it would go.  In this position, he was able to enter me further than he (or any other guy) had ever been before.  I think, as he was thrusting into me from this position, I may have almost taken him balls deep in my mouth, but my face was taking such a pounding and my mascara running into my eyes so much that I couldn't tell for sure.  Finally, FINALLY he rewarded me for my efforts with his delicious cum.  As he had one hand on my throat, the other squeezing hard one of my exposed tits, I heard a deep moan, felt his thighs shudder, and tasted that warm hot cum as it began to fill my mouth.  I couldn't believe how much he filled me.  Spurt after spurt of thick semen shot into the back of my mouth, almost faster than I could swallow it.  After his orgasm finally ended, he pulled out of my mouth, and I swung back around to get on my knees and lick up the last drops of cum from his beautiful, throbbing cock.  

I looked up at him and whispered ""thank you"".  ""You're welcome"" he whispered back... and with that, I had finally achieved a long unfulfilled fantasy.  I can't believe it took me so long.  But now I know how amazing it can be when taking a risk finally pays off.  Maybe I won't be so shy about taking chances in the future...  speaking of, maybe I'll send Mr. Hot Cock a text now to see if he can come by and fuck me tonight  ;)


EDIT:  No luck tonight.  But we made arrangements for him to come by and fuck me after work tomorrow!  Let's see if he's as good working my pussy as he was with my mouth.  I had him check out this post, and he was so turned on by my recollection and popularity of this post that he wants me to document our next encounter too  ;)"

4dtw9b,3,2016-04-07,Unfair dismissal from part time job?,ikeabitch,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/4dtw9b/unfair_dismissal_from_part_time_job/,"Today I was fired from a part time job while still within what they called the '3 month probation period'.

Backstory: 

I have been working for a furniture retail store in Scotland since the 19th of March 2016 as a part time employee while I finish my final year of uni. The assumption would be that I would work full time after graduation over the summer.

Before I accepted the job I had been for an interview for an internship but not heard back from them, so I accepted the job at said furniture store.

Fast forward to 2 days ago, I get an email saying that I have been offered the internship and it runs for 3 months during the summer. I send them a reply saying that I am flattered, but need to speak with current employers.

Last night after closing I inform my manager at my current job about the internship and ask whether there could be a compromise. I also say that I am loyal toward my current position and would be inclined to stay within my current job and decline the internship if a compromise couldn't be met. My manager seems ok with what I have said and says 'not to worry, we'll discuss it next time you're working'.

Today on my day off I receive a text from my other manager asking for me to come into work for a chat. We agree a time and I when I arrive, I am joined by both managers in the office. 

They begin by saying that they have spoken to one another about what I informed them of last night and would like to know a bit more. I tell them how I had been for the interview before I'd even been offered the position from my current job, and that they had only just got back to me. I stress that I have actually already made up my mind and will be declining the internship offer. I also mention that I have wanted to be as honest with them as possible because I believe that they should always be in the loop. 

After this the tone quite drastically switches and my managers inform me that they do not believe that I am 'dedicated' to the job, as I have, according to them, been speaking to other companies. The fact that I interviewed for the internship before even knowing that I would be working for the current job doesn't seem to be a good enough reason for them, neither does the fact that I have said that I have declined the internship and am 100% committed to continuing in my current role. It seems that they have already spoken about this before hand and made up their minds. Nothing I could have said would have changed their minds.

Now, my dilemma is whether this could be regarded as an unfair dismissal or not. They gave me no advance warning or notice at all. Simply brought me in, fired me, and that was that. My concern is that I had only been working there for roughly 3 weeks, whether this is lawful for them to do. Any advice is greatly appreciated, and sorry for the long post!"
4dtxbq,1,2016-04-07,My Girlfriend's Parents will never approve of me,arion1123,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4dtxbq/my_girlfriends_parents_will_never_approve_of_me/,"Hello twoxchromosomes,

Over the years I’ve been on reddit and gone through many threads, I have come to an understanding that you guys have some of the most genuine and best advice for those who are in serious need of help. I come before you today, broken and depressed by the situation I find myself in. I wasn’t going to do this at all but my friend suggested it because many people are more likely to come up with something that I haven’t thought of, and I’ve spent half a year thinking of everything.

Where do I start? After I finished my undergraduate degree, I was in China for a year-long internship. There, I met the girl of my dreams. I've dated other women before her, but have never felt the level of connection that I have with her. What was supposed to be a one year internship extended to two years, just to prolong the time we could be together. I am now back in North America, and the plan was to go back after a year of saving up money here and get married. Unfortunately, she resides with her parents, and her parents dislike me very much. They don’t approve of me as her partner for various reasons. 
For those of you unfamiliar with traditional Chinese culture, the classical teachings strongly assert that a child should be very filial to their parents. And that was how she was raised. She’s conditioned not to defy her parents’ wishes. The reasons they don’t like me are the following:

-I’m short (5’5’’)

-I’m a foreign-born Chinese who is not overly familiar with Chinese culture

-My family background is too complicated for them (parents are both divorced, with new partners)

-My dad side is from An Hui province, which is supposedly known for untrustworthy people, and they heavily take this into account

-If we do get married their daughter will probably not be geographically close to them all the time anymore


These are all things we knew of entering the relationship, but we always thought we could steadily get them to come around. So why has the situation suddenly escalated? Whereas before, she would try to subtly highlight good things about me to her parents, a month ago, she decided to outright tell her parents she wanted to get married to me. They rejected, and devised an arranged marriage for her with a candidate of their approval, who is the son of family friends. She also quickly rejected. They had a massive fight, words were exchanged to the effect of as long as her parents were alive, they would never approve of us. Her father felt that he lost face because of it so he didn’t talk to her for a month. The situation has more or less melted down and she’s giving in to the pressures from her parents now that it seems the idea of us being married is hopeless. However, instead of agreeing to one of her parents’ proposed candidates, she has brought them her friend, who she hopes they will accept as a sound candidate. Her plan is to get married with him and then immigrate to Canada to see me, but here’s the thing, she will probably not be able to divorce him because her friend is dead serious about marrying her and she knows if she tells him that she’s immigrating here to see me it will just scare him off. The other reason it’s pointless to divorce him for her is that even if she’s single again in Canada, her parents will never approve of me as her potential partner. And as long as they don’t approve she will not be with me (on paper). 

I have tried convincing her to run away from home to establish her independence, or elope with me. But she says her parents will abandon her and she doesn’t want to lose her only family. I rebutted that since she is their only child even if she goes against her parents’ wishes they will eventually forgive her but she says they will not and from my interactions with her parents I can tell she’s probably right. To be honest I even thought about just uprooting my life and move it to China, but after working there for 2 years I realized my career there will never be as good as it could in North America and moving there for permanent residency will not magically change the way her parents view me. I have also thought about getting my father involved since he’s very good with words and understands how to deal with people. I am currently thinking if there are any alternative solutions such as convincing her that there are other ways to be filial instead.
Please, please, help me brainstorm. I really don’t want to just give up on her. She’s the only girl I’ve ever been in love with. I know there are “plenty of fish in the sea”, and I’m well aware that letting go is the most likely outcome and a part of me has already accepted that. What I need isn’t advice on letting go; I have people telling me that already. What I need are ideas that I may not have thought of.

TL;DR GF too dutiful to go against parents, parents don’t see me as a good husband material, what do I do if I want to be with her?

4dtxpi,2,2016-04-07,Work as computer programmer with MMJ card?,obladidi,MMJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMJ/comments/4dtxpi/work_as_computer_programmer_with_mmj_card/,"My husband recently got a part-time paid internship as a computer programmer after completing an intensive coding course for a few months and applying around for another couple of months. Once he started they said he needed to take a pre employment drug test. They said they have a zero tolerance work policy and they don't care that he has a card and that MMJ is legal in our state (New Mexico). He would also be subject to random drug tests. 

He had heard that his field- computer programming- is pretty lax when it comes to drug tests or smoking pot but this was his first good opportunity after applying at many different places so I am scared that he won't be able to find a job as an MMJ user. Our city is not a tech hotbed and we could move out of state- are there others with MMJ cards who have found work in this field elsewhere?

I have no problem with his MMJ as I know it really helps him and it has no negative effect on me or us. But if he can't be employed as an MMJ user that will be problematic and I think that maybe he should stop unless he finds a job that is cool with it. He says that with the amount/grade that he smokes it could take months to be out of his system. He's bummed that he lost this opportunity but he doesn't think the MMJ will be an issue in other jobs. I am not sure what to think and I feel bad that something harmless that helps him so much is the reason he couldn't keep the internship, but if he had prescriptions for other drugs he would have been okay. I am hoping there are places that are more understanding as he has a legitimate disability and MMJ card."
4du14x,3,2016-04-07,"I'm so frustrated with job searching, it feels pointless",Anthor325,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4du14x/im_so_frustrated_with_job_searching_it_feels/,"So I've been unemployed since February, I'm an engineer, who graduated about 2-3 years ago. When I left college I had all the boxes ticked, 2 internships in engineering related fields, a 3.7 GPA from a really top tier engineering school, several years of extracurricular activity, a great senior design project. I wasn't the super top of my class but I was reasonably close. But despite all those advantages I spent the year watching as all my friends, many of whom were less qualified than myself got jobs. Meanwhile I was rejected from the company I interned with, they never explained why besides the standard line about deciding to go with other candidates, this despite the fact that I had done exactly what they asked me to and tried to make myself useful to everyone around me. I got rejected from dozens of other jobs I applied for at career fairs, even though I got several different interviews. I know I interview relatively well because I did years of public speaking in high school and college and while i may not be perfect I'm pretty good at coming up with answers and being personable. 

So after spending the whole year getting rejected over and over again I graduated and had to move back home with my parents. I tried to connect with people I knew, but most of them weren't in engineering. The few connections I did make resulted in an interview where the interviewer literally asked how someone as qualified as myself didn't have a job, right before passing on hiring me a few days later. Eventually I found a job because a family member refereed a problem form work to me that required me to write a fairly complicated program, which I did in about 16 hours, and based on that I finally managed to land a job with an oilfield company as an engineer. It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it paid well enough and my boss was nice, so I stuck with it and within a year I went from being the new guy to being the go-to engineer for most technical problems. Then about a year and a half ago the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia decided to put us along with everyone one else in oil out of business. I held on through three rounds of layoffs and a bankruptcy filing based on my performance, before finally being let go when the company basically collapsed entirely (The last year and a half has been the worst time of my life thus far like a low point that keeps sinking lower every single day it drags on). 

So now I'm out of a job, and since the oilfield industry in the US is basically collapsing into a black hole and the city where I worked was mostly oilfield dependent I realized my only shot of getting a job would be to move somewhere else and basically switch careers. The end result was that I had to move back in with my parents at 25. Now I've been at it for about a month or so and all I get back in response to my applications is the standard thanks but we decided to go with someone else email. 

It's particularly frustrating because  most of the job descriptions for engineering jobs are nonsensically specific. Back at my old company I helped out with one or two interviewers and typically we were just looking for a relatively intelligent person who was ready to learn. But the job descriptions online are ludicrous, especially entry level jobs that require lots of experience???? I know that behind all these postings are engineers just looking for someone who can learn fast and solve problems...like me. But in between there is this impenetrable HR wall with algorithms that other people much like myself wrote that now filter me out from the job application pool because I don't tick all their boxes. (I even had a teacher back in college who described exactly this sort of thing happening when he tried to hire someone). Basically HR people aren't qualified to hire engineers because they know nothing about engineering. If I thought it would help i would just lie and pretend I did check all the boxes to get past the gatekeepers, but I can't bring myself to do that plus I think it may be illegal or something. Anyway that's not an option. 

I suppose I could try calling engineers directly, but back when I was working I actually had something like that happen to me and it made me feel that I really didn't want to hire that person even though he might have been a decent fit, I'm not sure why... it just did. Looking back I really sympathize with him now that I am on the other side, knowing you are qualified for a lot of things but unable to get your foot in the door. I had a few friends suggest headhunters, Aerotech is one that i worked with in the past right after college, but they really didn't seem very impressive to me, they took months to find anything and it was typically just contract work where any day can be your last for any reason whatsoever. 

It just feels like i am sitting there facing this massive wall with no way over, no way around and so my only option is to kick it down, so I kick and kick but no matter what I do nothing happens, and I know that if I could only get around to the other side and get a job I could deal with pretty much any obstacle, because I've done so int he past with great success, but I don't have that chance because it's impossible to even get a job in the first place. It all feels so completely hopeless and unfair. 

All my friends from college still have great jobs... why? Because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia didn't decide to make them unemployed, and that's pretty much the only differentiatior, some people on the other side of planet earth decided to screw me and not them. I know I'm not supposed to be measuring myself against other people, but it's hard to sit there while a bunch of people, whom you know you are just as capable as, have jobs, get to take cool trips overseas, and pretty much have a great time in life, while I'm stuck here desperately trying to find anything that will pay me a wage all because of reasons completely outside my control. I don't mean to sound jealous, because I don't wish them any harm or anything like that, I just wish who would give me a chance, because I know that I've succeeded in difficult situations historically. But this is the one sort of situation that I can't math and science my way out of. 

I've tried to go through my resume and highlight all my accomplishments, but it doesn't' seem to matter because I don't have the '2 years of experience with (insert specific software package)' and as far as the sorting algorithms are concerned, that's all that matters. Never mind that I've programmed my way out of all sorts of problems, or that I learned pretty much everything I did at my last job on my own, never mind that most people who know me are amazed by how much stuff in general I know, or that I can talk at length about numerous subjects, or that I've written at least six completed and unpublished novels in my spare time (At least one of which is actually decent) never mind that and a million other things. None of that matters because those aren't things that I can put on a resume, and even if I could, none of them check the job description box that the computer or the HR person is looking for.

When I went to college the people there loved to lie about how I could do anything, but the truth is that anymore it feels like I can't. I keep applying to jobs because I don't really know what else to do, it's a sort of personal holding pattern i am stuck in but every time I apply the rejection just gets worse and worse. Back before all this there were probably ten years of my life where I could count the number of times I had cried on one finger, but over the last few months it's gone from being something that I do when someone dies to something that happens weekly or anymore almost daily as the frustration grows worse. It's not any one rejection it's just the avalanche of rejection that feels like it's coming from every aspect of my life, including my job search, and each one makes it a little harder to get past the next one, like it's slowly chipping away at whatever willpower i have left.

Looking back, I'm sorry for the text wall, I didn't mean to write all this, and I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I just needed to say it to somebody, even if that just means one anonymous reddit account talking with another. I know there are people who have it worse than i do, but it doesn't make the frustration of being constantly rejected in job searches any less."

I'm currently right now graduating from BC high school. I already got into U of A since last year (CS Major, Pysch minor). A few questions here:

1) Generally, how's the overall difficulty of the Computing Science program? Does classes usually have Bell curves?

2) Is Computing Science mostly theoretical (Data structures, computing theories, abstract algorithms) rather than real-life practical stuff (coding, software creation, etc... )

3) Am I required to take first-year English class in U of A? How is it like overall? (I've searched this before, but couldn't find any information)

4) How's the social life in the campus/Edmonton? Overall club/society life?

5) Is SIP still a thing here? Would it be difficult for a CS Student to get an internship generally?

Thanks guys,

Edit: I am not fully committed yet to any university. Still waiting for replies from other places first. "
4du7xw,2,2016-04-07,"Stuck in lease, need advice!",throwaway_0x5f,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4du7xw/stuck_in_lease_need_advice/,"Hey Reddit.

So, I have been living at my current apartment with a roommate since Fall.  We agreed with the apartment that we would have a 9-month lease ending in May, but we recently found out that we signed a 12-month lease ending in August instead of the 9-month one.  I guess this doesn't matter now, as it was our fault that we didn't read the lease.

The problem is that I have an internship over this summer, and I won't be staying at this apartment for the last three months.  

Currently, me and my roommate just split our rent in half.  Breaking the lease now would save me money as opposed to paying the rest of the rent.  I suggested this to my roommate, as I knew that my roommate had already been planning to move back to her parents over the summer.  Now she doesn't want to leave the apartment, saying that she doesn't have a place to stay.  She also opposed to letting me sublease (we have to jointly sign papers).

My question is:  What can I do in this situation to save me the most money?"
4dudgb,12,2016-04-07,"[Rant] dealing with crazy, hypocritical, and religious Asian dad.",chibichaan,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/4dudgb/rant_dealing_with_crazy_hypocritical_and/,"TLDR: I have a crazy, hypocritical, religious, useless, racist, Asian dad.

I've pretty much been lurking on this sub-reddit for a while and because of how my dad has been on his moods lately I've finally gotten the courage to post on here. A little background on myself, 23, fresh out of college working, but unfortunately due to various circumstances and stuff I was unable to get a job straight after graduation and was forced to move back home. While I'm currently working and saving up the money its currently not enough for me to move out with the amount of bills I have to pay with my student loans. 

Now onto my parents. I have a great relationship with my mom, at least I would like to think so. 

My dad is a whole other story, he's one of those asian parents who really dislikes the culture in the US and when I ""disobey"" him and stuff and goes off on how if I was raised in the Philippines i would have more values and things like that. He believes that he is absolute because he is the father and that he doesn't have to respect me because I'm his kid. On top of that he believes that he doesn't have to do the housework or anything like that and dumps all of that to me and my mom, he also doesn't get up or do anything for himself because he expects me and my mom to do it for him like serve his food. He also has various health problems, and he refuses to take his medicine and everything and it has already bitten him in the ass, but at this point I really don't care lol. (as harsh as that sounds but yeah). Earlier today he got pissed at me just because I didn't move my car earlier and I tuned him out and to punish me and my mom apparently he turned off the internet. (I'm using my mom's phone as a hotspot so I'm able to post this and rant) 

So both my parents are also super religious. I was always forced to go to anything religious, and when I turned 13, I began questioning everything I was seeing and I discovered what atheism and agnosticism was and I began identifying myself as agnostic while putting up with the overly-religiousness. Being super religious my dad is anti-gay, anti abortion, super conservative and all of that stuff. Since I don't agree with anything like that, my dad constantly believes that the reason why I don't believe in the same thing as him is because of the college I went to and it was too ""liberal"" and that I should've went to a conservative college so I would once again have values. My dad also has an incredibly annoying holier than thou attitude (anyone who meets him believes hes such a good person because hes so religious), he believes that anime and anything japanese is evil, like when I refused to do anything religious he would start blaming it on anime and japanese things because he believes that its made me hard headed and he hasn't put two and two together that I stopped being religious because of him shoving his incredibly crazy beliefs down my throat. He also believes that social media and that the ""pajama generation"" as he likes to call anyone my age has influenced me to not be religious. I constantly question everything he tries to shove down my throat and then he gets pissed by accusing me of worshipping anime and the devil. Nowadays though, I'm more catholic than agnostic but I do it on my own terms. 

Now his political views, if you're from the US, you've probably heard of fox news and believe me that's all he watches and he listens to those conservative talk shows, and because of that he has a serious case of Islamophobia.

So since I was in my junior year of high school, my dad hasn't held a job or anything like that and has become super stingy on money and everything. Recently he's been trying to find ridiculous ways to cut our money spending among them being cutting the cable and just relying on streaming sites. Another way he wants to cut spending is by cutting our internet access and just have us use our data plan on our phones. My mom and I have common sense and tell him, that its a stupid idea, and my dad says, it doesn't affect me I just use the internet for email anyway. I obviously call him out on it and he starts saying I'm disrespecting him and that if I want the internet so much I should pay for it. Also, my dad who doesn't have a job constantly attempts to keep me from going out by saying I should just stay home and do nothing and save money, and yet he goes out every weekend for a religious event. 

Now going off on the whole I couldn't move out right away and all that stuff, once again it was thanks to my dad indirectly. When I was getting ready to go to college, my dad kept pressuring me that I had to graduate within 4 years, while he himself graduated within 5 years. So much so when I got my schedule, I had the perfect schedule with the elective I wanted to take (Japanese) but I wasn't scheduled to take biology and chemistry at the same time, when he found that out, he personally dragged me to the academic dean's office in my school and yelled at the deans in charge of registration to put me in chemistry instead of taking Japanese. This had some consequences, you can image, because I ended up failing both bio and chem and my dad ""accidentally"" opened my letter addressed to me being on academic probation. Since that he realized that i wasn't going to graduate on time and forced me to take summer classes just so I can graduate on time. Thanks to that I was unable to do like an internship and get some experience in my field since most internships were usually in the summer. 

Now onto the judgemental part, most Asian parents believe that their kids are morbidly obese no matter how skinny or muscular they are. I know I'm incredibly overweight as an Asian but most people see me as pretty fit and stuff like that. My dad would tell me that I looked better when I was younger because I had a bowl cut and because I was ""skinnier"" too. He would constantly judge me for my weight and he would say look at me, I'm skinny and I'm healthy, when he's clearly skinny and looking like he's not healthy. (if that makes sense). Whenever he judges me for my weight I would call him out and say ""you were bullied as a child and in order for you to make yourself feel better you project all your negative energy on me by making fun of my weight"" then he would go off again on me being disrespectful. 

I pretty much call my dad out on a lot of things with the end result of him acting like a little kid and throwing temper tantrums. Like I said earlier in my post, in order to ""discipline"" me and have me ""respect"" him he turned off the internet thereby pissing off both me and my mom. I'm 90% sure that my dad is a narcissistic parent because of the way he acts and I was going to also post this in raisedbynarcissts. Dealing with an Asian parent like him, I had to resort to standing up for myself by calling him out on all his bullshit which he calls ""disrespect"". Honestly, while he is my father I can't respect him because he acts like a little kid when he does not get his way and pretty much abuses his power as a parent and does the whole ""this is my house my rules"" and the whole ""I'm the dad you have to respect me and I am absolute and since you're my kid I don't have to respect you""

I just want to know how much of a difference having internship experience really makes for the average student?

The Young Turks [say that they support the minimum wage](https://startpage.com/do/search?query=tyt+minimum+wage&amp;cat=web&amp;pl=chrome&amp;language=english) and at the same time as they are [offering their interns $500 for 160 to 240 hours of work](https://www.tytnetwork.com/careers/internship-tyt-sports/)

I am not sure how long this ad will be up, so I will paste it below as a comment. So, by my calculation, TYT is willing to pay its interns $62.50 per week, which is about $12.50 per work day - somewhere between $2.083 per hour and $3.125 per hour depending on the number of hours worked per week (estimated 20 to 30).

How is this not greedy? How is this not hypocritical? Cenk Uygur's net worth is estimated to be around [3.5 Million](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-politicians/democrats/cenk-uygur-net-worth/). Surely he can afford to pay people who do work for him a decent wage?

Some poor black kid who grew up in the tough streets of LA, raised by a single mother, saw his brother gunned down by gang violence, who decided to try not to go with the flow, to try to make it in this world despite his lack of white privilege. He did everything right, went to college, studied his ass off, took all the right courses, dreamed of working for TYT since he was 9 years old, planned on becoming a role model for his community, the next black liberal thought leader with an A-list celebrity status. The thing is - he did get the internship; he blew Cenk and Anna away with his skills, his achievements, his abilities. However, $500 for the summer internship just was not going to cut it. He took the internship, but he had to make money on the side, so he started dealing weed. In the middle of the summer he was busted by racists cops, who man-handled him, he resisted the abuse, then one thing led to another and ... he was shot dead.

Another innocent young black life ruined by racist cops thanks to greediness of The Young Turks. The boy had no chance. The greedy CEO worth 3.5 million dollars just would not pay him a living wage and so he died.

When asked about his views, Cenk replied that he will continue to support minimum wage, and no, he does not have to pay a full wage to his interns because [this instance is different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading). You see, it is the CEO of McDonalds that is greedy, and while interning at TYT is work, it is not [work work](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/dirty-jobs/), also that his low-paid internship can only possible affect the life of a single person, while his vote for a democratic nominee and his promotion of Bernie Sanders on his show will improve the lives of millions.

There is also this argument:

&gt; TYT Network is committed to providing a quality learning and training experience for its interns. This program is designed to provide not only practical training but also encouragement, inspiration, and role models for a new generation.

Also, Cenk considers himself Turkish and not white.

4dugty,1,2016-04-07,[Internship] Should I decline an official offer for a verbal offer?,MisterLongPotato,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dugty/internship_should_i_decline_an_official_offer_for/,"Please help me make a decision, I received internship offers from a big, well known company and a small start up in NY.

The big company is near my place, and the start up one requires me to reallocate. But in the end, after minus all the expense, the money I get will come out equal.

In term of experience, I like the smaller, start up more because I think I will learn more there (better mentorship, more connections), and I will actually build features that make impact to the company. Their project also interests me because I am going to use all the cool stuff: Django, Python, React + Flux...
The smaller one also say they will consider full time employment offer to me after I graduate, if I perform well in the internship (Which I desperately need, since I am an international student).

The bigger company, closer to my place, I can commute there, the team, that I am going to work with, is actually pretty nice, small team, but the project is as not interesting, C#, PhP, Database, Refractor &amp; clean up other's people code. However, the company said they will not make any commitment to consider hiring me after I graduate.

I had done my previous internship with a small start up, and I actually learned a lot. That's why I prefer the start up one more.

In short, The bigger one will look good on my resume, but I will actually learn more from the startup.

HOWEVER, I have to accept the offer from the bigger one tomorrow, I have been stalling, asking for more time, and they already gave me more than a week.
The smaller one hasn't sent me the official offer letter yet, they emailed me the ""casual"" offer (with salary), and they are contacting my references before sending me the official letter, they already knew about my deadline.

So my question is, what should I do? :( Should I decline the official offer from the big company for a ""verbal"" offer from this small company?

Am I making a right decision when I chose the smaller, start up company?

Thank you!

It involves using the company's entire tech stack and skills listed in the job description. I've had no internships, so learning how to do all of this has been challenging. I'm progressing, but every time I read the requirements, I see something new I have to learn. The project involves the entire full stack (database, front end, back end).

So, I'm wondering how common this is, and how others fair in completing these."

I let him know I was a poli-sci major and that it was my dream to intern on the hill. 
He appreciated my in depth anal-ysis of the hard pressing issues that evening and knew I'd be an asset to his office. When a vote to defund Planned Parenthood came up I happily volunteered to give oral arguments and threw myself into the thorough presentations to persuade our congressmen who were elected on their family-values platform. 

Your assistant knocks on your door and exasperatedly tells you that a young woman has been waiting in the lobby for two hours and that she's repeatedly asked me to leave. But I push past her: I'm sorry sir, but the Congressman insisted I put this position paper in your hands and get an answer directly from you before I return! I explain. Your eyes take in the young bombshell before you.

It's fine. I owe him the courtesy of at least reviewing the material. Hold my calls and give me an hour to handle this.

I walk toward your desk which you're standing behind and hand you the thin folder. A single sheet of paper says: Healthcare for women is not just a women's issue. I hope you will support funding planned parenthood. Our intern, Becca, has a very compelling presentation for you.

You look up and I fall to my knees in front of you.

I really like older, powerful men. I love the way they seduce you and make you feel so good that you want nothing more than to please them.

Hi! I'm Becca and I'm looking for an older, powerful, family values hypocrite to play with me tonight. 

Me: 22f, about to graduate from college, blue/green eyes, blonde hair that wear in loose curls. Naturally full pink lips. 34 Ds. Pale skin, small pink nipples that become hard little pebbles (I've been told I have ""tv tits"") and a pussy that is so wet. I also wear a little silver cross that I never take off.

I love name calling, older men, being taken advantage of, power dynamics, white collar, powerful men, cheating - you, cock sucking, light choking and impregnation.

BOLD: I'd want to hear how you lust for me, how you want to touch me and how you'd make me your slut.*"

4dupao,0,2016-04-07,27M4F Any bad girls out there?,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4dupao/27m4f_any_bad_girls_out_there/,"OK, so I'm looking for some really naughty girls to RP with. I'm open to a variety of different situations/prompts, and if you've got an idea, I'd love to hear it. If you'd like a few ideas of mine, they're below, as is my kinks/dislikes list!

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) I've married older and into an open relationship. My new wife has a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. You come over somehow on a night where nobody else is home (my wife is getting fucked by at least one other guy, my step-daughter is elsewhere), and ultimately we wind up in a situation where one of us seduces the other. Why are you at my house? How do we get to that point? Let's figure it out together!

5) Any kind of party prompt you can imagine; nightclub, pool, bachelor/bachelorette, etc.

6) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking/smoking (also open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"

I don't necessarily want to go into prosthetics, so would that (in combination with me going to a school that isn't well touted for mechE) mean that it would still be a good idea to go in as meche with a leaning toward biological stuff? I am also planning to double major as BME/CS, does this pairing really fit together?

4dux4q,26,2016-04-08,My [25 M] Girlfriend's [25 F] parents will never approve of me,arion1123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dux4q/my_25_m_girlfriends_25_f_parents_will_never/,"Hello fellow redditors, I decided to post here upon seeing Katasstic's advice.

Over the years I’ve been on reddit and gone through many threads, I have come to an understanding that you guys have some of the most genuine and best advice for those who are in serious need of help. I come before you today, broken and depressed by the situation I find myself in. I wasn’t going to do this at all but my friend suggested it because many people are more likely to come up with something that I haven’t thought of, and I’ve spent half a year thinking of everything.

Where do I start? After I finished my undergraduate degree, I was in China for a year-long internship. There, I met the girl of my dreams. I've dated other women before her, but have never felt the level of connection that I have with her. What was supposed to be a one year internship extended to two years, just to prolong the time we could be together. I am now back in North America, and the plan was to go back after a year of saving up money here and get married. Unfortunately, she resides with her parents, and her parents dislike me very much. They don’t approve of me as her partner for various reasons. For those of you unfamiliar with traditional Chinese culture, the classical teachings strongly assert that a child should be very filial to their parents. And that was how she was raised. She’s conditioned not to defy her parents’ wishes. The reasons they don’t like me are the following: 
-I’m short (5’5’’) 
-I’m a foreign-born Chinese who is not overly familiar with Chinese culture 
-My family background is too complicated for them (parents are both divorced, with new partners) 
-My dad side is from An Hui province, which is supposedly known for untrustworthy people, and they heavily take this into account 
-If we do get married their daughter will probably not be geographically close to them all the time anymore

These are all things we knew of entering the relationship, but we always thought we could steadily get them to come around. So why has the situation suddenly escalated? Whereas before, she would try to subtly highlight good things about me to her parents, a month ago, she decided to outright tell her parents she wanted to get married to me. They rejected, and devised an arranged marriage for her with a candidate of their approval, who is the son of family friends. She also quickly rejected. They had a massive fight, words were exchanged to the effect of as long as her parents were alive, they would never approve of us. Her father felt that he lost face because of it so he didn’t talk to her for a month. The situation has more or less melted down and she’s giving in to the pressures from her parents now that it seems the idea of us being married is hopeless. However, instead of agreeing to one of her parents’ proposed candidates, she has brought them her friend, who she hopes they will accept as a sound candidate. Her plan is to get married with him and then immigrate to Canada to see me, but here’s the thing, she will probably not be able to divorce him because her friend is dead serious about marrying her and she knows if she tells him that she’s immigrating here to see me it will just scare him off. The other reason it’s pointless to divorce him for her is that even if she’s single again in Canada, her parents will never approve of me as her potential partner. And as long as they don’t approve she will not be with me (on paper).

I have tried convincing her to run away from home to establish her independence, or elope with me. But she says her parents will abandon her and she doesn’t want to lose her only family. I rebutted that since she is their only child even if she goes against her parents’ wishes they will eventually forgive her but she says they will not and from my interactions with her parents I can tell she’s probably right. To be honest I even thought about just uprooting my life and move it to China, but after working there for 2 years I realized my career there will never be as good as it could in North America and moving there for permanent residency will not magically change the way her parents view me. I have also thought about getting my father involved since he’s very good with words and understands how to deal with people. I am currently thinking if there are any alternative solutions such as convincing her that there are other ways to be filial instead. Please, please, help me brainstorm. I really don’t want to just give up on her. She’s the only girl I’ve ever been in love with. I know there are “plenty of fish in the sea”, and I’m well aware that letting go is the most likely outcome and a part of me has already accepted that. What I need isn’t advice on letting go; I have people telling me that already. What I need are ideas that I may not have thought of.

TL;DR GF too dutiful to go against parents, parents don’t see me as a good husband material, what do I do if I want to be with her?"

Just one more hurdle, and I think I can do anything I want.",imdirtysocks45,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4dv6m0/everything_is_starting_to_click_in_my_life_just/,"Last March, I had to drop out of my second semester as a freshman at Georgia Tech and was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 with psychosis. The school was very supportive and helped me get back on track. In late April I started lifting with a personal trainer. This helped me get over the fear of looking like a dumbass in the gym. Lifting became my religion over my extended summer. I've been pretty consistent for the last year, but my progress could have been better if I had gotten my diet in check. That's one of the things I need to fix (count macros and calories). As far as other health things go, I take meds for my condition and see a therapist once a month to get feedback on whatever is on my mind. I started doing yoga this last moth but pretty basic stuff. I plan on going to a studio to really learn over the summer while I'm working at my internship. I meditate everyday, run 3x a week, and lift 4x a week. I usually get 7.5 - 8 hours of sleep a night. The other part of me that I've been focusing on is what I actually want to do with my life. I'm a CS major right now. I thought after the incident in Freshmen year that it might be too hard, so I thought I might switch to IE. My psychiatrist convinced me to stick with my current major. I was still wondering over the summer. I tried making an app, but I was having so much trouble that I thought maybe I wasn't meant for it. I thought about majoring in math because I have this passion of learning the baseline logic of anything that is possible. At one point I wanted to be a banker because I was hanging out with a friend who was bent on getting into Wall Street. I started really trying to think what would make me feel the most ""me."" Math was kind of close. I wondered why I wanted to do CS and remembered /r/futurology. I wanted to create AI to (hopefully) change the world in a positive way. So I figured I should stay CS and focus on Machine Learning. I asked on /r/cscareerquestions what I should do to achieve that goal and the general answer was to get a PhD. I was pretty deflated because that seemed like too much work. So I figured I could at least get a Masters and that was the plan for most of this year. Just keep good grades and do Georgia Tech's BS/MS program. Then around spring break which was recent, I realized my true dream would be to do a PhD. I want to be at the top. I don't just want to be using something that's already been made by someone else. I want to make something new. So I figured I could go for the PhD. Now the hard part is getting undergraduate research. It's pretty competitive especially in my program at my school. Once I can get that part figured out, I think everything becomes trivial. I keep working on my health/looks, get on track to do a PhD and maybe someday find the perfect girl for me. The biggest thing on my mind right now is getting a professor to accept for research next fall though. Anyways, I'm still really grateful for how far I've come. If I think back to my high school self, I cringe pretty hard. I'm actually happy right now albeit a little anxious still. But I'm almost at that Self-Actualiziation stage in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I just need to keep pushing if I want to get to that image of myself that I've fantasized my whole life. "

Based on practice interviews I've done, I feel really confident about my ability in coding assignments and talking at in-person interviews, but I'm never able to get to that place because I don't have any previous work experience.

I feel like I'm just spamming resumes at people through Columbia's career site and on angelist, etc., is it just a number's game at this point of spamming more resumes? I have some simple-ish finished projects, which I get asked about in my interviews and I'm able to talk about how I worked on them with people, my role in them, and the sort of product that I made, so I don't think it's that.

I’m submissive. I'm really short for a man, blonde hair and blue eyes. Looking for someone for a roleplay with both social and sexual parts, preferably a girl but guy works too. I like a deeper setting with us focusing on our own characters but sometime playing others too to deepen interactions. I’ve been told I roleplay well and hope to find someone who enjoys details and language as much as I do. English is not my native language though, but hopefully I’m not too shabby. Below is a suggested intro, we can change it if you want! Be open with your thoughts and ideas =) I have many smaller kinks, and I’m open to new ones too, just ask!

I have a bit of time almost everyday, but know that this upcoming weekend is quite busy.)
 (This intro contains a boss-employee relationship.)

Throughout your adult life you’ve always been a hard worker. It has taken a lot of effort and sacrifice to end up where you are today, and sometimes you question if it has been worth it. You went from having no real money to becoming the [CEO] (Or any high boss of your choice) of a very successful international company. The long hours had taken a toll on your personal life though, and a few months back your last partner left you. Rethinking your situation a little you’ve started to delegate more of your job to be able to go down in time a little, and by now you’ve gotten it flexible enough to have a little free time even. 

In another part of the world my life had also contained a lot of struggle, but not with the same goals in mind as you did. My name is Tim, I’m 18 years old and live in Sweden. Well, lived in Sweden rather. My family consists of my single mother named Karin, and my two sisters Erica and Malin. With only one source of income my family has always been struggling to get by, but due to almost free education and good teachers I had managed to do well in school. It wasn’t easy though. The women in my family were all very feminine, short and curvy, and to my great annoyance I had also partly inherited such traits. I’m only 162 cm, or 5’3, with lightblonde hair and blue eyes. My short build is also very slender, but what fat I have gathering around my hips and butt. My butt is shaped more than mens butts usually are, and considering my face has androgyn features I had constantly been confused for a girl as a child. Even now it can be hard to tell sometimes, so I make sure to always dress in more masculine clothes. Due to my overall slightly girly and small looks I was constantly picked on in school causing me to become quite shy and timid. My sisters also kept teasing me about it, delighted with how easily I got mad at them. 

I was always quite clever, and due to fast development as a child I started school one year earlier then people my age usually do. And being younger didn’t help with my problem of being bullied… So I focused on my studies, and in the long run it has seemed to pay off. I still wasn’t that much of a people person, quite timid and feeling my height was a bit shameful. 

Your company was looking for international interns for one year. I had no real hope of getting the job, but two weeks later I got an answer that I was called to a skype interview. Hearing this made me incredibly nervous, and the thought of actually doing something besides my poorly paid extra job as cleaning hotel rooms was exciting and frightening at the same time. After an incredibly nervous interview, I got the internship. I couldn’t believe it. After that it was all a blur, a storm of emotions. I would begin in a month, and there was so much to get ready. Your company paid for tickets and arranged housing, an opportunity of a lifetime. I was nervous, but I knew I had to take it. An after saying goodbye to my family, a difficult departure, I left my home

Living alone, and in [the US] (If we have the RP there) was very rough at first. But now that four months had passed I felt much more comfortable in my situation. My colleagues were decent, everyone having very mixed emotions about me. Some just couldn’t take me seriously, thinking I just was adorable. Others had realized I was quite clever, trying to get me to overcome my shyness to make me contribute more. 

After these four months you were having a meeting with some of your employees regarding the new interns. You had taken four. Two of these seemed not quite cut out for the work, one were doing great, and the last one… It was an odd situation with this Tim. Leslie, a 33 year old rather chubby woman was the boss directly responsible of me.  She explained that I was exceptionally smart, and that I had done each task extremely well. She wanted to offer me a fulltime job. But the boss one step further up, the 52 year old Bob wasn’t at all as impressed. He’d seen me around the workplace, and noted how I had a hard time working in the group sometimes. “He’s so timid! I mean the kid looks like a girl too, no one will be able to take him seriously!” The comment made Leslie glare at him, and countered with that I was still young and would learn the social game in time. The two usually saw eye to eye on most matters but as they started to argue you stepped in, and decided you would talk to me before you sent them off. Your secretary quickly set up a meeting together Monday afternoon at 3. 

When you saw my image in my file you’d recognized me straight away. You had only seen me a handful of times, but each time I had disappeared before you got a chance to approach me. You couldn’t help it, you wanted to get to know me better. You’d never mixed up romantic/sexual feelings with your work, but for some reason you’d gotten real curious when you saw me. It was something about my looks that attracted you… And hearing about this situation you got an excuse to meet me. 

Today it’s Sunday, a rather rainy one at that. You’ve just been visiting an old friend living in the other side of town. On the way home you had to go by a grocery store, needing to fill up on some stuff at home. You stop at a bigger store in the slightly poorer parts of town and head inside. There’s lots of people doing their shopping, and you don’t really stand out as you go down the list of things to pick up. As you head to the last item on your list you suddenly spot someone you recognize. Me. 

I’m currently standing on my toes, trying to reach an item on one of the top shelves. I’m dressed in a pair of slightly too tight worn jeans and a white t-shirt wearing a light jacket over it. You can’t help but notice how short I am, but also how shapely my legs are. And my butt too. I’m holding my phone to my ear with one hand and hold a shopping basket in the other, speaking Swedish on the phone. “Ja- Ja jag äter tillräckligt- Jag är ju och handlar nu!” I release a little annoyed groan, and you guess I’m talking to a family member. You can tell I won’t be able to reach no matter how much I try.

(So that’s the intro. Suggestions, thoughts are very welcome. My plan is that we have a shorter meeting here at first, then skip a bit to when we meet the next morning. My character doesn’t recognize yours at all, not knowing you’re my top boss.)"

4dvhgg,2,2016-04-08,Engineering internships over summer important?,toasted_moon,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4dvhgg/engineering_internships_over_summer_important/,"Should I be concerned about not having an internship over the summer after my sophomore year as a mechanical engineer? My grades aren't as high as I'd like them to be so my plans were to take a few summer classes and work to pay for loans. I definitely am looking into research opportunities at my uni over the next year and summer though, it's just I have this uncomfortable feeling that I should have looked for an internship instead."
4dvy0q,439,2016-04-08,"""Curious,"" married-with-children neighbor prying into my [22f] life for 8 years with questionable intentions. You live down the street but let's not meet.",Mim0hsa,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/4dvy0q/curious_marriedwithchildren_neighbor_prying_into/,"Long post that felt good to get out. This is something that gave me anxiety for years, and I shook while writing it. I switched from first (I) to third person (OP) unintentionally but it makes it easier to write about.


We moved into our house when I was 5. My first memory of it was jumping on the twin beds with white wicker headboards with my sister.


A family moved into the house down the street when I was probably 7 or 8. Tim, Diana, and baby Sarah. 


We moved out of the house when I was 13 to renovate it. We moved back in when I was 14, also the summer when I was allowed to have a Facebook account.


Tim adds me as a friend. ""Oh, a grown-up family friend wants to be my friend. That's cool."" *Accept*
 

Tim starts conversations. ""Thanks for the add!""
 

Tim starts conversations about normal things, family and vacations and stuff. I replied.  


Tim pops up when I get into a relationship in 2009. Tim pops up when I break up. Tim and I talk about our families and Tim starts talking about giving ""the talk"" to his children. Blathers on about how much he admires my parents and their parenting style. ""Hey are you still with that guy? Wouldn't want to lose our Friday night sitter :) "" Not an exact quote. ""Hey girl, love your homecoming pictures. Who's the photographer?"" This type of messaging is regular and would go on every few weeks until 2014. Below are some more specific incidents. 


I start taking pictures outside of photography class. Tim compliments me on my photos. Tim comments on my hair color change. Tim comments on how classy I am and how smart, from beginning to near the end. 


Tim comes up the street to take photos of me before my senior prom (to his credit, he had a gorgeous camera and I still have one of the portraits somewhere).


All along, OP thinks it's fucking weird but doesn't think she's allowed to say anything because Tim is a grownup, after all. Sometimes, OP blows the messages off for weeks and weeks hoping he'll go away, but he's relentless. She makes excuses like ""yeah I see these but I'm super busy! You can email me at __@___."" 

Edit timeline (writing about this dislodged some things): OP gets a twitter before college, Tim follows her, and tweeting Lady Gaga lyrics (""I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong"") or tweeting about wanting a black sequined miniskirt got a response from him. 

OP goes to college in 2011, three years after Tim's first message. Tim starts conversations about religion. OP gets into campus leadership and helps host an event about female orgasms. Tim wants to talk about that, a lot. OP went on a coffee outing with a cool guy 10 years her senior in 2013 and tries to tell herself that Tim might just see her as a promising and interesting person. 


At some point, OP mentions this to her mom. OP's mom says that Tim talks to Diana about it sometimes and hopes that it doesn't come across as ill-intended!! (Edit: OP also mentions subject matter, at that time or at another, and OP's mom was like ""you know, we hang out with Diana and Tim a lot and they're very open-minded people."" True, but not what I needed to fucking hear.) 


OP comes home from college, gets drunk on dad's bar, and asks sisters (close in age) if Tim really likes messaging them, too. [Blank stares]


When Tim plays basketball at the hoop with his son Paul in summers when OP is home from college, OP catches Tim gazing into the dining room window of OP's house, right to where OP is seated. This happens once or twice. 


OP takes an internship in 2014 that makes her travel a lot. OP stops replying and Tim probably freaks out. Tim emails her. ""Sorry, OP, if my conversations have ever crossed the line."" OP says, ""That's okay, Tim, but I don't think we should talk about that [nude photography as an art form] anymore."" 


Tim goes on a long rave about how much respect he has for OP and how his intentions were never ""lascivious."" OP never accused Tim of having weird intentions. OP blocks Tim on Facebook and he notices right away. He sends another blathering apology, sends another email saying that the last one was an error and that he ""just can't catch a break. :("" Fuck you, Tim.


OP goes abroad for a year and shit happens that has nothing to do with Tim. In therapy she's learning how to forgive. She crosses paths with Tim in the cul-de-sac and thinks ""hey, he's okay."" She adds Tim again on Facebook and he thanks her for the add.


The therapy OP was in taught her a lot about triggers. She brings up Tim to her therapist and the therapist is disgusted with him but compassionate with OP. Therapist says that Tim is obsessed. OP is grossed the fuck out at the time and is shaking writing this. 


OP tells her now-fiancé about the years of messages and he gets angry - not at her, but at Tim. OP realizes that while everyone gaslit her for years, this is not normal. 


OP drafts messages. She settles with,


""Tim, I've been thinking a lot lately about the conversations you started, and tried to start with me, when I was in high school and in college.


A lot of time has passed between me being a confused 15-year-old receiving messages from a neighbor who was so very interested in talking to her; who repeatedly came out of the woodwork for 7 years to talk about subjects like puberty, her romantic relationships, nude photography, and even events about sex on her college campus. In that time I have realized that most people do not do this kind of thing.


I was a precocious kid and I might have seemed like a great person to talk to. I was very young however, and you were my neighbor. I thought it would be disrespectful to an adult to tell you that I thought that such conversations were inappropriate, and I have wondered all along if you knew that I didn't dare. 


Now, I'm going to draw a line. You and I will not have conversations more serious than ""hello,"" ""how are you,"" and ""goodbye."" Do not try to initiate conversations about anything more personal or sensitive than that.


If you still have any of my prom photos from 2011, you will permanently delete them.


You need to talk to a professional about boundaries. I did.""


Tim replies with a long apology, but swears his intentions were innocent and laments about losing the respect of someone he holds in high regard.


Tim promises to delete all photos he has of me (prom AND neighborhood parties, apparently, how long was he photographing me for?!?) and is deleting his Facebook, supposedly.


So, Tim, although I see your house every time I drive away from my parents' home on rare visits, and although you did nothing illegal and can keep pretending that you're a normal old dad and a nice guy, and I will look like a dick when I exclude you and your family from my wedding, let's not fucking meet.

Parents: please teach your children that they are allowed to dislike and distrust certain grownups. Please trust your children's intuition when they come to you with a problem, or they will never trust their own. 

UPDATE #1: Second and final message to Tim, freaking out thinking he was going to go to my family to find out about me despite going no contact, realized I needed to talk to my mom. https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/4e5hlh/update_curious_marriedwithchildren_neighbor/

UPDATE #2 (final): Conversation with mom. Neither of us think she or my dad knew the extent to which it bothered me, and given that I was a young teenager when it started, I knew it was odd but not as much as I do now. It went really well and I'm glad we aired it out. https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/4e7dvf/update_final_curious_marriedwithchildren_neighbor/

4dw30t,15,2016-04-08,"Sophomore doubling Actuarial Science &amp; Statistics at Illinois currently looking to study anything but Act Sci to compliment a Stats degree. The dream would be writing for 538 or a similar publication, but I'm also interested in a career as a data scientist/statistical consultant. Anyone have advice?",gymsteal,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/4dw30t/sophomore_doubling_actuarial_science_statistics/,"**Some (extensive, optional) background**:

*Why I'm leaving Act Sci*-

I came in with about 1.5 years worth of gen-eds knocked out with AP credits and a single declared major in Actuarial Science. I passed Exam P after my freshman year, which landed me an interview for an internship with my top choice of the actuarial consulting firms that visited my school (Milliman). I didn't get it, and upon followup the interviewer said he was impressed with my proficiency but had doubts about how much I ""wanted it,"" and consequently how successful I would be at the kind of entrepreneurial client recruitment their actuaries do. The rejection was disappointing at the time because I was very impressed with the models they showed me and the whole interview process confirmed my suspicion that if I wanted to be an actuary, I'd want to do consulting rather than an insurance company gig. But, I guess he had a pretty good intuition that I was excited in that half-hearted way you get when you find out you'll be able to actually stomach one of limited options of which none truly interest you. As I continue to learn more about the distinctions between meticulous details about real life trading in corporate markets and the conceptual focus characterizing the FM exam, I also continue to get turned off by the idea of solely minimizing risk of losing money in financial speculation and figuring out how to turn a client's money into more money.

*What I like &amp; what I'm good at*-

By far, all my favorite classes have been my stats classes (and philosophy, but let's be real), so I declared a double major this year. There's a lot of overlap so I can still actually graduate a semester early with my current 2 majors and a Math minor, but I don't want to. I am very intrigued by working with big data and am loving the class I'm in right now about different methods of regression and model comparisons. I genuinely enjoy writing and have received enough positive feedback from peers and mentors that I'd feel confident selling my ability to communicate information or editorializing findings from studies to an employer who values it, hence the attraction to 538. Other topics I enjoy are politics and math, and math in particular has always come pretty naturally to me. I've been considering going for either major and minor combination in Math + Philosophy or two minors in them to apply to grad school because I know those are the best for sharpening your logic and reasoning skills (a professor last year said those two have the highest positive correlation with scores on the LSAT or the bar exam, forgot which one). I am pretty comfortable using Excel and am currently learning R, but I feel like my limited vocabulary in any other language is holding me back from being a typically attractive millennial hire. Honestly, I have doubts about the level of grad school I would be able to get into if GPA is heavily weighted in the admissions process, as I've taken a bit longer than I should have getting used to structuring my time in college and my general apathy towards my non-stats/philosophy classes has put my GPA at 3.06, and that's expected to drop after this semester. I have two years to bring it back up to a level I consider more indicative of my ability, but I definitely don't see myself getting into an esteemed grad school without admissions being impressed with my application essay.

*My concerns*-

1)Is stats on its own a valued and marketable skill in the current/foreseeable economy?

2)How vital is grad school for a career as a statistician, and does the esteem of the grad school at which you study even matter?

3)How much computer science would you recommend I learn if I go the data scientist route--or any route, for that matter--and would I considerably benefit from switching my Stats major to the combined Stats &amp; CS major offered here more than I would from seeking certifications or a CS minor?

4)Are political science or any other lens through which we study human behavior a desirable supplemental proficiency to those in the market for statistical consultants?

5)Is it realistic to want to be paid to study things and write about the findings?

**TL;DR I want to get a job using statistics. How do I?**

I don't expect to find all the answers here, but I've read some pretty interesting and helpful posts on this sub in the past so I figured I'd give you guys a holler. Oodles of thanks to anyone who read this whole post!

EDIT: 1.5 years, not 1.5 semesters."

What should I do?",pineapple_catapult,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dwswu/accepted_a_software_engineering_internship_but/,"So last week I verbally accepted an offer for a software engineering internship (10 weeks full time, paid, 22/hr).  While waiting for the written offer to arrive, I interviewed at another place for a Data Analyst position and was called back for a second interview next week.  It's full time, and I'm thinking it will pay somewhere in the range of 45-50k + full benefits and 5 weeks paid time off (pretty decent for my area, I'm not in some crazy expensive region like the Bay area or NYC).   I'm thinking that I could be getting an offer from this company, the first interview went well.  I still have one semester of school left after this (graduating in December), and I think the company offering the full time position is willing to work with me for that, as my classes would be mostly at night anyway.

I'm conflicted as to what I should do:  on one hand, I have a solid internship lined up for the summer, that pays way better than the job I have currently, and is more in line with what I want to do (I went back to school specifically for programming/software engineering), and I'd have to renege on the offer, but at the same time, a real full time job is hard to turn up.  And, I'm not against a big data type job, I just didn't necessarily see myself in those shoes when I went back to school.  It could be lower stress/pressure than doing a programming type job, which might fit my personality better.  I'm just a little conflicted and was wondering if anyone could provide some insight."

___________________________________________________
Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

Every project I have done in the last three years have been so much fun and I have learned so much on the way to where I am now. Seeing my work improve and my popularity grow is a great way to stay motivated and to keep delivering top of the notch work. 

I've recently (read yesterday) finished my internship at a small design firm in my town. After finishing they asked me to stay and help them with some projects, most of them websites. 

At the moment I am following a lot of online courses to stay up to date and to keep improving my set of skills. 

For now and the coming 1 to 2 years the amount of money I make is alright. But I see the possibility to make it bigger. Bigger in more clients, money. However, I'm afraid to take this step.

Taking this step would mean raising my overall price (which is my USP) so that I can for example; Rent a small office, start my own hosting, hiring other freelancers, etc etc.

Does anyone have any experience in this? If so, do you mind giving me some tips about how to get this done?

The startup that I'll be working in is starting their data science division and I'll be one of the first one to be working on ML to solve their problems. They haven't hired anyone for ML till now but my interviewer (and also my would-be mentor) told me that they are hiring a data engineering guy. As it is a startup, he is expecting me to work a lot at the place and they are offering a good salary based on the area. So, it will be gruelling work for sure. 

I am really excited for the position but I feel low on confidence on coding interview questions because of my lack of preparation. Straight after the internship, on-campus placement season will begin at my college to hire for full-time opportunities. I am nervous because I don't know how I'll manage time to practice my interviewing skills and prepare for interviews while juggling with the internship. Some people I have talked to are advising me to prepare for interviews in August rather than taking up a summer internship as I am not expecting to take up a full time job at the same startup as well. Needed advice from you guys on the same.

**tl;dr**: got internship offer from a startup on a position that I wanted, how to take out time for preparing for full-time interviews which will take place almost just after internship ends.

I am very interested in the field but I also would like to travel some and I don't think I'll have many more opportunities in the future. Right now I am able to travel for free because my dad works for a major airline. I have gone overseas a handful of times, but it was always to the same country for a week or two, and I spent most of the time with relatives I couldn't connect with very well due to the language barrier. This privilege lasts for another year or two.

On the other hand, I don't feel like my university has instructed me enough in my field, which worries me to no end. An internship would likely be my best shot at gaining experience and becoming desirable in the job market after I graduate. Choosing to do this feels like the more responsible decision, but travelling and getting outside of my comfort zone seems fairly important as well, as it would force me to actually talk to people to around. Any guidance would be very much appreciated.

4dxc2t,7,2016-04-08,A tale of two internships: what would be a better choice?,river_roads,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/4dxc2t/a_tale_of_two_internships_what_would_be_a_better/,"Long-time lurker, first time poster.

Me: Recent grad school grad (Envi. Sci with significant coursework in GIS/stats) who has been looking for work for about 6 months.

Potential internship position: Small planning department, working on transportation/zoning mapping and other various planning tasks.

Here is my quandary: this internship is slightly out of my area of interest (I'd eventually like to end up in something with both GIS and environmental aspects) but pays decent ($15 per hour, midwest USA) and has long-term potential. My hesitation is that since the department is so small, there isn't anyone else in the office with a ton of GIS experience that I could learn from- I'd basically be on my own or asking advice from other planning commissions and other connections the office has (what they have said they've done in the past). I did some investigating and their past interns have stayed around 1-2 years each- so I'm thinking they couldn't have been that unsupported? I'd say I'm pretty good at teaching myself things as well. Hours would be on the higher end of part-time.

I have an official offer for this position, but am also waiting to hear about a second internship I interviewed for that is closer to what I'd ultimately like to be doing, is under a GIS specialist, full-time, but also has a much shorter duration (typical summer internship), and pays only $10 per hour. Both internships are public sector positions.

At this point, I've been looking for work long enough to not want to wait for something better, I'm feeling so lazy and worthless sitting at home doing nothing (other than trying to teach myself python) and want something to give me some experience and income while I look for a permanent position. 

Should I go ahead and accept the longer-term planning position with less guidance that is not quite what I'd like to do- or hold out to see if I get offered the shorter-term lower-paying position that may give better experience in the field I'm interested? Thoughts, advice? "

I know stipends are taxed differently and I know I have options in terms of telling the company that just gave me an offer. What should I do? Should I take the amended offer, try and get more from the company that originally had a more lucrative program, or does the stipend not even make up the difference after tax?"

She has been busy with final school projects and exams so we haven't seen each other since the weekend (which we spent entirely together).

I wasn't expecting to see her until the next day but she calls me out of the blue yesterday after work to see if I'd like to come with her to one of her student group events and hang out beforehand.  I tell her to come over.  She comes over, we hang out and joke around, and then eventually start fooling around.  We're going to be late for the event so we decide to continue later.

We go to the event and everything is fine, we're socializing and having fun.  Then she starts talking to one of her friends about her plans after she graduates.  She has always planned to move away and work or do an internship abroad, so this has been on her mind heavily lately.

When we first started dating, she said she had always planned on moving right after she graduated, but was now considering holding off on that till the fall (or later potentially if she continued her degree or decided to work where we live) because she met me.

She had taken a job at her families company in the city and had plans to work there after school.  In the past few weeks though she has been very hot/cold and she'd brought up the issue that she's now decided to leave in August/September.  She started getting really anxious and weird about it and I asked her if she had anything lined up or any definite plans and she said no, so I said something along the lines of ""then why are we even talking about it, if it's not an issue yet?""

Anyways back to last night.  When we get back to my place we pick up where we left off and start having sex.  She seems unengaged/distracted so I say ""tell me what's wrong"".  She brings up the same issue as before.  That she plans to leave in September and it's bugging her.  It's the same conversation we had before so I asked her if anything has changed since and she said no, but that talking about it with her friends made her think about it.

I told her that I'm not going to try to change her mind on anything, but I'd rather just enjoy our time together.  She responds with...  ""If you don't really see yourself staying with someone, what's the point of continuing to be together?""

We talk a while and I joke about her ruining my awesome bachelor life.  I tell her that “it’s no secret I’m falling for you” and she starts getting emotional and crying.  She seems really torn and confused and is having trouble talking at this point.  She says the last she “doesn’t know me that well” which is weird because when we were first dating she would always say things like “it’s so weird, it’s like I’ve known you for years”.  I ask if she wants me in her life or not and she doesn’t answer right away.  During her emotional storm I’m trying to remain calm and stoic and simply guide the conversation without seeming like I’m overly invested.

I joke that maybe we should go back to being FWBs and that if that's the case she'll have to recruit a few friends to make up for it.  Then we start getting back into it again and have really rough sex which is hurting her, but she tries to put up with.  I again stop, as I'm not into sex that the other person isn't enjoying.  We talk a bit more and then continue to have much more passionate sex for an hour or so.  We then shower together and get ready for bed.  She seems in a better mood and talks about how great the sex was, but still seems a little dazed.  I joke that “she just needed a good fucking and gets anxious when she goes too long between them”, to which she laughs/agrees but says “it’s not just that…”  We continue to talk about unrelated stuff for ~30 minutes before falling asleep.

Now I've always abided by the rule of analyzing the actions of a girl, not her words.  Her words say she's certainly leaving in the fall and unsure about our relationship, but her actions suggest otherwise (she hasn't made any plans to leave, she still hangs out with me constantly, we continue to have great passionate sex, she plans on seeing me later tonight and tomorrow).  Was this a shit-test?  Something to stir up drama and create some emotion/excitement?  Or should I be concerned here?  She’s been hot/cold out entire relationship, so although the conversation was a little extreme this time, the behavior wasn’t super abnormal.

I really don't know what to think here.  When we’re together we have a great time, but she can get very anxious and on edge about certain things.  When she’s around me, she’s usually in that giddy happily retarded mood girls get in and when I look in her eyes I see a look of desire/comfort.  I think that my attainability has perhaps been far too high in our relationship, that I haven’t presented myself as much of a challenge and she is treating me as a sure thing.

Any opinions would be greatly appreciated.

4dxoep,6,2016-04-08,Finding fulfillment in comp/sci,uno85417162,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/4dxoep/finding_fulfillment_in_compsci/,"I have been doing some reflecting recently about my situation and feel like I can provide some insight into the many --often flawed-- reasons why we attend college or pursue a certain profession/field-of-study. I'd be interested to hear about your situation and if you have found happiness in computer science. 

I'll first start with where I'm at currently. I'm a sophomore at a public university in the mid-west studying computer science with a focus on security. My grades are good and I'm an intern at a fairly large company doing very low-level enterprise-level IT tasks. I also tutor computer programming a couple days a week at the school I go to. Considering these jobs plus classes, it's quite a lot of work.

Now, how did I get here? When I started to pursue computer science a few years ago, I set out to really learn as much as I could. I started with programming and have since expanded to many other computer science topics like design, operating systems, etc. I have really learned a lot about IT as it relates to business but also have an intrigue into what is to come with more advanced computer science topics. Through all of this, I never found something that has fulfilled me. That feeling you get from a day well spent from accomplishing something meaningful has never been felt. Each night I double-down and say ""tomorrow is the day when I will be fulfilled"" only to be disappointed by idiot students that come in for tutoring or one of my fellow desk jockeys at work. 

One of the reasons I think this is, is because my time has not been allocated to the best of my ability. Sacrificing regular social interaction for more work and more classes has not paid off. Moreover, cramming my day with mind-numbing work leaves me mentally exhausted at the end and wanting to be alone. My mind is very scattered at times and doesn't quite have the time to relish what exactly I am doing with my life. It's the feeling of ""going very fast, but going nowhere"". It's almost to the point where I can't sleep or eat. I literally have dreams where I am trying to solve a problem and get stuck in an infinite for loop. Maybe it's my bladder signalling that unless I go to the bathroom, I can't proceed with the dream, who knows. I also find myself eating abnormally, eating large meals, skipping meals, etc. Even with a roommate, living has really gone downhill. 

So what does this mean for the future? Without finding other like-minded people --especially in the computer science field-- the path seems short and dry. But, by taking on a new project, meeting new people, bouncing a few ideas around, I think I can experience the path of computer science which is long and fruitful.

Is this on par? How have you found fulfillment in this field?"

The primary objective is to have them help us create standard documents (mobile device setup, spam information, email continuity, etc) plus shadow help desk calls. I want to teach them how to talk someone over the phone get connected remotely via LogMeIn Rescue. Once connected, help desk staff will walk them through fixing the issues.

Now, we have enough work to keep one intern busy full time but I pushed for two. My rationale is they should spend half their time working on client documentation stuff and half of their time learning. I am going to set up a lab and have them go through the Introduction to Windows Server course on pluralsight. I also am going to have them go through a bunch of specific vendor sales/technical training courses.  

I think getting two interns is better than just one. This is focused on teaching them the basics of IT. In my mind, two interns will be able to both bounce ideas off each other and share ""war"" stories with each other. I see the learning curve being pretty steep so the students will have each other to lean on for the course work.

Sorry for the wall of text.

TL;DR - Hiring two interns. Have enough work to keep one busy full time, but with two I want to structure half of their jobs in a way that will teach them IT basics. What do you think would be the best things to teach two super green IT interns and how would you do it?"

This spring break I was ticketed by a US park ranger in Joshua Tree National Park, under 36 CFR 4.22 (b) (1) - 'Operating a Vehicle without Due care' when my car went off road and got stuck in the sand. There were no injuries to me or my passenger and the car had just a small radiator bust, but it had to be towed. Now on the ticket it says United States District Court Violation Notice and I have option B checked, Pay the fine of ($350  and a $25 processing fee), or appear in court (I was not given a court date and do not have one as of now)

I have no other run ins with the law, this is my first and I intend it to be the last. 

My question: I am a signal processing major, and have a decent GPA (3.2-3.4) and a good research background (publications, research award and a research internship this summer), does this affect my prospects for employment here in the states, do the employers look at this in bad notion ? How is this viewed in the Tech industry ? Some one please give me advice/your thoughts regarding this.

First off, I would like to take the time to thank you all for showing nothing but support and love, I could never express my appreciation for that guys!

I'm almost done with my fourth day, which wasn't bad at all! In fact, I was feeling good most of the day, except when I had a cluster headache that phased me out a little bit.

My head is much clearer and I feel much more social. I went out of my way today and had a short conversation with two adorable girls in my school! 

This is the first weekend without weed, it feels a bit odd since I usually light up until I pass out, but I don't even miss it one bit. My mind is more occupied with coming up with ways to fill all the free, clear time I have on my hands. 

I already applied to over 10 internships over the past few days, I work out every other day (1 day on/1 day off), and read about 2 hours a day. Also, I bought a couple brain teasers books in attempt to increase neuroplasticity and I feel like it helps.


I was thinking about having couple drinks, but instead I will just take a walk to clear my head and I will have couple hours to kill before bed time. 

I wish you all the best, and remember, only thing that is 100% in our control is whether we smoke or not, the rest will work out as time passes!

4dz7nv,4,2016-04-08,My [24F] company associate's [50M] abuse of our interns [19F/21F],girlinworkplace,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dz7nv/my_24f_company_associates_50m_abuse_of_our/,"So the man concerned works a few times a year as a consultant with my company , which is very small and a young all-female team except for the boss (I suspect that this is a contributory factor to the problem). I've noticed that he has a rude and condescending attitude to people working for him, but now he has turned it on the interns at my company - who do not work for him. The guy has a habit of asking them to do chores for him unrelated to our or his work (ie going and buying him something) which for me crosses a line. Anyway, things came to a head today when a mistake was made in a very minor task that usually should not have been required of the interns and I caught him laying into them this evening at a work party, swearing at them about how incompetent they are ('Fuck, you're so stupid,' etc). I listened to him rant for about ten minutes while my supervisor (35F) tried to defuse the situation before going to get our boss, but he kept on and on, the interns were getting upset, and I eventually told him that they were just the interns, that was enough,and if he had a problem then he could discuss it with the team members, and that he needs to speak more respectfully to them. Cue him insulting me and storming off to complain to my boss while one of the interns starts crying (and I stand there seething in fury). Boss comes over and shouts at the intern for making a mistake.

I am now wondering how to approach the situation on Monday, seeing as this guy is actually squatting in our office apparently indefinitely (not as an employee, it's a favour from my boss). I understand that it puts my boss in a difficult situation because he considers the relationship to be valuable, so stopping hiring him is extremely unlikely, but at the same time I have the minimum expectation that my workplace will be a safe place and, even if we occasionally work with difficult people, that we won't be subjected to verbal abuse (not to mention on a thoroughly unreasonable basis), and furthermore that my boss has some responsibility in ensuring this, especially in our office. How can I approach him about this? Is there anything that can be done?  

TLDR; Senior person associated with my company badly mistreats my team even though he doesn't employ us, but boss unsympathetic, what do Reddit?"

I live in the Hudson Valley of NY and I'd ultimately like to work in the general area. My main interest is in criminal law, if that helps. So I need thoughts on my schools, and what would suit me best!

SUNY Buffalo- $12,000 scholarship per year ($24000 tuition), will need housing
Brooklyn Law School- $37,000 scholarship per year ($43,000 tuition), can commute via Metro North
Penn State- Full tuition scholarship, renewable every year ($45,000 tuition), will need housing

I'm still waiting on UConn, Fordham and St. John's. I'll be able to commute to Fordham and St. John's, but not UConn. 

Fordham is my favorite, but I know it's a stretch and I'll probably get no money if I do get in. Buffalo is the lowest ranking so I'm thinking that one will probably get the boot.

**The reason for my post:** 

10 months post break up I still angrily ruminate for hours on the breakup and post breakup and the relationship itself, seemingly constantly. I search online for his name and the names of the people involved in the breakup. I want them all out of my head, I want not to be angry anymore but I can’t seem to let it go. I’m sick to death of the revenge fantasies and fury that fill my spare time. I’ve seen a psychologist but for this particular issue it doesn’t seem to be helping. I’m hoping that writing it down and seeing what suggestions people make about getting over anger will help. I’m sorry if I leave out relevant details or ramble. There’s a lot. I will try to be succinct and honest. 

**Before the break up:** 

We’d been together for five years. We’d lived together for four years. We hadn’t slept in the same bed for months. I was just out of university, and had taken a full time unpaid internship as part of the process of post-grad work I needed to do for entrance to my profession. I had quit my job and he was taking on all expenses at the time, something that was discussed between us and that he swore he was fine with. During the previous four years of living together I had worked part time and paid part of the rent and expenses while going to uni full time. At the time we broke up he was paying all rent and bills, and had been for maybe six months. He knew I had no savings. 

We were both very stressed. He had been sick for months with some undiagnosed thing that left him weak and unwell most of the time. His job was very stressful. I had worked my butt off and done well at uni but was terrified about my job prospects in an awful graduate market and hated having no money. We’d been squabbling for the first time in our five year relationship because I’d fallen out with his two best friends, a married couple who lived in the same block of flats, next door to us. The fallout was partly my fault, partly theirs. Excessive anger and stubbornness on both sides I would say. One of the two friends was a pretty vicious guy, he started with blanking me and moved on to calling me a ‘fucking psycho’ to my face. Boyfriend refused to take my side in the fight. I accused him of being more loyal to his friends than to me. I said I wanted him to limit his time with the friends (I specifically said I wasn’t asking him to end the friendship) since they now hated my guts and it was distressing to me that he was still hanging out with them constantly, hearing god knows what opinions about me. He refused. In fact he said we had to break up if I insisted that he limit the friendship. I backed down. I know, I know. I was not in a good place. 

**The breakup:** 

The day that I finished the internship he broke up with me. He said he hadn’t been happy for years. He said my anger was too much. I asked him what the fuck I was to do, given I had no job and no money. He said the most important thing was that I was okay. That was the last time I saw him. He left for his parents’ house for a few days and I had to move in with my alcoholic mother as I had no money. I was heartbroken. It was horrific. I was gone in two days. I didn’t harm any of his stuff, though I wanted to. I left every gift he had ever given me in a pile on the floor. All my stuff went into storage. I told him via email that he had to pay for the storage (about $200.00 a month) until I found a job and that he had to pay for the movers. He did both those things. I stayed with my mother, sleeping on the floor of her workroom, for four months. I found a job in a month. I told him immediately that I would now take over the payments for storage and this I did. It took me another three months to save up enough for a bond and to buy the furniture and appliances I needed for a new place. I stayed with my alcoholic mother for four months and it was the worst four months of my adult life. I had left home at fifteen, largely because living with an alcoholic parent was enormously traumatic. He knew this. He knew I had no money and it was my only option. 

Being there again, with her uncontrollable drinking and everything that went with it, the wailing through the night, the falls, the lying, just seeing her like that, was truly, truly awful. I couldn’t be there after three in the afternoon because the drinking started then. I stayed out as late as I could every night to avoid seeing her drunk, even after I started the new full time job and was exhausted at the end of the day. I finished my postgraduate studies. Staying with her re-traumatised me in a terrible way. I developed severe anxiety. Even after I left and moved into my own place, I couldn’t sleep through the night anymore. I woke up four - five times a night, every night. I was eventually diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I started self-harming again, something I hadn’t done for ten years. I was suicidal. I started seeing a psychologist and these symptoms are improving.  

I blamed and blame him for how awful it was to stay there and for all the symptoms that followed. If he had made some provision for me to stay elsewhere, offered me enough money so that I could pay a bond and leave that terrible place sooner, I would not have had to go through that. I never asked him for money apart from the expenses above which I had no way of meeting at the time, I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Pride, shame, I don’t know. 

To be clear, he was right to break up with me. The relationship had many problems. We were not well suited. He was right about me being an angry person in general. I’m not angry about him breaking up with me, though it made me horribly sad at the time, because I loved him. I am angry about the circumstances he left me in and the fact that I cannot remember any part of our relationship - the longest of both our adult lives - with any happiness. I just want to forget any of it ever happened because it all feels tainted by how it ended. 

**Contact with him:** 

For the first three weeks I was a complete mess. Classic heartbreak. I couldn’t eat. I cried uncontrollably. I lost 8 kilos.  I would call him sobbing uncontrollably at all hours of the day because the pain was so bad and I would do anything to try and make it stop. I told him that I couldn’t bear staying with my mother. That it was unspeakably horrific for me to be there. I begged him to please help me. Eventually he stopped answering my calls. 

I sent him an email sometime in the next few months, venting all my fury, telling him how his conduct had completely fucked my life and my mental health. Recriminations, anger, terrible spite. Anything to hurt him, though I made no threats. No reply. 

After I moved into a place of my own I couldn’t speak to my mother for a while because of the anxiety that I had developed. I told her this, doing everything I could to soften the blow and make it clear I would be in touch again at some point soon. She threatened to kill herself. It was more horror. I sent him an email and told him that I blamed him for that too. 

At some point I learnt that his friends (the ones I had fallen out with) were telling anyone who would listen that I was planning to sue him (I think that this misapprehension came from me pointing out in that first nasty email to him that as a financially dependent de-facto I was actually entitled to some financial support after he broke up with me. The reason I said this was to try and elicit an apology from him, some acknowledgment that I wasn’t completely off-base to be angry that he encouraged me to quit my job and then kicked me out of our home with no warning, forcing me into a terrible situation. I never said I would sue him and never intended to. I was just trying to point out that this wasn’t me being crazy, that the family court of this country takes a dim view of people being made homeless) and that I was a ‘fucking psycho’. 

I sent him a measured email telling him that I never intended to sue him because I could see no good coming from him thinking that and it was completely untrue. There was no reply. That was the last contact I made, several months ago. 

I haven’t seen him since the break up or tried to see him. I’ve never made a social media post about the fact that we broke up or my feelings or my situation. I’ve never contacted his friends, family or work. I didn’t damage any of his property. I’ve cut him and his friends from social media. The only ‘psycho’ things I did were the two admittedly vicious emails and I suppose the heartbroken calls and texts in the first few weeks. 

**Now:** 

I have a good job now. My sleep is improving. I usually only wake up a few times a night, and have slept through the night a few times. Meditation and exercise and therapy have helped a lot.  I am rarely suicidal. I’ve stopped self-harming. I am less miserable. I can speak to my mother again. I still blame him for the damage done to my mental health and the symptoms I still experience. I’m terribly, terribly angry. I had had a great deal of therapy before I ever met him and worked hard for many years to re-establish a relationship with my mother and to deal with my various childhood traumas. He knew that. I thought I was past it. Being put back in that situation set me back many years. It did me real and lasting damage. I ruminate about what I would say to him, what I would do to him, his friends. I think about how easy it would have been for him, with his large income (well over $100,000.00 per annum, with at least that in savings), to give me say, $5,000.00, and help me avoid having to be in that situation. I reflect on him telling me when we broke up that the main thing was that ‘you are okay’ and I become enraged because it was a lie.  I believe it would have been better for me emotionally to stay in a homeless shelter than to stay with my mother, and I honestly would have done that if I hadn’t had two cats that I love very much and that I also had to house. I really had no choice about staying with her and I got out as quickly as I could. I want to get past how angry I am, at him and his friends who now happily spread lies about me. I don’t know how to do that. I would like help. 

**TLDR;** 

Bad break up. Left me in very traumatic circumstances, for which I, rightly or wrongly, blame him. I truly hate him. Whether or not I am right to blame him for the breakdown in my mental health, how do I get over my anger with this person?

Bad break up. Left me in very traumatic circumstances, for which I, rightly or wrongly, blame him. I truly hate him. Whether or not I am right to blame him for the breakdown in my mental health, how do I get over my anger with this person?"

4e01wf,1,2016-04-09,DevOps Summer Internship,likdeeznuts,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e01wf/devops_summer_internship/,"Hey guys! I've received summer internship offers from two mid-late stage startups in the bay area. I'm having some trouble choosing between the two.

The role at company A is going to be more DevOps focussed with probably most of the code written in Bash and Python(one of my stronger languages). At company B they've promised me a ""breadth of projects"" that will help me gain experience in various facets of software engineering so I feel it'll be a little more full stack i.e. more Java/Javascript (both of which I don't know). 

Considering this is an internship, my main goal is to learn as much as possible to allow me to apply for full time roles as a backend software engineer in the Fall. I feel I'd enjoy working on the core product of a company. Building the product from the ground up. DevOps doesn't seem to fit that category and the opportunities offered by B seem to be more conducive for that. 

However, I don't want to make a hasty decision and go for company B without inputs from other people in the field!

Now that I've spoken about the background of the two companies I'll come to the questions I have (about time!).

1. If I were to take up the devops intern role, would I automatically eliminate the possibility of applying for full time roles in the field I mentioned above?

2. Are the skills required for a DevOps role different from those required of a software engineer who works on the product itself i.e. the engineers who use the tools that DevOps builds?

3. Are DevOps engineers looked at differently by software engineers or vice versa? (Sorry about this slightly awkward question!)

That pretty much sums it up. Any comments/answers would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks guys!

&amp;nbsp;
*************

&amp;nbsp;

As the title states I think people are complaining about the wrong things. Heroes shouldn't and (I hope) won't really change or be ""nerfed"". Logic/Reasons:

&amp;nbsp;

- No Ranked system is in place. I acknowledge there is some kind of ""hidden"" ranked balancing thing that isn't competitive for sure--playing for the love of the game amiright?--and ELO *cough* agora.gg *throws up* is a joke. So how do you know they're ""OP"" and your counters are just bad(or vice-versa)? You don't.

&amp;nbsp;

- New players are popping up like pimples on a teenager. They're stubborn, ugly, and when you pop them pussy little rage flies out. But one day, they'll grow up to be beautiful... flowers? Idk. But so many people are new to the game/genre. Let it settle. Let the players get gud. Let them be flowers dammit before you pull out the weed wacker.

&amp;nbsp;

- Deck builds are awful. If peoples deck builds were outfits. I would see underwear on elbows, shoes on ears and duck face on ass. Logic? Not usually. Bad? not really. People are experimenting. Just like two boys at summer camp. They'll grow out of it. But with help.... Segue...

&amp;nbsp;

Fixes! IDEAS! Suggestions... Simple enough. I think the lack of ""knowledge"" is KEY &lt;---- see the word ""key"" its important shhh..... KNOWLEDGE is key.  So is experience. But the knowledge can be provided. Here's how I think how:

&amp;nbsp;

- Under the profiles for heroes give us some real information. Right now I only see ""light"" info of abilities. And unless I'm stupid--which I am but still--it only shows Level one abilities. The space is there. Have the intern sit down and write out CD-time/mana costs/damage-increase for each level. And when he's done give him half a cookie. Eat the other half. Too much hope is bad ya know.

&amp;nbsp;

- Under the in-game ""Control"" button get better info. Right now it's almost downright decieving. With some abilities just showing a mana cost increase. Why would someone new ever upgrade that? Bigger AOE. 2 words. You could even put a Bubble with a ""+"" sign. Put something

&amp;nbsp;

- Last of all. Card deck, explanation, change/overhaul thing. This is the biggest. So it's last. Note, I'm not suggesting CHANGING the cards but asking/begging (Only other time I get on my knees is for Channing Tatem so enjoy it) for an easier, better understood UI system. WTF is a shadow ward? First thing I said when I got my first card pack. Descriptions of what cards do is shady. And the tools to build a deck are even worse. These are huuuuuge. And I think most effort should be into getting these out.

&amp;nbsp;

I've played +100 games. Like a lot of you. But. The ""bad"" experiences I face are from randoms who didn't go out and look up all this random stuff they couldn't find in the game. That's my opinion. Conclusion: Don't friendzone the new people epic. Embrace them; take them between your gorgeous big breasts and show them a world they didn't know they needed until now.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks. End of post. Peace."

He has a girlfriend [21F], he met during this time abroad.",8monthslater,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4e0n3s/i_22f_dated_guy_abroad_26m_moved_away_but_8/,"Last summer, there was a group of us who were studying abroad. Me and this guy really liked each other but it was one of those didn’t realise it situations. He ended up sleeping with someone from our group, a girl who has a bit of a reputation, yet we were still getting closer. This girl believed they were heading into a relationship. Me and the guy ended up kissing and he broke it off with the girl to be with me. 


He told me that he didn’t feel the same way about her etc and wanted her to leave (she had prolonged her stay). He took me to meet his mum (it was the first time she had met a girl of his) and we spoke about visiting each other when we returned home etc. It was clear to everyone that we were really into each other. His dad and his childhood friends even commented on it. (His dad had also seen the other girl too but didn’t particularly like her.)


Now, we still hadn’t committed to each other. At this point, there was only a couple of weeks before we parted and we never had the chance to get serious. On the final night, everyone met up and then I found out later that he slept with her again on this final night. As I said we weren’t in a proper relationship but I believe in different circumstances we could have been. I should add, I hadn’t slept with him because I’m inexperienced and was nervous. 


We went home. He sent me postcards and we would text non stop. Then I found out about the last night and was hurt. I messaged him about it and tell him we should just be friends. 


6 weeks later, the girl messages me saying that he visited. Over the next few months it becomes known they’re a couple and they try to visit each month. 


It’s been 8 months since we last saw each other (longer than we were even friends there) and we still talk. The messages vary between really long and we both know what’s going on in each other’s lives. Not once has he mentioned her to me in all this time, though he must know I know. She tried messaging me too but in the end I stopped replying because I came to dread her messages. 


This morning, I found messages in my other folder from her demanding an explanation as to why I stopped talking. From 2 months ago. I honestly had no idea they were there. I haven’t read them yet.


I’m not going to lie and say I don’t have any residual feelings but I am glad we’re not in an LDR right now. I honestly think it would have fallen apart as we’re both at different points in our lives in order for any future to be planned. My friends believe they are more of a convenience relationship, they live a few hours away from each other and he is currently at home, in a town where he doesn’t know anyone, working 12 hr days in an internship. 


But why does he still write to me? I don’t think that she knows he does, especially after finding these messages, I imagine he wouldn’t tell her. It’s been 8 months, we’re in different countries, we’re not even friends on fb anymore (I deleted him when I was upset). I enjoy writing to him and staying in contact, and I would like to meet up in the future. But what could he think? After this long, you don’t keep writing to someone you never plan on seeing again. But he’s dating this girl. We fell pretty hard for each other back then, now we chat as friends, but never talk about what happened. 


I would like a 3rd party view on it. We’re not flirting or writing constantly. We’re so far apart, that it would be so simple to cut each other off but neither of us seem to want to do that. I don’t want to ask him, as he’s dating her and I do not want to get in the way of that. 


**TLDR: Dated guy whilst abroad. It’s been 8 months, different countries, still talking. He has a girlfriend, who he met from our time abroad.**

About 2 years ago I began to look for a job after graduating college. I work in a highly specialized field, and struggled to find a job for about 7 months. During that time I entered a depression, because the endless rejections took their toll on me. Initially when I was looking for jobs my boyfriend had stated that he didn't want to live in our home state so I focus all my effort in looking for jobs in other areas. Unfortunately after months of no job offers I began to search in my home state because in my field it is much easier to find a job when you are a local candidate, especially for someone who is a fresh college grad with only internship experience. Eventually I found a job with a company I live in my home state and took it. At the time I told my boyfriend, who was still in school, that this wasn't permanent and that after I had a 3 or so years experience it would be MUCH easier for me to find jobs in other states and I would be happy to leave. 


Last May my boyfriend graduated and took a job that is in another state across the country. That really hurt. At the time I stated that this location was much further away from my family than I wanted to be but he went anyway. This is ok, I understand he is free to do whatever he wants as he is his own person, but It hurt to have my boyfriend do that. At the time he asked me to just move with him and I said no because I had just started my job. What frustrated me at the time was that he is a teacher, and that in his field he can literally work anywhere in the country and will be doing mostly the same thing. I want to make it clear that I absolutely respect teachers and what they do, and I am not trying to say my career is more important than his; just that my career is more specific and finding jobs in various locations is more difficult. 


Now to the present. For a while I became ok with the idea of moving out there for him. I would be sacrificing a lot, family, friends, and a company I love to work for but I came to terms with that (which I think he doesn't truly understand the sacrifices I would make to be there). My one stipulation was that I needed to have a job there before I moved, because I didn't want to fall back into where I was after graduating and because my career is important to me. I spend a ton of time looking for jobs everyday, I have had a few interviews but no offers. Lately he had been telling me that if I loved him I would just quit my job and more out there with him. And has been demanding I set a date for when I'm coming regardless of if I have a job. This again really hurts, because when he left he chose everything he wanted in a job and a place to live over me and now he's telling me that if I loved him I have to give up everything I want to be there?


I feel like when he made the choice to move away from me he chose something other than me and made no sacrifice to be with me, and now he is asking me to scarifice everything to be with him. I don't know where to go from here. Am I crazy? I mean he did initially tell me he didn't want to live in our home state, and I did take a job there. But I only did it because I couldn't find anything else. Where do I go from here?


tl;dr: boyfriend moved away, I am not sure where to go from here."

------------------------------------------

- **[Rai News24]** **BREAKING NEWS**: After weeks of allegations, rumour, heated protests concerning the presumes widespread briberies, tax evasion, Sexual allegations and some counts of treason within the Collation governments, made up of the Forza Italia and the Movimento Cinque Stelle parties, President Silvio Berlusconi has resigned, following allegations and the confirmation of a vote of no Confidence within the Government. 15 fellow members of both parties have been found linked to these issues, with resignations and departures being seeing throughout the parties and Governemnt.

------------------------------------------------

####Resignation 

In the early hours of the February morning, Silvio Berlusconi faced a number of allegations, some dating back to his first Resignation back in 2014. Within his approval rate collapsing and a call for a vote of No Confidence for the Presidency, Silvio Berlusconi decided to resign, to take pressure of his now under-threat Government.

With the Investigation by the ""Dipartimento delle Informazioni per la Sicurezza"" (DIS, Department of Information Security), Several other Ministers have been accused of being involved in a number of scandals, linked in with Silvio Berlusconi. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

####Prime Minister remains

Following the Resignation of Belusconi, Marco Salvatore faces allegations, which yet have to be proven. Despite it, he will remain his position of Prime Minister, with no threat of a vote of no confidence. Instead, he will be kept under careful watch, now loosing huge support for his party.

---------------------------------------

####New Intern President

Following Berlusconi's Departure, Deputy party leader Giovanni Toti will take Berlusconi's place of President, until fresh elections can be held later in the year. Despite the party loosing huge support, Toti has remained honest and transparent, with no alligations against him personally.

Despite this, the Forza Italia is predicted to lose its position of power within the Government, with plans for a Snap Election later in 2024, early 2025. 

--------------------------------

####Aftermath

With the Government now in chaos with a number of resignations, including the President, snap election for all the Government positions, Chamber of Deputies	and the Senate will occuring in late 2024, early 2025. Until then, the Forza Italia government must continue moving on with their government, now lost most of it main support.

----------------------------

[M] Yay, my first post done as Italy! 

#####Viva la rivoluzione!! 

*I just wanted to add a thank you to everyone who congratulated me on winning the roll, I didn't expect wining the roll at all! XD*

Last thing, I'll do my best trying to run Italy, with a new Government and a fresh face to Italy on the world Stage. *I'll also going to start considering recruiting a 2iC*, especially when I head back to Uni (College) in the next couple of weeks. **Until then, I'll try and make Italy as great as it can be!**

Lets the fun begin.

You've got to help me relieve the pressure before they burst!,cumfort_enthusiast,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4e1ty6/23_m4f_please_youve_got_to_help_me_relieve_the/,"*No matter when you are finding this, if it is still up, I am still interested!*

I'm a college student who is on the brink of entering the professional working world. To just about everyone in my life, I am a pretty unassuming guy. I keep a steady job, I earn good grades, but I don't really seem to keep any feminine company. You see, I suffer from an extremely rare and somewhat embarrassing medical condition. 

Ever since I hit puberty, I produce cum at an unprecedented rate to the point that my balls become absurdly swollen and painful if I do not ejaculate at regular intervals throughout the day. How swollen you ask? Let's just say that on one occasion I was prescribed a sleep aid during one of my busier exam times that resulted in me sleeping for 12 straight hours, during which time I would have normally cum at *least* three times. When I woke up, they were the size of grapefruits, but despite the insane feeling of pressure and discomfort, the sensation wasn't entirely unenjoyable. 

Alas, this condition can make living a normal life difficult, but for the most part I hide it well by relieving the pressure during regular bathroom breaks. Anyone who knows me but doesn't know about my unique problem usually assumes that I just have some sort of intestinal disorder or something. My only real problem comes from trying to maintain a healthy dating life. The few girlfriends I've had tend to get freaked out when they find out about my situation and end up leaving, which usually results in me spending most weekends alone. That is, until you come along.

Perhaps you are another student in one of my classes, maybe you are a colleague at my internship, or maybe you're just someone I always seem to interact with during the day. Through some odd string of events, you and I end up trapped together for an extended period of time. Maybe it's a traffic jam, maybe an elevator breaks down, maybe we are in quarantine after a bio-hazard spill of some sort; regardless, the situation is such that we are trapped in close quarters, and eventually, despite my best efforts to hide my problem, I break down and have to explain everything to you, right before I release my load in front of you. 

Now as unassuming as I am despite my problem, you too are hiding a secret. You are absolutely OBSESSED with cum! You love the taste of it, the smell of it, the feeling of it all over you and inside of you. Despite your rather reserved and quiet personality, the sight of my overly swollen balls accompanied by the spectacle of an absolute river of hot, thick cum flowing from my cock drives you wild. 

Before this incident, you had always thought I was kind of cute, but had never really planned on me making a move, or on you making one yourself, but after what you've seen, you decide that you *have* to make me your's. Over time, we actually begin to get pretty serious, and you couldn't be happier with both our regular relationship, but especially our time spent beneath the sheets. With me to ""fuel"" your obsession, you constantly ask me if I need release, and are more than happy to use your lips for a bit more than kisses. Everything is going well, except for one little secret that you hide.

You have always wondered how big I could truly get. When I once told you about my grapefruit-sized balls after too long without release, you practically creamed on the spot. Despite your repeated requests to see it for yourself, I politely refuse, and explain to you that the sensation can be very painful. You always tell me that it's fine and that you understand, and to a degree that's true, but deep down you are always terribly disappointed. Then one night, you get an idea: what if you were to remove choice from the equation? 

You propose a little experimentation with domination with me being the submissive one. Always eager to spice up our love life and to please you, I agree enthusiastically. Once you have each of my limbs attached to the four posts of our bed, you smile wide and explain your true plan. I am now completely at your mercy, and until such a time as you decide to give me release, my balls are going to swell and fill with cum. Knowing that arousal only exacerbates my condition, you spend hours teasing me and turning me on until my balls are absolutely filled to the brim with cum, throbbing and aching for release. After a while, you begin to enjoy your role as a dom, and begin teasing me about my size, calling me things like your little ""cum balloon"". How big will they get? Only time will tell...

Obviously, I would love for this to be a non-con scenario in which you let my balls swell no matter how much I beg for relief. Ideally, I would like to begin this RP from the point where we are first trapped together, the circumstances of which I will leave up to you. I'd imagine this will be *relatively* long-term. My turn-ons include nipple sucking (me sucking your's), puffy nipples, pussy and penis pumps, cock rings, name-calling, and some pain. My limits include scat/ watersports, blood/ gore, futa, and furries. Hope to hear from you!"

I will apologize if I have any typos as I am typing this on my phone on the go and I will try to make this short.

I am currently on my last year of college. I am graduating with an Applied Math Major and minor in Computer science. I was planning on going into engineering. However my current GPA is not where I want it to be, which is 2.7. This is not like me at all, and was depressed and had problems that affected me in college. I know I am very capable of doing better and have been the best semester or two. 

The thing I am worried about is that, im just ""screwed"". I won't be able to get into graduate programs or finish a degree in engineering like I wanted to do with such a low GPA. I really wish I took a semester off early to rethink things, but my family pushed me to stay in college but I do not want to blame this on them. I also still have to do an internship and have a summer and fall semester left to do so. 

I am feeling like ""this is it"" and ""this is the end"" and won't make it in life. It is in the back of my head everyday and affects my mood knowing this. I know it really isn't the end of the world but it is just upsetting that I KNOW I could have done better but I messed up. 

I would like the honest truth and any advice would be appreciated."
4e1zdq,4,2016-04-09,Formal education or learn on my own and how to pay the bills during the process,Ibeenlurkin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e1zdq/formal_education_or_learn_on_my_own_and_how_to/,"Background:
I am 25 years old. I graduated from a respectable state school with a B.S. in Psychology, certificate in Neuroscience, and a minor in Biology just about 2 years ago.  After graduating, I realized my degree was kind of worthless (ok, I realized before graduating, but I was already too deep in and I loved what I was learning). I moved to Florida, and ended up working as a line cook. I love to cook and enjoyed this, but even getting above standard pay for a line cook, I knew this was not an industry I wanted to stay in. I started applying for different schools and ended up accepting a scholarship at the state school I graduated from for an M.S. Health Informatics program. After 1 semester, I realized I had no idea where I would fit in or find a job. So after 1 semester I switched to an M.S. Data Analytics program. I ran into the same problem, I was learning things that just didn't apply to me because I didn't have the fundamentals of computer science. Yes I am learning a lot, but I constantly look at job descriptions, and didn't feel at all like I was gaining the skills needed to get a job I desired.

tl;dr - I have a b.s. in neuroscience, minor in biology, lots of experience in the restaurant industry, and I am half way to a M.S. in Informatics with a specialization in data analytics.

This semester, I have taken a concepts of programming languages undergraduate course, and have steadily been completing online programming tutorials. I also have an internship creating public health data visualizations for a non-profit (which I love). I have found a huge disconnect between the masters program, and the skills needed in industry. I want to stop the Master's program and focus on learning web development. 

SO..... My question is whether I should go for another B.S. in computer science, or just try to learn on my own for the sake of not building upon my already frightening debt situation, and how to pay the bills during this time (may be a question for another subreddit, I know). I have taken concepts of programming languages, and this summer I am taking server-side programming for the web (I have to be enrolled in 3 credit hours to continue the internship). The internship is paid, but it is pretty much just enough to handle my bills. 

tl;dr - my question boils down to whether I should get a B.S. in computer science or learn informally on my own. Also, is there a good way to earn money and get good experience while doing this? 

I think I want to eventually be in web development. I also really enjoy data visualization, and would love to eventually work in big data analysis. I am pretty familiar with general concepts (control structures, loops, subprograms, data types, parameter passing, databases and such), and I am experienced with Python, Java, a little C++, SQL, and I am now learning HTML and CSS (planning to learn Javascript next). For my internship and through the program I have used Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, KNIME, R, and SPSS. Job descriptions are vague and list a lot of requirements, experience, and degrees that I don't have. 

I will give any more details if necessary. I guess I am just looking for advice on gaining skills and earning money at the same time while I get to where I want to be, and a formal post-graduate education was not cutting it for me. "

To get the crazy prices down, I'm looking for 3-5 open minded fellow interns to live with. Here's my idea: 

1. rent a 3-ish bedroom apartment in SoMa, Mission, or Castro.

2. have one bedroom with bunk beds. This is where we sleep. 

3. have other bedrooms with full/queen size beds. These are the flex-bedrooms that we reserve when we want our own room.

4. profit! (none of us expected *that* from this summer)

The idea is that we regularly sleep in the bunks, but schedule ourselves into the flex bedrooms for nights when we want privacy, are sick, have an overnight guest or whatever. You could also schedule the room for friends visiting. We'd have a certain number of days per week or month when we could reserve the room, first come first serve, to keep it fair. 

Examples of different arrangements based on #roommates (RM) and #bedrooms (BR):

- 4 RM / 2 BR = 1 bunk room + 1 flex room. 4 RM per bunk and each RM sleeps 25% nights in flex

- 5 RM / 3 BR = 1 bunk room + 2 flex room. 5 RM per bunk and each RM sleeps 40% nights in flex

- 6 RM / 3 BR = 2 bunk room + 2 flex room. 3 RM per bunk and each RM sleeps 33% nights in flex

Does this sound like an arrangement you'd be interested in? I'm looking for fun, tidy people who will be in SF from around mid May to mid August to join me on my unconventional quest for affordable, flexible housing. "

Normally I'm a college student who lives at home with my parents. My only real expenses are my car, some food, and entertainment. I spend pretty freely on food and entertainment because I have no student debt building up, no home-related expenses, and I have a part-time job where I earn about $900 per month.

This summer I'm going to be spending 3 months working full-time and living on my own. My income from the job will only be like $1200/month but I'm going to be covering all my own living expenses with that. It's just a seasonal internship and I'll be moving back home immediately afterwards, but I want to make the most of it by attempting self-sufficiency for a while.

Advice on the switch / negotiation.,stozzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e2kea/considering_a_change_advice_on_the_switch/,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can. I'm 10 months out of college with a BS in CS. I'm currently making 65K as a software engineer in the eCommerce sector of a large agency. My company has tried to pigeonhole me into more of a consulting role since I'm one of the few members of the team who have experience with the ExactTarget platform and one of our clients depends heavily on it. As the only technical resource on the project, I've learned a lot, however, it's not what I want to be doing in the company. I have pushed many times to get put on more projects that require more traditional software engineering and not consulting work, and have only recently been put on projects that will allow me to grow in the direction I want. There are many other reasons I haven't been happy here regarding the culture, management, and overall growth.

During the time that the management had been pushing against my interests, I was looking elsewhere for employment. A previous manager of mine during an internship has recently joined as a partner at a startup company doing similar eCommerce work. One thing led to another and after a couple of interviews I have been offered a position at this company. I've already determined that I want to go to this company. The people there are extremely talented and I know I have the drive / mentality to do well in a startup environment. My internship under the direction of my old manager went very well and I have a good working relationship with him. I see a lot of opportunity to contribute and grow. 

I'd be employee #9 at this small startup. Initial offer of 75K. 0.25% equity in the company. Healthcare and 401K, but no 401K matching. I made the mistake of telling the manager before the interview process that I'd be looking for something in the 80-85K range. My cost of living is quite low, and 65K has been plenty to keep me happy and be able to live my lifestyle. That being said, I do want to be solidly in that 80-85K range. How should I negotiate to get a bit more? It is a startup so I know money is tight, but I do have some experience in the field and do think I'll be a solid contributor. Should I ask for 85K? Or would asking for more equity be the long-term right ask?"

tl;dr of original: Kinda falling for the guy who I wasn't attracted to first, don't like it when he's with other girls, still I want to retain my freedom and he has clearly communicated for me that he won't be ready for another relationship in the coming couple of months. Not sure what to do/if I should do something in the first place.

So I posted the original on Tuesday night, because I was upset. Thanks for the kind responses!

I didn't really expect to update, because my problem wasn't that big, and would blow over. But now, holy shit.

This guy, let's call him Pete, is also close friends with my best friend Eva. I met him through her, and then joined the association they were in as well.

Pete was a bit off this week, ignoring Eva when she texted on Wedsnesday. I was still afraid that I had fucked up big time and didn't text him, afraid that I was annoying. However, yesterday I did sent a message, asking if we could meet up. He answered this morning that he would like to, but that he was in him hometown. Ok, shit happens. I told him I would like to talk to him about what on earth we were doing, no response.

Eva then texted me that Pete would call her, and that apparently it was some big stuff. I immediatly assumed it was the ex. Well, it wasn't. She called me (he asked her to) and dropped a bomb.

Apparently he hadn't passed his final thesis, the one you need to graduate. He had been faking going to his internship and being a student for eight months. Since he wasn't a student, he didn't get any aid from the government (Netherlands) and he didn't get any money from an internship either, since he didn't have one. He hasn't paid rent in months, and is apparently in severe dept.

This last Tuesday his landlord had emailed him, because he was months behind obviously, and since Pete didn't answer, the landlord called his parents. His parents (who also knew nothing about the scheme) then came to the city we study in, got a key from his best friend and dragged him home. They gave up his room, and now he lives back home. He is supposed to see a therapist soon, and obviously needs to figure out his debt and future.

This is no joke, by the way. This last Tuesday he came home, drank half a bottle of whiskey and seriously considered ending himself. He has some mental issues that are at play here. 

I was absolutely FLOORED when I heard all this. Nobody had a clue. I even stayed over at his place once, rolling out of his bed at 8 in the morning because he needed to go to his internship. He also came drinking sometimes still in fancy clothing, because of this internship.

I have sent him a message, basically saying that I'm here for him if he wants me to, but that I would be ok with no contact if he desires so, because I haven't known him for long and that he has other issues he needs to sort out first. No response just yet, but honestly I wouldn't know what to say either if I were him.

That's where it's at right now. I'm still in a wtf-state of mind, and I don't know what's next. The benefits are obviously out of the window, and a relationship isn't even on my mind right now. The main thing is that I would hate to lose his friendship, but if he wants space I will give him that of course. It's also weird because he doesn't even live in the city right now, I don't know if I will see him again, I just don't know.

Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm just so confused right now. Advice is welcome, but I also just very much needed to vent.
   
**tl;dr: Apparently FWB faked his internship after failing his final thesis, no one knew. Because he didn't have any aid he now has major debt and has moved back home (1,5 hours away with public transport). I don't know what's next, I just feel very confused and I'm afraid to lose his friendship.**"
4e2oby,7,2016-04-09,Need help deciding between two colleges,Flagauster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e2oby/need_help_deciding_between_two_colleges/,"I am a senior in high school and will be entering college this fall. I live in New Hampshire and I will be majoring in Computer Science.

I have narrowed down my options to 2 schools: University of Washington and University of New Hampshire.

I am in a big predicament. There are three reasons:

* I absolutely hate being in a small town/rural area like where I live now (small town of 2500). Being near my family kind of sucks, they always are fighting and there is not a lot of love amongst each other, so it's not the best environment to be around. Also, there is no opportunity for me here, and I can't stand how the ""rural/country"" way of life works. I want the city more than anything. I have spent some time in Chicago already so I kind of have a feel for it, and it was great. I definitely want that kind of life. So the difference between Seattle, Washington and Durham, New Hampshire is huge. I feel like just being in Washington will help me land internships and maybe have some opportunity to work at some great companies, or even some huge corps like Microsoft/Google whatever. Obviously my sights are set on Washington for that.

* UNH is basically where all the ""bros"" from my school go. B's and C's students that just kind of chill and go through school like ""whatever man fuck it hahahhahaha amirite"". From my understanding, UW is not like that, especially for Computer Science. I really want to be somewhere where I am surrounded with others that want to learn and excel and just be in that kind of atmosphere, not some place where the kids from my old highschool 20th in their class go to just bro out.

* Money is the most important thing for me. Say what you will about me, it's fine. I understand the dislike for my money mindset... but money is extremely important to me for many reasons. I want to have the opportunity to have a great salary, by whatever means necessary. I know this sub hates the extreme circle jerk around ""big 4 hur dur"", and I do too, but I want to be wherever the money is (where is it?). So yeah, the biggest factor here is that I want to maximize my salary/money making ability and maybe UW will help me get my foot in the door to those opportunities (or will it not??)

So yeah, the final big kick with this is that it will cost me around $30,000 per year to go to UW, and I have a full boat to UNH. My parents will be a helping (roughly $10,000 a year), so UW is really $20,000 and if I go to UNH, they will set the money aside (so $40,000 waiting for me when I get out of UNH debt free, versus $80,000 in debt out of UW. So $120,000 difference...)

I really don't want to stay in NH at UNH with the same old shit i've been living in for the past 18 years... I really wanna leave here and go to the city and start my own life. But I dont know.... this is a fuck ton of money we are talking here... Is it worth it?

I really need help here guys.... the more the better. I just wanna hear it straight. Which school will help me make the most money? Which will offer me the best education/best time? Or does it not matter? Thank you for reading!"
4e2qbe,0,2016-04-09,Formal Computer Science B.S. or learn on my own?,Ibeenlurkin,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4e2qbe/formal_computer_science_bs_or_learn_on_my_own/,"Background: I am 25 years old. I graduated from a respectable state school with a B.S. in Psychology, certificate in Neuroscience, and a minor in Biology just about 2 years ago. I studied hard, had a high GPA, and did extra-curricular activities like being on the Neuroscience club executive board, volunteering, and working (for class credit, not money) as a research assistant in a couple different labs. Also, I worked part time in a restaurant all through school.




 After graduating, I realized my degree was kind of worthless (ok, I realized before graduating, but I was already too deep in and I loved what I was learning). I moved to Florida, and ended up working in a prestigious restaurant as a line cook. I love to cook and enjoyed this, but even getting above standard pay for a line cook, I knew this was not an industry I wanted to stay in.




I started applying for different schools and ended up accepting a scholarship at the state school I graduated from for an M.S. Health Informatics program. After 1 semester, I realized a.) the field of health informatics is kind of messy right now (with obamacare and other government mandates, I.T. has not been as effective as in other areas) and b.) if experts were still sorting things out, I had no idea where I would fit in or find a job. So after 1 semester I switched to an M.S. Data Analytics program. I ran into the same problem, I was learning things that just didn't apply to me because I didn't have the fundamentals of computer science. Yes I am learning a lot, but I constantly look at job descriptions, and didn't feel at all like I was gaining the skills needed to get a job I desired.




tl;dr - I have a b.s. in neuroscience, minor in biology, lots of experience in the restaurant industry, and I am half way to a M.S. in Informatics with a specialization in data analytics.




This semester, I have taken a concepts of programming languages undergraduate course, and have steadily been completing online programming tutorials. I also have an internship creating public health data visualizations for a non-profit (which I love). I have found a huge disconnect between the masters program, and the skills needed in industry. I want to stop the Master's program and focus on learning web development.




SO..... My question is whether I should go for another B.S. in computer science, or just try to learn on my own for the sake of not building upon my already frightening debt situation, and how to pay the bills during this time (may be a question for another subreddit, I know). I have taken concepts of programming languages, and this summer I am taking server-side programming for the web (I have to be enrolled in 3 credit hours to continue the internship). The internship is paid, but it is pretty much just enough to handle my bills. 




tl;dr - my question boils down to whether I should get a B.S. in computer science or learn informally on my own. Also, is there a good way to earn money and get good experience while doing this?




I think want to be in web development. I also really enjoy data visualization, and would love to eventually work in big data analysis. I am pretty familiar with general concepts (control structures, loops, subprograms, data types, parameter passing, databases and such), and I am experienced with Python, Java, a little C++, SQL, and I am now learning HTML and CSS (planning to learn Javascript next). For my internship and through the program I have used Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, KNIME, R, and SPSS. Job descriptions are vague and list a lot of requirements, experience, and degrees that I don't have.




I know my post is kind of vague and long. I will give any more details if necessary. I guess I am just looking for advice on gaining skills and earning money at the same time while I get to where I want to be, and a formal post-graduate education was not cutting it for me."

For the record, I am I am 22 years old, and I am a senior in college.

I checked my credit report for the first time ever earlier this week, and everything was marked as ""ok"". I then checked my score, it said it was 591. I currently have a Chase Freedom card with a $1000 limit through my parents. Our system is I pay my parents for anything I use the card for, and then they pay the bill. I have never missed a payment, and have always paid in full. 

Here's some information to help you get a better idea of my situation:

**My cash:** 

* $1300 in main bank account, $500 in an emergency fund
* Will be making ~$7k/month for summer internship starting in May.

**Student Loan:**

* $7,641.68  @ 4.29% fixed rate through FedLoan (have not made a payment yet).

**Credit Scores:**

* **TransUnion(CreditKarma):** 752 Excellent (I think this is wrong)
* **Equifax(CreditKarma):** 580 Poor
* **TransUnion (Paid for, before I knew about CreditKarma):** 591 Poor

**Credit Report:**

* Everything is listed as ""ok""

**Chase Freedom Card:** (limit: $1000, age: 3y4mo)

###
 | 03/2016
:---|:---:
Balance: | $251
Scheduled Payment: | $10
Amount Paid: | $0
High Balance: | $1467

The high balance on the Chase card came from last summer. I totaled my car, so I had to pay for a lot of large bills quickly. I did pay the full $1467 that month though, so I had no balance to carry over. 

I am planning on getting a new credit card to start building my credit score back up. My top 2 cards are the [Discover It Secured Card](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/secured/) and the [Capital One Secured Card](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/secured-mastercard/).I plan on making a large purchase soon (MacBook), so it would be nice to get some rewards from it, but rewards are really not a priority for me at this point. I just want to start fixing my score.

I also have some questions I was hoping people could answer for me:

1. Let's say I have a secured card and put in $2000. If I use that card to pay for a $1800 purchase, can I ""re-fill"" my card in the same month by adding money to it?

2. What can I do about the Chase Freedom card? It's paid off in full, but I think the high balance is hurting my score. I've read that I shouldn't close out cards, so how can I move past this? Should I just stop using it and ignore it?

3. I now understand I should stay under 30% of my credit limit. Does this still apply if I pay my monthly payments before my billing cycle?

4. I have also read that putting securing payments on the card can help build history. I don't have any recurring payments (No Netflix, etc.). Should I open up a Netflix account to put on my card to start that cycle?

5. Right now, I can pay about $1k towards my students loans. Should I just pay the $1k outright, or should I set it up in payments? Negative is that I accrue interest, but if it improves my score should I just bite the bullet and go for the long haul? I plan on putting additional $1k/month payments towards my loan during my internship.

6. I want a credit card as soon as possible to start the rebuilding process. Do you think I have a better shot at the Discover It Secured, or the Capital One Secured card? I want to minimize my chances of rejection.

**My goal:** I'd like to get my score up to ~650 by next April. With wise decision making, is this realistic, or am I shooting for the moon?

Thanks for reading my post. I'm new to this, and I really want to take the proper steps to fix my credit, so I would appreciate any advice at all.

**TL;DR:** I'm looking for some advice on building/fixing my credit score.

**Career**

I'm 26 years old and currently in my final year of studies in SIM. As my exams draw closer in May, I've begun submitting my resumes to various companies in the accounting industry. 

For the past few weeks, I've attended 3 interviews thus far. And I feel that it went really well but all of them told me that my graduation date of August is far too long for them to take me in right now. To be honest, I can commence work at the start of June as that's when my exams are done. However, I am concerned that many other companies have not been replying despite tailoring my CV specifically for each position.

I've had to work multiple jobs to supplement my income and school expenses over these 3 years; my family isn't well to do. As a result, my grades are not that stellar, I foresee myself graduating with a second lower class honours. But I do have a total of 2 years internship experience (while I was schooling) with two companies in the accounting role.

My aim is to work in the audit / tax sector. But lately, I'm getting uncomfortable with the idea of waiting for something to happen, hence I've also applied for the positions of senior officers in the home team academy. To be honest, if it ever comes to a situation where I have to choose between a career in audit / tax or a  career in the uniformed services, I have no inclination over one or the other.

Do I just keep doing what I'm doing with the resume blasting? Because currently I'm already at the second stage of the interview of one of the uniformed services in HTA.

**Relationship**

For the past 4 months, I've been going out with this lovely girl that I've met through a mutual friend. She's much better than me academically but I've never seen that as an issue. I really do like her but I've yet to tell her that. I'm not much of an expressive person when it comes to matters of the heart but instead I just show it through actions.

To add on to that, she tells me that her friends wants to meet me, which I guess is a positive indicator? My friends are elated that I'm seeing someone, and they too wanna meet her.

She's been taking it positively and I feel that I should tell her that verbally, according to friends of mine. When I do, how do I go about doing that? I've only had one long-term serious girlfriend when I was 22 that lasted for 3 years, until she cheated on me. So for the 3 years after the breakup, I've never made relationship a priority in my life.

Also, she's in the same situation as me in terms of job search. However, she's in a much better position with her higher qualifications. And I don't know why I beat myself about not being able to make enough or even on par with her. Am I being a [MCP](http://womenshistory.about.com/cs/60s70s/g/gl_mcp.htm)? Please be honest or slap some sense into me.

This overthinking has really taken a toll on my confidence and whether I really do deserve her.

I'd like to thank you if you made it through this wall of text. And may you have a great weekend.

Thank you.

She's interested in CS as a major/career, and has registered for a Visual Basic programming class next semester.  Her high school also has three CS classes (all Java) with the last one being AP CS, which I'd imagine she'll eventually take.   I was wondering what productive ""things"" she can do during summer breaks, but also potentially during the school year as well.  I'm thinking summer programs or (optimistically) internships.

I thought of three optional (but preferred in my mind) criteria.  Feel free to say whether any of them are unreasonable:

* Requires physical attendance.  My sister's first brush with coding was a Codecademy Python tutorial a few months ago.  However, she never completed it because she got ""busy"".  Self-learning/building websites is a simple option, but I'm not confident that high schoolers have the best diligence.
* Hosted by well-known companies/organizations/universities.  I feel that their programs would be better structured.  Participants will also get some familiarity with these types of companies (Big 4, startups, etc.) and universities.  Google has their [summer camp](https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/computer-science-summer-institute-cssi/) but its for graduating high school seniors, which doesn't satisfy the next criteria.
* Can help with college applications.  This basically means that the ""thing"" must have started by application period, which is around the beginning of senior year.

That's all the criteria I can think of.  What would you guys suggest?  Hopefully this thread can be a useful resource for aspiring computer scientists in high school."

The drive was ordinary and my morning was non-eventful.  Needless to say, I was excited as I sat down for my lunch break.  I walked into the break room and saw Angela, a cute college intern who hopped on last week.  She was clearly too young for me, but it never hurt to smile at her.

""Oh, what's that?""  She eyed the can in my hand.  

""Some ice tea,"" I shrugged my shoulders as I tossed her the can, ""You can try some.""

""Thanks, I forgot my water at home,"" she opened the can and took a big gulp, ""I just-""

She froze as the can dropped.  Magically, nothing seemed to spill.  I picked it off the floor and weighed it in my hand.  It was full.  *Maybe it's unending.*

""What the fuck is that?""

""Huh?""  I found Angela breathing heavily towards me, ""Angela, are you?""

""That tea... I can't explain it,"" her voice grew tense, ""It's just... it's just so...""

She pulled out her cellphone.  

""Who are you calling?"" 

""Mr. Brian,"" she smiled, ""He needs to come down and try this out right now.""

*Wait, Mr. Brian?  How does she have the boss's numb... holy shit, she's sleeping with him.*

It wasn't long before the news of my tea swarmed through the company as people were lined outside the break room, their empty mugs eagerly anticipating it.  Nobody seemed to notice or care that a small can was endlessly filled with tea as one by one, I saw my fellow coworkers take a drink.

""HOLY SHIT.""

""WHAT THE FUCK.""

""THIS IS A DRINK OF THE GODS.""

""Andrew, you need to tell us how to made it,"" Mr. Brian looked at me, ""I'll give you anything you want.  You can have my money, my car, any-""

*There's no way I can drink this.  I'll lose my mind.*

""No thanks, boss,"" I was beginning to feel frightened but saw the potential, ""Boss, do you mind if I take the rest of the day off?""

Mr. Brian nodded as he looked eagerly at me.  ""See you at work tomorrow?""  He seemed hopeful.

""Not likely.""  I muttered as I walked out of the room.

The next day, I quietly set a small stand on one of the downtown street corners as I lay out several cups of the tea.  ""Get your ice tea!"" I shouted, ""50 cent a cup.   The best iced tea in the world!"" 

Nobody paid me any attention.

""The best tea, or your money back!""

That was enough to attract a couple of people at a time as one by one, they took a sip from the cups I provided.  And as expected, their eyes lit with ecstasy.  Over the next few minutes, people continued to line up for the iced tea that God had given me.  Rumors and whispers spread.  A line had formed around the corner after an hour.  It wasn't long before I attracted the attention of a news crew.

""We're channel 7,"" I recognized the anchor from the night crew, ""What makes this tea so good?""

I grinned and handed her a cup.  ""Why don't you find out?""

________________________________________________________________________________

That was over two years ago.  I sat down on my balcony overlooking at the coast.  The news of my iced tea had spread from a crazy live news report claiming that ""If you don't have this tea right now, you will regret it"".  Within that week, I was invited to talk shows all over the country, offering my iced tea to everyone who wanted it.  It wasn't long before powerful people drank my tea and bowed down to anything I wanted.  There was a rumor going around that the President had drank my tea, but I got lost somewhere along the line of whispers.

Now, I had unlimited wealth and all the power in the world I could ever want.  I had meaningless sex every night with a different woman, and I had every luxury car I dreamed of owning.  I traveled the world and I was able to buy anything I wanted.  Or rather, people gave it to me for free after having some of my tea.  

But I was unhappy, for I had followed my one cardinal rule and had never drank from the can.

I looked at it as it sat on my coffee table, the cool wind breezing past my hair as the smell of the ocean permeated all of my sense.

*How does it taste?*

*It is lemon?*

*I wonder if it's sweetened.*

Every question barraged me for every single waking minute for the last two years.  Last I heard, Angela had gotten pregnant from Mr. Brian and the company immediately offered me the position of CEO earlier that day.  But I didn't need any of that.  

I stared at the can as the voices continued to swirl around my head.

""I can't do this anymore.""

I grabbed the can and approached the ledge of my balcony, the waves crashing against the rocks below.

*You did this, God.*

I closed my eyes as I leaned forward, letting the gravity take me.  As I fell I opened my eyes one last time.  The can in my hand was still full after all this time as I took one last look at the label again.

""Real Brewed Heaven tea,"" I muttered as I fell closer to water's surface, ""Southern Style.""

*Southern Style?*

Oh, it all makes sense now.  

I felt a sudden blackness take me as I crashed into the ocean.

*The tea was from hell, huh?*

4e3dta,7,2016-04-09,College student (19). I want to pursue a copywriting career. What should I be doing right now?,Lsdsoundsystm,copywriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/copywriting/comments/4e3dta/college_student_19_i_want_to_pursue_a_copywriting/,"Greetings, all.

I am an first-year college student studying English. 

My first two terms in university made me realize that I want to work in a creative field and utilize my writing ability. My professors say I am a talented writer. 

I have a passion for it, but I was originally planning to pursue teaching, because a career in writing seemed far-fetched to me. 

But my confidence has grown through practice, hard work, and constructive support from my professors. 

A copywriting career is what I want now. I don't have any background in marketing, but I have researched the job and strongly believe it's a good fit. I would like to start at a small firm or startup, maybe do some freelancing, and eventually move up into an ad agency.

I am planning to take more marketing classes and find internships while still in school. I want to network as much as possible and get my foot in the door before graduating.

What else should I be doing right now to:

A) Learn more about a copywriting career
B) Put myself in a position to find a job after graduation?

Thank you!

I found a great place in VA, but like so many other apartment complexes in the area - subleases and assignments are not permitted by the original lease agreement. The apartment management and the current tenant suggest that I be added to the lease instead - I will be added to the lease in May and the lease will end in August. I'll be paying the rent for that period. 

He will vacate for the summer months and will apparently be out of the country. He will return at the end of the lease period. He has already payed the deposit on the apartment.

I am also concerned about the current tenant's request for a furniture deposit. He asked for a deposit to cover potential furniture damage which will be returned at the end of the lease period. 

**I have several questions**:

1. Can I be liable for damage to the apartment that occurred before I was added to the lease?
2. Will a separate agreement between myself and the current tenant, in which he agrees to vacate for 3 months will I pay rent, be enforceable? Would there be anything stopping him from simply moving back in? Would that be unenforceable as basically being an assignment?
3. Can I terminate the lease agreement if he does attempt to move back in? 
4. If he does not return, or keeps my furniture deposit, would I be entitled to deduct my losses from the original deposit on the apartment?

Thank you very much! I would prefer to take this apartment, but I will not if it is unsafe. I'm looking for someone familiar with LL/Tenant law to suggest a course of action."

$1000 CAD (Canadian)

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 I can overlook if some of the following are missing: 6+ hours of battery life, a GPU as strong as a AMD 7850 (probably being delusional, but it's a 3-4 generation old GPU, so I'm sure there's mobile chips that are just as strong as that desktop chip), sturdy case (I won't be hiking up the matterhorn anytime soon, but I would like it so at most, it dents after being dropped 3-4 feet onto wood) 

* **How important is weight to you?**
 Like I said, I won't be hiking with it on my back. That being said, the lighter the better, but I'd rather have weight rather than bad performance. I am a stickler for the height of the laptop when the case is closed, so anything under 3.5 cm would be appreciated)

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 Doesn't matter, I'll just buy windows if I have to

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 1600x900 and above is great

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
If it can run league of legends at high settings, have 20 tabs of chrome open, and have photoshop just running in the background, I'd be insanely happy! If it can record, even better! Otherwise, my most used softwares are League of Legends, Skype (in conjunction with the former), Photoshop, Chrome (I use a lot of tabs), and rain meter

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
League of Legends at high settings. I'd like to play games like Far Cry 4 at medium settings, but I don't care too much about heavy gaming. After all, after I do my summer internships, I'll be relatively loaded for a desktop!

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I'd like a decent keyboard. I don't care much about the trackpad since I'll be using a mouse, not to mention I do most of my navigations through the keyboard anyways. I do need a decent webcam though (Idk what's considered good, but I'd like a decent picture resolution so that you can tell I have nostrils at least)

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I live in Canada. I am not open to purchasing a refurb laptop, and I'm willing to use just about any trustworthy site (Amazon, Newegg, Ebay trusted-seller, Tiger Direct, i.e.). Also, I don't trust Lenovo after they pulled two shenanigans in 3 years, so I'd really prefer not to go with them!

If I'm not angry already at the moment, I don't react, I just ignore it and write him off as just another idiot, as it doesn't affect me internally at that time. But over time, later on it starts to piss me off and I wish I was that angry at that moment so that I'd do something about it and wouldn't act in a way that might me look like as a doormat.

4e46n4,3,2016-04-09,How to improve my chances for top tier colleges as a high school sophomore?,worldsocold34,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/4e46n4/how_to_improve_my_chances_for_top_tier_colleges/,"Hey guys!

I'm a current sophomore in high school (class of 2018) and I'd like some advice from those of you who've gone through this process before on how to increase my chances to get into top schools.

My dream school is MIT. I'm also especially interested in Carnegie Mellon and Caltech.

I apologize in advance if I sound arrogant at any point below. If so, that is not my intention.

I rambled on a lot so thanks in advance!

**Demographics:** Female, Asian (Chinese), living in Maryland since I was 5 but born in China. I go to a pretty competitive public school (ranked in the top 300 by US News for what it’s worth) with 30% Asians. Last year 13 people got into Ivies (4 through UPenn ED alone), one Asian girl got into MIT, one Stanford, a few at JHU. This year, I think 3 people got into Stanford but two of them were URM, another Asian girl got into MIT (maybe a pattern? :) ), and a handful into Ivies.

**Possible Major:** Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering

**Academics:**

* SAT: 2330 (December 2015: CR 760, M 800, W 770). Should I take the new one?
* ACT: planning on taking this junior year, since some colleges I want to apply to don't accept it for my year.
* PSAT: 1470/1520 (CR 720, M 750) didn't study, since it doesn't matter this year
* SAT Subject Tests: Math 2 800, not sure what to take for my science (was planning on physics but I have found out that I am incredibly bad at physics), humanities?
* GPA: 4.00 UW, by the end of my junior year if all goes well I should have a 4.84 weighted. APs and GTs count as 5, Honors 4.5, Regular 4.
* Class Rank: not given until senior year, but I know for sure that I am in the top 10 out of about 350.

**Coursework:**

* Summer school: Health and Lifetime Fitness, counts as 4.0 in GPA
* 9th: English 9 GT, Precalculus GT, Biology GT, US History GT, Computer Science I Honors, Spanish II Honors, Art I
* 10th: AP Calculus AB, AP Computer Science AB, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP US Gov and Politics, English 10 GT, Chemistry GT, Spanish III Honors, also self-studying for the AP Chinese test
* 11th (projected): AP Calculus BC, AP Microeconomics/Macroeconomics (taking both AP tests), AP Biology, AP World History, AP English Language, Advanced Data Structures GT (CS IV), Intern/Mentor GT (elaboration below)
* 12th (projected): AP Physics C: E&amp;M, AP Statistics, AP Psychology, AP English Literature, Differential Equations GT, Advanced Object-Oriented Design GT (CS IV part 2), Student aide (probably for computer science or math)

TL;DR: 13 AP classes, 15 AP tests.

Additional Details:
I have one of the most rigorous schedules of my grade. Five other kids are taking AP Calc with me this year, three other kids are taking AP CS, and I am the only sophomore in Mechanics.

My school uses GT classes to give students a solid foundation in the AP version of the class. The weight is also used to mark classes which don't have an AP equivalent as challenging.

Intern/Mentor GT is a special research-based class that my school offers, where students are paired up with mentors (university professors, company employees, etc.) and work at their mentors' workplace for at least 5 hours a week. They must come up with a research paper topic (or do what their mentor tells them to do, especially if in a STEM field and the mentor is currently working on a project) and write a paper on their findings. Popular places of internship for computer science/engineering are JHU APL and NASA Goddard, both of which I am ineligible for because I don't have US citizenship :( but I will probably end up at University of Maryland College Park. I was also considering JHU’s downtown campus but the commute is an hour and it doesn’t seem to be worth it.

At my school, our AP Calc BC and DiffEq teacher is a former professor from MIT :) (known for his involvement with a particular card game back in the 70s) and I hope to get his letter of recommendation.

**Extracurriculars:**

* FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) (9th - present), treasurer this year, hopeful Captain for the next two years
* Programming Club (9th - present), vice pres this year, will be President for next two years
* FBLA (10th - present), my first year, Desktop Application Programming. States is coming up next weekend and not many people do this event so I'm feeling hopeful for making nationals, probably will not try for an officer position, and may drop next year because the timeline overlaps with robotics too much
* Maryland Technology Honor Society (10th - present)
* Math Tutoring (10th - present), at nearby middle school once a week
* Piano (8 years, plan on sticking with it for the rest of high school), testing for my Advanced Certificate in a month, Senior Theory Award
* Karate (4 years) first brown, don’t think I’ll be able to earn my black belt before senior year
* I plan on applying for NHS when I’m a junior.

**Summer:**

* before 9th: took Summer School to get Health &amp; Phys Ed requirement out of the way
* after 9th: CTY Investigations in Engineering at JHU, SAT camp LOL not going to mention this one
* after 10th: Terp Young Scholars at College Park (3 credit tech class), might intern at UMD/JHU to get Intern/Mentor hours early so I’m not panicking and scrambling for hours come robotics build season. What else isn’t too late to apply for at this point? I don’t want to sign up for an expensive pre college program at a prestigious college, because it just sounds like a waste of money. Do they actually help in admissions?
* after 11th: planning on applying to RSI and all of the summer programs at MIT. Any suggestions for other selective programs?

Also, an issue somewhat unrelated to school:
In elementary school and middle school I loved creative writing, and I would spend hours a day roleplaying on forums, even starting a bunch of my own. In 8th grade however, as my attention shifted to programming and technology, I slowly lost that passion, and now I can’t bring myself to write creatively anymore, unless it's for a school assignment. One, I’m constantly stressed and I never seem to have enough time for anything because I have a huge problem with procrastination (hence, my addiction to this website). Two, I’m terrified. I guess I can’t think as romantically as I used to anymore, and now whenever I write like two sentences, I criticize the hell out of it and quickly become discouraged because it sucks so much. Either that or I find it too cheesy and I cringe so much I have to delete it. My writing is still fantastic -- for essays and literary analyses; I’m also great at addressing abstract ideas and explaining them in vague and profound ways (read: bullshitting). When I try, I’m one of the best, if not the best writer in my grade, verified constantly by every English teacher I’ve encountered. But when it comes to generating and implementing my own ideas as stories in creative writing, I just can’t anymore.
I really want to find pleasure in writing again, but I also don’t know how to make myself start writing again. I’m afraid to start again, and it’s going to take time and effort that I can’t spare right now.
Any thoughts?

I think my main problem right now is that I have no hooks or awards.

If I manage to get something cool done through Intern Mentor, I may participate in Siemens or Intel.

As of now, I plan on applying to:

EA: MIT, Caltech, UChicago, College Park (safety: 140 kids from my school were accepted last year)

Reg: CMU (CS 1st choice, Eng 2nd), UPenn, UC schools, JHU, Cornell, HYPS just for the hell of it if I find the time

Suggestions (for extracurriculars or for college choices)? The more thorough, the better! Thank you so much for reading all of that, by the way! I really appreciate it! :)

4e4b6c,1,2016-04-09,Need some advice.,Insanejub,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4e4b6c/need_some_advice/,"So i knew of the red pill a few years back and didn't think much of it but gave it shot while in college and was getting seeing a lot of women, having a good time, and non thinking about being in a serious relationship.  Went a girl during the end of my junior year, and it was casual.  She started to get more serious thatn I was and I sort of pulled back.  She wanted it more than I did, and so she started pursuing me more and more, and it started to seem like clingy behavior.  She eventually 'gave up' and that made me want to be with her but I felt as if I messed up in some sort of way, letting my emotions get the better of me.  She got back her ex and then started to move on with life but was still a bit hung up on her. 


Fast forward to the end of my senior year.  I was still hung up on previous girl and getting sex where I could to get her off my mind. Met this girl who was a soophemore, thought she was hot and started pursuing her (while also pursuing two other girls). At first, it was casual and then slowly became more and more serious. 

Been dating this girl for about 10-11 months now.  When we first started seeing each other, I was only really in it because 1) she was very attractive and I wanted the sex and 2) I was getting over an ex.  During the first few months (summer) I was non-schelaunt in our interactions, mentally and physically and didn't think too much about actually being in a relationship with her.  At this point, she pursued me more because I wasn't super into, just like the previous girl, and things were going great.  Lots of sex and all of it was casual and fun. As time went on though, I feel as if I started losing control / dominance over the relationship.  Things also started become more and more serious. I have met her parents, brother, and extended family;  gone on their family vacations with them multiple times; etc. 


At the same time, school started back up for her and i started working.  I was still wanting to have sex and what not on the weekends or after work which went on for a while but school, her family, and hobbies all gradually and progressively seemed to seem like more of a priority, once again, understable.  


To this though, I tried to hang out with her more and more and do more things for her.  Retrospectively, I was becoming more and more clingy.  I had / have feelings for this girl unlike others in the past and have been thinking that she may 'be the one' because to me she seemed sexy, smart, motivated, and not that crazy.  The feelings were mutual until she started pulling away when I wanted to do more stuff with her. 


Fast forward to the present, we have been talking about maybe breaking things off.  Not that I would like to but because she feels like I have been asking too much of her and I feel like I have been too much for her and that we have not been having sex as much as we use to. 

Last week we went on a break to think things over for a few days independently (no communication between other) and she ended up texting and wanted to meet (2 days before we were suppose to talk) and said ""sorry I have been acting all crazy. (she gets really stressed out by school and a lot of times school gets stressful its associated with our relationship) I dont know what came over me.  I want to stay together but some things need to change.""  To which I agreed, and I explained how we both need to be more independent, more me than her though.  So I have since been much more hands off, so to speak, and make sure she is the one to text me first and what not. 


Meet up with her today to help her review a paper she wrote for class and afterwards we got into a discussion and she started crying a bunch on how she doesn't know if she wants to be in a relationship and has from the start (once again this is the craziest week of school she has had yet).  I stated that if she happy with me, I don't want to be in a relationship.  Moreover, that i am unsatisfied sexually and that I have was being clingy and I going to start focusing more on myself.   

She will be leaving for an internship in about 5 weeks and will be gone for 10 weeks.  We decided that we will decide to break up (she said just be friends, to which I said I probably can't do) the week before she goes.  If things get better then we will stay together, but I explained to her that a lot of times when she gets all stressed out and I ask anything of her (to hang out or whatever) then I come off as being clingy and that everytime she is really stressed with school she starts second guessing being in a relationship in general. 

Right now, I am trying to be pretty hands off and am not texting her unless she texts or calls me.  Might send her a snapchat or whatever if I am doing something fun with friends but that is the most of it.  Once school ends she will def have more freetime, and everything is well and good during those times.

Anyways, sorry for the long post but I was wondering what you guys think is the next step here?

Should we go on a break while she is gone and maybe try seeing other women but keep in contact with her?

Break up with her and try moving on?

Give it time, leave her alone, and she if she comes back?

Thanks guys

I have an internship in Los Altos from May 30 to August 16th. I'd like to get there a few days early and stay a few days after, so I can be flexible on the start and end dates if you need to get there a little earlier and or stay a little later. 

I'd like to be within an hour commute, either by bike (preferred) or by the transit to Los Altos. 

This means that I would like to be within [these highlighted areas.](http://i.imgur.com/ktFNARm.png) (basically, if it's within 1hr bike ride to the work icon on the image, I am interested)

Private rooms range from about $1500-2500 (and up), and I would really prefer to get an entire unit if it made things cheaper for all involved. I'm willing to spend up to $2,600 per month for my room if it is worth it, but I would prefer to spend closer to $2,000. I'm not really sure if it would be better to just do an AirBnB or a sublet.

For the past five/six years of college, I lived on-campus, so I guess you can say that I got a little used to living ""on my own"" and being able to manage myself -- going/hanging out, getting things done, etc.  But since the last year of school is very internship based, I decided to move back home and commute.

But sometimes, I feel like I should have just stayed on campus.

Living at home while I was younger, as the oldest sibling, it was hard to convince my parents to let me do anything.  Sleepovers? Forget it. Going out with friends? I had to strategically ask my parents at the right time, and even then it was a 40% success rate whereby something like ""you have to [insert tedious chore] before you go.""  Most of the time, it was ""well, you can't -- you have to watch your siblings [read: free babysitter]."" 

You'd think that as time went on, your parents would get a bit more lenient, because, you know, you're an ""adult"" and all.

But when I first moved at home, I was working without pay for ~40 hours/week.  When the first weekend came, and some of my friends from school who were also in the area wanted to go out, I decided to join them, and stay a bit at their place so I didn't have to drive late at night.  But that resulted in x amount of missed calls from my parents at ~9pm asking me where I was.  

In addition, my parents would tell me to go and pick up my siblings at x or tell me day of that they need to be at an appointment at x time, or that I needed to go to y to do something for them at z time.  This would really hinder me from doing anything, as if I decided to do something, more likely than not I had to drop whatever that was in order to try to help them out.  

Anyways, overtime, I just decided to avoid coming home late at night.  I am also in a long term (2.5 years) relationship [29 M] so staying over a boyfriend's house was just simply out of the question.  Go out for a bit, commute back by 12 pm.  It wasn't the best feeling, where you still had a curfew and had to leave while your friends laughed the night away.  

After the year progressed, I guess you can say that I have been steadily pushing my curfew later, to points that I would come home ~3pm.  Most of the time it was because I fell asleep at my boyfriend's house.  I also used to call home as I was beginning to return home, but that resulted in my parents just yelling at me as to why I wasn't home yet at 11pm, so I stopped doing that.  

Anyways, one day, I just had a breaking point.  Not only was I not able to hang out properly with friends/boyfriend, but my schedule was being thrown out of whack with all of the demands my family kept putting on me.  ""Please buy x,"" or ""Go and do y before z time,"" or ""do not do a before doing b."" It was starting to cut into a lot -- I would always arrive late to something or had to work something out because of the things I needed to do beforehand.  

It was also starting to affect me emotionally, and I think physically, as I was uncontrollably angry/irritable a great deal of the time, and even started twitching.

So, I decided to just do whatever I want.  Really.

Instead of waking up from my nap at my boyfriend's house, I just stayed the night and went back early in the morning. Same thing with hanging out with my friends.  If my parents had a request, I simply told them I could not do it, and told them to give me a heads up beforehand (as I had told them many times before). 

This was met with opposition.  My father, in response to me staying at my boyfriend's house, mentioned to me that if I continued to act like this, just disobeying my parents, my boyfriend will lose respect for me and will no longer love me (although I know this is not true -- he would rather me stay at his house than drive tired any day).  It was extremely un-religious like for someone like me to do this, and that I should be ashamed of my actions.  Wayward.

They also mentioned that this is an awful example to show my younger siblings, so that they don't follow this path of waywardness (even though I strongly feel that they will be doing this once they turn 18, nonetheless 23).

But, really, I feel that I have become significantly happier (outside of my parents' remarks) since I've started doing me.  I've stopped twitching, and even sometimes have the desire to go/call home after spending the weekend at my boyfriend's/friend's house.  

I gave my mom a call today, and asked her how she was doing.  Then, she was like, ""Who do you think you are? You've been out for a long time, and you keep doing this.  You're completely irresponsible, completely wayward, and this isn't something to be proud of."" And then, she hung up on me. 

For some reason, I didn't go through the whole calling back, ""wait what do you mean,"" that I used to go through with my parents back when they called me for being out at 9 pm.  I just shrugged my shoulders and lay in my boyfriend's bed, typing this up because, I'm not sure how I should be feeling.

How should I be feeling?  Should I feel like a complete POS for acting this way towards my parents?  I have literally done almost everything they have asked me to, but I feel that I've reached my limit, and backed out.  Every time I try to talk to my parents about this, it usually ends in the ""we don't care, as long as you live here, you do as we say and that's it,"" ""you're wayward, and irresponsible,"" or ""we really don't want to listen to you."" And somehow me crying.  

This might just be me venting, but is there any way that I can get my parents to let loose a little (for lack of a better phrase)?  Am I really wayward and reckless?  Or is it that I should be able to do these kind of things since I'm old enough?

Some other information that may be helpful -- I live at home but I fully financially support myself; not enough to buy rent, but enough that I buy my own food, do my own laundry, etc.  I have five younger siblings that I basically care for.  And when I say going out, it mostly consists of either hanging out with friends, a movie, or maybe the occasional bar.  I do not do drugs outside of alcohol.


   
**TL;DR**: Parents think that me (23 F) is too wayward for staying at a friend's house late/overnight, and after a while of trying to comply, I just started doing it anyway.  Am I wrong?"

Sorry guys, this is a long one. Thanks in advance if you choose to read all of it. All comments and thoughts are welcome and appreciated.


Here I am again, at the bottom of this well. Yes, I’ve relapsed again. I always manage to convince myself that another one won’t come, because it feels so impossible during a high, and I always forget the crushing disappointment. Now that I’m here, I can’t think of the happiness coming back. I never learn. 


I’m a college student, just finishing planning a study abroad in Costa Rica, a dream come true for an nature-lover like me. That was enough to sustain me for a while. I took on two jobs along with classes, one at a call center, and one in an academic department, and at first they seemed okay. What started to bother me was the idea that people didn’t respect me. In the beginning, I thought I was humble enough to handle making coffee and stapling papers for $8.50 an hour, and doing dozens of calls while my coworkers do nothing but fuck around. I can’t remember exactly what set me off. It might have been this one day when I came into my office job, ran into two professors, and of course like any normal, polite person, said good morning. One mumbled a response, and the other ignored me entirely. It wasn’t just this either. They continually ignore my very existence while being perfectly friendly with the other office worker, who’s more of a professional and has been there longer. It boils my fucking blood. And I’m not normally an angry person–it takes a lot to make me truly mad, even more so to start a confrontation. Normally my depression just makes me hollow and indifferent, but this time around, it seems to have filled me with utter rage and fury. I get paid 25 cents above minimum wage to work this shit job, and haven’t gotten a raise despite being promised one when I accepted the job, and having done a lot of extra work like cleaning and organizing their dump of an office. That’s not nearly enough to be fucking disrespected on top of that. The head of the department, my boss, and the other worker are really the only ones who actually acknowledge my existence. Whenever anyone else comes through the office, they act as if I’m not there. And even if they are polite to me, if they really respected me, they would compensate me for the work I’ve done. I haven’t gotten a single paycheck for my months of work either. That’s not really their fault, but it still frustrates me. 


My other job started out okay too. It’s a small and fairly comfortable office, and I have my own cubicle with my own computer and everything. The work is usually okay too–I didn’t really like talking to people over the phone at first, but this job has helped me a lot with that. The trouble came with the next batch of employees they brought in–and boy, they really scraped the bottom of the barrel. They sit around chatting with each or playing on their phones, doing the bare minimum amount of work, because there’s no supervisor (although there is a little camera above my area, lol). I do my work efficiently and with high quality, but I get treated just the same as them. Fuckers. For some reason, we’re working on a group project now, and I took the lead because those idiots didn’t have the slightest clue otherwise. It’s due tomorrow evening, but I can’t get them to do the damn work, let alone with any consistency or quality. I’ll just blame them for it, let them sink or swim.


I also snapped a little at a classmate, although in my defense it was justified. She’s this uber tumblrina/SJW type (nothing against actual social justice advocates), and we were having a lesson on multicultural sensitivity, and naturally she wouldn’t shut up. After listening to her bullshit for like an hour, I lost my composure when she started with some nonsense about how men creepily hit on her when she tries to interview them (blind and deaf men, apparently), basically trying to say that this something all guys do (I’m a girl too by the way). At this point I asked her rather harshly how many men she had actually talked to, which turned out to be like 3 or 4, which I responded to snidely about it being a rather small sample size. The professor cut in at this point, agreeing with me but clearly trying to head off an argument. I was just so fed up and frustrated, and despite my normally calm and polite demeanor, was ready to fight this bitch.

 
If you’re still reading, here comes Part II: Electric Boogaloo. Everyone in my life thinks I’m a failure, even if they won’t admit it to my face. They just stick to the snide comments and insinuations. It’s advising season, and I had to go see the director of my scholarship program. I used to be one of her favorites, having an excellent application and interesting ambitions. Now she probably thinks more highly of what she scrapes off her shoe. To be clear, I don’t share her sentiments. I’m a hell of a good writer (even if it might not seem like it here), I have a genuine love of nature and a lot of curiosity. It just seems like my skills and interests aren’t fitting in anywhere–I’ve tried a lot of different things so far, but nothing is working. I abandoned the hard sciences (which my dad just pressured me into anyway) after having basically a mental breakdown last semester. And I’m beginning to realize the English classes I’m taking are completely fucking pointless, though unfortunately I have to take them. I thought college was where you were supposed to find out what you want to do, but it seems like you have to come in with your 50-year plan prepared and 20 internships under your belt. That’s mainly what the director is disappointed in me for. I heard her talking to someone else before me, and she sounded genuinely enthusiastic and interested in what he was doing. It seemed like she was barely hiding her contempt for me, asking the bare minimum about what I was doing. I mentioned going to Costa Rica (study abroad is mandatory for this program), and she didn’t even react. I also told her that I was working two jobs, and she half-heartedly asked about it, seemingly thoroughly unimpressed. Because of course, you have to be doing research or an internship (which don’t actually exist, for people like me without a car anyway) to even be considered a real human being. These jobs were really all I could find, and I tried so hard to find work. I’ve already done research in a biology lab, and I hated it so I quit to do other things. Then she reamed me out for being behind on my degree, which I can’t really do much about, mostly due to the aforementioned mental breakdown that caused me to drop out of some classes. I have to go see another department in a few weeks, where they’ll probably bitch at me for the same reason. I have to deal with my dad’s obvious disappointment, even though I’m clearly unsuited for the sciences. I mentioned taking a journalism class (which is required for my degree), even though I’m not actually pursuing journalism, and he made some dreadful comment in front of my mom and brother about having to put away money to support me in the future. Maybe he didn’t really mean it, but it’s still an awful fucking thing to say, and my mom did nothing about it. I’m constantly the butt of all these jokes, and I’m getting tired of it. I’m not lazy or untalented. I’m very hardworking at whatever I do, and very determined, I just haven’t found the right path yet. My parents have never really grasped the depth of my depression either–they think it’s a mild inconvenience when really it’s major and has utterly crushed my spirit. I know I need more treatment than what I’m getting–I have meds but haven’t been going to therapy because of my busy schedule and playing an endless round of phone tag with my new therapist. 


Probably should have mentioned this earlier, but part of the reason I think people don’t respect me is because of my appearance. Please don't take this as arrogance, I'm just trying to give a little context. I’m quite pretty, but also very small. Despite dressing professionally and wearing makeup, I think people see me as much younger than I really am, just a little girl playing around at working and studying. I mostly blame men for this, which probably isn’t fair but I’ve never really been comfortable around men. 


I’m tired. I just want to get out of here, but I can’t find a decent job for the summer because of transportation issues and a lot of other reasons. Meanwhile my brother is living in a nice place, doing a job he likes for $20 an hour. Great. I despise all these people who know very little about me but still feel they have the right to dictate what I do with my life. I’m sick of it all and I just want to leave them behind for a long time.

4e4r6j,11,2016-04-10,"I suspect my landlord is intentionally being difficult to push me out, so he can rent to new, unwitting tenants",HarrumphingDuck,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4e4r6j/i_suspect_my_landlord_is_intentionally_being/,"Hi, FP. Never posted here because I never seemed to have enough of a pressing need, but I need to get some objective advice. Apologies for the wall of text, but I want to be as thorough as I can in explaining my situation. (**TL;DR** at the bottom)

Since June of 2015, I've been renting on a month-to-month basis from the owner of a 3BR/2BA condo. Right now it's only myself and one other roommate, who only has about 3 weeks left on his internship before he moves back home. The owner lives somewhere nearby, I believe in the same condo complex. Its location is ideal for me, since it means a short commute to where I work, and I suspect the month-to-month convenience is because a lot of seasonal interns and contractors make up his tenants. Before I moved in, I had asked him what the policy would be on repairs for the unit. I explained I'd had a bad experience at a previous place where the washing machine unexpectedly died, and how poorly the management/repair people dealt with the problem. He assured me not to worry, that he'd get right on any such issues. That proved to be a lie pretty early on, but those issues he never worked on are not related to this, and far more minor.

For the last ~3 months, my roommates and I have been warning our landlord that the clothes washing machine was starting to go. It was making a burning smell when we ran a load, and some pretty unsettling noises (squeaks bordering on shrieks).

This became more of an issue when we discovered bedbugs had invaded our unit, because when you have bedbugs, you need to wash and dry (on highest available heat) basically every possession that you can. We pointed out that this would mean an increased strain on the appliances, and he said he'd get someone to look into it.

Every week or so, we'd email him again to see if there was any progress on the W/D, though at the time, we were mostly worried about the bedbugs. Now that the bedbugs seem eliminated (fingers crossed, you never know with them), focus returned on the washer.

Two weeks ago, it finally gave up the ghost, and now won't finish a load. He said he'd look into getting them fixed, but in the meantime, he said we should take $20 off our monthly rent, for the cost of using the coin-op washer and dryer on our floor. So, because he seems to not consider this a pressing matter (no companies would ""entertain his ask"" he said), I got frustrated and did the research myself. I found a place &lt;2 miles away, confirmed they could come out as soon as the next day, and got their pricing info. Including the phone call, this took me around 15 minutes. I forwarded all this information to the landlord, and he had scheduled a visit for Friday.

The next day, he said that the repairman wouldn't inspect the units until the dryer had been unstacked from the washer. The landlord asked if my roommate and I could help unstack it. I wasn't happy about the prospect of doing this for free, especially when it could entail injury, and simply told him no. Still, he came by at some point and pulled them away from the wall. This mostly blocked the passage into the apartment, but at least he was making progress.

I came home today to find an email telling us that he's decided to not get them fixed. No mention of getting replacements; no discussion about lowering our lease rates to offset the extra cost, effort, and risk of running them in a public space in the building (there isn't even room to sit down in the laundry room, so I can't mitigate that last factor); not even an apology.

I sent him a reply asking if he has plans to get replacement units, explaining that part of the lease rate is the presence of in-unit W/D, but if that wasn't the case anymore, we would need to renegotiate it.

I live in the Seattle area, where rent is horribly high. I don't get paid very well, and I have only my own income, which makes options very limited. I'm going to start looking for other solutions tomorrow. I do have a friend that is about to close on the purchase of a 2BR/2BA house, but it's located a very long way from where I work, which would mean ~2 hour commute to work each day. My current commute is about 15 minutes. She also wants to charge me about $150 more than I think I can comfortably afford, and that's before utilities (they're covered in my current place). In a conversation with our friends, she also let slip that this rate is more than she would be paying. I've been considering jumping jobs to work with her, which would mean an easier (if not great) commute, and while we get along great and I think we could be tolerable roommates for one another, this would mean being around one another every waking hour.

There is a low-income housing complex just up the street from this place, but I hear it's a very long line to be approved for a unit, if you are approved at all. I've also heard that such places are typically inhabited by unstable folks that I'd probably not want for neighbors, and that the units are pretty low quality.

Am I being unreasonable for losing my patience with my current landlord? I feel like continuing to pay my full rent, despite bedbugs for several months and nonfunctional (or barely functional) appliances, is more than reasonable. And now that those appliances are not available, renegotiating the lease seems like the proper next step, but I have very little leverage, especially when I think the landlord's goal is to push me out anyway.

Any thoughts or suggestions on how to move forward would be appreciated.

**TL;DR:** Landlord has been habitually lazy about unit repairs, especially for major appliance breaking. Now I suspect he's just being difficult to convince me to leave, so he can replace me with tenants not familiar with his bullshit (or the recent presence of bedbugs). A friend just bought a house, but moving in would be more of a strain on my finances, and a nightmare commute."
4e4u9i,1,2016-04-10,The Cost of Changing Majors,aychtooessohfore,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4e4u9i/the_cost_of_changing_majors/,"Hi Everyone,


When I first started school, I was awarded a full ride scholarship (tuition, fees, housing, food, books, stipend) to an out of state school. I've now been attending for 3 years (1 of which was spent co-oping). This means I have 4 semesters of scholarship left. 


I started off as a chemical engineering major, but after working in software and computer hardware for my co-ops, I've really wanted to change my major to computer engineering. This change, however, would require me to take an additional semester of school since only 55 of my 70 credits will transfer over. I'll need another 74 to graduate. Since I'm an out of state student, I would need about 18k to cover the full cost of a semester at my school.


I currently have 8k saved up from work and will make another 9k (of which I can probably save most) this summer while living at home. I hope to be able to earn another 8-10k for the other 2 summers I'd have until graduation. I also plan to apply for any scholarships I can. I am a decent candidate (4.0 GPA, volunteer work, internship at NASA), so hopefully I will be able to earn some to cover the costs.


I also plan to live off campus and cook significantly to save some of my scholarship money. Living on campus was a lot of fun, but my college gives me 10k per year for housing/food which is a large surplus. My next apartment will only cost me about 4k for the year in rent, and I'm confident food will be less than 2k for 2 semesters based on my spending history. This would allow me to save 2k from my scholarship per semester or 8k over the course of the next 4. 


Do you think this is a bad decision? I could graduate earlier and with more money if I don't change majors, but I'd much rather work in the computer hardware and software industry. There's also the opportunity cost of staying in school longer (4 more months) vs working fulltime"
4e4xiu,36,2016-04-10,1 interview 1 acceptance,akaur93,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/4e4xiu/1_interview_1_acceptance/,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to write this post to inspire premeds out there who may find themselves in shoes similar to mine. 

I applied to 18 medical schools. Heard back from ONE MD school on Oct. 2. Interviewed Nov. 14th. Didn't hear back ANYTHING. Wrote a combo update/letter of intent. Finally got accepted on Jan. 29th. 

3.94 GPA, 30 MCAT (11,8.11). Honors biochemistry major. I had 0 clinical volunteering (until my update letter which included volunteer scribing for a family doctor and working ED registration, both for a few months). The only research experience I had was my required senior honors thesis+poster. And I had NO significant leadership ECs. 

I took the MCAT once, and self studied using EK and Princeton Review.

I just want to show that it's possible to get into med school without being the most involved premed. Don't get me wrong, I had work experience (waitressing), tons of job shadowing and non-clinical volunteering plus some scholarships/awards but nothing AMAZING (except for my honors thesis which I think was pretty boss). My personal statement and LORs were also good. 

If I had to do it all over again here's what I'd do: 

+Focus on getting a good GPA and MCAT (seriously, I feel like this is all that REALLY matters...). I took 3 summer classes (Physics I, II and Micro) and was never asked about them. So I'm living proof summer classes don't make you look bad, and because you get to take them one at a time, are a significant GPA booster.

+NEVER consult my stupid premed committee. I feel like committee letters are designed to make you look bad. F*** them. I was only specifically required to have a committee letter on one of my med school applications (BU). I had it anyway, but if I had known how unnecessary it was I never would have bothered. Pre med committees, in my opinion, are given too much power and are designed to make you feel like shit. 

+Focus on ONE medical school that I thought I had the best chance at. (Eventually this is what I did! Ahaha, I didn't bother writing update letters to schools that didn't offer me interviews). I would recommend reaching out to students, faculty, alumni etc. from the one medical school you want to go to most. Being able to name drop in a secondary application, I imagine, would be EXTREMELY helpful. 

+Used Interfolio. This is actually something I did and I'm so glad! It was super easy and convenient. Especially when my school dragged on their damn committee letter, I already had my other LORs ready to go. 

+HAD MORE FUN. I don't wish I had studied more. I do wish I had more fun and focused on making friendships. 
____________________________________________________

THE BIG BUT:
Since getting accepted, for personal reasons, I've realized I'm most likely not going to pursue medical school. I put myself through hell to get to this point and now I realize I just want to be happy. I'm tired of waiting to get through the next exam or course or semester. I'm tired of wishing away my life.

Honestly, I had wanted to be a doctor since I was 8 years old. Living that dream for so long and having your entire family know about it, I felt like I cornered myself into a path and could no longer get out. I think this is called the Sunk Cost Fallacy - the idea that you have to keep doing something because you've already dedicated so much time to it. 

I think I was also drawn to the job stability and prestige of being a doctor. I was also good at science. I liked feeling smart and making my parents proud. But I know I'm only going to resent them if I go to medical school just to make them happy. 

Finally I'll end on a quote I recently read that really spoke to me:
 
""Just because you're good at something, doesn't mean you should be doing it"". 

Follow your passions even if I'm the first person to ever tell you that you can. Your happiness DOES matter. You're accountable for your own happiness.
______________________________________________________________________________
Edit: This post keeps getting upvoted. I can't help but feel like there's many of you that may be feeling the same way or similar. Send me a message. I'd love to hear from you.

Edit: It annoys me that everyone keeps yelling at me about clinical experience. I never said I had no clinical experience. I said I had no clinical volunteering, that too only until my update letter. I had close to 200 hours of job shadowing with a general surgeon, a PA and a family doctor who wrote me an awesome LOR. And I had tons of non clinical volunteering too.

Plus apart from my application I had taken a 2 year LNA program and a transport internship at a hospital in high school. So I had a good idea what I was getting myself into. But you don't realize how you're gonna feel about med school until you're accepted and the reality of 7 years and taking out a massive binding loan is staring you in the face. 

Also about the committee letter. Yes obviously get it people if your pre-med committee offers it. Personally I felt that my premed committee unnecessarily stressed students out and played favorites when it came to the letter. Obviously the kid who had worked in the lab of the letter writer since freshman year was getting a better letter than those of us being judged at one poorly conducted interview with random faculty. So based on my experience I would have forgone it but even I don't know how important that letter may have been for my acceptance.

...I'm like 90% sure I used that same headline for our last Mexico show too. Whatever. In the second week of All-Around April, WiR's going to get spicy as House Party puts on Lucha Night! What does that entail of course? Well, the Lucha Night are:

- Six-sided ring

- Two *extremely incompenent* referees for every match

- Every match is two out of three falls

- Everyone has to wear a lucha mask (except Brodie, because we're not cruel enough to go send some poor intern to try and stick a mask over that bearded head)

- You're damn right that everybody will get introduced with their lucha names

We'll be coming to you LIVE from the Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico, which means that once again we're gonna pull a huge crowd who are probably only there to see Los Chongas. They're our true bread and butter. The card for the show is:

-----

**El Dalidus del Estrella Nueva y El James del Marfil vs. ¿¿¿ y ¿¿¿**

*2/3 Falls Tag Team Match*

-----

In their debut as a team, Dalidus Nova and James Ivory will face off against mystery opponents! But who will they be? Perhaps luchadores? Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

-----

**Team Lucha (El Hijo del Sloth, Jimmy Chonga Jr., y Mil Léones Jr.) vs. Team Not-Lucha (El Buster del Bravata, El Hwo del Sonó, y El Joey del McCarty)**

*6-Man 2/3 Falls Tag Team Match*

-----

Mexico is going to get a chance to see their favourite luchadores and lucha-sloths work together in an all-star lucha team against the not-so lucha team of Buster Bravado, Hwo Rang, &amp; Joey McCarty. Will Mexico's finest be able to score a win in their home turf, or will the rudos get the victory?

-----

**Los Señores de la Guerra (El Robert del Brujo y El Stephen del Romero) vs. El Kevin del Scottjackson y El Marka del Holandés**

*2/3 Falls Tag Team Match*

-----

The Warlords have been keeping the tag team division tight as champions, but the recently made team of KSJ and Mark Dutch could give them a run for their money. Will the champs disperse of the new all-star team in town, or will the former rivals give the Warlords a run for their money?

-----

**Brodie Hansen (c) vs. El Erik del Vonjarrett**

*2/3 Falls Match for the WiR World Championship*

-----

EVJ won a gauntlet match against the secret senate. He did it with the help of kaytlin, but he's going alone in the title match. Does he have the might to topple Brodie? Or will the man from Carcosa add another trophy to his growing collection?

Different cities named to try and preserve identities.

I will try to make this as short as humanly possible but I feel like there's gonna need to be some back story for y'all.

**The Backstory:** So I've been dating this guy we'll call Adam since November of 2014. We had to go long distance when I went back to school to finish my bachelor's in January 2015. The school I go to is about a 2-3 hour drive/bus ride/train ride away from my home city/where Adam goes to college. The distance was fine at first, well I guess as fine as long distance can go. We would skype weekly and always text and whatnot.

Summer 2015: He got an internship in his home state of Ohio related to his major that he started like right after he finished out the school year. We were having some communication problems at that point, we were both busy with finals and projects and whatnot, and my sister graduated from high school so I was busy for a few weeks. So long story short there, we didn't really talk very much (other than the occasional, short ""hi, whats up, thinking about you"") conversation for about a week, maybe 9-10 days. 

Adam skyped me and addressed the problems, saying it was mostly on me for the lack of communication (and it probably was for the most part, I was busy but I probably could've made more of an effort) so we made up. While we were discussing this, Adam brought up the idea of an open relationship (at least while we were several states away for the summer). I didn't want to at all, I wasn't comfortable with the idea of it personally. He was relieved and said the same thing. We agreed that wasn't what we wanted, so we stayed monogamous and I skyped/facetimed him literally every day over the summer. I also went to visit him for a week in Ohio over the summer, and we had a great time.

We eventually have more communication problems around Christmas 2015 (again, starting with me cramming for finals and not getting back to my home city until 12/22). We break up from 12/27/15-01/04/16. We get back together and talk about communicating more. He asks again if I want an open relationship. I still tell Adam no, he says he only wants to be with me, and he looks visibly relieved and says he doesn't want to be open either. It works out (from what I can see) and we're all good when I go back to school for my last semester.

Quick fast forward to February: I have a semi-popular tumblr (like 1000 followers, nothing to really look at) where I will talk relatively openly about my own sexual experiences and who I've slept with. I've been intimate with someone he knows (we hooked up before I started dating Adam) and when someone there asked me about it, I answered truthfully. Adam later contacts me and says he's really upset, accuses me of cheating and is incredibly indignant about it, as if I'm the one responsible for everything that's ever gone wrong in his entire life. He again asks if I want an open relationship; this time I say I want to think about it, but I ultimately tell him I didn't want to a few days later. He again acts very relieved and says the same thing.

**The Dilemma:** Fast forward to the past few weeks: Adam was acting very weird over my spring break while I was home to visit him, so when he was showering one day I decided to investigate. I don't know his phone password so I looked at his iMessages through his computer, and found out he's been regularly cheating on me since his summer in Ohio with multiple guys. At first it looked like it was just from when we were broken up, but he continued to message and (from what I can tell) fuck these guys even after we got back together. Adam even had a guy over about 2 hours after I left his place the same day during my spring break. I took pictures of the texts on his computer (for some kind of proof in case I wanted to confront him) but I don't know what to do about them because I'm also fucking scumbag and cheated on him before (twice: once while he was in Ohio for the summer, once in October of 2015). I even found a text message of Adam's from October of 2015, telling a potential new fuck buddy of his that said we *were* in an open relationship, and Adam's planning on hooking up with this guy when he comes to visit our city in June.

I've been pretending everything is fine since then, because I don't know what to do. To be honest I'm a *little* mad but not **that** mad about the cheating. I'm more angry about the hypocrisy; the crying and the guilt trips he would freely use to make me feel like a shitty boyfriend are more infuriating than anything. He's the one that would bring up the idea of an open relationship, and then chastise me for considering it. But when he thinks he's in the clear, he has no problem trying to throw me under the bus and make it seem like I'm the only bad boyfriend.

**The Questions:** What should I do? Do I confront him? Do I try to open a discussion? Does his hypocrisy matter at all, or am I just being petty?? I don't think I'd want to be in an open relationship with him, because I do love him. But I don't know if I can keep pretending everything is fine now. I know I'm equally to blame, I've cheated too. Is it worth trying to save this relationship, or do I just say ""we don't work if we aren't being honest"" and break up with him?

**TL;DR** LDR Boyfriend thinks we suck at communication, begrudgingly suggests an open relationship several times. Even though he seems happy about a closed relationship on the outside, he's been regularly cheating on me for almost a year now. Problem is: I've cheated on him twice. He has no idea I've cheated on him, and he doesn't know that I know he's been cheating on me. Is the relationship worth saving?"

4e57ed,6,2016-04-10,Educational Question about a Masters,bahaa9001,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4e57ed/educational_question_about_a_masters/,"Basically, my undergrad GPA is awful (under 3.0). I'm about to graduate this semester and I also have no internships. My degree is in Math (with enough Stats courses to almost satisfy a Stats B.S) and I have to say I don't know too much about programming or even much financial/insurance jargon. I can learn this stuff on my own time, but I worry that I will have nothing to show/prove that I know anything. The stuff genuinely interests me, so after graduation I can relax from these brutal pure math courses and leisurely study some relevant material. 

My low GPA I know will hurt me in in finding a job/internship (and an internship even more so because I am about to be a grad). Since I'm not 18 anymore and I actually care about school, I'm thinking about applying to a masters program in actuarial science somewhere so that I can work towards rebuilding a sexy GPA, and so that I can also familiarize with the non-math side of an actuarial role. Not to mention that being a student again will open me up to some intern opportunities.

I am interested in your opinions. I understand that school is just more time/debt that I have to worry about, and that most of you would probably advise against graduate work in favor of an EL, but I also feel that this is one of my few options considering my low GPA situation, as well as my need to be familiar with non-math concepts. I should mention I'm taking P/1 in 5 weeks and am doing relatively well on Adapt and expect to pass. Hopefully I'll have FM/2 in the bag this August. 

For reference, I'm a Florida resident and the closest thing in this state is a Financial Math, Actuarial Track MS from FSU. Other universities offer B.S programs but I don't want to have to go through another 4 years (some of my credits may transfer, but even then an MS would probably still take less time). Since I previously didn't plan on pursuing a Masters, I never did GRE exams or anything of the sort, so I'm afraid I may be too late to make it into the program this Fall. So side question: Do employers look negatively on candidates who have a year break between undergraduate and graduate programs? I wouldn't exactly be doing nothing; I'd still be studying for/taking exams while holding some kind of job.

Thanks and any input is appreciated!!"
4e5a4v,0,2016-04-10,I am from a poor background. Should I stop hanging around with wealthy and successful people?,ronsoness,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4e5a4v/i_am_from_a_poor_background_should_i_stop_hanging/,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the best thread, but here goes.

I am from a very poor and dysfunctional family. My dad died at 3, then my mother's schizophrenia emerged at 5. They were farmers from another country before immigrating to the US. I ended up in foster homes at 10. Dirt poor, traumatized, socially not adjusted, and with no one looking out for me. Then I did a funny thing. 

I was going to this middle school in a very ghetto part of my state. I mean, minorities and immigrant kids amok. Bullet casings found on my campus sometimes. Dress code is full of gang-related things. And I got street cred for living in a shitty street. Anyway, I apply for a scholarship to this high school in my state that was $10k/yr tuition (today it's $20k/yr ) and where the smartest kids go. I got in. 

High school was hard. I was socially not adjusted and being from the poorest segment of society and then going to school with people from the wealthiest segment was rough. There were scholarship kids there too, but none were probably living in a foster home.

At 18, I graduated high school and also got kicked out of my foster home. My social worker told me I had scholarships for college, so I went to my state college. There, I was living on my own. Working shit jobs like stock boy, janitor, retail. I was catching the bus, then riding a moped. I was shit poor. Yet, for some reason, I was constantly around middle class + people. I also ended up befriending many of those kids from my high school. And then I kept meeting more middle class + upper class people. I even got a sweet internship through a wealthy friend that paid me $20/hr while in school. I started hanging around people and going clubbing with them... they had nice cars and didn't even work. 

When I graduated, I moved to another country to be an English teacher. I was still around middle class + people. They were all educated (you have to have a bachelor's to teach) and I don't think any of them were poor like me. The problem was that teaching was a dead end job, and I wanted more for myself.

I moved back to my home state to try find a job. No luck. With a 2.9 GPA, I simply couldnt make the cut for the jobs I wanted. I'm a smart person, but I lack experience and mentorship. I ended up being self employed for the past 4 years as a web developer, making a living wage, doing fairly interesting work, but feeling like I am not doing anything with my life and not living up to my potential, work-wise, status-wise, and money-wise.

The worst part is that because I have been around so many middle class+ people and went to a prep high school, so many people I know are now with great jobs and ""successful."" It's easy for me to see the connection between their resources and their current success, but it really makes me feel like shit. 

So my question is this: should I stop hanging around wealthy and successful people? I feel like they are good to know and I can learn much from them. Yet it makes me feel so poor and inferior. Yet I can't hang out with poor people because I have little  in common with them anymore and some of them lack ambition and just talk about the same stuff over and over."
4e5agm,1,2016-04-10,"Advice for a ""no dress code"" interview",WelshGhandi,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/4e5agm/advice_for_a_no_dress_code_interview/,"Hi guys,

Bit of context: I'm 20 and from the UK. I have an internship interview this week at a tech company, and in the invitation it says 
&gt;We don’t have a dress code so feel free to come dressed comfortably. 

How am I supposed to interpret this? I was considering a white oxford shirt and black jeans, but I feel like jeans could be a bit too casual.

The company is quite new (~2007), and from what I've seen the staff dress pretty casually. So I don't want to overdo it with shirt and trousers and shoes.

Does anyone have an experience of interviews like this, or any recommendations? I'd really appreciate it!"
4e5c4b,6,2016-04-10,[Shadowrun] Special Agent Face,ArticulateT,gametales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4e5c4b/shadowrun_special_agent_face/,"Ok, so [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4d68xv/shadowrun_fast_food_massacre/) our runners had completed their first task as professional criminals by rescuing a hostage from a small-time mafia family who ran future-McDonalds.

Since the cyberdeck they found took a month to fence, the group spend some time maxin' and relaxin' until they get a call from their fixer for another job. In the mean time, the players, now in a potentially proper campaign, apply some mild-strength retcon tonic to their characters.

**Sam**, the Elf Street Sammy, is no longer corp owned (as the Corp Born SIN drawback was fairly hard for both GM and Player to handle) and was now albino and an amnesiac. There were a few adjustments to their cyberware, so they were .3 more human than they were the last time.

**Arturia**, the Human Face, hadn't really changed much since the last time, other than having a code name. They still hold all the dice for social interactions, and refuses to share on them.

**Whisper**, the Human PhysAd, is now blind, but has a series of abilities and gear that effectively makes them Daredevil of the year 2072. Came into their adept powers at the age of twelve and was thoroughly enthralled with the Shadowrunning lifestyle throughout their youth, even after losing their eyesight.

The fixer was one of Arturia's contacts, and he was an Orc called Donahue.

Donahue, also known by his near-coincidental surname of Fixerville, wasn't like most fixers. While most would run a bar, restaurant or skype their clients from their cheeto and porn filled basements, Donahue was a realtor. He ran a 'legitimate business' by selling homes in a suburban area of Seattle. Some of the homes on his list (detached four bedroom homes in an 'ok' neighbourhood) he would have listed for extortionate prices, with their apparent quality indicating they were definitely weren't worth it to those who could afford them, and Donahue wouldn't budge on the price.

These homes were radio-shielded, lead-lined and constantly EMP'd, with a local talismonger going through them on occasion to ward them against magical eavesdropping. It was these homes that Donahue would permit his clientèle to meet in, discuss and get their jobs from.

The group met with Donahue at a nice house on 5th Street, and wandered inside while he continued to provide the smug-as-shit realtor sales-pitch. Even when he closed and locked the door behind him, the persona didn't stop, possibly indicating that this was just the normal Donahue.

As the group got comfortable, he explained that the job against the Fratellis had generated some level of unease among the mafia families of Seattle, especially since the group had implicated the Ciarnellis in the previous job. This meant there was a greater demand of runners to perform subterfuge and wetwork as the other families got a little unnerved by the apparent Ciarnelli power-push.

When Sam asked how their fixer knew it was them, since they paid good money for a hacker to scramble and erase information that they were there, Arturia admitted that he had bragged about it when the job was over.

Donahue then got down to brass tax and explained to the group that he had a Johnson waiting for them at a downtown restaurant known as 'Martinis', and that the restaurant was kind of fancy, so they would likely need to go shopping for some nice clothes prior to the meet, especially since the Johnson was kind enough to pay for the meal.

This lead to a brief shopping montage, as it was more or less explained to the group that a good show of etiquette when getting dressed for a meet was to wear something that emphasised your group role. Arturia wore something formal and graceful, to indicate his role as the group face, Sam wore something formal, though also practical and adjusted to permit ease of movement, and Whisper wore something of a cross between a suit and formal robes of a martial artist, to help emphasise their adept abilities.

Martinis itself was a two-function affair; the ground floor was a nightclub, with a long line of late-teens and young adults waiting for their turn to get drunk and dance, while the first floor was a fancy-pants restaurant with a somewhat smaller, more refined line outside.

Leaving their weapons in security boxes by the door and being padded down by security, the group head inside and are guided by a waiter to the table (they were offered menus, and sadly didn't have any in Braille, but did have an audio version of the menu, or could fetch one of the interns to read the menu to Whisper. Whisper just opted to have one of his teammates do that.)

Mr. Johnson, a Minotaur of prim and proper demeanour, was already at the table and delicately sipping on a nice red wine As the group sat down, ordered their meals and favoured wines, the Johnson got right down to business before the food could arrive.

Due to the Ciarnelli power push, his employer would like to get some information on some of their more illicit business transactions, and had reason to believe that an automechanic on the edge of the Redmond Barrens was serving as a covert distribution point for BTL chips. Now, this wasn't inherently terrible, though the chips they specialised in were the kind of things that weren't so innocent. (Instead of skydiving, for example, it would be things like torturing or being tortured, that sort of thing).

He wanted the group to go in and find all the information they can within their nexus, as well as find a journal. When asked what the journal might look like, Johnson explained it wasn't like a standard tablet or dataslate, but an actual leather bound journal. It was curious, but it was reasonable to assume that, in a world so digital, going backwards might be one of the better security options.

The group was offered 20k Nuyen for the job, which was negotiated up to 25k due to Face powers, with a 5k bonus if they perform the job without them thinking that anything is immediately wrong.

Task accepted, Johnson and Arturia shook hands and the deal was made just as the main course was brought to the table. The group enjoyed a delicious, though not entirely filling meal, with Johnson footing the bill as promised before he excused himself and lumbered off.

The task before them, the runners proceeded on their jobs. Arturia got in contact with Donahue to see if he knew where to find a book they can replace the journal with, and was pointed in the direction of Fracas, a talismonger in midtown who might have something of that nature. Then, they contacted another one of the Fixer's contacts, a hacker (who was decidedly made [Sandra Bullock's character from The Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Net_(1995_film))) who would might be able to hack the building. Upon being unable to do so, either by an enemy hacker or a damn good firewall, the group picked up a wireless matrix dongle that they could use, as well as being on the look out for a decker in the building.

With their gear acquired, they went over to the site, only to find it seemingly in the middle of a Lone Star raid, at least from the outside. Squad cars and beat cops form a perimeter around the building. Using their senses, Whisper detects one of the cops to be a mage, with a total of eight people being immediately visible to his ultrasound.

Arturia heads over to the barricade and talks with one of the beat cops, rolling god-like con rolls to convince the guy to let him and his partner, Sam, into the building. While this occurs, Whisper manoeuvres to the back of the building, using their gecko-grips and adept skills to scale the wall to an exterior window.

Sam and Arturia are introduced to the Lieutenant on duty as Special Agents Black and White, and they request a private conversion with the lieutenant, as well as the clerk behind the counter. They're brought into the garage area, where they find a Dodge Rhino (A big, fuck off APC) that had been stripped of its wheels, windows and almost all of the interior (seats, gadgets, everything) and the doors had been welded shut.

As the two convince the clerk that they can get rid of Lone Star, and are aware of the BTL dealing, they stay behind in the garage to inspect the Rhino. Sam disables the cameras before they snoop around and find a pair of datasticks (one labelled Blueprint, the other labelled Transcript) on a workbench. As they prepare to leave, Arturia spies a grate in the wall shift open, and a pair of Ferret drones roll out, tasers raised.

Of course, these are Ferret model drones, the kind you'd get for personal security and punishing mild belligerents rather than fighting two highly trained runners, and in a matter of two rounds, the drones are disabled. Looking through the camera of one, more face powers are applied to intimidate the shit out of the decker on the first floor.

the 'Special Agents' head upstairs, finding the elf decker in the common room, backed against a wall and shakily aiming a pistol at the two, but with Sam helping with the intimidation, the elf drops his weapon and heads downstairs to sit with the Lone Star cops. With the way clear, a window is opened to let Whisper in, and the three make their way to the office where the building's owner is going over some paper work, but not before attaching the wireless Matrix dongle to anearby data port and letting Sandra get to work.

Giovanni Ciarnelli is a portly man, a light shade of red on his face as frustration mounts over the sheer volume of paperwork covering the place. Special Agents Black, White and now Brown, introduce themselves and explain to the man the same schtick from before; that they know about the BTL business and will be able to get rid of lonestar. Sadly, intimidation doesn't immediately work since the fellow is highly aware of how much pull the Ciarnelli family seems to have, but it does provide enough distraction for Whisper to palm the journal, found on a nearby shelf, and replacing it with the blank one.

After a brief moment of negotiation from the 'Agents', the three leave, telling Lone Star that they have all they need and that they can go home (Face rolls high, Lieutenant crit-glitches). Hopefully, their little run would make the Lone Star goons the prime suspects if and when the Ciarnellis notice their paydata is gone.

The group drop off the data at a bar called Murray's in downtown, their contact being an old dwarf named Joseph. The transaction is quick and easy, and the trio suddenly become 30k richer. All in all, a good run."

And yes, anyway you cut it, these foreign workers in tech companies and even in other corporate structures in America, are 'slaves' first and 'slaves' second.

There is not even an iota of doubt in that presumption.

Although I know it's not politically correct to call 'slaves' to some very bright interns or just plain foreign workers brought to America from China and India when we replace  our year old U.S. born American citizen employees with these cheap tech workers who get only $19.75 an hour or $3,000 dollars a month, for the same job that the honchos sitting in some dot.com  company's board, figure  a much better bargain as they were paying almost a minimum of  $10,000 a month to the American born citizen workers.

And the working conditions these 'slaves' brought on H-1B visas get to work on their computers are as deplorable as the workers in 'sweat shops' stitching t-shirts for us in Bangladesh or 'Haiti', etc., by hunching over sewing machines,for almost 18 hours a day, these slaves in the third world countries as well as in New York City where I witnessed first hand how the South American undocumented workers were producing cheap merchandises that we buy paying just a couple of dollars in WalMart and other departmental stores, not knowing that some 'slaves' somewhere are giving their lives for us in the most horrible and inhumane conditions. 

Not denigrating the horrible conditions the 'slaves' in our country worked under, from the beginning of 16th century on wards until the 1864 when they were freed by Abe Lincoln and the Union Army, these modern day 'slaves' work in horrible conditions too.

So it's as important as it was in 1861 for the politicians to raise an  awareness of this horrible practice called 'slavery' and the descendants of Lincoln and others have a moral obligation to end the modern day slavery which most of the Americans are not even aware of.

But looking at these tech workers brought on H-1B visas who sit side by side in long tables, hunching down and looking at their Pcs for 18 hours a day, who can very well be termed as 'slaves' because they are bought and sold by their respective 'importers'  called Tata Consultancy Services etc., from India as we recently came to learn from the turmoil in Disney and other American workplaces where the American tech workers are given no time to find other employment opportunities but given a month or so to teach everything they know to the low paying tech workers and get fired without making any fuss .

That's what I call 'putting salt to your injury' when you have to teach your replacement everything you learned over the years just to get a paycheck which is not what the law behind H1B visas was based on.

As per the law, an employer must make efforts to hire American workers by placing at least two ads in the National newspapers.
And if after waiting for two months, they get no applications from U.S. citizens, they can the start the procedure to hire foreign workers.

So, in every terms of the law, this whole system where tech company executives fire an American worker by calling it a 'graduation' for them, is nothing but a travesty.

And the sad part is, our politicians who passed the law, look the other way when our own citizens are abused and taken advantage of, because of the almighty dollar that these tech company bosses make by hiring cheap foreign workers and literally slap the faces of U.S. born tech employees by calling it anything but 'firing', then shuffling these foreign workers placing them  in different rooms  in different cities of  U.S.A. making them sit on the same type of long tables like their predecessors.  .

Really, what  baloney  ?﻿...tkb."

I'm a CS student doing my second internship, the first was C# desktop, and now it is mainly backend with Java + Spring, which I'm really liking.

It's been some time that I'm trying to figure out a good side project focused on back-end. The main goal is that I could improve my skills and have a solid project to be shown when trying to get a full-time job.

But for me it just seems much harder to come with a cool idea for a website with a good amount of back-end compared to desktop or mobile.

Any suggestions would be really appreciated! Thanks!"

4e60z5,17,2016-04-10,Some queries about top tech companies (UK Student),princepieman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e60z5/some_queries_about_top_tech_companies_uk_student/,"Hi there guys,

So I'm an incoming Maths &amp; CS student at a top 10 UK university, and I've been exploring the tech space for a while. In my search, I've pretty much confirmed that it is possible to land internships in the US from a UK school, but I wanted to expand upon this a bit. So without further ado, here are my questions:

Perusing my LinkedIn network, I've come across numerous Imperial grads that have undergone Software Engineering internships in the US, and not a significant number from my Uni. Are the top tech companies more welcoming to Oxbridge/Imperial students or can a Warwick/Bristol/Edinburgh student get an interview too?

How possible is it for me to apply to far flung offices (i.e. Google Tokyo, Microsoft HK etc) without full fluency in the local language? Would my CV be binned straight away?

It's common knowledge in the UK that most students complete internships in their penultimate year of university. However, if I were to apply to the US HQs of some of these top tech companies for an internship before my penultimate year, would I even be considered? Also, are there any other programs besides Google's STEP program?

How should I position myself best during my first year (projects, knowledge etc) to stand a chance coming from the UK?

Thanks :)

4e63ux,2,2016-04-10,F4M The Latina Intern and the Republican Congressman,longtimelurker92,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4e63ux/f4m_the_latina_intern_and_the_republican/,"Olivia's stilettos echoed on the marble floor as she made her way down the empty corridors of the US Capitol. During the daytime this place would be swamped by tourists, eager to fawn over the artifacts of America's grand democracy, but it was nearing midnight, and the only people still around were cleaners and a few bored-looking policemen.

When she heard back in the Spring that she'd been accepted into the Congressional Interns Program Olivia could scarcely believe her luck. Her two years at college had been stressful, to say the least. Between her studies, part-time job and student loans Olivia barely had time to sleep, let alone cut loose like so many of her peers. It saddened her, truth be told, to spend Friday night after Friday night in the library while her friends got to revel in the glamorous debauchery of college parties. But while a summer spent in D.C. wasn't going to involve much partying, it at least made Olivia feel as if she was on the right path.

Granted, when she heard just who she'd be working for Olivia's was a bit taken aback; Jack Stewart. Representative for Georgia's 21st district and the Great Young Hope for conservatives everywhere. It seemed like every other week he was on Fox with his gleaming smile, talking about the importance of border security or reducing welfare. His beautiful blonde wife Cindy and kids only added to his appeal. There were whispers that he might be offered a cabinet position after the next election, or at least a senior position in the house.

None of that really appealed to Olivia. As a girl from a poor Latina family she wasn't exactly a fan of Stewart's brand of conservatism. However, she also recognized that the opportunity was too good to pass up, and she should just grit her teeth and get on with it. Plus she couldn't deny it, there was something about Stewart that made him so...easy to listen to.

As Olivia neared Stewart's office she checked herself out in the mirror, flushing a bit in embarrassment. For some reason she had allowed a fellow intern, Kristy, to take her shopping over the weekend for work clothes, and her previously conservative attire now offered much more. Her pencil skirt came down to mid-thigh and did an excellent job of showing off her round Latina rump. Likewise her white blouse, even buttoned up, gave an ample view of her impressive chest.

Reaching the outside of Stewart's office Olivia took a deep breath and double-checked that she had all the documents. She looked up and down the empty corridor before knocking on the heavy wooden door.
__________________________________________________

Heya! Thanks for reading so much. So the idea here is pretty straightforward; I'm looking for a guy to play the role of a young, up-and-coming conservative politician who turns an innocent Latina intern into his personal slampiece. I want you to change Olivia from a girl who spends her Friday nights looking over voting data to one whose on her knees in the back of Stewart's limo.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are what I'm interested in above all, but I'd also like to incorporate raceplay, powerplay and some light bimbofication/stepfordization. Dub-con is another aspect I'd like to include - I want this scene to be dark, but more focused on Olivia's mental manipulation, rather than out and out rape.

Anyway if you're interested shoot me a PM either continuing the story or setting up your character. I wrote around 450 words for my intro so I'd appreciate something of similar length!"

So I'm currently an Accounting student in Lebanon. My long term goal is to immigrate to Canada. After extensive research, I realized that getting a visa to Canada with a bachelors degree from abroad with no local Canadian work experience is almost (If not fully) impossible... So, if all goes well, I'm planning on continuing my graduate studies in a Canadian university. The university I go to now is part of the AAICU (Association of American International Colleges and Universities), however, I'm aware that this doesn't really mean anything because in a field like Accounting I need to be familiar with Canadian tax laws and get Canadian qualifications. I really want to work in either Accounting or something related to Finance/Banking, so the realistic option is to apply for a Masters program in either Accounting or Finance. I've done some research online and found out that in order to actually get into a Masters program in Accounting, I'm going to have to retake some core Accounting courses before becoming eligible for admission. Is this also the case with wanting to have a Masters in Finance? What are the general requirements for someone with an Accounting bachelors from abroad to be integrated into the world of Accounting/Finance in Canada? 
Relocating to Canada successfully and having a good and profitable career means a lot to me so I am ready to go through all the necessary procedures to meet all the requirements. I'm aware that tuition fees for international students are pretty expensive but I am willing to pay for that investment and get my Masters from a Canadian university if it means that it makes it easier for me to transition successfully to the Canadian labor force. 
So, the purpose of this thread I started is to know if getting accepted into a masters program in accounting or finance is a possibility for me. I have decent grades in my university now. I have a 3.5 GPA and I get A's in most of my courses, especially my Accounting ones. My entire program is 136 credits overall, but even so, I guess I'm going to have to repeat some courses in Canada before getting accepted into a masters program? Does having some work experience prior to enrolling in a program help at all? I'm currently aiming for an internship at one of the Big Four auditing firms and I'm willing to work for a year or two if it solidifies my chances of getting accepted.
Assuming all goes well and I do get my masters there, what are my chances of finding a job IN Canada after earning my graduate degree? Do I get a work permit for at least a year after I finish a one year Masters program? Does having a one year work permit give me sufficient time to find a job in Canada AND apply for permanent residency? What universities are open to accepting international students? I'm aiming for Toronto but I am open to attending universities in other areas. 
Some information about me... I'm currently 21 years old. I'm a fluent English speaker and I speak it better than I speak my current country's language so I don't have any language barrier issues. I really hope I would be permanently settled in Canada by the time I'm in my 30's. So...Do I have a chance? Thanks in advance for any replies. "

This guide applies to incoming freshman in the summer, freshman, and sophomores. **Edit** - This advice isn't for everyone. Life isn't just all about work, and you're young and you have so many opportunities to experience and learn about the world. Also I'm just a sophomore. I don't know as much as most people on this subreddit, but I've talked to many recruiters and currently recruit underclassmen for internships. Feel free to not listen to me.

I'm a sophomore studying CS and Economics at a rank #40-50 school. I've managed to be successful despite the low ranking and low GPA. I had an internship after freshman year, and have one secured this summer at a good name. I also get into summits and scholarships based on all the work that I've done.

You're going to study Computer Science this fall. Yay! Your school might offer a BA or BS. What's the difference? Honestly, general education requirements. You still take the same CS courses. 

Okay you probably took AP Computer Science, and aced the AP exam which means you got placed out of the introduction to CS classes. Most likely your first CS class will be on data structures. Most of your interviews for the next three years will be based on what you learn in this class, so you better pay attention. At my school, we implemented and built data structures while in a real life setting, you can use libraries with pre-made structures. Building the structure helps you understand how and why it works. 

Maybe you didn't take AP CS. Okay then you'll probably take an Introduction to CS class which teaches you a programming language and the basic syntax. Usually these classes are in Python, Java, or C++. 

**Also, don't expect to be spoonfed everything you need to know in your classes. To me, the CS classes are to develop your thinking and problem solving skills. Outside of class, you'll teach yourself what you need to ""know for the job"".**

Everyone has their own goals but here's how you can succeed if you want internships after freshman, sophomore, and junior year, and hopefully employment after senior year:

Often internships and job applications will ask for your resume, occasionally a cover letter, and then links to your portfolio and online presence. 

*  Make a resume, Github, LinkedIn, Twitter, and account on whatever company you're applying to. I've filled out maybe 100-200 applications and probably &gt; 50% ask for Github, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  **Why do I need a Twitter? Applications have asked for it and with an online presence, recruiters can reach out to you. Twitter is not necessary but doesn't hurt to have one.** Also, you better make a website. Teach yourself HTML and CSS, and use an easy framework like Bootstrap. Your website should display your portfolio and links to your profiles and accounts.
* So now you have your Github and portfolio, but you have to fill it up with stuff. Make projects and teach yourself new technologies. Go to hackathons. You can find university hackathons here - https://mlh.io/ If you don't enjoy staying up for 24 hours developing awesome software, then yeah just teach yourself. You can easily google ""how to build a web scraper"". Also check out subreddits for project ideas. You can also join student groups at your school or ask your friends to work on a project with you. 
* Omg what should I learn? What languages and technologies? Which frameworks? If you really want a specific list, explore the occupations that you'd be interested in and usually they list out qualifications. They'll tell you what technologies, stacks, etc. to use. 
* You're a freshman but there are lots of freshman internship programs. Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Pinterest, and Facebook all have freshmen internship programs. Just google ""Google freshman internship"". Make sure to apply all of these and start looking starting in **September** or **October**. For big companies, the internship applications usually close up in **November** and for medium sized companies, they start in the spring and end in **March**. Get your shit together and apply, otherwise you're going to lose amazing opportunities. Don't be lazy. 
* Apply to as many internships as you can. Google ""software internship"" and tons of listings show up. Getting an internship is a numbers game. The more you apply to, the more likely you'll hear back. As a freshman aim to apply to 50-100 internships. 
* Use the resources at your school. Your school might have a career center that does resume review. Attend all the career fairs. Check out which companies are visiting your school and attend all the info sessions. Network, network, network. 
* Interview prep - look for resources on this subreddit, get Cracking the Coding Interview, and solve hackerrank coding problems. Also a lot of coding challenge interviews use hackerrank, so you'll get used to the interface of an interview when you practice on hackerrank.

I'm from the UK and looking at doing Birthright (age 19-21) either this summer or next summer and wanted to ask you guys a bit about it. Any answers would be really helpful as I haven't yet been able to find them from the relevant websites.

1) Am I a bit late applying for this summer or is it still likely I'll get a place?

2) Can I choose when in the summer I take the trip or is it allocated for me? If so, what is the window? (I'm hoping to do an internship as well and would prefer to take the trip either side of the internship.)

3) Is it clique-y? Is it likely I'll be able to easily make friends there and fit in? If I can find a friend to go with me, would that be preferable?

4) Is the tour group international? Or will everyone in my group be British? While I obviously have no problem with my fellow British Jews, I think it would be cool to meet people from around the world.

Also, there are a few organisers to choose from, so if anyone has been with IsraelExperts, Israel Outdoors or Israel Experience and would be able to share their thoughts about them or recommend one, that would be awesome! (With regards to politics and religion: I'm atheist but in touch with Jewish culture, so I have no problem with some level of religion but would prefer that wasn't the focus; I have no problem with the pro-Israel ideological bias or aliyah-pushing that many people seem to be concerned about.)"

I've finally had it with this life. I have to talk to my parents today, but I don't know if I can be honest about what's going on with me. I've tried so many times before, but it was easier to lie since my grades were still good. They also want me to be looking for jobs and internships, but I can't bring myself to do that either. I really want to tell them that I'm done with college when I talk to them today, but I know they'd just get angry, as they should. What do I say? Should I lie and tell them that my grades are fine and I've been applying for jobs? Should I tell them that I'm struggling a bit but not reveal the extent? Or should I tell them the truth, that I literally can't do this anymore, and no solution has worked? I just know they won't really understand and that scares me to death. I don't think they'd let me quit at this point since they've put so much money into my college education, and I'm already so close to finishing (aside from the fact that I won't pass my classes this semester, which they don't know yet). But the fact is, my loneliness, depression, and anxiety has swallowed my motivation and interests when it comes to school, work, or anything else in life. I have plans later tonight with a friend from out of town for the first time in awhile. I'm going to have to talk to my parents before we go out and I'm probably going to be a mess.

It was very nice of my parents to allow us to live here, but it's not a good environment for a relationship.


My BF and I have discussed moving in together multiple times, and it was understood that we’d move out of here - together - the moment it became financially possible to do so.


~3-4 months ago, he started talking about subletting an apartment by himself while I looked for a job. I was a little hurt, but I understood. His commute is 90 minutes minimum, beginning with me driving him to the bus every morning at 630AM, which would be enough to drive anyone insane. Plus, we've spent more than half of our relationship living in different places, and he always found the time to visit.


I got a job offer during his apartment search, and accepted it. The job is a bit farther from his school than my parent’s house is, but my salary’s enough to get an apartment at the halfway point between work and his school. I’m more than willing to double (or triple) my 20 minute commute if it means we can finally get out of my parents’ house together.


When I told him the good news, he gave me a subdued “congrats”, and told me that he’d just paid the deposit for a 2-3 month sublet in the city.


I asked if he could get out of the lease so we could move in together a bit faster, and he said he’d already paid for the first month, but should be able to get out of the rest.


Fast forward a few weeks; his move in was rapidly approaching, and I was admittedly very anxious about it, so I asked him to help me make a plan for the next few months.

We looked at a few places together, but he had reservations about all of them.

I asked him what was up, and, finally, he let me know that he needed to stay in the city longer. Up to 6 months. He felt like the long commute was strangling his social life, and needed to live in the city. Cutting it to an hour, or even 45 minutes, was not good enough.

He said I should look for an apartment for myself in the meantime — our current living situation is pretty toxic — and he’d visit often before we move into a different place together.

This plan makes absolutely no sense to me. I work in a suburban area where temporary housing is almost non-existent. Everything requires a 6 month to a year lease. Plus, how was he going to afford an apartment in a very expensive city with nothing but internship money? And if he needed to live in the city that badly, what would change in 6 months to make him come back?

I told him my concerns and asked him to make a plan with me. He insisted that his finances all worked out, and that he’d be able to pay his part when we move in together later this year, but didn’t give me any more of a plan than we already had. He also didn’t explain what would change after 5-6 months to make him suddenly be okay with the long commute.


He'd said we'd move in together ""September or October, maybe sooner"", but that doesn't really seem like a commitment, so I asked him if there was a month where we'd definitely be able to move in by. I explained that I needed a date I could count on.

He said he couldn’t guarantee anything.



I cannot bring myself to look at apartments for myself anymore. I break down every time I start now. I’ve spent hours looking, and everything near my workplace requires commitments so long that we’d be living separately well into next year.

Worse yet, if I get one of the inexpensive apartments right next to my workplace, he’d rarely be able to visit due to the shitty public transport.


The reason I write this is because I have no goddamn clue what to do. I'm not even sure if I'm just being crazy/clingy; he continues to act like this is no big deal, and is otherwise as loving as ever. Somehow this makes it hurt more.


There are other factors in the mix here, like both of us suffering from depression and mine generally being worse at home, but I feel like I've already made a wall of text here. Thanks to anyone who read this.



tl;dr --

Boyfriend and I agreed that were going to move in together the moment it became financially possible, and I recently got a well paying job. His commute is killing him, so he wants to move to the city until ~October, but refuses to make a real plan to move in together after that ends.

It seems like all of my options fucking suck."
4e738e,11,2016-04-10,House Sitting,awkwardmeghan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4e738e/house_sitting/,"Ever since I started as an intern at my current job, I have done a good amount of house sitting for several of my coworkers.  A few qualities make me an ideal house sitter:  1)  as an unpaid intern, I desperately need the money  2)  I am in my early twenties and single with no pets, so little household responsibilities of my own, and 3)  I am fairly responsible for my age and a bit of a hermit, so need to worry about having strangers over for a party in someone’s house while they are away.  

Recently I was house sitting for a coworker for 10 days, 10 nights while she and her husband took their two young daughters to Washington to visit family.  Their house is located in a more rural subdivision where houses are on an acre or more of property, so each house has plenty of privacy.  During my stay there I was only responsible for taking care of two low maintenance cats and a very elderly golden retriever, Ripley.  She’s such a sweet dog, but is almost completely deaf, has cataracts in both eyes, and has some hip problems, which means she spends almost all of her time laying down and sleeping.  

Normally I’m always a little apprehensive the first night I stay in someone else’s house.  It takes time getting used to a new location, new routine, new bed, new noises of the house settling at night.  I was exhausted my first night at this house after a long shift and oddly enough fell asleep without any problems.  The next day I came back to the house after work, parked my car in the garage, and entered the house through the garage door which opens into the kitchen.  From this door you can either walk left directly into the kitchen or go straight down the stairs that lead into the basement.  It always gave me an uneasy feeling to shut the door to the garage behind me and look straight down the stairs into the dark hallway of the basement.  There is also a bank of light switches to the right of this door for the kitchen, garage, and basement.  However the wiring in the house is a bit odd, so it never made any logical sense which switch belonged to which light.  I would often end up flipping two or three switches before finding the correct one I was looking for.    

That same night I fed the cats, gently shook Ripley awake to feed her, and watched Netflix on the couch.  The cats went outside and the dog slept in the same spot on the carpet in the living room where she had been seemingly 90% of the time since I’d been there.  Like I said, Ripley was sweet but she only ever got up to eat or go to the bathroom outside.  Around 10 I decided it was time to go to bed, so I walked around the house, making sure the doors were locked and heading to the kitchen to turn off the lights before I headed to the other side of the house to the room I was sleeping in.  When I went to turn off the kitchen light switch next to the door, I mistakenly turned on the light inside the garage.  I glanced through the window in the door leading into the garage as I flipped the switch off and froze:  there had been someone sitting in the passenger seat of my car.  My breath hitched and I felt a painful rush of adrenaline in my toes as I flipped the switch back on.  There was no one there.  Just my car and the gentle swinging of the bare bulb that lit the garage.

The next few nights were uneventful, but I dreaded each night when I would have to turn off the kitchen light, making sure not to accidentally touch the switch to the garage.  My fourth night there I made the same mistake.  This time, although my car was empty, there was the figure of a man just at the  base of the stairs into the garage.  I screamed, turned to grab the phone, but when I turned back he was gone.  I called my friend, Brian, to help calm me down, and he convinced me it had just been a shadow, and my paranoia was getting the best of me. 
As I was shutting down the house the next night I made sure, again, not to touch the switch for the garage light.  As I turned to head for the bedroom I realized I had mistakenly turned on the switch for the basement hallway.  I peered down the stairs in horror as I noticed the same figure at the base of the hallway.  I grabbed my phone and ran out of the house, begging Brian on the phone to walk through the house with me and make sure no one else was actually there.  Brian stayed that night on the couch and there was no sign that anyone else was or had been with us.  

My ninth night in the house I made Brian stay on the phone with me while I turned off the lights in the kitchen.  Once I was finally convinced it was safe, I ended the call and headed down the hallway to the bedroom.  I stopped walking when I noticed Ripley was standing, facing me in the hallway.  Her cloudy eyes were focused past me as she started barking.  I hadn’t heard her bark once since I’d been there.

I never made it to my tenth night in that house.

I am currently looking for a more permanent position in another country, and I am hoping that I can leverage the experience of the last few months.

However, I still feel that I have a weak CV, with respect to my choice of words in describing my experience which I have never been good at.

I would also like to ask the professionals here if the location (City,Country) that I gained the respective experience is an important/necessary element.

I am especially looking for criticisms from people in the financial industry, and how I can improve my CV to fit the industry better.

4e7yb8,11,2016-04-10,I'm [23 F] am in a relationship with a manchild [27 M]. We've been together for over three years. I'm tired of being his maid.,marriedtopeterpan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4e7yb8/im_23_f_am_in_a_relationship_with_a_manchild_27_m/,"**tl;dr**: My boyfriend of three years is messy, doesn't help with the cleaning, and relies on me for all household management. How can I fix this?

Every solution to our problems is thwarted by his inability to make good with his half. We were having trouble getting our money together to pay rent every month (we have the money. It's just a matter of making sure one of us gets it into our account so we can write a check). He says he can't get direct deposit from work so that some of his paycheck can make it into the account. So I ended up having to deposit $500 into our account a few weeks back so that we could pay rent (that's in addition to the money that I put in so we could pay our rent and other bills).
He doesn't clean. Not even after himself. I work a full time job. I come home from work and cook dinner every night. I have to beg him to wash the dishes. And when he does wash the dishes, I still have to make sure that the floor is swept, the leftovers made it into the appropriate containers (because if he can't figure it out, he won't clean the dish. He will leave it on the stove so I can take care of it). He won't vacuum, won't mop. His side of the room is knee deep in clothes. His clothes are also strewn throughout the living room (he comes home from work and strips down into a t-shirt and boxer in the living room and leaves his clothes wherever they land when his disrobes). I'm doing his laundry right now.
I clean because I want a clean house. If I refused to clean, he still wouldn't do it (I tried that. I left for an internship out of state and our friends sent us a picture of our apartment. It was knee deep in trash and looked like a literal disaster zone).

He can't remember where he keeps important pieces of paper, like his tax forms, bank statements and bills (I don't move these items. He places them on a surface and just can't remember where he placed them. He asks me and gets angry with me if I can't remember where he placed them).

I plan all meals. I cook all meals. I do all the cleaning. I clean up after him. He had a surprise day off work in the middle of the week last week. The night before his day off, I asked him if he could do the floors (sweep, mop vacuum) since I wiped all surfaces, picked up the items on the floor, straightened the apartment, cleaned the kitchen and bathroom, etc. When I got home, he had not done the floors. A fight ensued. He accused me of trying to sabotage his day off since he got one and I didn't. I still cooked dinner that night.
He has a longer commute than me, which is why I am happy to cook dinner. I am not ok with being his maid. I hate cleaning, but I do it because having a clean place to live is important.

Every time I try to talk to him about this, about how I feel like I am constantly cleaning and worrying about getting the rent in on time and folding laundry, etc, he always answers in a passive aggressive way to show how much of a hardship it would be to him. He will say something like ""I'll guess I'll come home from a long day of work and when I'm really and really exhausted and about to pass out from exhaustion, I'll clean up from dinner. But it'll be for you because I don't care if our apartment is clean or not."" Every argument centers around the fact that it's only important to me, so he either he shouldn't bother or that I should worship him if he does do it. 

I mostly just needed to vent. What do I do? Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm at a loss, but I do know that I can't spend the rest of my life being angry at him for not contributing to the household more. I cannot spend the rest of my life being someone's unpaid maid.

Admiral Masahei Togo: Is it time?

Radio Officer: The Message says ""You are ordered to destroy the Russian fleet at Vladivostok, for the protection of our nation and allies around the world""

In the meanwhile, Japanese and US forces link up around the middle of the Sea of Japan. Fighter pilots prepare their HARM and ASM-3 Missiles, both on the Nagato and on air bases across mainland Japan. Tomahawk Missiles have their coordinates preloaded to hit SAM sites and Pacific Fleet Headquarters. In all this commotion, Admiral Togo is surprisingly calm and determined. His family has been through this before. He can carry out their legacy by doing what was done before: a devastating naval attack on a long time foe. 

As preparations are finished, Admiral Togo gives the order to raise the [Z flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_flag). On speakers aboard all ships within the fleet, a Message is heard:

""The fate of Japan rests on the outcome of this battle. Let each crew member do their utmost""

He sends a message to the JMSDF headquarters saying: 

""In response to the warning that enemy ships have been sighted by satellite, the Combined Fleet will immediately commence action and attempt to attack and destroy them. Weather today fine but high waves.

With this signal, jets are launched from both US and Japanese Carriers, and Tomahawk missiles head toward their targets. Fighters have already been launched from Japanese Mainland bases, and head to link up with the fleet.

The Second Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan is about to begin (The first battle is known in English as the Battle of Tsushima).

The ships with VLS systems, namely the AEGIS destroyers and Hayanami Class, will launch Tomahawk missiles at the air defense sites and Command centers of Vladivostok. Once they are hit, fighter jets launched from carriers, and aircraft from Mainland Japan will launch HARM missiles at remaining SAM missile sites. Ships without the capacity to carry Tomahawk missiles or other long range cruise missiles will be defending the fleet from submarines, surface vessels, aircraft, and missiles. SH-60 aircraft will engage in ASW operations forming a perimeter around the fleet, while minesweeping aircraft will ensure there are no such threats to the fleet. As air defense sites are being destroyed, the remaining fighters will drop LJDAM munitions and Anti Ship missiles at ships to destroy them.

Meanwhile at Russian Foreign Ministry, 1 minute before the first Tomahawk reaches Vladivostok:

Russian Intern: Sir, we have received a fax from the Government of Japan

Foreign Minister Lasin Kamov: What is it? I'm busy dealing with our Great Patriotic War to Liberate Oppressed Russian Territory

Intern: The message says: ""The Joint Houses of the National Diet, seeing that the Russian government has invaded our allies in the west and viciously murdered the troops and civilians of the Baltic states, Poland, and Ukraine, has no choice but to declare our ceasefire since 1945 is dissolved, and that the Prime Minister of Japan is authorized to use all naval, air, and ground forces necessary to terminate this conflict that Russia has entered with our allies. 

Kamov: What are the Japanese going to do? Our fleets are safe in Vladivostok, and they wouldn't dare to attack such a well defended fortress. They're a bunch of yellow cowards.

Minutes Later:

Intern 2: Sir! There are reports of explosions at our headquarters in Vladivostok!!

Kamov: Is that so? Find me the terrorist that is responsible and kill him.

Intern 2: Early reports claim they do not look like terror attacks, but cruise missiles coming from the East!

Kamov: ....

Kamov: It looks like the Americans are bolder than I thought. Our glorious worker's navy can still defeat their shiny weapons. Mark my words.

As he says this, a feeling of worry and anxiety is seen throughout the office. What has President Petrovich brought upon us? Everyday, the wrath of NATO and it's allies only seems to grow stronger. Everyday, more and more enemy forces become committed to the fight. Can the Russian nation and people survive through these times? 

**During the attack, a message by Prime Minister Haruko is delivered to the people by NHK:**

After the Russian attacks on our allies in Europe, Japan has been pressured to enter the war and defend our nation, our allies, and our very way of life. I will not claim this will be an easy and bloodless war, as that is a lie. But our Nation must stand strong against the tyrannical forces of Russia, and help our democratic allies if democracy is to survive in Japan itself. It has been a hard decision entering the war and risking the lives of many brave men and women in our Self Defense Forces, but it is a sacrifice that must be made for the greater good of the world. Our brothers and sisters in Eastern Europe, who had gone from being under decades of Soviet oppression to being prosperous democratic nations, are once again under threat of oppression by a tyrannical state. No democracy with the capacity to help rescue these people can sit back and watch. We must stand with these nations, these people, and this way of life, otherwise we are no better than being Russian collaborators. As I speak, our forces have been dedicated to eliminate the threat to peace in Asia, and give assistance to allied forces around the world.

Long live Japan, its people, and Democracy!

4e8v1h,4,2016-04-10,"If I do an internship in web development, will I be stuck doing web development for my whole career? How would one transition from area of the field to another?",dy_over_dsex,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e8v1h/if_i_do_an_internship_in_web_development_will_i/,"I've accepted a summer internship at [non-Big 4, southwestern company]. I'm really excited for it because I will getting paid to code which is really where I want to be, but I'm concerned that I might not be ""as happy"" in web development.

Notably, the internship is explicitly for frontend - not even full-stack stuff. They have some interesting stuff going on with Backbone and React, so it won't just be vanilla JavaScript (which is nice), but the interview involved a fair bit of CSS questions. I know CSS stuff, but I just find it **incredibly, incredibly boring.** Honestly, I don't get as excited about problems that are sort of ""design-based."" I find much more joy in the problem-solving that comes from ""ooh, how do we represent this data? How do we transport it from A to B? Ooh, what algorithms do we need to use here?""

My favorite language is Java, but I've been having a lot of fun doing my undergraduate research in Haskell (I'm well aware that the job market in Haskell is VERY small). I think currently I'd really like to be working either on enterprise software (that might be - but doesn't have to be - web-facing) or stuff on the backend (I've been learning some NodeJS in my free time, and it's really exciting to me, too). I know C decently enough (haven't touched C++ outside of helping fraternity brothers who use it for their freshman programming classes or aerospace engineering coursework, though), but I don't feel like I'd enjoy embedded much. Mobile is interesting from afar but I'll see how I feel about it after my capstone project next fall semester (which at my university is to build an Android app).

---
---

Ultimately, my worry is this: I take this internship doing mostly/entirely HTML/CSS/JavaScript; maybe I even go work there for a while after graduating - but then, any time I apply for a job as a ""software developer"" or ""software engineer"" with other technologies, I'll be instantly rejected on the basis of a lack of experience, and my career won't be as satisfying.

Are my worries unfounded? Has anyone here made the switch from webdev to other stuff?"
4e8vz4,128,2016-04-10,"Never Go Full Retard: writer for Vox demands Swedish style high taxes because ""High taxes give me more choices and freedoms""",PaperbackWriter66,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/4e8vz4/never_go_full_retard_writer_for_vox_demands/,"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/8/11380356/swedish-taxes-love

The author has 6 points in the article, 5 of which are basically fantastic arguments in favor of drastically reforming the American tax system on libertarian lines. The author speaks approvingly of Sweden's sales taxes, he approves of a 4 page long pre-filled out tax form, the author approves of a 'conservative' Swedish government **abolishing property taxes**, the author approves of lower marginal rates on income, and fewer tax deductions.

And yet, after this extended paean to what sounds like a fairly libertarian tax system (emphasizing simplicity and taxes on consumption over production, with *no* taxes on property), he then turns abruptly into a blithering idiot demanding higher taxes.....*because*....reasons. Basically, it is a very strange article divided into two cognitively dissonant halves; the first half praising the Swedish tax system that Ted ""Abolish the IRS"" Cruz would probably call too radically conservative, and yet then shoehorns-in the argument out of nowhere that higher taxes are more moral than lower taxes because the State can allegedly spend that money 'better' than can the people who earned it. 

I mean, it's the standard pitfall of the Statist who acknowledges only the visible benefits of the system he prefers and the visible shortcomings of the system he opposes, while ignoring the hidden/unseen costs of his preferred system and the hidden failings and hidden blessings of the system he opposes. He blames things he dislikes about the US on ""low taxes"" and exhorts things he likes about Europe as the product of high taxes. 

For example, he condemns the lack of public transport in the United States' as the result of ""low taxes"". 

&gt;Another casualty? Our public transportation system. Betty and I used to live the village of Lodi, about 25 miles from Madison. This being America, I was free to travel to Madison however and whenever I wanted, as long as it was by private automobile. There was (and is) no bus service to Madison. Even though railroad tracks run right through the village, there is no commuter rail service either.

He is choosing to ignore the fact that Americans *prefer* owning and operating their own automobile to public transport; this is not the result of ""low taxes"", it's the result of individuals making choices and choosing an automobile-centric lifestyle over a lifestyle dependent on public transport. The author also ignores the reality that populations in the US are generally a lot more spread out and less dense than they are in Europe, making public transport impractical and inefficient and more costly, something that taxes, high or low, cannot readily remedy. He also ignores the reality that politicians in most of America have for decades tried to force Americans to use public transport/bicycles and have spent God-knows how many billions on expensive public-transit projects and yet Americans continue to prefer using cars over public transport *despite the efforts of politicians* to make the costs of car ownership too onerous and inconvenient. But rather than saying we should lower the costs of car ownership by repealing gas taxes, licensing/registration fees, road taxes, insurance taxes, et. al. so that more and more people can enjoy the independence of owning an automobile, he instead demands ""higher taxes"" to fund public transport in the US, even though Americans have repeatedly expressed their preference for automobiles. 

And fucking hell, he's ignoring **his own goddamned choices in life**! He *chose* to live in a village with no goddamned public transport; if he wanted to be able to use public transport, why didn't he obtain a dwelling near a public transport system? Rather than demanding other people pay for something he wants (a commuter train or bus service), why doesn't he just fucking move to a house near a bus station?

The worst thing is that he justifies this *in the name of freedom*! 

&gt;If we value freedom, those of us who drive cars should pay higher gas taxes so that those who are old, infirm, too poor to have a car, or want to reduce their environmental impact can have fast and efficient bus and train service

It is an achievement in DoubleThink that would make Orwell proud. I mean, if you want to be free to keep the money you earn and spend it on things you think would improve your life, **fuck you**! The State is going to take half your income and spend it on things you may or may not want or need! Because *freedom*! *No*, the State isn't ""limiting your freedom"", it's giving you more choices, by letting you choose between a train and walking to work! Would you rather drive a car to work? Well, too fucking bad, because the money you would have used to buy a car has been confiscated by the State and spent on a commuter train! Do you live near your place of work and don't need any kind of transport system at all? Would you rather invest your money or spend on something you would actually use and enjoy? Too fucking bad, your choices have already been expanded!  

The author completely ignores the unseen cost exacted on people who aren't going to use these ""public goods"" and could have spent their money better for themselves if the govt. had let them keep it.

&gt;Besides the moral issue of providing freedom of choice, [by limiting the choices people can make with their own money?] there is a great economic value. If we had bus and train service to Madison, the value of all of the real estate in Lodi would shoot up, and our crumbling downtown would have a shot at a future.

And yet, your downtown would only have a shot at the future by stealing money from other people and depriving them of *their* future. That guy working at the auto-body repair shop who wanted to start his own shop someday never will, because the money from his wages that he would have used to start his own business have been confiscated in taxes and spent on a bus. Those college graduates who want to start a tech company with the money they earned in summer internships? The State took that money and spent it giving them a ""free"" education. And so on; this is Bastiat's Broken Window Fallacy writ large. 

He also completely conflates the idea of having *better, more efficient* government services and high taxes. He seems to think that only with high taxes (and high spending, presumably) can we have the nice things the Swedes have, like accessible national parks and better health care, and yet one look at our public schools would show you that more money =/= better service inherently. If you want better national parks, privatize them! 

He also completely ignores the reason why the US tax system is the Byznatine, multi--headed Hydra it is today (because, basically, high taxes incentivized the rich/powerful to subvert the tax system and were enabled by politicians engaging in social engineering and soft corruption). High taxes with or without tax reform will only make things worse. "

* 

Cons

*  The pay is less(- $3) than current job
* I will have to stay at school during the summer. I wanted to spend a lot more times with friends over summer as I feel I've been neglecting them. Side-cons of this are buying/preparing my own meals.

A lot of people minor in something that only takes a few extra classes, like math or computer engineering, but I didn't want to do that.

Im taking all the same Computer Science courses as a person doing the BS would, so I don't think my computer science foundation will be hurt at all, but I am starting to wonder if when employers see that I only took Calc I &amp; Stats in college, it will raise some type of red flag? Specifically, I was talking to someone in the field who was going to try to get me an interview for an internship next year and he said he looks for how students did in Calc III.. I didn't say anything, but whats weird is he hires from my college all the time but the BS students don't have to take Calc III so I don't know where thats coming from.

I live in the MidWest, low cost of living, and a dream job to me would be making at least $50,000/year out of college. Im not exactly chasing the big four."
4e989w,2,2016-04-11,Me [19/F] and my boyfriend [19/M] had a serious talk and he said something super hurtful. Should I be upset? And now I'm so sad/hurt and confused on what to do from this point forward,Pancake189,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4e989w/me_19f_and_my_boyfriend_19m_had_a_serious_talk/,"WARNING! I understand this is long! I ramble on a bit about the back story and leading up to what actually happened, but you can just skip down to the dashed lines if you don't want to read it all.
For a little background information: My Boyfriend (Gerald) and I (Cammie) have been dating for a little over 7 months. We met before coming to college random, ended up finding out we were going to the same college in the fall, and the rest is history. We're very different on the surface as far as interests, I love music and politics while he's more of a video game dude (and I soo am not a video game girl). Sometimes our interests difference make things difficult, but usually we try each others stuff, and find stuff we enjoy doing together. Of course we're not identical on the fundamental views, but overall I would say we are similar on that level too. We both have small issues, like I tend to want dramatic gestures while he has a hard time communicating when he's upset, but we overall do a great job of communicating. He does like to drink a fair amount, while a really hate drinking. This causes a bit of a rift for the only reason that he feels like I want to drink around my friends just not him.

Also, we used to have sex tons, but recently we haven't for several reasons. One day about a month ago I brought up that since we hadn't had sex much recently it no longer felt like a safe place, and comfortable to have sex and I felt like I literally didn't know how to have sex anymore (the fear of not being good enough at sex, yanno). This just made things more awkward and didn't solve anything.

It really started with spring break. We went to padre with his best friend (Josh) and his girlfriend (Sarah). The 3 of them have known each other for 2 years, so they are all pretty good friends. I on the other hand just got introduced into their friend dynamic a few months ago. That in itself is awkward for me, because I felt like I was 3rd wheeling on the 3 of them. I also wanted his best friend to like me (obviously) so I had that self-induced pressure. Sarah, while we're very different, she is very sweet and we get along fine. Josh on the other hand is honestly a bit of a dick. We have very different personalities and humor and he has hurt my feelings a few times in the past. He's not a bad guy or anything, but my boyfriend, Josh and I once sat down (a few months ago) and talked about how he hurt my feelings sometimes. That didn't really change anything at all honestly. I personally feel like I try really hard to be nice to Josh and joke around with him, but he doesn't and sometimes just comes off hurtful.

All this being said, spring break was a bit difficult. It was pretty good for the first few days! We had fun, it was a little bit weird when we drank and I didn't totally want to the whole time, and Josh said some hurtful sarcastic remarks, but overall it was good. The day before we left though I was really upset, basically all day. Several factors contributed such as a really bad sunburn, feeling awkward around Josh, I wanted to get a souvenir but felt like I couldn't speak up and have us stay longer at the store because it wasn't my place, my boyfriend knowing I was upset and not asking or anything, and probably other stuff. Me feeling like this intern made everything else a bit worse and awkward. Then the ride home the next day I could tell my boyfriend was acting really weird. My birthday was in 2 days, and I'm the type of person who is upset until they talk about it, so I wanted to talk about how I was upset the last day and how I was bothered that my boyfriend didn't care as soon as we got back that night because I was leaving to go to my hometown soon after.

-------------THE REAL GOOD PART (AKA: WHAT I POSTED THIS FOR)-------------
Well, that talk opened a whole can of whoop ass. I approached my boyfriend telling him that I was upset and turns out he was really upset as well (I can't always tell because he has a hard time expressing when he's upset like I mentioned earlier). It honestly felt kinda like a break up talk. He thought part of the awkwardness between me and Josh and Sarah was my fault. I agreed that it was because sometimes I did purposely exclude myself because I felt weird. He said the reason why he didn't ask why I was upset the last day was because whenever he does, I don't tell him. This is partly true, I usually require some effort to get why I'm upset, but I've told him before to pull my teeth until I tell him whats wrong. There were some other minor things that were bothersome that we talked about but eventually we sat down and talked about our relationship, if we want to be together, and how to fix things.
So I asked him if he wanted to be with me and he said yes. I then suggested we say what we need the other to work on, that we get upset about, so we can improve our relationship. He had 3 main issues.

Some times I'm really mean. Apparently on the trip sometimes I was just really mean to him, and Josh and Sarah noticed too. Although I don't totally remember specific times, I do have a tendency to sometimes say harsh jokes that don't come off right. I also felt awkward/uncomfortable and sad so I probably lashed out sometimes. I super apologized and said I would work on it, and I have.

Sometimes he feels like he has to walk on egg shells around me. He feels that I have unrealistic, unsaid expectations and if he doesn't exactly meet them I will be upset. This does happen sometimes, though I didn't realize that he thought it was so often. I said I would try to communicate more when I expected/hoped for something and he said he could communicate more when he felt like I was upset about an unmet expectation.

Over the past two weeks I've been working on these 2 things and it's been really good. But here is the kicker.
3. His 3rd major issue with our relationship was how I look and our sex life. He said he's ""not physically attracted to me"", that I ""dress like a mom"", that I've ""changed (meaning put on weight) since school started and needs to go work out"". Also, regarding our sex life, that I ""don't ever instigate it"", I don't ""give him random blowjobs"", I am ""not good on top"", and he's not ""sexually attracted to me"". I asked why we had so much sex at first but not now and he said it's because he's grown to not like our sex life the more we've had sex lol.

All this literally felt like a knife. I have never felt more insecure and upset about my body and my sex ability has he made me feel. I know he didn't mean it mean or malicious, and I can see how someone would think some of that stuff and some of that is valid, but I struggle with so many questions now.

How is the way I look one of the top 3 issues he has about our relationship? How could we ever say those things to me? I really haven't gained but 10ish pounds? I know I'm not skinny, but I am not obese at all. I am 5'4, 160 pounds with good curves and a pretty good ass. I think my boyfriend is supposed to make me feel beautiful, secure, and confident and he took away what positive body feelings away (at least while I'm around him). I don't want to even change shirts in front of him. I've cried several times about it because I feel so shitty. He is by no means a fitness God, he has a belly and not the hottest, most well dressed, attractive guy so I feel like it's hypocritical. But mostly it just hurts to think about it and feel the way I do. I feel like every song that mentions beauty on his playlist for me is a lie and every time he mentions how I look that it's a lie or pity compliment. I also get so uncomfortable now when he mentions looks.


He has gone back and said that he shouldn't have said all of that like he did. He mostly means that he just feels like I never try to look pretty for him and he's just sometimes not physically attracted to me. He does have a problem with my weight though. Now I'm confused and don't know what to do. On one hand I want to dumb his ass, get really hot, and shove it in his face. On the other, I do love him and want to be with him, but those words keep repeating in my mind.


SOOO... What should I do? What that okay for him to say all that to me/or even think all that? Should I change myself for him? If we stay together, how do I get over my new found insecurities around him? How can he make this better? And probably tons of other questions I can't think about this second.

TL;DR**** Boyfriend said I'm not physically attractive, I need to loose weigh, and our sex life isn't good. I'm so hurt, what do I do?

Numbers like 90k, 100k, and even 110k were thrown around as if they were the norm rather than the exception.

Could I really expect to make this much with a CS degree? I'm trying to figure out what my degree will be worth. I'm 21, and will be going into my final year of college next year. My GPA is around 3.55 - not amazing, but respectable (I worry that my one D and one F will still make it look bad...). I had an internship last summer - nothing spectacular, just average - and might not get one this summer. And despite my GPA, I still feel like most of my classmates are more knowledgeable than me - programming seems to be a hobby for many of them, whereas I only do assignments required by classes and internships, in general.

I seem like the average CS graduate, so I'm not sure why I should expect to make more than 60k a year. Why does everybody say I can make so much more?"

I have a bad habit of putting off small tasks until they become real problems. I think about them all the time and let them stress me out. Small things like cleaning the house, doing laundry, checking the mailbox, or more important tasks like meeting deadlines for simple documents. I'm constantly worried about them snowballing out of control, but I never end up doing anything about them. I just end up trying not to think about them and focus myself on something else.

A few years back I failed my first year of college because I couldn't force myself to get out of bed, or do the assignments, and eventually just gave up. I'm going strong in school now, but I feel like I'm starting to slip up again. I tried talking to some of my friends about it a while ago, but their only advice was to see a doctor.. which is really terrifying. My dad's a psychiatrist, and I live at home in a small town. I don't feel like there's a way to talk to anyone without having to confront him about it. I know it's a stupid fear but I feel like once I start a process like that I'm going to be labeled as broken. I don't want to use something like depression or anxiety or anything else as an easy way out from dealing with my responsibilities.

I've been living on my own the past couple of months for an internship. I find I end up having to throw out a lot of food because I won't bother to cook for myself. I still eat lunch when I'm at work and usually grab something small for breakfast, but lately I've been putting off going to the grocery store altogether and skipping supper. Yesterday I was at a party and some of my friends told me that I've lost a lot of weight. In December I was a bit overweight, but I probably shouldn't lose any more weight now. 

I'm conscious that I might have a problem but at the same time I just don't want to acknowledge it. I just wish everything would go away."
4e9lur,2,2016-04-11,Choosing between 2 Summer Internships,21cinemaclub,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4e9lur/choosing_between_2_summer_internships/,"Hello everyone,

I'm having a hard time choosing between two summer Software Engineering Internships. I have until end of day on Tuesday (4/12) to make a decision. Here's the breakdown:

First, both companies pay the same and rent in both cities are roughly the same. So the financial component of this decision has been completely removed (thankfully)

Company A:
The company has hired 6 interns to work on an intern project together and present to leadership as the conclusion of the internship. As a group, we'll have access to a few mentors. The tech stack is .NET and React/other JS frameworks. Company based in my hometown.

Company B:
I've been paired up with a Lead Software Engineer who I'll be reporting to. The stack is PHP/Javascript and maybe some Java. Based out of state for me. 

For background, I graduate next year with a B.S. in Math and am looking to make a career as a Software Engineer.

So I'm most concerned about which internship will help  most in that..am I overthinking it? At the end of the day, does it matter because either way I'll be working on a development team?

Also, should the stack each company uses be a factor? I ask because I know .NET is everywhere with Enterprises and I rarely see PHP on job applications.

Any advice/insight/anything else anyone can share will be so greatly appreciated! 

Thanks!"

We have separate rooms and share kitchen,entr, and bathroom.

..

 I have a slightly sketchy roommate. She is very cunning and I worry - machivellian. 

..


BIackground: I have lived here for two years for an apartment renter who lives in a garden shed. Without contract. She moved herr 6 months ago. Recently, things have been kind of hell-ish in the terms that we have avoided each other like mice. When she moved in we both had girl-/boyfriend. Broke up 4 months ago.I have made it my point to not hit on her even though we are both kinda hot. This opinion was even backed by reddit. Now, she have been casually lying. She said she cleans when she obviously don't. She only briefly swipes the floor before guests arrive to make it appear that she cleaned - the odor in the cleaning products. She also nags me on cleaning the toilet even though I have never seen her do it. She also stole the cleaning gloves she had bought and added to our common cleaning expenses list that we split monthly. I confronted her and she gave it ""back"". She is a princess in her family of three brothers and she studies social pedagogy. her parents seemed upper middle class normal but very scary in terms of social influence. 

She is the first girl of four flatmates I have lived with. This is the first time I moved from home, and I am 25 yrs, trying to reinvent my career. 

.



It doesnt seem normal for a boy and a girl to live together without being couples. I have no control over what she tells her parents or social circle. But I do thinn she has heatd me madturbate in my room or loudly waking myself up by saying ""No"" as a part of a social trauma I have from realizing that my mother is dead and my family only tolerates me. I have no real friends and only a suspiscious dad and even more cunning sister.  I am moving home for a month. I hope that my roommate doesn't try to accuse me of harassment or rape or whatever that can damage my reputation. I have tried to be really nice to her even though she crossed some territorial lines.

.

Things that might stir are:

.

- I have casually walked from the kitchen to my room just as she exited the bathroom dressed only in a towel, swiftly going to her room. I didn't really see her totally naked and wasnt trying to stare her down, just a bit surprised to see her at all like that since shes a lot more christian than me in culture.

.

- When she was going on an internship I didn't have time to meet the girl (with whom she had arranged to live the temporarily with furniture) at the time my roomate specified. She didn't ask me beforehamd ehen I would be available. This means that my roommate canceled because she realized she  had too much stuff to move and I havent met the girl. I contemplate whether she tried to extract more money from her parents like that - like a true princess. Kind of like when my sister intentionally ""uses all her money"" and then begs my father for more. My roommate or her ex very likely also stole my camera, but because my memory on this is blurry  and because its a serious accusement,I haven't blamed anyone.

.

What can I do to prevent any harm done?"
4e9tau,9,2016-04-11,New to Sub - Not sure if my mom is borderline,throwaway85289,raisedbyborderlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/4e9tau/new_to_sub_not_sure_if_my_mom_is_borderline/,"Hello everyone,



It's very cool that a sub like this exists, because this is not something I want to talk to my friends about, as I really don't want to spread rumors about my mom's metal health.  The other day I stumbled upon the Psychology Today site which I'm sure everyone is very familiar with.   A bunch of things I read there struck very true to me.  I have hardly done any research on BPD's, so please forgive my ignorance while I write. 



Some background: I am an only child, and a senior in college.  I am certainly not without my flaws.  I'm not a model son, but I also like to believe that I am a genuinely good person, and I think my friends would agree with that statement.  I have a 3.0 GPA and haven't done anything to really shame my parents (other than dropping out for a semester because I hated my major, but now I'm in one that I really like).  



My mother is in her mid 50's now and still married to my father.  I would say if my mom does have a BPD, it would be a Queen case.  Some of the posts here make me feel like she's a saint, although I'm sure BPDs come with varying severity.  She severed ties with her mom when I was 8 who passed away a couple years ago.  That entire half of the family disowned her as a result, trying to become best friends with my grandma to get her inheritance.  My mom has been through a lot emotionally with her mom and family.  I wouldn't be surprised if her mom had a BPD either.  



The good:  My mom had no problem sending me to college (of course she was sad though).  She doesn't have a problem with me taking an internship outside of my hometown if it is a better one than I can get at home.  She has always been loving and supportive of me, even if it's in her own way.  



The bad: I've always sort of felt like my mom was extremely controlling.  It was something that I started noticing in 8th or 9th grade.  She was always very overprotective, although that has mostly worn off now.  I would still consider her more overprotective than my friends moms, but that isn't really an issue. I still find her very controlling.  I have always had to ""ask"" to leave the house or do something with my friends.  She is always holding something over my head so that I comply with her wants.   



I feel that whenever we get into power struggles (pretty much just me wanting control over my life) that we have pretty vile arguments.  I just sit there and take it, because I just want it to be over.  She dishes things out from the past (up to 8 years ago) and basically makes me feel like shit.  I always feel like shit when I'm done with an argument with her.  I always feel like I'm the bad guy.  The problem is, that I started to develop what I think is a protective mechanism.  I just admit to whatever she said I did, and I just accept whatever she says about me as a person.  It makes me feel even worse, because I feel that I haven’t stayed true to myself.   It’s not just limited to me, my dad has similar arguments with her.  She has said some pretty horrible things to him too.   



•	Nothing is ever her fault/she’s always the victim

•	She loves attention and can never stop talking

•	She makes things that are insignificant about her.  Only one of many examples: She will say “why did you not answer my text message for a day?” Then, she will call my phone 6 times in a row and disconnect the service.  That has happened probably 5 times since I went to college.  I bought my own phone plan in the past week because it happened again (I am 22). 

•	She always talks about her past and her ex boyfriends.
 
•	My friends would never no how crazy she is

•	Everything that I do to “disrespect her” is always followed by a punishment.

•	She has very low self esteem

•	She can warp what I thought was normal behavior into making me feel like I was wrong.
 
•	She told my dad that I forgot he was visiting me at school.  Why in the world would she do that?  I love my dad very much and, it had to hurt his feelings that I forgot. 
  
•	To be honest, I really think that some of the stuff she has said to me and my dad boarders on bullying.  As a result, I shut down when she starts to yell at me.  I have started to think that I am never to blame, even when I might be.  This is not a good trait to possess, and I hope I don't do it in other situations. 

•	She has told me that when someone wrongs her too many times that she wants to abandon them, because that makes her feel better than working through it.  (definitely what happened with her and her mom)

•	I always feel guilty

•	I always feel like I'm not meeting her expectations

•	She never forgets anything that you've done to ""wrong"" her

•	Although I do sometimes get complements on my successes, I feel like I will never be able to reach her expectations.

•	She has told me that I lie all the time, and that I need to seek help and get to the bottom of it.  I do lie, and its just to avoid the wrath of my mother.  I don’t do it to anyone else other than my dad, because everything that I would share with him would get to my mom. 
 
•	She recently told me that she had been suicidal twice while I was growing up.  (I never knew this.) 




I finally stood up for myself last year and didn't go home for spring break.  I ended up going home for one day so that my parents and I could talk.  I told them that I wasn’t going to take any more punishments, or I was going to move out.  I think that if they didn't own my car and pay for my college, I would have left.  The crazy thing is, it helped a ton over the summer.  I was given more freedom.  I didn't have to always ask to leave the house.  There was more mutual respect.  



This happened last week:  We had a massive argument.  Of course, I am partly to blame.  What I did wasn't kind or polite and I could see why she was upset.  After I cooled down, I thought by calling her and apologizing we could get over the hump.  I apologized for things I knew I did wrong and some things that I didn't even think really deserved an apology (she had a list that dated back 8 years).   But then this happened:



A text in response to me saying that I wanted to be left alone about my E-cigarette use: 



Me: If I didn’t critique her on her health choices, why should she do the same to me (I did not mention weight).



Her: ""You have had more of a problem w ur weight and being in shape than I had by ur age. I also could kick ass in college back in those days. U have done fine. U have the potential and brains and all the qualities to perform at a great level yet u r partially slacker. Certainly far from getting any true positive recognition for urself. I was DEFINITELY more IMPRESSIVE than u at ur age. Man up and start kicking some ass. Unless u r very fortune r u setting urself up to be eating other people's dust. Truth. What HAVE u done that is so impressive??? U have had lots of opportunities. Maybe u will get lucky.  It's a roll of the dice how u r choosing to play it. Hope it will work out for u. Don't act surprised if it doesn't. U r smart and have a lot on the ball but (unless LUCKY, in MINORITY) this shit doesn't fall in ur lap. And the best thing I could do to get in physical shape is to leave ur dad, move to NYC, take classes and walk all the time -- that would solve my weight problem.""



This is just the start of things she has said to “motivate me”.  My parents are also going through some marriage troubles right now.  



I don't want to lose my mom for my future children.  I also don't want to cut her off because of how good she’s been to me, raising me, helping me with extracurriculars in high school, etc.  She deserves better than to be cut off. I just don't know how to handle it.  
 


•	I feel lost frequently, am I actually a disrespectful son?


•	Why do I always have monthly arguments with her?


•	Why do I feel that just being out of the relationship would make me happier?  When we get along, I really enjoy it. 


•	Have you all experienced similar traits with your BPD mother?


•	If so, do you think this book: http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Borderline-Mother-Unpredictable-Relationship/dp/0765703319/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460361461&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=understanding+the+borderline+mother  is a good place to start?

I’m submissive. I'm really short for a man, blonde hair and blue eyes. Looking for someone for a roleplay with both social and sexual parts. I like a deeper setting with us focusing on our own characters but sometime playing others too to deepen interactions. I’ve been told I roleplay well and hope to find someone who enjoys details and language as much as I do. English is not my native language though, but hopefully I’m not too shabby. Below is a suggested intro, we can change it if you want! Be open with your thoughts and ideas =) I have many smaller kinks, and I’m open to new ones too, just ask! Some of my kinks are feminization, petplay, bdsm, size difference, sensory deprivation, social and sexual domination, corruption, light humiliation, servitude, clothing/outfits, lending etc. I'm open to longterm roleplays mostly. I have a bit of time almost everyday, but know that this upcoming weekend is quite busy.) (This intro contains a boss-employee relationship.)

Throughout your adult life you’ve always been a hard worker. It has taken a lot of effort and sacrifice to end up where you are today, and sometimes you question if it has been worth it. You went from having no real money to becoming the [CEO] (Or any high boss of your choice) of a very successful international company. The long hours had taken a toll on your personal life though, and a few months back your last partner left you. Rethinking your situation a little you’ve started to delegate more of your job to be able to go down in time a little, and by now you’ve gotten it flexible enough to have a little free time even.

In another part of the world my life had also contained a lot of struggle. My name is Tim, I’m 18 years old and live in Sweden. Well, lived in Sweden rather. My family consists of my mother named Karin, and my two sisters Erica and Malin. Raised by a single mother we grew up poor, but I put in great effort to do well in school. It wasn’t easy though. The women in my family were all very feminine, short and curvy, and to my great annoyance I had also partly inherited such traits. I’m only 162 cm, or 5’3, with lightblonde hair and blue eyes. My short build is also very slender, but what fat I have gathering around my hips and butt. My butt is shaped more than mens butts usually are, and considering my face has androgyn features I had constantly been confused for a girl as a child. Even now it can be hard to tell sometimes, so I make sure to always dress in more masculine clothes. Due to my overall slightly girly and small looks I was constantly picked on in school causing me to become quite shy and timid. My sisters also kept teasing me about it, delighted with how easily I got mad at them.

I was always quite clever, and due to fast development as a child I started school one year earlier then people my age usually do. And being younger didn’t help with my problem of being bullied… So I focused on my studies, and in the long run it has seemed to pay off. I still wasn’t that much of a people person, quite timid and feeling my height was a bit shameful.

Your company was looking for international interns for one year. I had no real hope of getting the job, but two weeks later I got an answer that I was called to a skype interview. Hearing this made me incredibly nervous, and the thought of actually doing something besides my poorly paid extra job as cleaning hotel rooms was exciting and frightening at the same time. After an incredibly nervous interview, I got the internship. I couldn’t believe it. After that it was all a blur, a storm of emotions. I would begin in a month, and there was so much to get ready. Your company paid for tickets and arranged housing, an opportunity of a lifetime. I was nervous, but I knew I had to take it. An after saying goodbye to my family, a difficult departure, I left my home

Living alone, and in [the US] (If we have the RP there) was very rough at first. But now that four months had passed I felt much more comfortable in my situation. My colleagues were decent, everyone having very mixed emotions about me. Some just couldn’t take me seriously, thinking I just was adorable. Others had realized I was quite clever, trying to get me to overcome my shyness to make me contribute more.

After these four months you were having a meeting with some of your employees regarding the new interns. You had taken four. Two of these seemed not quite cut out for the work, one were doing great, and the last one… It was an odd situation with this Tim. It was quite odd, but at the moment Leslie, the 33 year old rather chubby woman that was the boss directly responsible of me, was fighting her boss the 52 year old Bob about my value. She saw that I was very clever, and secretly found me amazingly cute. He thought I was small and too timid to contribute. They turn to you for a decision, and to reach a conclusion you have sour secretary quickly set up a meeting with you and me for Monday afternoon at 3.

When you saw my image in my file you’d recognized me straight away. You had only seen me a handful of times, but each time I had disappeared before you got a chance to approach me. You couldn’t help it, you wanted to get to know me better. You’d never mixed up romantic/sexual feelings with your work, but for some reason you’d gotten real curious when you saw me. It was something about my looks that attracted you… And hearing about this situation you got an excuse to meet me.

Today it’s Sunday, a rather rainy one at that. You’ve just been visiting an old friend living in the other side of town. On the way home you had to go by a grocery store, needing to fill up on some stuff at home. You stop at a bigger store in the slightly poorer parts of town and head inside. There’s lots of people doing their shopping, and you don’t really stand out as you go down the list of things to pick up. As you head to the last item on your list you suddenly spot someone you recognize. Me.

I’m currently standing on my toes, trying to reach an item on one of the top shelves. I’m dressed in a pair of slightly too tight worn jeans and a white t-shirt wearing a light jacket over it. You can’t help but notice how short I am, but also how shapely my legs are. And my butt too. I’m holding my phone to my ear with one hand and hold a shopping basket in the other, speaking Swedish on the phone. “Ja- Ja jag äter tillräckligt- Jag är ju och handlar nu!” I release a little annoyed groan, and you guess I’m talking to a family member. You can tell I won’t be able to reach no matter how much I try.

(So that’s the intro. Suggestions, thoughts are very welcome. My plan is that we have a shorter meeting here at first, then skip a bit to when we meet the next morning. My character doesn’t recognize yours at all, not knowing you’re my top boss. This RP is very open and could lead to almost anything, romance, sexual, you name it. =) )

4ea563,2,2016-04-11,CMV: Financial and career success is all that matters in life.,MarsExulte,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4ea563/cmv_financial_and_career_success_is_all_that/,"To give you a bit of context I'm a 22 year old white man from a poor background in the North of England. Due to being fairly smart in Primary School (Age 4-11) I got into a fairly reputable school in my city and was able to mix with other kids from a variety of backgrounds including fairly Middle Class (for Americans that means pretty well-off professionals and buainesspeople, I don't really understand the American concept of ""middle class"" where even janitors can refer to themselves as ""lower middle"".)

Although because of depression and distractions such as video games I didn't do very well in my exams aged 15-18 I was able to attend a Top 5 university in England studying modern languages. I'm due to graduate that university this June with a 2.2 degree - probably the equivalent of a 2.5-3.0 GPA I'm not certain. Again this is due my own fault for being depressed and lazy. My time at university has allowed me to befriend some people from exceptionally wealthy families from Eastern European Oil barons to Systems Engineers for Google. 

Onto the crux of my point: as someone who has ruined his life through apathy and underachievement I now realise success and achievement, as well as the acquisition of money is all that is important.

Although these goals are equally admirable for women failing to realise them carries additional weight for men. Your attractiveness to women (if that's what you're into) is severely crippled by not only a lack of money but also a lack of other things that women place under the umbrella terms of ""passion"" or ""ambition"": you're not achieving any success, your status among other men is diminished and your station gives you no respect from your friends and peers. 

Enough of being selfish anyway. I want to talk about the effects these things have on children. I'm sure you could put out all sorts of studies and so on to counter this but from my experience social mobility is basically a lie in capitalist societies and people almost certainly end up in the class they were born.

As a child from a single parent dirt poor family I was not given the ability to develop healthy self-confidence or esteem as more wealthy children are. I was never able to travel the world going on regular exotic holidays, nor did my family have the money to allow me to take up sports.

As the first person in my family to go to university they also were unable to give me any advice, I'm afraid they (and I, for a long time) still retained the foolish outdated belief that any degree meant instant career success.

My peers from better families opted far more often to do STEM or Law, and through their parents' connections got multiple internships or opportunities for valuable experience that has now set them in very good stead for their careers, in which they will undoubtedly achieve the same levels of success as their parents.

TL;DR: Having a successful career and money are all that truly matter because it's what people judge you on and your respect from others is determined by it. It is also very heavily correlated with the success of your children due to the better, happier upbringing you can provide as well as guidance/financial aid through university to set them up for much better careers themselves.

Oh and PS: Can we please not make ""highlight reel"" arguments like ""yeah you only see that they've got loads of money but they're all drug-taking alcoholics with dysfunctional families""

Until...",DontAskhowIknow,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4ea8es/26m4f_you_would_submit_in_the_bedroom_but_never/,"It seemed to make so much sense. Out there, you'd be the motivated, driven, elegant young woman your parents had hoped you would be. Confident, eloquent, successful. Well-liked by peers and beloved by teachers. An apt pupil, a gracious intern, and now, a model employee.

And in the bedroom, with the boyfriends who could handle it, you were a filthy, cock-riding slut. A little piece of fuck meat to bind and spank, an eager dick-sucking whore who drank in cum and humiliation with equal aplomb. A moaning little fuck toy who'd scream into her gag and convulse under her collar while her Dom ripped orgasm after orgasm from her sopping wet cunt.

And then you'd shower, get dressed, and go to that networking mixer you'd penciled in on your calendar.

And it was at one of these button down events that you met him. From the moment he shook your hand you could feel the tension. This guy didn't want you working under him, and he didn't quite want you writhing under him either.

He wanted you to *live* beneath him. To be his full-time slavegirl. How did you know? Was it his steel gaze? His confident posture? The way his voice seemed to ooze sex even when he talked about industry jargon?

Soon he was pursuing you - and you hated it. Hated knowing that you'd throw yourself at him after one or two dates, letting him take you however he wanted.

But he didn't want you like the rest of them did.

He wanted you to dress how he liked. To act like he wanted. To address him, even with people around, by a title. To walk behind him, to fetch him drinks, to be at his beck and call.

You'd never known a wetness like this - a smouldering desire in your breasts and clit that ached to be his slave.

How long would it take before you finally gave in?"

* 3th year ""sophomore"" obtaining two bachelor's degrees in Accounting and unrelated liberal arts degree (graduating in 9 semester, fall 2016 intern recruitment). Plans to enter into audit. 

* USC (SoCal) Student with a very good GPA, but needs more stuff on resume

* Likes playing poker (like a few accountants), thinks he's pretty good at it, thinking about going semi-pro*

Long-time reader, first time poster. After (perhaps unwisely) abstaining from sophomore SLP recruitment due partly to laziness and distraction, I am approaching this summer with the goal of preparing for my career path within the next five years. I particularly valued a degree that gave me a flexibility in my career, security in a good resume and income, and accounting was a subject I didn't mind and at times even enjoyed learning. 

My main concerns moving forward is deciding where to live, and figuring out the implications of recruiting away from my feeder office. While I like Los Angeles as a city, it is just way too damn expensive to live in for my taste. Paying $800 a month for a crappy bedroom apartment with a roommate just sounds ridiculous, especially coming from a state with such cheap housing. Also, I do plan on saving a lot of my income from accounting to help obtain some sort of financial stability going into my late 20s, early 30s. The only problem is that I intend on working within the media/entertainment industry during and after my time in the Big 4, and obviously Los Angeles is a great place for that. 

After googling over a few places that fit the crieteria of:

* Relatively cheap,
* Entertainment Industry present,
* Poker scene present,

I know that three of the Big 4 have offices in Las Vegas, which addresses my want of a poker hobby while also being in a relatively affordable city. It is also relatively close to Los Angeles for me, in case I might want to work with a client in the area, or visit friends once in a few months. 

My question(s) is basically how much would insisting on an office location away from the feeder school affect my recruiting process? Also, would I lose any opportunities working in in a smaller city as opposed to a world-class city like Los Angeles? Would opportunities in entertainment be lost if I were to move away from the city? I'm not entirely sure how much this forum can really answer given how diverse my concerns are, but some sort of direction would really help in this planning process.

4eagoo,3,2016-04-11,Found out I'm an INFJ on different occasions. I have no idea what to feel but it made me understand myself a little better.,Efyeeah,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/4eagoo/found_out_im_an_infj_on_different_occasions_i/,"First things first - I'm 22 and just graduated university with a pre-med course. I also consider myself a self-taught yet frustrated artist (feel free to look at some of my work in my post history or whatever) I didn't realise I took the MBTI personality test as a part of my enrollment requirement for university when I was 17. The guidance counselor said I was an INFJ but didn't elaborate due to the number of students she had to accommodate. I was pretty much occupied with adjusting to college so I didn't have time to figure out what it meant. 

When things went dark for me at 18 (was diagnosed with anxiety and depression), I had to see a therapist and I was also asked to take the same test and ended up with the same results. My doctor told me that my personality type is ""one of a kind"" and it could be the reason why I have trouble adjusting to social situations and different people most of the times. But I shouldn't worry because she believes I ""have a lot to offer"" and deep down my complexity, I still have a chance to get better.

When I was 21, a friend of mine suggested I take an online personality test to see which Game of Thrones characters I resemble the most - and it was the same test! I somehow liked my results because I found out I am similar to Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Maester Luwin - no wonder they were the first characters I ever like upon watching show then reading the books! That's when I became really intrigued to find out about what being INFJ really means.

During my last months in university my anxiety has gotten worse due to a lot of stress, personal problems and losses. It pushed me into being paranoid that I might have bipolar disorder so I decided to see my doctor again. Months before I went back to therapy, I felt like I was beside myself, like I was some stranger I didn't know. I dealt with my issues in unconventional ways (I resorted to drinking copious amounts of alcohol and not eating for days because I was unable to cope with a betrayal of a really good friend and falling out with someone special). I lied my way to skip many classes and shifts on my internship because I just felt like I needed to get away from all of it. When I reached the so-called ""breaking point"", I was able to express my anger and frustrations in ways I never thought I would. I ended up hurting loved ones emotionally and breaking a few trusts people had in me. I got so scared with this horrible, unpredictable person I was becoming. I couldn't deal with the heartbreak mixed with academic pressures I was experiencing. 

My doctor ordered I get scans for my brain to really see if I have BPD. Thankfully, I didn't have it. I was told I was experiencing burnout syndrome and was advised to take a whole week off from school. I somehow lost a lot of motivation those days. I didn't bother catching up on a lot of school work that resulted to my name being dropped off from the honor roll but I really couldn't care. I felt so numb and frustrated because deep down, I know I didn't deserve to be in this situation. I've worked so hard on my studies, on trying to fix damaged relationships and it all went to nothing. I ended up destroying myself in the process. The grief of losing connection with someone dear to me overshadowed other damages I encountered along the way.

As I try to understand what being INFJ means, I figured many people have given up on me because I do sometimes end up isolating myself. It's the part of the personality I connect with the most. And it's terrible that people misinterpret that part of me, they end up thinking it's their fault and I don't even try to explain my side. It's also probably the reason why I fell out with a special someone. I also have trouble opening up why I shut myself out, I don't understand why but I know I need it. It takes a toll on me when special people shut me out and vice versa.

It's just quite lonely to realise that there are only a few of us out there. I know I am not ""all that"" but everyday I wish that person would be able to see my worth, because I still believe he's worth it even if we're not talking anymore.

Nowadays, what keeps me going are the few close and unexpected people who still see the good in me in spite of everything that has happened. I hate myself for being unable to control my anger that I ended up hurting innocent people. But there were still the ones who believed I can get better and I am so thankful for them. At times, I do feel suicidal because of my illness but I'm glad I'm still able to focus on my dream of becoming a physician someday.

I've posted in many other subreddits, and thought I would here as well...

To sum up my situation:

I am a 28 year old, who just finished my Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. Near the end of the program, I realized that although this type of work is fascinating, it isn't a career path I want to follow anymore....after devoting three years of my life studying, internships, and $50K in student loan debt.

I currently work as a youth director ($38,800) at a local religious institution. I used to really like the work, not the pay. Now, I've started to hate the job. I'm up for a promotion next year as director of programming, but I'm not excited about it at all, despite the increase in pay ($52,000). I seem to have lost my will, developed a sense of social anxiety, and really feel lost, unhappy, and the unhappiness consumes me, washes over me.

I am about to get married to a wonderful life partner, but I don't think she understands what I'm going through. The promotion would be great, but is it doing whats best? What is even best for me? My interests have changed, I can't seem to not compare myself to my friends in these other jobs. I feel like I am not using my potential, and I don't even know what that is. The feeling of sadness consumes me, and I think I was happy yesterday for the first time in so long.

I don't want to go into the marriage with a job I hate, feeling pigeonholed and trapped, but I also don't want to go into a marriage without a job, broke and penniless.

I have the student debt, around $5K in credit card debt.

I'm in crisis mode right now because I have only gotten any response for two of the more than dozen applications - one saying they would email me in May (which is not a sure thing in my opinion since it was sent in March) and another which led to a job interview over the phone which, in my opinion, was a complete disaster.

I don't feel like I'll be able to find a job in my field because I didn't graduate from that third-year program. I also don't have any opportunities to add any new stories to my portfolio outside of doing stories for the college program's newspaper in September - an offer which felt like a slap in the face because it showed how confident my professors were for me to be able to find any work despite getting praise from all of them for two and a half years.

I also don't know if I can accept any job offers out of province because I only have a G2 license. That's because my mother refused to let me get a G1 until I had to force her to drive me to the DriveTest facility when I was 18 years old and refused to teach me - I haven't even driven since my G1 Road Test in January. I was only able to get the G2 license after she let me take driving lessons. As well, I can afford to buy a car right now, but can't afford to pay for car insurance or gas until I get a job. In the journalism field, having a driver's license (sometimes a G2, sometimes a full G license) and a car is required to even be considered for a position. Also factor in all of the things you need to do when you move and I have no idea how getting an out-of-town job will work out.

I also can't find any retail jobs that I'm even qualified for because most of them require at least a year of experience. Also, I live in a city that, up until two months ago, was 'The Unemployment Capital of Canada' (unemployment rate dropped because a local car factory hired a few thousand people, which led to spin-off manufacturing jobs). That being said, I'm competing against 300 people for a lot of the applications I make in this city. Also, those retail openings are few and far between (there are more than 300 openings - mostly full-time positions - posted on Indeed.ca right now). The only types of workers in demand in this city right now are for people who are coming from my college's trades and apprenticeship programs. Also, before you ask, the temp agencies don't have many non-factory openings right now either.

Now, why am I looking for a job right now? Well there's a few reasons:

1. In January, I pulled out - not dropped out - of my college program at the time due to a mental health crisis and was planning to take the time to work on my issues. I was also told I could go back to finish the program the next school year. Instead, I'm now worse than I was before in part because I've been struggling to find any places to get proper help in a timely fashion (and not in six months to two years) and because the program is now cancelled for 2016-17 because only one person registered (most people planned to enroll in April. Also, the college wanted 25 students to register for a program designed for 12 people at once).

2. I'm sick of getting disability payments for having Asperger's Syndrome (which never affected my stories or classwork. While it's on the mild side, my social skills are not that great for things like casual conversations). Some people both online and in my personal life have judged me because I get just enough money to live on my own - $610 a month plus $500 a month for rent. I can't afford to buy food more than a couple times a month or buy a car to get around with how much I have to pay in bills. I can barely afford to pay for the bus as it is. They also judged me because my grandmother saved enough money and then some to pay for my tuition and equipment.

3. Because of what I've said in the other two points, I've been told by some people such as mental health professionals, my family and even a Statistics Canada surveyor that I should just keep staying in the house all day and/or to not bother getting a job for now. The StatsCan person also told me I'm listed as permanently unfit to work. I'm sick of people telling me I should work in a store or trying to give me booklets for hospitality (cooking for restaurants) courses at a community centre or offhandedly saying I'm delusional for wanting to go into journalism - one person even said I'm delusional in a psychiatric report because of that. I just want to prove everyone wrong.

4. At the same time, I'm also feeling pressure from some of my former classmates too. After everything that happened earlier this year, I had one of my better friends from the program I was in tell me she and everyone else noticed me slipping downward. But, while some people tried to give suggestions on what to do and walked away back then, they also thought it wasn't a big deal ""because I was the perfect journalist"" and thought I could deal with them on my own. A lot of them (especially in the second year of the journalism program. Before you ask, the program I pulled out of is separate from the journalism program and is technically its optional third year) keep telling me I'll be the most successful out of all of them. I also have people telling me I should go into magazine writing or photojournalism or anything else they feel I'm best at. I have a lot of pressure to not let those people down too.

I'm just in crisis mode about all of this. I'm sick of sitting around the house all day hoping to get lucky or to hear back from an employer. Some people in here might say to keep doing that, but I'm losing my mind doing so. I feel like I'll be able to get my mental health back in order by doing a ton of work at a job. I also want to get the heck out of this city as fast as possible and can't do that if I have to work retail or in a factory for a few years.

So, what am I supposed to do right now?

I chose CIS (Computer Information System ) over computer science because I liked coding but it wasn't a thing I imagined to do forever. (JAVA is like love and hate relationship) anyways.. I browsed some stuff what I wanted to do and was really interested in Database Administrator and Security. I really want to do Security since I want to be the hero of the company fighting hackers! spammers! and the bad evil guy on cyberworld. ^
Since CIS is a very broad major, it really didn't prep me for a particular career. So my question is what can I do to prepare myself for a career in Security or database?
For security I know there are alot of certifications like Network+ and cissp. Will those help me land a job? Of course internship is a must too.

A few days ago he told me that there was a position open when I graduated and I told him I could work but had to take the two weeks off for AT and he said that the position may not be available anymore. Am I fucked? I feel like I'm fucked.

With that being said, I'm looking to create a simple lab to not only help me with my degree, but also to teach myself.

Currently, I'm looking at buying 2 of these for the sake of learning Ubuntu and Windows 10:

http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Optiplex-Desktop-Pentium-3-0Gghz/dp/B00DL04H1Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1460391937&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=refurbished+desktop+computers

My question is, is this $200 investment worth it? Currently, I have 0 experience with Linux based OS's and very little experience with the Windows 10 OS, and a few of the companies I would like to intern for say that familiarity with both OS's is a plus. So the entire reason behind getting both of these computers would be to learn both OS's ins and outs in a hands on environment.

On top of that, as my studies further and I learn a bit more, I'd like to expand upon my homelab (I plan on going the route of Networking), so would this be a good first step in going about doing this?

Thanks in advance! "

4ebmk2,3,2016-04-11,And I would have stayed up with you all night. Had I known how to save a life.,aline_connally,PotterPlayRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/PotterPlayRP/comments/4ebmk2/and_i_would_have_stayed_up_with_you_all_night_had/,"*It had been a long time, since she’d had the nightmares. Over a year. But for some reason, they had come back, more vivid than ever, even worse than when it had first happened [that fateful August night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PotterPlayRP/comments/2egxel/the_initial_incursion/) Every time she woke up from the nightmare, she could still feel the tingling of pain throughout her body. The memory of being hit with the torture curse haunted her. When she was in school, Elijah was there to comfort her, he kept the nightmares away. Now, there was no one. She couldn’t talk to her flat mates, they wouldn’t understand. And her parents wouldn’t either. So, to fight the nightmares, she simply didn’t sleep.*

*It was fine, at first. Staying up for a few days at a time, she was able to delay the nightmares. Curled up in bed, she would read book after book, study, anything to keep her mind occupied. But then, when she finally did sleep, it kept getting worse. For weeks, this was her pattern. Stay up for three or four days, get one night of horrible sleep, repeat. Until she couldn’t take it anymore. With a combination of potions and caffeine to keep her awake, she managed to stay awake for 9 days, though it was beginning to become clear she wasn’t sleeping. Unfortunately for Aline, her lack of sleep was causing her more problems than she realized.*

*It had been a Wednesday, day 9 with no sleep. Aline was shuffling through the halls of St. Mungo’s with her fellow interns, doing rounds, same as always. After receiving her patient care information for the day from the Head Healer, she went about doing her job. Later in the day, an emergency came in, a poisoning. Aline was charged with fetching the antidote and administering it. The patient’s condition seemed to improve immediately, and was sent to recovery, and she went on with her day.*

*Going to check on the patient later, she discovered he was not there. Instead, she found several senior healers, talking in hushed tones, one of them holding a vial in their hands. Noticing her there, they summoned her into the room.* “Ah yes, Miss. Connally. We were just going to fetch you. Mr. Jameson was placed under your care when he first arrived, was he not?” *Aline nods, glancing at the other healers, trying to read their faces for a clue as to what was happening.* “And you administered the correct antidote for his situation…-* The healer flips through the chart attached to the end of the patient cot.* “A series of Doxy bites to his arms and face?” *Again, Aline nods.* “Yes sir, I administered two vials of Antidote for Uncommon Poisons, due to the large number of bites he sustained. Where- where is Mr. Jameson? Has he been moved to another room? Did I not give him the correct dosage?” *Aline could feel her heart start to race, fear that she had given the patient too much, or too little of the antidote coursing through her.*

“No, Miss. Connally. Two vials was the correct dose. However, it appears that you administered the **wrong** antidote. You gave Mr. Jameson two vials of Antidote to Common Poisons, which alleviated his symptoms temporarily, but did not stop the poison from reaching his heart. He succumbed to his injuries about an hour ago.” *The healer presented her with the two empty vials, which were indeed the wrong vials. Aline felt her hands shaking as she stared at them, stammering incoherently for a few seconds, before looking up at the Healer.* “I- I-I, I didn't- I mean, I thought I grabbed… Oh my God, oh my God, I am so sorry. This- this is all my fault, I should have-” 

*The healer cut her off.* “Yes, Miss. Connally. This was your mistake, and things like this happen. They’ve happened to all of us at one point or another. However- we have noticed that your work these past few weeks has been- less than your standard level. You’ve been one of our most promising interns this year, but your work has been slipping, you’ve been falling behind the others. We’ve set up a meeting with Augustus Pye, so we may discuss what’s been going on. Please report to his office in an hour.” *Terrified, Aline nods, and then goes to speak, but is cut off again.* “One hour, Miss. Connally. You may explain yourself then.” *Nodding again, she leaves the room, her head down, and trying to fight back tears. Her hands won’t stop shaking. She spends the next hour or so pacing in an empty room, cursing herself for acting so foolishly.*

*At the meeting, Aline sits across the desk from Augustus Pye, the Head Healer of St. Mungo’s. The other senior healers sit alongside a wall in his office as well, watching. Aline tells them everything. The attack a year and a half ago. The nightmares. How she hadn’t been sleeping. Everything. Everything comes out all at once, unable to keep the words from spilling out of her mouth any more than she can keep the tears from spilling from her eyes. After she’s finished, she notices the pity on the other healers faces, and she’s passed a tissue.*

“Well, Miss. Connally. That is certainly a heavy situation to be dealing with, and I am sorry that something as tragic as that has happened to you. However, you were knowingly putting patients in danger by not sleeping, and did in fact, cause the death of one man. You’re lucky that Mr. Jameson has been the only one to suffer for this. I’m going to have to recommend a week’s suspension. Effective immediately.” *The tears continue to fall down her face as she nods silently, staring into her lap.* “Also, Miss. Connally. Take this down to the potions distributor.” *He hands her a slip of paper.* “Seven vials of Dreamless Sleep Potion. Take them, and get some rest. If after a week, these nightmares of yours continue, see me and we will see what else we can do to help you.” *Nodding again, ALine tucks the paper into her robe pocket.* “Thank you, sir. And, I’m sorry, again. I understand that I behaved very irresponsibly, and I’m grateful that you’re giving me a second chance.” *And with that, Aline is dismissed. She heads down to get the Dreamless Sleep Potion, and then heads home, ignoring the stares and questions from her fellow interns.*

*When she arrives back at the flat, she immediately locks herself in her bedroom, sitting on her bed as sobs start to take over her body. How could she have been so stupid? She knew better. She knew she could have asked for help. But she didn’t. And someone died because of her stupidity. She cried for what felt like hours, draining herself physically, and emotionally. Shaking, she goes to her bag, and pulls out a vial of the potion, sighing. Such a simple solution had been available to her all this time. She had suffered for no reason, for weeks. Downing the potion, she crawls under her covers, exhaustion finally taking her over as the potion gently pulls her towards a dark and dreamless sleep.*

---

OOC: Even though Aline is graduated, she’s one of my favorite characters, and I like to continue her story. For those of you who didn’t know, after graduation, she became an intern healer at St. Mungo’s hospital. Clearly, it’s not going well right now.

It costs 62k but my parents very generously said they are willing to support me wherever I choose to go. UC Santa Cruz on the other hand has a beautiful campus, still a good CS program and is close to silicon Valley. The class sizes are larger however and I probably wouldn't get to know my professors as well. I feel like I would fit the SC vibe in general (it's more diverse and chill imo). Also it's only 35k. My parents want me to go to SCU but idk. Someone please help!"

4ec08v,21,2016-04-11,Overcoming Third quarter slump and Anxiety,thirdquarterslump,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/4ec08v/overcoming_third_quarter_slump_and_anxiety/,"Every semester around this time (around third midterms) I get into a stupendous slump. I get overwhelmingly depressed. I don't leave my room the entire weekends. I find some sort of substance or activity to abuse and escape into. I feel genuinely anxious about everything to come. In short, I get into a really negative spiral. This is after doing reasonably well during the first portion of the semester. 

I am doing it again. Previously these activities and avoidance harmed just me. For example, I lost an A in a class that I had a 97 one summer. This was unfortunate but fine. Now, as a junior, more people are depending on me, between parents, girlfriends, classmates, lab-mates, and groups I am leading. My actions are hurting them and impacting them, and this is bothering me. It hurts seeing the disappointment in my parent's eyes when they come to me for support, and all they find is me hiding in fear of life, shirking all responsibility. In semester's past, I was able to keep this part of my life secret from my family and friends, so all they would see is an acceptable GPA and assume all is well. Somehow, I let it slip this semester. 

Usually if there is some sort of organized activity, like a lecture or a group meeting I am fine. I go there, just so I can accomplish the bare minimum, and I go to sleep a nervous wreck. But whenever there is little to no structure like on the weekend, I devolve into a state of anxious, substance abuse. It will start off with ""just one for old time's sake"" which will cause immense guilt that will then explode into a weekend long relapse where I accomplish no work or have any fun. Sadly, this has been each weekend since mid-February.

I am not sure how to get out of this negative spiral. I keep digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole. In the past, I have tried to ask for help, and each person has helped me to the best of their abilities. However, for a number of reasons, that I am not too sure of, I keep finding myself in this situation, each and every semester.
 
Like at the moment, my life *should not* be stressful, and I *should not* be in this state of anxiety nor should I be trying to escape reality. The assignments I have remaining are things I have managed to do well on in the past. My schedule is fairly light, after dropping a course. My ""future is bright,"" as I have a summer internship offer at a pretty high profile company. My friends and family really support me, and come to my aid. Like all things are well, but I am just falling back to nervous, anxious, avoidant old me. I really have nothing to complain about.

So my questions are:

* **How do I get out of the negative spiral I am currently in?** I have basically completely disengaged from my life for the past three or four weeks. Replacing it with anxious substance abuse, and each time I try to get up, I convince myself, ""it's too late. You already screwed up so far.""
* **Has anyone experienced this before and overcome this**
* **Does anyone have any insight why this keeps happening at the exact same time each semester?**"

Me (31m) and wife (25f) are married for 3+ years. well my wife simply stops talking for days or sometimes couple of weeks if she doesnt like something i do. it could be anything. I try to ask her 100s of times nicely on whats wrong but i dont know what goes on in her mind but she doesnt say a word. for example last weekend i worked like crazy because the project i run ran into some problems. customers were calling me all the time and shes angry now with me once again for it. if i try to explain something she gets angry and doesnt like discussing any topic for more than a few minutes...... its like discussing is wrong. 

my wife has a decent intelligence level but doesnt work very hard or even hard and may be shes not as dedicated to things as i am. for example she joins a company as an inturn and says she doesnt like it within a day or 2 and says i want to quit. I try to convince her and tell she needs to give it some time and need to be patient.

well she doesnt respect the fact that i work hard and she comments a lot on my working style and the idea of fun for her is commenting on my weaknesses.....i kinda accept things if i do something wrong and promise to be bettter.... i believe i have changed a lot in the 3 years i am married keeping what she likes in mind....for example my wife  is from a family thats financially better off than mine and she grew up not knowing what outside world is like. her parents may be bought what she always wanted and she believes in living life in style and likes laptops and phones a lot. she works at as an intern for free in a company but gets some money in support from the governament......but she believes say buying a laptop everyyear and also a phone every single year even if the previous one work just fine..... she believes only in buying latest and most expensive models.....i other hand work my ass off and am certainly happy to buy stuff for her but not a laptop every year....when i say no to something she thinks very cheaply of me... but i do try to save some money for our own future as a couple... i cant understand why anyone wants to buy one laptop every year..... she says she has got only the best since childhood and when she wants it......should i not tell her whats right or wrong and simply obey what she asks ?

if we travel for vacation - i do all the planning, bookings and every single thing....but yes she cooks most of the times and i do dishes.... but i kinda dont feel loved.....she finds so many things that i do for her and i never get a hug or a thanks for buying or even doing something for her.... i asked her why she never appreciates anything i do.....she responded saying i should not expect thanks.....well im getting tired of this silent treatment game.....i dont know what i can do to maker her stop silent game and start to discuss whats wrong.... i tried telling her and even showing articles that its not correct.

I have lovely friends and a great boyfriend. My parents and family is super supportive in whatever I do. 

But I just don't know it anymore...
Ever since I started going to highschool I didn't like school. I had friends, but close friends? Not really. I got fine and sometimes even good grades. The stress and anxiety started showing up there though. I didn't enjoy going to school every day. I fled away from my responsibilities by playing video games or being with friends or boyfriends at the time. 
Eventually after a lot of crying, a lot of frustration and many 'I don't care' episodes, and 3 months just not showing up to school, I finished highschool. 

So.. What is the next thing you do? You go to university. My parents are super supportive and after my first year at uni failed they helped me searching for something different. Now two years further... I am just sinking away deeper and deeper in this (what it seems) bottomless pitt. Last year I tried to reach out to some student counselor because I didn't know what to do anymore. I don't really like reaching out to people for help, I feel like I don't want to bother them. Even if I know they will gladly help me. That they are concerned about me. I don't want to talk about my feelings and thoughts. I don't want people to feel sorry for me or pitty me...

Anyways last year I took my first step for help because I was always sad, distracted myself with other things so I would feel happy for atleast a little while. I talked to the counselor and she tried to help me for a little while... I never told her the entire truth about how I felt and whatnot so she couldn't fully help me. And then I just gave up. I didn't go there anymore and for a little while I managed to be fine. I did what I had to do for school. 

Now this year I have these internships (not entirely sure what's it called exactly in English) my first two weeks were around Christmas. It was incredibly hard and I felt like absolute shit. But hey what choice do I have? I cant just quit, right? I managed to get through it but I was insanely happy it was over.

The past month or so I had to prepare for my second internship in a different school. But I couldn't get myself to do anything. I just keep on sulking, feeling bad, feeling stressed out and trying to escape anywhere I can. I have had two weeks of easter holiday now, they didn't help in my negative state. Nonstop working for school, feeling horrible and sleeping bad because of stress and escaping for a few hours in gaming, partying, whatching movies or being with friends is what those two weeks looked like. 
Today was the first day I had to go back to school and I just crashed... I can't do it anymore.

When my mom came home I just started crying like a 4 year old. Trying to explain what was going on between the tears. I have tons of work and next monday the internship starts. I don't know it anymore... 

Do I want to continue this feeling horrible, to push me deeper and deeper down just for this piece of paper that says I have a degree? I don't even want to be infront of a class once I am done. I just enjoy working with children. And it's fun to be infront of the class, but forever? For an entire schoolyear? Even for a month? No thanks. 
I don't want to disappoint my family especially not my mom who is always helping me out with my problems.

But what if... What happens when I stop? Will it make me happier eventually? Or will I just stay in this state. I know I'll have to take steps to get happy again, to find something I enjoy doing.
And yes, I know I'll have to decide for myself but I am hoping talking about this to strangers might be a start to getting better."

I am also studying JavaScript on my own, but I would say it is the language I am weakest in. However, my APCS class didn't cover GUIs, and I know the syllabus for the intro class states that it is covered in the class. What would be the pros and cons of taking the intro class vs taking the AP credit?"
4ecpjq,1,2016-04-11,Some Career advice/help (x-post /r/askengineers),JackGoff,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/4ecpjq/some_career_advicehelp_xpost_raskengineers/,"A little background, I graduated with my BSCE back a couple months ago. I never had any internships during college due to being unlucky or having to deal with family issues during the summer(taking care of sick father, etc.). Despite everything, I know either wanted to do structural engineering or design of some sort or project management.


During school I always enjoyed learning about the structural portion of CE which where I took my most places. During my stay, I didn't do the best in my structural portions just little mistakes during tests ruined my grades and my school never really taught how to use programs for drafting. In other words, my AutoCad experience is below average and Revit knowledge is pretty average. Even though I really enjoyed learning about this subject and performing some of the calculations, me doing poorly in classes and not having much experience with design programs made me not that confident in doing Structural Engineering or Design proficiently as a career.


I always thought Construction Management was interesting since I thought it was more hand-on with projects and what not. My school doesn't really have a construction management program (the minor program is very meh) and the one CM class is very basic like what is a bid or submittal (one that you can just read from a book, etc.) Also we never had a plan reading class and I can barely make my way around them.
Anyways, I luckily landed a job within CM with a subcontracting company. However, I'm just starting with job (3 weeks in) and it's not (so far) what I expected. Nothing I really learned in school has applied much at all especially since It's really been is budgeting, phasing out projects, submitting time cards, job cost analysis, production rates, etc. I need to learn a lot and a lot of it is confusing and a lot of time not even sure what I'm doing. I do, however, really like going out to job sites and seeing all the progress and construction that's going on. The pay is okay (60k gross), people at the company are seem caring, nice and helpful (at least my senior PE I work at), and benefits are decent but the area in which this company is located is very expensive to live in and get by (i.e rent for a 1bd 1ba averages 1400-1800). I know too with CM that it can be very work heavy with long hours (which can depend) but can have a lot of career growth and opportunity. As of right now, I don't know if I see myself doing this long term.


I don't know what to do right now. I can't really go back to grad school (which I know a lot of companies for Structural Engineers) since I totally bombed my first 2 years and ended with just under a 2.8 GPA. I'm really unsure with my design ability and calculations. And I'm unsure (so far) about construction management since it hasn't been all that exciting. Is it best to stick with the job, see if it becomes better and work my way up? Or maybe go into design/structural engineering work? And somehow gain more design experience. I'm not sure how my CM experience even helps out with any design experience though.


Some just added notes, I still need to take my FE exam (and I can become a PE at the CM company I work at). Also the slight experience would be from a design class where we used Revit a little bit and a little bit through my school's Steel Bridge team. Any advice on what to do?

TL;DR: Not liking CM job so much since I thought it was something more. Difficult to go back to grad school with so-so GPA. Not very experienced with design/drafting programs"
4ecr3p,1,2016-04-11,[Build Complete] Netachi- First PC Build (Gaming),narutoninjakid,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/4ecr3p/build_complete_netachi_first_pc_build_gaming/,"Hey guys thought I would post my PC since i finished it a while ago. Heres my lengthy write up. Photos attached in Imgur Link. 

The name of this PC comes from my 2 favorite Anime Characters in Naruto. Neji and Itachi and hence a fusion. So far naming all my PC’s and routing equipment using an Anime Motif. 

I knew from the beginning that I wanted to build a killer game PC but I previously did not have the means to do so. After getting an internship I made sure to save up as much funds as I could to put towards building my future PC. When it comes to my electronics I never hold back and I usually always go for the top-of-the-line (I’m often told not to do this but I can’t help it  ) I immediately decided that I would have to go with the 5820K, it was one of the best CPU’s in Intel’s enthusiast/professional class CPU’s at the time and it was a pretty good price at that. I also had to wait because I knew that I would need to get the 980ti. It was just a rumor when I first heard about it but I decided that I would hold off and wait. 
I purchased pretty much all of my parts on Amazon since I had prime and I can get everything in 2 days. There were only a few items that I can get on Amazon such as the custom cabling as well as the H240X. I built the PC around August 2015. This was actually my first ever pc build. After this I built the other Bankai Build for my siblings. 
This build may seem over the top on price but considering it was built summer 2015 this was the going price for parts back then. 

** CPU- Intel Core i7-5820K 3.3GHz 6-Core**

I went with the CPU simply because of its performance was Intel’s top-of-the-line and I had to have it I decided to pick it up in Micro Center since it can be had for a little bit cheaper than Amazon at the time.

**CPU Cooler- Swiftech H240-X 90.0 CFM Liquid**

This was a really good performer at the time and since I wanted to expand my loop later to water-cool the GPU and CPU so I decided on Swiftech for their modular coolers. Let me tell you however these things are very hard to get. They are sold out almost instantly and you have to keep checking their website every day. I had a whole fiasco and you will see that I bought a corsair cooler in the meantime. I learned that you do not want to power up your system especially without a cooler. Plus the X99 series CPU doesn’t come with a stock cooler since Intel expects the enthusiasts to buy their own lol. I bought a corsair H100i GTX then I bought a H220X when I found one online. However The H220X I bought had issues so returned it and got the H240X and have been happy ever since. This is why some photos above have the H100i GTX. 

**Thermal Compound- ARCTIC MX4 4g**

Not much to say her. One of the best thermal compounds you can get from all the reviews on it. 

**Motherboard- Asus X99-DELUXE/U3.1 ATX LGA2011-3**

I ultimately decided on this from all the features it has and somewhat good price. I initially was going to do a red and black theme like most so I was looking at the ASUS Rampage V Extreme as it was the top of the pecking order lol. I have an issue with always wanting the best even if I might not utilize all the features. However reading about some issues on the rampage and it was was quite costly so I decided to get the next best thing since I really wasn’t going to be doing crazy over clocking anyway. Decided on this board and had to change my whole theme from red and black to black and white. 

**Memory- Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (4 x 4GB) DDR4-2666**

Corsair makes good products and since I wasn’t springing for the exorbitant prices of the dominators at the time this seemed like a good deal. The Color matches well with my build a well. Plan to add another 16GB’s soon to top out at 32. 

**Storage- Samsung 850 EVO-Series 250GB 2.5"" SSD**

Bought this as a scratch drive since I would be using the 512GB 840 pro that was in my other laptop. It was on sale and still a good SSD for the price. Storage was just a little small for me. 

**Storage- Samsung 840 Pro Series 512GB 2.5"" SSD**

This is my main drive in my PC now. Runs windows 10 smooth and no issues. Don’t store any games or anything like that just a lot of programs. 

**Storage- Western Digital BLACK SERIES 4TB 3.5"" 7200RPM**

This is my main work horse. All of my files are on here including all the games I play. Never noticed any sort of speed degradation or anything like that. Not too loud as well. I would recommend them for those who need a lot of storage at a good speed and at a good price. Plan to pick up another soon. 

**Video Card- Gigabyte GeForce GTX 980 Ti 6GB**

This was the Magic component at that time lol. They had just been announced and I pushed off my build waiting for these to be released by NVDIA. It was expensive but they power through all the games I play. These were also hard to get and I had to camp on amazons website since they sold out fast. At the time it was between EVGA and Gigabyte for me. But after hearing many good things about Gigabytes coolers I decided to go for them. I really like ASUS but hey were dragging there feet and the strix model wasn’t out yet. I also planned on getting multiple displays so I needed a good amount of display ports. I also liked the way Gigabyte arranged the ports. 

**Case- Corsair 750D ATX Full Tower**

I just always like the way this case looked. Clean lines and nice aesthetic. I liked this and the 760T as well but ultimately decided on this. I had to have a big case with a large window. Looking at these online you may be deceived. These full tower cases are quite large in real life and it fits everything I need and more. Plan to add some water-cooling soon so the added space is a good bonus. 

**Power Supply- EVGA 1000W ATX12V / EPS12V**

Not much to say here. Very good power supply and EVGA makes great stuff. I also know a bit overpowered for my build but you can never be two careful. Adding another card later or some pumps should be no problem. 

**Case Fan- Corsair Air Series AF120 Quiet Edition (2-Pack) 39.9 CFM 120mm**

A fan is a fan lol. I do like the colors of these however. Did look at some Noctua fans but they were more costly and louder apparently. The colors scheme was atrocious as well but heard they have started changing up colors lately so may look into those later. No issues with these so far. 


**Fan Controller- NZXT Sentry Mix 2 Fan Controller**

Nice fan controller. Simple and looks good. Quite a bit of cables coming of it though. May look into changing or swapping these out later to save some space with all the excess cables it produces. 

**Monitor- Dell U3415W 34.0""**

This was another part that took me a while to decide on. Knew that I need a large screen for doing homework and gaming. When I saw the first LG that came out with 34 inches of space I was hooked. Shopped around, read up on all the issues and kept waiting. Eventually was going to get the LG 34UC97 but saw the dell come out and it would work just fine for me. Even better I ordered it from Costco so if I ever have any issues it’s a simple return. Was waiting for the model with G-SYNC but so far have never had any screen tear issues. This monitor is great for school as I can have 3 Microsoft Word/PowerPoint windows open at once and read all of theme. Highly recommended for productivity. 

**Keyboard- Corsair K70 RGB**

I really liked this keyboard. When I saw all the customizations and programming of lights and actions you could do I had to get this one. Has been solid form e ever since. Only issue is dust shows easily so must be regularly cleaned. 

**Mouse- Corsair M65 RGB Wired Laser**

Same as the keyboard. Solid for me no issues so far and they can be linked together with the software to show the same lights. 

**Custom- NZXT HUE/LED Lights from Amazon**

Haven’t put this in my build yet. Bought another set of amazon ( Link : http://www.amazon.com/SUPERNIGHT-Waterproof-Flexible-300leds-Changing/dp/B00K5MW1X2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage . The cheap ones with the controller lol. Like that I can change the colors with the remote. Saw they came out with a new model so may look into that. I still have this one unopened. 

**Custom- Ergotech Freedom Arm**

This was a little bit of a hassle for me. Funnily these are rated by monitor weight so heavy duty and normal. The monitor I got is too heavy for the normal one but to light for the heavy duty model according to the specs and customer service rep I talked to. They said since the monitor was to light for the heavy duty the tension wouldn’t be enough and it would always be high/extended. Planned to tape a bag of rice to the back of the monitor but I have had no issues. It stays in the spot I put it in with the heavy duty so not sure what they were speaking of. 


**Custom- CableMod E-Series G2 / P2 Cable Kit – BLACK / WHITE**

I knew from the beginning for me since I had a big window I had to have the custom cables. These were pretty hard to find and I had to order them from an obscure website just to get them. They are quality cables however and I love the look. 

**Conclusion/Plan For Updates:**

Ultimately my first even PC build was exquisite and quite simple. A few months of research ended in a short and quick PC build. I was surprised at how fast I put everything together once I got them. I would recommend for new builders to just watch a lot of videos and read on forums. Since Pascal is around the corner I’m waiting to see what’s up. May just get another 980ti however and SLI them. I’m looking now into how to expand the Swiftech H240 x to include the GPU and CPU in the loop. Plan to get some EK extras as well however. Was going to purchase a second Dell UC3415W but may just get a 50 inch TV on the side. Still debating that one lol. 

**I would appreciate any comments or questions and should get back to you guys shortly. Thanks for reading this wall of text lol.**

4ecyx3,28,2016-04-11,Mr. Snider Story,TheRealEBurns,Flyers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flyers/comments/4ecyx3/mr_snider_story/,"I worked for Comcast-Spectator in the summer of 2014 as an IT intern, but since the IT department was rather short staffed they gave me large duties and access to work for the 76ers, Flyers, Ed Snider Youth Hockey, and even the executive, Penthouse floor which was where Mr. Sndier worked. 

One day I was assigned a task to help Mr. Snider's assistant with an issue on her computer, so I went all the way up to the Penthouse and helped her out and while helping her out, Mr. Snider actually walked into the hallway and said Hi to us both. 

He obviously had never met me before and took the time out of his busy schedule to shake my hand, even though I was just a mere intern. I  then introduced myself, he seemed very pleased to meet me and welcomed me in and even thanked me for helping his assistant and told me, he hoped to see me around more. I was just an intern, literally working for free and Mr. Snider treated me like I mattered and like I was important to him and to me that was such a cool moment working there. 

You could tell when he walked by how his assistant just revered him and he had this aurora of greatness. I only met Ed one other time, actually a few weeks prior to starting my internship, at Lew Katz's memorial service, where I only briefly offered my condolences to him, but, in these 2 instances, I could just tell he was a great man and I'm proud to say I, at least, met him and am even more proud to say I worked for him. 

I hope this team does something magical in honor of him this postseason and I hope we play inspired all the way through June. The statue they build in Mr. Snider's honor at the Wells Fargo Center won't even come close to paying enough homage to the respect he deserves, but I still can't wait to see it built. RIP Ed, you are gone but you will never be forgotten and your impact on Philadelphia, the NHL, myself and so many other realms/walks of life will be felt forever. "

Throughout my first year here, I've been in about 3 Testing roles and one Software Analyst role, all with different clients.

I've received an offer from Goldman Sachs' Technology Divison, on a much better contract. The pay, location and professional qualifications I've been offered to work towards on my 4-year-paid-intern position is much better than the same 2 year paid intern deal offered by Accenture, but I'm not sure where the experience would be better.

Granted I won't move around as much and won't see nearly as many clients and mainly working with in-house softwares etc, but it's also in the Finance sector and is a big name in the tech startup space.

Looking at it from a standpoint, would making the jump to GS be more beneficial than ACN?

Thank you to anyone who can provide any input on this."

How is the program? Do you feel like the quality of education is high and challenging? What kind of internships and opportunities do students get. I have to choose between this and Rutgers Comp Sci.

4edle1,3,2016-04-11,"Teen looking to land a summer internship/job, preferably CS related",Sniksder16,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/4edle1/teen_looking_to_land_a_summer_internshipjob/,"So I found a local CS internship that's only requirements are that you know either C#, C++, or Java, know microsoft visual studio, and are in college. I am pretty proficient in java and know bits of JavaFX for GUI work (not that that would help at a large company), for the third requirement I am a high school senior headed to UMD for cs this fall so hopefully that will be close enough to what they want. The second requirement, microsoft visual studio, I do not fulfill but hopefully I could learn it before summer? I would like to know what to include on my resume for this internship application, and in case I dont land that opporotunity for jobs as well. 

My thoughts are: 

Over 200 hours of community service including:
-x 
-y
-z thing, not shown for privacy

I have enough experience with Java to create useful programs with minimal online research/reference and a growing knowledge of JavaFX, a Java GUI library.

Working knowledge of Google Analytics (id call myself like a 2.5/5 on this one, but feel like it is a good thing to write down)

Well... thats about it that I feel like I should 100% include, other things could be GPA, SAT (probably not? although I got a very high score), sports, clubs. Anyways thanks for reading, if you could leave advice for both types of applications (the internship, standard job) that would be great!

EDIT: so just found out that MVS is actually for app dev, I actually created an app dev club at my High School could be a good hook for my resume should I learn MVS and word it right.

I'm planning on getting a bar III suit from Macy's and bourbon AE Fifth Avenue's (nice deal on seconds). I wanted to get a charcoal suit but I'm worried that the bourbon is too light for charcoal. I also have the option of a light grey suit but I don't know if it's versatile enough for a second suit. What is your opinion? Thanks for the help!"
4edrxr,1,2016-04-11,My boyfriend [26 M] of two and a half years broke up with me [25 F] last night. He won't give me a straight answer as to why.,ripizzatime,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4edrxr/my_boyfriend_26_m_of_two_and_a_half_years_broke/,"this is a weird, long situation but i'm going to try to give the short version. my boyfriend and i have been in a semi-long distance relationship for two and a half years (three in july). we live in the same state, PA, but he lives in philadelphia and i live in pittsburgh. we see each other once, sometimes twice a month; sometimes our visits range from a weekend to a week long. point is, we're not in the position where we only see each other once or twice a year.

for as long as i've dated my boyfriend, he's been very discouraged and depressed over his career choice. he comes from a very wealthy family that was able to completely pay for his tuition at an expensive, semi-famous university for screenwriting/film studies, but he let his degree go nowhere and gave up far too easily on his goals. he went from working menial jobs at movie theaters to retail, and only just in the last year he got a pretty good job at an investment banking company working on the phones, which he claims to like as it finally gives him a purpose in life after feeling like a failure for so long (his words, not mine). he's changed very noticeably — he's very highly invested in his job and coworkers, he throws parties at his house for them, they go out every wednesday, the whole works. when this is pointed out, he gets very defensive and self-righteous about it.

i've been planning on going to school in his city since we started dating, but i also have back-up schools in new york city. we've talked about moving in together since we started dating, and he agreed to it but only after we've had the experience of living on our own for a while, which is understandable. last year from august to january of this year, i moved to california temporarily for an internship at disneyland, which was a big step that we talked about endlessly beforehand and agreed that it wouldn't be a problem in our relationship. midway through my internship, he was offered a promotion that required him to take a licensing test, which he endlessly stressed over; on my end, i was just trying to get used to living in a weird state with roommates who were pretty difficult to get along with. what all of this accumulated into were some very tense nerves that drove us to argue and all of that jazz. we've always made up afterwards, though, but i found it very aggravating that he never seemed to really understand *why* i was feeling upset and seemed to put his problems on a pedestal over mine.

when i got back in january, he tried to break up with me. we discussed things and talked them out, agreeing that things would be different now that i was home and he had his promotion. plus, i was finally in a position where i could start planning on moving to his part of the state in the fall for college. basically, things were really going to be different.

since then, we've been fine. i only just got a new job recently, but i've had more than enough money saved up so i've still been able to keep visiting him monthly for long stretches at a time. we've had arguments, but we've still been able to resolve them peacefully and without an issue. earlier in march, he gave me a key to his apartment.  we made plans to go to a concert in new york in may. just a few days ago, i got back from spending a week with him. things were just fine.

then on friday, i approached him asking if we could talk more about the future in light of the amazing week we spent together, because he told me it was on his mind. for the whole discussion, he was sullen, moody and quiet, especially when i told him that i planned on working part-time to pay for school. when he asked me what i planned on doing specifically for a job, i told him i didn't know, but i wasn't worried either way because i have some pretty stellar experience in customer service so i was confident i'd be able to find something. he didn't like this answer, and he didn't like that the school in philadelphia i planned on going to wasn't my first choice (NYU was, but realistically, the philly school would be more obtainable financially). the discussion ended in an argument because he started getting passive aggressive, and i told him he wasn't being very proactive talking about this, and he blew up because he thought i was talking about the relationship as a whole instead of his role in the conversation. i told him that i needed a few hours to cool down, and he agreed, and then he proceeded to completely ignore me until sunday night.

when i called him to ask if he was alright, he brought me on skype and flat out told me he didn't think this was working. when i asked why, he gave me so many different answers and they all contradicted each other. basically:

1) he had no confidence that i could take care of myself if i moved to the city because, in his words, ""i didn't have a job lined up immediately after i finished my internship and i spent our visit last week playing video games while he was at work when i could have gone outside"". this is coming from a man who only just moved out of his parents' house last year.

2) this distance depresses him and makes him anxious and sad. every time we spend time together in person, he's happy and we're just fine and have no problems, but the moment i leave he gets depressed again. he looks at all of his friends who are already engaged with SOs they live with and says he wants a ""normal"" relationship.

3) we've been dating ""for years and years"" (what the hell) and we're still no closer to bridging the distance than we were when we first started. when i told him that i was going to be moving to where he was in three months, he whined about it and said that the philadelphia school wasn't my first choice and i would only be moving for his sake and he didn't want that responsibility.

he then proceeded to do the thing that most people try to do when they want to break up but still want a person in their life to fill the void — ""let's still be friends"". i told him i couldn't do that with an ex, he wined more for a bit, tried to use how upset and confused against me because, in his words, he's been perfectly nice and civil and diplomatic. i told him goodbye, and here we are. he hasn't tried to contact me, but he's removed our status from facebook; he still has me friended though.

so yeah. really confused and just. really, really dazed and disassociated right now. i don't know if this was all my fault or his, and i don't understand why he'd do it because he never once told me he was this upset. he acknowledged that he never communicated and all he offered was one ""sorry"" after another, but he's made it clear that he doesn't want to change things. i don't know. i just don't know.

**tl;dr**: my boyfriend and i live six hours apart, but we were planning on living together this fall when i move to college. he has a new job and i had an internship that required me to temporarily move across country for four and a half months last year, which we apparently never recovered from. after a break-up scare in january of this year, we were making amazing progress and moving forward, and he actually gave me a key to his apartment. i spent a week with him last week, and when i returned home to ask him about making more concrete plans on moving in together, our discussion ended in an argument. he then proceeded to ignore me for two days and finally called me to tell me it was over, then gave me a multitude of reasons that contradicted his behavior up until now.

there are more details of course, but that's the short end of it. ask me whatever questions you want to get a better feel on things and i'll give it my best."
4edw6m,1,2016-04-11,Management Consulting Case Practise Group,USydCasePractise,usyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/4edw6m/management_consulting_case_practise_group/,"Hey guys,     

I want to get together a small group of people interested in meeting on a regular basis to practise case interviews.  
To excel at case interviews it needs to feel like second nature and there are tons of cases online from Wharton, Harvard, etc that we could practise on. 

**My proposal:**  
   
We all meet for coffee once a week (probably the weekend) and form pairs: 1 being the interviewer and 1 being the interviewee.   
We would have timed sessions to keep it as realistic as possible and at the end of it the interviewer would provide some feedback on what the interviewee could have done better or what other approach should have been taken.
And then we rotate partners and roles, etc.  
  
It also doesn't have to be strictly limited to cases, we could print out question banks of the typical behavioural interview questions and throw them into the mix as well so that everyone is kept on their toes and gets a chance to practise the STAR approach.      


Interviews are generally stressful and employers can see the fear in your eyes and your voice. Lack of practise and exposure is one of the main reasons people don't perform as well as they should during the interview. You'd probably be lucky to get 2 interviews during a typical internship round so it's best to make sure you'll be making the most of it.  

**Benefits:**  

1. Good practise and exposure in solving a variety of cases  

2. Building confidence for interviews  

3. Support network of hardworking and smart like-minded people  

4. Continuous opportunity for constructive feedback and growth  

5. Perspectives from both sides of the table (which helps in understanding the cues from your interviewer)  

  
**So if you have the following background:** 

1. Strong passion and interest for the management consulting industry  

2. Have done background reading on the case interview process or books such as 'Case in Point' or 'Case Interview'  

3. Are interested in dedicating an hour or 2 every weekend to practising case interviews  
   

  
Then please do pm me expressing your interest and perhaps your rough availabilities throughout the week. Also do drop in some info about yourself - Degree, year, work experience, case comps, etc  
  
I really do feel that practising regularly over the course of a year would greatly enhance your ability to do well in interviews. Your resume only gets you in the room. What you do in the room is what determines whether you get the job or not. Looking forward to working with you guys!

---------------------------

**Another packed month, so excuse the length of this post**

* After a wild weekend of partying, a picture of a drunk Keith the Cop wearing a g-string leaked onto FoundryMusic.com

* Colin Quinn makes his debut appearance on the July 3 show. Unsurprisingly, he’s the same as he’s every been and is very funny. Worth hearing.

* They have a couple of women come in to do live cat fighting. I forgot that cat fighting vids were a sort-of porn trend in the early ‘00s for some reason.

* Movies that the boys hate: Tomb Raider, Fast and the Furious, Pooty Tang. Ant couldn't wait for Planet of the Apes, but both hated it when it came out.

* [Steve C sounding gayer than he ever has in his entire life during this ""don't do drugs"" PSA](https://youtu.be/S1j0wNAgF2s?t=43m42s)

* Opie was talking about a mouse and he wanted to use the possessive plural form of the word, which we all know to be ""mice's"" ...he said meese's. He also said that their show isn't for everybody and is a ""required taste.""

* Stalker Patty is now living in a hotel/hostel with an entire floor of tenants that she has to share a single bathroom with. 

* To my knowledge, July 6, 2001 is the first show that features Line of the Day, but they don't go back to it again for the rest of the month.

* O&amp;A had a roadshow at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park that attracted 4,000 people and resulted in lots of public nudity.

* I'm convinced that John Valby and Doctor Steve are the same person. Their voices sound exactly the same. 

* A girl called in to play ""Guess what's in my pants"", only to reveal that he was a guy pretending to be a girl. It was funny and it really showed how played out and awful that game has gotten.

* Psycho Mark is suing the company to receive compensation for bits that he claimed to be either a part of or that he claimed to have created. Opie is angry, claiming that Mark wanted to try to get back on the show ever since he was fired. Mark had been appearing at live events and was calling into the show regularly like a needy douche that couldn't move on with his life, so apparently he began doubling down with this lawsuit. In a statement, he claims to have created the 55 gallon drum challenge, the Jay Mohr vs. Air Sick fight, the hot wax girl, and other extremely specific duties that really weren't bits as much as they were just things that are said over the airwaves during a radio show. Opie insinuates that Mark had sex with a lot of listeners he couldn't possibly have banged otherwise. 

* Brian Regan is in studio and he has plenty of prepared bits! It’s funny how whenever comedians come in studio, it's just a total “hang” as Opie likes to say. But with Regan, it’s pretty much a performance. Ant and Opie don’t seem to mind it at this point. In fact, Ant is totally in stitches despite probably being prompted off-air with how to set Brian up for his prepared bits.

* They started a series of bits called Cripple Bouts, where people with various disabilities box each other in studio. I think the title and premise is meant to be more shocking than the bit itself. One legged boxing and blind boxing both weren't that compelling to listen to. The show has been great at pulling off visual bits, but this one fell flat. 

* The boys did an [interview](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000384,00.html) in Time magazine with Joel Stein, and Anthony is disappointed that Opie was quoted so many times and Anthony was only quoted once saying that ""Mary Kate and Ashley Olson are hot."" They get Joel on the phone and he singlehandedly makes the two of them look like whiny babies. Joel just lets their criticism roll off his back by acting casually, while these two self destruct. Especially Anthony, he's livid. The interview was during the July 17 show and is worth hearing.

* [Rick Delgado bumbling like an idiot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT7lGjGN92c rick delgado bumbling like an idiot)

* During conversation, Opie jokingly said ""Wait til we start fighting, it's gonna be great"" 

* They interviewed a chick called Jackie Fine who was talking about some sort of sexual cream that increases libido. O&amp;A made fun of her, played sound clips, and had callers phone in just to make fun of her. I think it was the first of their interviews with random people who were trying to hawk something, and it was hilarious. 

* Ant and Jim feed off each other's pedophilia jokes. It seems like 50% of the jokes from both of them are about fucking kids, although granted at least Jimmy makes it absurd by implying his experiences are with toddlers. Ant is always talking about adolescent teens and it's pretty creepy in retrospect.

* Ant introduces to the show ""mollirama.com"", a website featuring young teen girls in provocative poses. He acts all, ""This is terrible!"" He's so appalled by it, more than everybody else. Then again, I mean, he was the one who brought it to the show...

* Norton never just hangs out, I've noticed. Every single line he says has to be a joke. He's good at improvising but it's also kinda needy that he has to prove his worth at every opportunity and can't just participate in a discussion. 

* Opie had to stay at a dirty hotel in Times Square. And guess what guys, he slept naked! And he wore the same underwear today that he had on yesterday!! He really relishes telling people about his poor hygienic habits.

* Ron and Fez intern Al Duke got drunk on air and started giving his assessment of other personalities at WNEW. He said Anthony gets along with everybody and is down to earth, but he thought Opie is a little standoffish and cocky. Opie immediately becomes indignant. 

* They love playing the “pull the strings!” soundclip from the Ed Wood movie

* July 25 - the legendary Cindy Williams from *Lavirne and Shirley* interview. They introduce the interview to her as the first in their ""Has-Been Corner"" interview series. Very cringe, a classic must-listen O&amp;A clip.

* Opie, who constantly says that he doesn't really care about Howard or what he does, sure does get triggered every time a Stern caller phones in. One such instance, he dug into how Howard sucks for close to 30 minutes. It’s kinda funny hearing how furious Opie gets at the drop of a hat, while insisting how he doesn't care at all about Howard. Meanwhile, Ant sits in the background and interjects occasionally. It seems like this is 100% Opie’s fight.

4ee14b,6,2016-04-11,1 month clean. My journey to dropping pot.,23almost24,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4ee14b/1_month_clean_my_journey_to_dropping_pot/,"
Hey all. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons but I want to first explain a bit of my background, get into my usage and run down what I did to quit smoking pot and hopefully this story speaks to someone out there dealing with a tough decision.
Alright, well to start off, I'll run it back to senior year of high school which is where my life started the slow downturn of my young life.  All throughout high school I had stayed away from pot and was heavy into sports up until senior year when lo and behold I quit them because of pot.  I used to look down on my friends using it and everything. (I was one of those guys back then) Even though my friends used it and offered it to me, I still turned it down up until the latter part of my senior year. Probably because I was tired of being on the outside looking in. Why I chose to start then, I'll never know but after being a month sober, I'm getting a better idea as to why I started, why I chose to stay smoking, and what made we want to quit. 
So I smoked for the first time ever at a party with two good friends out of a water bottle and foil and got really damn high and it was great. It was so fun and everything was hilarious. After eating a box full of cheese-its and popsicles, my friends let me know that if I liked how the high night went, then I should try their new bong out and feel what it really means to be high. So I did. And I fell in love with being high and swimming around my head filled all these new thoughts and crazy ideas and I didn't stop wanting that for 5 years. 
 All throughout college I smoked pot every.single.day. Freshman year I started off with a gram every two days or so and eventually snowballed into buying more and more amounts. The typical progression of a stoner. That first year, I was pledging a fraternity but dropped out because I was alienating myself from them with other pledges who just smoked pot and we all dropped. That hurt. I wasn’t part of the group anymore. I started smoking more to dull the pain. Then I broke up with my ex girlfriend of a year and a half because I wouldn't take the time to call or skype her anymore because I just wanted to get high. I just did not care anymore. I even joked with my friends how Mary Jane was the only girl for me and we laughed, but it definitely was not alright. We had been friends since like 6th grade and I had always dreamed of being with her.. Tried being sober for a week after the breakup but the pain was too deep to bear, so I smoked myself until I greened out every day until it was so far back in the past that I could barely remember it anymore. Sophomore year I was still hanging out with the guys I smoked with freshman year, and added more toking friends to the group. The sesh group grew larger. Super chill, but we all sucked each other into the rabbit hole even more and started to dab every day. During this year was when the highs started to reach down into lows and I'd have extreme self-conscious thoughts about everything and it came to a boiling point where I had to go to the hospital because I had a panic attack. (Though I will say we mixed a dab and herb blunt with K2 which did not help *insert facepalm here*) I should've pressed the pause button and reevaluated my life and where I was going but I was scared that I had wasted 2 years and I did the only comfortable thing I had known which was to smoke and dab more in hopes that the pain of regret would subside. We'd laugh about our problems and play our abuse off as a joke but it was beginning to become a serious problem. Some fractured off and began to purely sell. Junior year I moved in with a group of old friends but we all still smoked every day. Same old shit, different day. Surprisingly this was a high point in college, I guess the sex  and night life made it feel that way because I had turned 21 but the whole time my grades were slipping, and slipping. I had started off with a 4.0 at the end of freshman year but was getting into the 2.8s and eventually ended with a mediocre 3.0 when I graduated college. I say mediocre because I know I could have personally done so much better.  I wasn't reaching my full potential and I didn't feel like trying hard because my half-baked mind said that just getting through college was good enough which brings me to my ultimate point. 
For roughly 5 years I had been under the influence, just stagnating; complacent in my comfortable little life. But then I graduated and went on the hunt for a job with no internship experience because I was high those summers I should've been working.  I had a job for 4 months after graduation but I washed out because I thought I'd just get high for a little longer while living at home and find a new job in no time. That didn't work out and that's when reality hit me like an 18 wheeler carrying a ton of bricks. Sleepless nights, night terrors dealing with past decisions I made, etc. After revisiting this sub, I decided to get sober and so I did because the stories spoke so much to me and I knew it was now or never.  I finished my final sack and started to get clean and it’s been a month since then. And the great part is that I smoked on my 30th day just to know if I wanted it back or not and after hitting a joint with my brother, I turned down the 2nd hit. I had already made up my mind that I didn’t want anymore, I just felt guilty to myself that I was even doing this again. So my willpower grew a little that day and I exercise that every day by turning it down from family and friends. What I can say about being sober is first the pain hits from all the lost relationships knowing you ghosted away from people you cared about because you wanted to be with people who were just dragging you back into bad habits. That hurts, but it’s a necessary step to growing and maturing as a man/woman. Then I started regaining my long lost focus, my drive, and motivation. Oh and NO CONFLICTING THOUGHTS. I can’t stress that enough but my high and sober brain fight each other on so many issues it was just exhausting to deal with. I learned to channel my down time into more productive hobbies like picking up my guitar again, shooting hoops and working on personal projects while visiting friends I lost touch with. I learned that I was just getting high to pass time. A big life lesson I learned is that idle time will make you lose your mind. 
 I know I rambled but I really hope someone reads this and makes the step in a positive direction before you reach my age. Its better you learn sooner than later because the pain, the regret only builds more and more.  I wake up every day and feel the pain of regret, of knowing I capped my life doing the bare minimum, not branching out more and keeping up relations with regressive friends who I don’t even talk to anymore. I was done with that, I didn’t want to settle anymore. I want to reach for the stars like I used to.  I look forward to making a comeback story because I fell wayyyy off the map, and I know someone reading this has too. But let’s not give ""those"" people the gratification that “they were right about us” and let’s get back to knocking things out of the park. Let's exceed our own expectations. I’m 23 almost 24 and I know there is a new beginning around the corner.

The legend goes that every 100 years, the baseball gods bless a child with extraordinary talent. Names such Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron are just little pebbles compared to the talent the baseball gods give this one small infant child.

It's a damn shame they chose me, or should I say.. Tom Song

You see, Tom Song is not a bad guy, he's actually one of the kindest people there is.. It's just the fact he's an idiot.. Like... He may possibly be the most talented and most 'special' person on the planet. 

Tom Song was found completely by chance, he had heard that pitchers liked to throw 'Cheese' and wanted to go take some delicious cheddar for himself. Luckily for him, the manager of the East coast Team found Mr. Song before he could bite the baseball, and then decided to see (for laughs) Tom Song swing a bat...

The first pitch, Tom hit the ball so far that there's rumor it's being studied by North Korea as a possible Weapon of Mass Destruction..

From there, Tom Song began his journey to the Major leagues, and hijynx insued..

Like the time he was locked inside a fridge, only to be found in the 8th inning by an intern, and later hitting the game winning Home Run

Or after his first AAA game, when the reporter had asked him how he felt, and he simply replied ""Cream Spinach""

Tom Song, the most talented player in baseball

4ee757,6,2016-04-11,High schooler. Grown cynical and hate my life.,Sphalerus,Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/4ee757/high_schooler_grown_cynical_and_hate_my_life/,"     I'd like to tell you my story and how I feel so that I can vent and see if anyone else feels similar. This will be a bit disjointed, as I have so many thoughts I'm trying to put in here. Here's a little backstory: I am a male, way more mature than my age group, am a strong Christian, I am trusted by those who know me (ex. my mom gives me her credit card and leaves for a while and knows that I won't buy anything other than what I said I would), I am self-confident, don't submit to peer pressure, and am naturally introverted. 
     I am nearing the end of my freshman year of high school. I've hated every bit of it. I'm introverted and introspective so I naturally keep to myself and think about things. But, I think that I might think too much about life. About who I am, about human nature, and about why we are here in the first place. I've grown cynical this past year. I've always loved life and have been looking forward to the future, but now I most definitely don't love it.
     I can't figure out, what the hell is the point? We all are raised from a little kid, and we are taught that we should go through school, get good grades, go to college, get broke, get a full-time job, marry someone, have kids, and teach them to do the exact same thing. It's just so stupid to me. I don't want to lead some ""normal"" life where every day at some boring old job you know exactly what is going to happen, do the same boring thing every day, and complain about your stupid petty little problems, like the weather, that the coffee machine at work wasn't working, that something was marginally less than what you were expecting, or that someone cut you off on the road. What's the point of living like that? It's pointless, there's nothing to live for other than conforming to what society has put in place for you. People watch home improvement shows like Fixer Upper and dream of having a house like they have at the end. But that never happens. Humans are full of empty dreams and empty promises. Humans dream and think of what could be better and do nothing about it. It seems I've lost much of my hope in the world. I'm hoping when I graduate high school things will change as I intern, do undergrad on something that actually interests me, and get a job that is interesting and you never know what is going to happen.
     People say ""just be a kid"" and ""just get good grades and have fun, high school is a time you'll never get back"". I can't enjoy it, and I sure hope I don't get it back. I HATE high school. All students find it pretty boring, but generally like it, but I hate everything. I hate having to go to seven class periods every single boring day and learn about some stupid thing that I couldn't care less about. Sure, you get some more choice later on in high school, but none of the classes they have really interest me. Not as much interests me anymore. My curiosity and creativity level has drifted to an all-time low. People say that if you are doing something that you don't like or aren't happy with, then stop doing it. That's how I feel with school. I'm going to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 because I can't imagine myself being in this place for 3 more grueling years. I hate the people on the bus that complain about Guard and band, I hate that everyone is so immature and brainwashed to believe what I described about life in the first paragraph. I hate being treated like some kid that can't reliably make his own decisions, I hate teachers shushing students and forcing them to do things. I don't belong here. I like talking with adults more, especially people in their 20s and low 30s. Everyone at high school is just so immature.
     I've grown cynical. As you can tell from above, I hate my life. I can see all of the flaws in people clear as day. I walk downstairs, head down, see my mom in my peripherals, raise my head and force a smile. I smile and laugh with my family, my friends, but what no one knows is that underneath I just want to run. I want to yell and scream. I want to run as far away from this hell-hole as I can. To escape having to act ""okay"" and ""fine"" all the time, and to escape all of these people. I dread every single day, each class period feels like an entire day has passed by. I have the self-control to hide my emotions, but one day I may snap. I feel like running outside into the rain and screaming and crying about the pettyness of life, and of my life. There's no point in living if you hate every minute of it. That isn't an exaggeration. And no, I'm not going to commit suicide, or become depressed (I'm not sad, I'm annoyed, angry, and frustrated.)
     I haven't told anyone any of this information. There's no one that I fully trust. Not my family or friends. Just me and my hidden emotions. No one really knows me. My mom doesn't. My friends don't. They think they do but have no idea who I have changed into. I probably missed something to say up above, so if you have any questions please ask.

I am going to be graduating in a month with a CS degree and will be starting a CS PhD program in the fall. Because I didn't decide to go to grad school until late, I just started looking for internships, and so I haven't had much luck. I'm also specifically looking for ones in Seattle which doesn't help.

I've done many (4) internships already, two at Google, and have interest specifically in NLP and computational linguistics. I'm really not picky about pay or type of work, because I've been either working or in school for 4 years and will probably feel really bored if I don't have some kind of job. Obviously I'd prefer something in my field but I have many personal projects and research going on in that area so it's not so important.

I've been looking up startups in Seattle (I figure many of the major tech companies are out of internships; I know that Google is unfortunately) and trying to get a list of some other companies which might be hiring anyone involved in tech... even low-level IT jobs (I never had that experience, so might as well do it now!). Does anyone have suggestions on where else I can look (job boards, list of companies, etc.)? Or even better, larger tech companies that you might know are still hiring?

Thanks!"

I (21 M) have been seeing this girl (21 F) for a little over a month. Pretty infrequent dates (twice a week, occasionally thrice). Mainly because we're both crazy busy. Neither of us is dating other people. I'd like to just hang out casually more often in addition to formal ""dates""
Things have gone at a pretty good pace (not fast, but not crazy slow). Made out on date 4 which was a couple of weeks ago. Didn't go for sex since I like to know that things are serious before that. We discussed that so we both know where we stand.
After the first make out, she brought up the dtr conversation. I told her I'd like to keep things going, and then waited for her response. She basically said she likes me, but isn't sure if she's ready for a relationship. In my head, I was saying ""okay, what do you consider this then?? If we're both not seeing other people and we do couply stuff, isn't that a relationship. If things ended, it'd pretty much be a breakup in my mind""
I was left feeling pretty confused, but we decided to keep things going how they were. Since then, communication has been much better (way more open about concerns and pretty much everything). However, we haven't gone back to the dtr topic yet. It's been a few weeks since then. Should I bring it back up or just wait...?
Normally, ""I'm not sure if I'm ready"" says to me ""sorry, buddy, not going to happen"". However, she's dealing with a lot right now :/ (friends, family, being burnt by past relationships) . I'm trying to be supportive and not pushy about defining things, but at the same time, I can't go on forever only seeing someone without knowing where they stand. Am I stressing too much about the label? Any other tips?

EDIT: My post wasn't quite clear. At first, we hung out once a week max. Sometimes every other week because of a family trip I went on. That went on for about a month. When I said a little over a month, I probably should have said a little under two months.
The frequency has gradually ramped up. Usually we'll meet during the day during the week and get lunch or walk around town or some sort of activity. These are typically short 1-2 hours. It's a very inconsistent thing (one week 3 short dates, other times almost two weeks between dates).
Then we'll usually hang out on the weekend for a longer ""date"" 4+ hours. First make out was only two weeks ago. We both have been ridiculously busy with exams and during the past two weeks only met up to eat lunch together---not a whole lot of intimacy there because of the setting (medium/short kiss at the end). We both have internships in the same city (we'll be working in buildings right next door to eachother) this summer, so hopefully there'll be more time to explore wherever this thing is headed.
Both of us have been good about not letting this ""relationship"" take time away from plans with friends. I think that's a good sign. However, communication outside of dates is lacking in my opinion. Maybe that's a matter of us getting more comfortable with eachother and will improve with time idk.
I guess my main confusion stems from the fact that after making out, she brought up the dtr convo. Like, if you need time to think about that, why bring it up? I would have rather just had her say, let's do (insert activity or even ""something"") (insert general time frame) and leave it at that. If I wasn't sure where I stood, I would just keep going on a few more dates/ getting to know the person.
Guess all I can do is make the most of it, have fun with her, and wait. Seems like she is interested given that she still wants to do stuff, but legitimately unsure of her own situation. My main struggle is finding the balance between keeping things going and coming on too clingy. I imagine we'll only get busier as finals approach and prob be able to do stuff every 7-10 days max until summer. Any tips for frequency of communication during that time period? Want to give her space, but also be there"
4eebe6,17,2016-04-11,My hood rat horror story.,Down_South_Donte,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/4eebe6/my_hood_rat_horror_story/,"About four months ago, everything was perfect. Three clean, quiet students lived in this apartment. We all got along and respected each other. Any minor problem that we had would quickly resolve itself through civil conversation. All this ended once my roommate, Dylan, subleased his room in order to move away for his internship.

Once the new guy, La'Darius, moved in, hell gradually let loose. I noticed that there was another guy that was ALWAYS here. He didn't seem to go to school or work. He just stayed in the apartment blasting music and smoking weed. Turns out that La'Darius had his boyfriend living with him. I didn't think much about it, until they started taking 45 minute showers 3 times a day... EACH. They were always in there, and it made it hard for me to ever get in there. I decided to talk to them about it, and they replied with: ""Nigga, I pay my share of rent here, and I can use the motherfuckin' shower whenever I want to."" Me being not-so-aggressive got over it. I started to leave the water bill on their door, and they stopped showering so much.

Cleanliness was the first problem I had with them. They constantly shaved, but would leave the hair in the sink and all over the floor. The boyfriend eventually started using MY sink, and would leave his clippers and hairballs in it. I asked him to stop, but he kept doing it. Whenever they would cook, they would somehow get grease in every stove eye, which would always cause our apartment to become smokey. Pots and pans were piled everywhere, and they never cleaned them. They also thought everything in the apartment belonged to them, and would take food, equipment, chairs, etc. to use for themselves. If we asked where something went, they would pretend to have no idea where it went.

After a while, I started noticing that the apartment wreaked of marijuana on a regular basis. I politely asked them to stop smoking in the apartment, especially when my girlfriend is over, and they ignored me. The weed was so strong, I had to take a drug test because my manager smelled it on me. I was fed up, so my roommate and I called the landlord, who then he gave La'Darius multiple fines for drug possession and for having someone live with him. That pissed them off, so they started calling me a ""bitch ass nigga"" repeatedly.

A month later, they're still doing the same things they got fined for... only now, they have a dog, which is completely against the lease. My roommate and I specifically said we did not want any pets, but again, they ignored us. The dog kept whining throughout the night, and it was making it hard for me to sleep. It was also making their room smell really bad. We complained to them, yet they ignored us again, so I complained to the landlord again. He wrote them another fine. Again, they were mad and I got called a ""bitch ass nigga."" repeatedly.

Some time later, they got into a huge brawl. The boyfriend was beating La'Darius and he was yelling for help. My roommate and I burst into their room and had to break it up. They ended up fighting right outside our door, and everyone was looking. We called the cops, and they both ran away. Turns out it's because one, or both, of them has a warrant out for them.

The boyfriend stopped living there for a few weeks after the fight, and everything was somewhat back to normal. I even started talking to La'Darius a little bit more on a friendly level. Eventually, the boyfriend started to live there again. At first, La'Darius was trying to hide him, but the boyfriend gradually started going out in the open again. We decided to not say anything at first, but the problems started occurring again. While La'Darius was at school, the boyfriend would stay home all day smoking weed and blasting music. I would ask him to turn it down so I could study, and he would for 5 minutes... then he would gradually make it louder. One day, I came home from class, and saw a huge, HUGE bag of weed that was forgotten on the living room table, and the apartment employees were doing inspections. If they were to find the weed, we would all get hit with a major fine. I notified them of what I saw, and the landlord hit La'Darius with another fine. They threatened me and started chanting ""bitch ass nigga"" repeatedly... again. Then they said: ""if we get one more fine, nigga, yo car gon' get it and yo stuff gon' get it.""
I was freaked out because they're relentless. I have thousands of dollars worth of stuff in my room and a fairly new car, but no proof of the threat.

A few weeks later, I came home around 11 AM to our door completely kicked open. The maintenance employees and the landlord both agree that someone used force to get in. My good roommate and I both carpool so school, so it was definitely not him. Our apartment is also on the ground floor and facing a busy road, so no random guy would try to break into a random apartment. Neither one of us had anyone angry at us, and we also lived there for several years without that happening to us or anyone else. I was furious because we had a $400 TV sitting in there, and I knew it had something to do with my roommate. We called the cops and filed a report. When the cops were here, we saw the boyfriend turn away from the apartment quickly then disappear. When they found out they were accused, they then started yelling ""bitch ass nigga"" and started with the threats.

Many more things happened, but this story is too long as it is. I'm getting the money to transfer apartments now. I'm not going to risk anything happening to my belongings.

I'm a prospective student to San Francisco State University (SFSU) and University California Riverside (UCR). I'm trying to choose between the two (though I'm leaning towards UCR).

I feel like the location is a very important factor. I know that people in the industry are hired for their **experience** which is shown in a reel/video and internships related to my industry of choice (cinematography). 

I'll list out the pros and cons of each place to make things simple.
 
**UCR**

Riverside is located an hour out of LA. This means that there are significant more film opportunities (internships and areas in general). Riverside is however, not as well known for their film. Though, some people give them some good words. Class wise, there are around 8-10 related to my major that is applicable.


**SFSU**

SFSU is located in San Francisco, where there is a ridiculous amount of tech startups and businesses. This means that there may be opportunities to intern/work with the start ups to help get their name out there. However, I don't think there are more opportunities than Riverside. Now, SFSU is known much more for their film. They've had students work on animation for movies that blew up in the box office (I can't remember which, but it was a fact stated by sfsu). SFSU has a HUGE list of classes for cine that I would also benefit for. I'd say they are more hands on.


I really don't know which to choose. LA is a great location for the film industry, but SFSU has a lot of in depth classes for the industry. One could argue I could learn just as much with the information online, but eh, I don't know.


What do you guys think? I'm just looking for a little bit of insight so I can choose what's best for me. I'm not asking you to choose for me.


Thanks in advance from everyone, hopefully this post is in the right place and not bothersome."
4eegwx,0,2016-04-12,Miscellaneous questions(and frustrations) of an atypical applicant,CSjrthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4eegwx/miscellaneous_questionsand_frustrations_of_an/,"Hey guys, hopefully this post maintains some semblance of organization, but I decided to make it on a whim. And I know the information I provide won't be enough to make a true judgement call regarding job offers/interviews/etc. but I would like your opinion.

Background: I have ~3 years of college under my belt, which was cut short by financial issues. I am coming up on the 1 year mark of being out of school, and have been unable to land myself a job. Throughout this year of free time, I have been doing freelance work on Upwork which I thought would be a 'plus' on the resume (I have also greatly enjoyed doing it). All in all, I have been programming for about 7 years and have done non-trivial projects in C++/Python/Java, along with varying experience in C#/Javascript/HTML and a handful of frameworks. I've also developed on Windows / OS X / and Linux, and deployed to both AWS and Azure.

My freelance projects have ranged from webscrapers and server utility scripts to openCV+OCR text extraction solutions and business acquisition software for the largest franchisee of a well-known franchise in the US. Most of these are on my github, either in their entirety or redacted/dumbed-down to look-out for my clients with competitors.

Now for my questions, directed mainly at people with experience doing the hiring.. in regards to an entry-level position, btw.

What would be your initial thoughts if a resume with these things on it crossed your desk? Call / don't call? Incomplete education is a red flag, but how big of a red flag?

Have any of you heard of a more unconventional internship for someone like me, since I am struggling to get hired full-time(US)? I haven't come across any in my job search.

My confidence has taken a big hit over this time period, which I think has reflected in my interview experiences. The 2 coding interviews I have gotten, one I did great on and got denied (I think they doubted my ability to explain technical details to clients), and the other revolved around a language not even on my resume so I did not do well at all. I have also gotten 2 HR type interviews, where I didn't get to proceed to a coding interview. 

My resume and cover letter were reviewed by my University's career department as well as by various people that I respect. I have applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs.

The only big mistakes I may be making are a) I am only applying to jobs within ~45 minutes of my current residence, b) I don't live near where I grew up or went to University so I have no contacts, c) I haven't had the nerve to ""cold call"" potential contacts on LinkedIn d) anything I may have over-looked. It also just occurred to me that I could attend local meet-ups to make connections, does anyone have experience with this? Did you get a job from it?

Any other advice for someone like me?"

At 26 I had a corner office in uptown Charlotte and spent more time on the golf course than ever before. We were selling websites for $50K to $10M+ companies and had a great time doing it.

&amp;nbsp;

I park my car and head into the office. The owner is sitting at his desk. He looks at me and says ""There's no reason for you to be here, the company doesn't exist"". He and his business partner had a disagreement and dissolved the company.

&amp;nbsp;

Shit.

&amp;nbsp;

I had just married Shannon the month before where my best man referenced the agency in his speech. If I ever forget the name I'll watch the wedding video.

&amp;nbsp;

Up to this point my resume reads as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

Economics degree from party school

Car Sales - 3 years

Website Sales - 8 months

&amp;nbsp;

I had just gotten out of the car business and could easily go back and make great money. However, I wasn't willing to put the strain on my new marriage. I was lucky that Shannon had an income and was able to buy me some time to figure out the next step.

&amp;nbsp;

What to do? I reached out to Peg, our neighbor, and asked if she would help me find a career. I wasn't asking her to call in a favor, just to help me with the process. As a wedding gift she agreed. To this day, that was the best wedding gift we received. The owner of the website company came in second with a full set of All Clad stainless steel cookware.

&amp;nbsp;

**1st Meeting: What do YOU want?**

&amp;nbsp;

Our 1st meeting was over coffee at Barnes &amp; Noble. I felt smarter just sitting there. The whole meeting consisted of her helping me find out what I would actually enjoy doing day in and day out. We focused a lot on the environment, e.g. indoor/outdoor, people/no people, travel/no travel, computer screen/no screen, AM/PM, etc. No one had ever asked me these questions and it was an enlightening experience. My homework was to spend some time thinking about those questions.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**2nd Meeting: So this is want you want.**

&amp;nbsp;

At our 2nd meeting we reviewed and came to the conclusion that being an Account Executive at an advertising agency was my dream job. There was just one glaring problem, my resume. No agency would higher me or even take the time to interview. I might have been able to start as an intern and perhaps worked my way up. However, Shannon's funds were running low and I needed to make a good paycheck right off the bat. Peg knew I was good in front of people, it was just getting in front of them was the problem.

&amp;nbsp;

**3rd Meeting: The Informational Interview**

&amp;nbsp;

At our 3rd meeting Peg brought a large magazine. It was the Book of Lists for Charlotte, which as you guessed, lists the top 50 of every imaginable category. She had bookmarked the page that had the top 50 advertising agencies in the city. She pointed to #1 and said that I need to call them and ask for the president and get a 10 minute informational interview with them. She explained that an informational interview is where I ask what the perfect Account Executive looks like in their eyes. I was to report back at our next meeting.

&amp;nbsp;

So how did I pull this off? A lot of people get hung up on the receptionist when calling up a company. They can't get past them to talk to the president. This is one of the advantages of the informational interview, it is completely innocent. Most people are receptive to helping someone else if it doesn't require a lot of their time and doesn't put them in a bad light. Know this, and this is true of 99% of CEO's, they love giving advice and hearing how great they are. The absolute best way to get in front of them is to stroke their ego. Let them know you are asking because they are the best in the business, and if they can spare 10 minutes, you are happy to meet them when &amp; where they want. Usually the best time for them to meet is early in the AM before their day starts or late in the PM after their day is over. It's important to stress this will NOT take a lot of their time and even a few minutes is appreciated. They will give you more time if the conversation is going well. Once I got the meeting I went in, stroked their ego, asked my questions, actually listened to their answers, and thanked them for their time. All questions were based around ""what the perfect Account Executive looks like"" and then a few additional questions that expanded on possible answers. e.g. responsibilities, attitude, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**The 4th Meeting: Rinse &amp; Repeat**

&amp;nbsp;

At our 4th meeting I proudly reported on the completion of my assignment. We reviewed what I had learned. There were a couple of phrases and acronyms used during the interviews that I didn't know and had to look up. Little did I know I was learning the vernacular (the way the CEO talked) through this exercise. Peg smiled and looked and me and said, ""now do the same thing for #2 - #5"". I got to work.

&amp;nbsp;

**Holy Shit: This is an actual Interview**

&amp;nbsp;

By the time I got to agency #5 some interesting things were happening. My comfort level about what was required of an Account Executive was extremely high. The level of my questions were advancing since agencies #1 - #4 had given me a ton of info. I was dropping names of the CEOs of the top #4 agencies relaying how I had meetings with them as well. The #5 agency said they would provide more info at another meeting if I was interested. I happily agreed. It was only halfway through the second meeting when the VP said ""this position would require you to do"" that I realized I was in an actual interview. We finished the meeting and I reported back to Peg. She suggested that I follow up with a thank you gift. She suggested one baby Timberland boot in a box with a note that said ""Thank you for your time. I'm ready to kick some butt"",  piggy backing of the phrase ""kick butt"" which was used during the second meeting with the agency.

&amp;nbsp;

I got the job and the salary of an Account Executive with 2-3 years experience.

&amp;nbsp;

This is a great example of being [slightly above average] (http://www.stephenhuneycutt.com). It took a phone call and maybe an hour of my life for each Informational Interview. I'm not brilliant, I didn't say anything witty, I just took the time to learn. I know a lot of people who have spent more than 5 hours in finding a job.

&amp;nbsp;

Not a bad weeding gift at all.

Of course I gave him his first kiss on the lips, then I totally fell in love with him. Since then, I keep on falling deeper and deeper into him. The bad thing is we have to keep things secret, sigh.

We went to Baskin Robbins and I got some cappucino blast. I couldn't be with my baby because he went to DC for his religious stuff. That's what I need to figure out. Do I pull him away from his religion? Mrs. Slavic is all up in my face about it. She said stuff like, ""Well Adnan used to be religious and strict last year, but this year he is so loose..."" like I change him. Actually, I did and I don't want to pull him away from who he is. I think I need time to organize these things. But I do know one thing. I love him and he loves me. Nothing will change that. I'll try a recess and see what happens. I'll probably kill myself if I lose him, but I'll go crazy if things... complicating things. I wish he'd call back soon.* [[as read by Debbie at trial.](https://app.box.com/s/j8abt6wmbgf79zp41rtzll7xtq1mi7eu)]

**Friday, May 15, 1998** 

- Hae tells Adnan she wants to take a week long break. 

- 1:AM: Hae writes in her diary: *I did it. Me and Adnan are officially on recess week -- a time out. I don't know what's going to happen to us. Although I'm in love with him, I don't know about him. He actually suggests that what we have is like not love. I heard the doubt in his voice. Although he couldn't pick up mine, I felt the same way. I like him. No, I love him. It's just all pressed in the middle. His religion and Muslim customs are the main thing. It irks me to know that I’m against his religion. He called me a devil a few times. I know he was only joking, but it’s somewhat true. I hate that. It's like making him choose between me and his religion. The second thing is the possessiveness. Independence (indiscernible). I'm a very independent person. I rarely rely on my parents... Although I love him, it's not like I need him. I know I'll just be just fine without him, and I need some time for myself and (indiscernible) other than him. How dare he get mad at me for planning to hang to with Aisha?  The third thing is the mind play. I'm sure it's out of jealousy. Shit. I don't get jealous. And I think whoever is trying to get me jealous is a fool because you'll definitely lose me. I prefer a straight relationship that don't get people mixed in just he wanted to play mind games. The fourth thing is nothing. It's just that I do love him. It's just all the shitty things are messing with my mind. I'm just too confused. If I don't take the time to set things straight, the whole thing will build on my head making me mad and I'll do something I'll regret forever. That's why I need the time out. I just hope that I don't lose him because of this. I love him and I told him I wanted it to be forever. I feel secure and comfy with him. I think he expected more of a spontaneous combustion. That's not going to happen all the time. Our relationship was great for me at first, then eventually calmed down. We started strong and now we've settled in the very secure and loving relationship. I don't want what he wants. All I want is him to hold onto, to cuddle up to, to kiss when I feel empty. Sigh. Maybe I'm supposed to be loved, but supposed to love. And I thought I had found another keeper and maybe have. Hopefully, we'll go through this and come out much stronger even with a stronger foundation. I love him. I can live without him, but I love him and want him with me. Please, Adnan, be patient with me.* [[as read by Debbie at trial.](https://app.box.com/s/j8abt6wmbgf79zp41rtzll7xtq1mi7eu)]

4eetzd,2,2016-04-12,Is this a plausible dream?? (Music school),howardthepianist,classicalmusic,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/4eetzd/is_this_a_plausible_dream_music_school/,"So I'm currently a 21 year old studying Computer Science in college. I've also been playing the piano for 11 years (Started when I was 7, Stopped when I was 17 for personal reasons and picked it up again when I was 20 over the summer). The three year gap really did me in though as I forgot most of the pieces in the repertoire I built up but the technique is all still there (I took lessons over the summer with 3 teachers and a professor who all said that my technique was still impressive). As I did my software engineering internship this past summer, I realized that I don't want to be coding my whole life. I don't mind coding for a while but I just don't want to do it my whole life. This was around the same time I was struggling with a depressive episode and picking up the piano and playing it again made me realize how much I missed playing the piano. I was playing around 5-6 hours a day and I found myself loving the instrument again. When the school year started, I always made sure to block out time to play the piano for 2 hours a day and I still block out this time unless I'm completely swamped (ie finals week: where I still managed to get 2-3 hours a day...). Anyway I thought about alternatives since I don't want to be coding my life and after a lot of sleepless nights, I think I want to go to music school after I graduate in CS to pursue a piano performance degree. I don't want to be a performer of any sort, I dislike playing in front of people and I don't think its plausible at this point. However I really enjoy teaching the piano to others, I taught my friend the Chopin Nocturne Op 9 No 2, and the rewarding feeling I got when he finally could play the whole piece was something I never got writing code. I guess I just realized my passion to teach and play music this past summer.

Anyway now I'm wondering how plausible it is for me to go to music school. I've put a lot of thought into this and I really would like to go. I've talked to my parents about this and they said they would consider supporting me since I already have my computer science degree and my teacher has always been supportive. So I wonder out of the options listed below, which is the most reasonable.

1. Graduate, take a few classes part time while programming (theory, history and aural training), expanding my repertoire and studying with a teacher, eventually stop coding and go to a  full time grad program for piano performance. (This is my preferred method but I realize that I may need an undergrad. Advice is welcome)
2. Do the same thing except go for an full time student undergrad degree for piano performance before going for a grad degree.
3. Both are unreasonable. You're being stupid.
4. You don't need a degree to enjoy playing the piano or teaching it

Any other options are welcome too. Also if I was to transfer credits, how long would it take to finish an undergrad degree even with recital requirements?
I don't want to be in school for over 3 years, but if it isn't reasonable to finish in 3 years, I would be OK with staying longer.

Tl:dr - I realized my passion for playing and teaching the piano this past summer again and I want to go to music school. How plausible is this?"
4eeue4,8,2016-04-12,What to do if I can't get an internship offer?,bhargavat,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4eeue4/what_to_do_if_i_cant_get_an_internship_offer/,"So I'm a Software Engineering major. So far, it looks like my first 2 years have not exposed me to coursework that gives me the confidence I need to sell myself to companies. For most of my projects, there was always someone that was far superior at developing than the rest of the group members, which made it difficult for me to prove to employers that I played an important role in that project. 

What I don't get is that several people with the same level of technical skills as me are getting internships while I am not. Their extracurriculars are stronger than mine, but I fail to see how that will help them in a technical environment. I have a 3.6 GPA in my university and around 3.5 if you count the courses I transferred over. A part of me thinks that I don't have a strong technical background and another part of me tells me that what I have is enough for an internship level position since some people who relied mostly on coursework to teach them the skills needed were able to land internship positions. I believe it's too late now because most of the internship listings are too old and there aren't very many of them anymore. Seems like I missed my chances of landing one when I failed to get an offer after 3 of the interviews that I received. 

What I plan on doing as a backup is enroll in community college to learn new programming languages and perhaps do a personal project, while working part-time at a electronic store or something. "

**Pedigree**:

* 32 years old.  Tall white dude, no affirmative action love for me.  Rapidly going grey, thankfully not going bald.
* BA CS, MBA Info Assurance (first-year MBA curriculum and then second-year courses same as business school's one year MS Info Assurance), law degree.
* Five years of solo law practice (financial privacy, asset protection, regulated industries/financial sector, and varied litigation experience).
* Four years teaching databasing and applied programming (TA in grad school, MS Access and VB, 1500 students).
* Three years sysadmin (in undergrad).
* Managed non-profit student-owned legal services office.
* Internships in software development and Big 4 SAS 70/SSAE16 auditing.
* Peer-reviewed scholarly article (best paper at my large state's cybersecurity conference) on HIPAA database privileges for first responders in the wake of natural disasters; peer-reviewed law review articles on virtual property, virtual world regulation and policing intellectual property infringement in Second Life; advice for employers on PCI-DSS compliance and several general HR publications.

**Gameplan**:

1. I'm in a small-ish town (1.5M people in the metro) with a newly-opening 24x7x365 SOC for a large regional bank.  I'm gunning for their SOC analyst position (BS + interest in cybersec posted minimum quals) to get back into the fold.

2. In two years I hope to move into a more specialized position within the SOC or the security team (at the same company or elsewhere); either SOC lead or on the incident response team.  I think IR makes the most sense from my background and interests.  I intend to get the CISSP (because HR drools on it &amp; the experiential requirement) during this time.

3. I figure I may need to relocate to a bigger city/change employers after 2 or 3 more years for a managerial position steering operations or perhaps security architect, get the CISM, and maybe another move after a few more years for a C-level position steering policy and risk management.

**Comedy Alternate Gameplan**:  Enlist in the Navy for 6 years.  Do cryptologic technician (""Navy hacker"") rating to wipe out my student loans and get certifications, and then do main gameplan beginning at #2.  I think this is a bad idea because the private sector has more potential in information security and policy than the government.  Even including government contracting, which I figure is full of ex-officers and retired career enlistedmen with a strong good old boy network.

**Questions**:

1. Are there other roles after the SOC that merit consideration over incident response based on my background?  Is there a speciality that is more frequently a feeder for executive security roles?  I considered audit but figured that there's less promotion potential out of audit than incident response.

2. Security+ (like a lot of CompTIA) seems like a retread; I get 90% of the practice questions right.  Should I get it if on my own dime?  I put my odds of doing DoD 8570 work pretty low.

3. Any opinions of the Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP/US)?  Encounter any in your work?

4. Would staying firmly in one regulated industry (e.g. financial or health) be preferable over experience in that and another industry, or in a less-regulated industry (consumer goods, tech startup, etc.)?

5. Should my gameplan include a stop at a vendor/managed service provider/consultancy (e.g. Accenture, Palantir, Dell, FIS, Big 4) or stay in-house the whole way?

**The $64,000 questions**:  Is it feasible?  If I perform like a goddamn superstar is it reasonable?  If not, what changes would you make to the gameplan and expectations?

Thank you for your wisdom and for having read this far."

So much to say that I love him brings tears to my eyes. I love you to death. I'd love to be with you right now. I saw him at track meet when he ran that 400x2. He's so dedicated to running and it makes him seem very sexy... Our table as usual where he kissed me and sighed when I drove away from him. Then we're gone. I know, as I always have, that Adnan's warm smile is the one I can't live without. You love the one you can't live without. I can't imagine my life without his smile, his (??), and most importantly, his love. I feel so guilty though -- about Don. I don't know why in the hell I have such thoughts. It's all because of (??) and her ideas. I really kind of wanted to tell Adnan about the whole Don thing, but I was so afraid. What if it pushes him away? Will he (??) me? Will he still love me? I would die without his love. I will just keep it a secret. But what if he finds out and hates me? No I can't tell him. He wouldn't forgive me because I don't forgive myself. I can't believe myself at all. Maybe I should commit suicide. Should I get on my knees and beg forgiveness? Would he forgive me, or would he build up his walls again? I love you so much, Adnan. What have I done? Why do I keep hurting you? I swear I don't mean to. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me? You're my one and only forever.*

On Thursday, December 31st I picked up Adnan from his work and dropped him off at Sears so he could pick up his car. I thought of waiting for him to but some reason I had to go up to Owings Mills Mall. When I got there I saw his Camaro, which was surprising since he wasn't working that day. When I was going to pull up next to his car, he was walking towards his car. I stopped and talked to him, flirting around with him as usual. Well, he actually let me drive his car around Owings Mills Mall. What a car. Well, we flirted around a little more. Finally, decided to for dinner on the first. I mean, what a day to start a new year. Well, I got to work on the first week. I spent the New Year's Eve at Aisha's with Krista and the crew, Amber, Becky, Dee (Debbie), Sean and Ryan, but the guys had to leave at two. But I fell asleep around one because I had to wake up at nine to get to work. When I got to work, Don was there of course. He is so cute and funny. Cool, I found my favorite pen. Anyways, he changed into a green sweater and jeans. His sweater made his green eyes look so incredible, since his eyes turn green to blue to grey. He has real beautiful eyes, real beautiful. Well, after work we went all of the way up to Aberdeen. We got to the Olive Tree where we sat and ate. I had crab cake which was really good, I loved it. Me and Don had a fun conversation. We were talking about a lot of things from Lenscrafters to cars to his name, Donald Robert Klinedinst III. Wow, I don't think I've ever felt this weird before but I really do think I like him. We came back to the Owings Mills Mall and we just sat and talked. I really wanted him to kiss me but not -- he's too much of a gentleman for that. Wow, what a guy. He was so kind, caring, intelligent, incredibly cute, funny, amusing, and very down to earth.*

- 26th Night of Ramadan

- according to /u/aitca: It is interesting that Gutierrez talks and talks about the last ten days of Ramadan, but she never once mentions that Laylat al-Qadr was in fact on the 14th that year, a significant date because it is the day after the murder and the day on which Syed led prayers. It is very common for younger Muslims to take on new responsibility for the first time on Laylat al-Qadr, and so I believe it is not at all a coincidence that A. Syed was allowed to lead prayers for the first time on the 14th. Suffice it to say: Laylat al-Qadr is a very big deal. It's the most special day during Ramadan. The day before Laylat al-Qadr is the equivalent of Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve; it's not just any other day.

I have two years of college, 6 months internship, 6 month Jr Engr contract, and about 2 years of freelance.   
   
I was offered a part-time position for a ~1000 person company in NY, NY for $20/hr. I've been looking for about 2 months and this is the first offer I've received. My first instinct was to take it because I need the experience, but now that I've had some time to think it through, $20/hr seems absurdly low. During my internship I made $22/hr and they gave me a $2000 moving compensation. I also charge $90/hr for freelance web development work.   
   
NYC is freaking expensive and $20/hr or $40k salary would barely give me any wiggle room. I was hoping to make in the realm of $28-$32/hr. Am I being unrealistic with my limited experience and no bachelor degree?"

They knew when I was going to graduate, and I have to imagine that that was considered when they decided to give me an internship offer. However, this semester I had some personal stuff come up and I had to drop some classes which means that it would be very hard for me to graduate in 2017, I'm looking at graduating more towards summer of 2018.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experience with this situation. Assuming they want to give me a full time offer, are companies (especially Microsoft) willing to work with you in this situation? Would they be willing to invite you back for another internship to give you time to finish school? Or is there just no way to know?

Thanks!"

which started its life as research project led by the
[Cristal Group][cristal-home] at the [INRIA][inria-home], the renowned
French research institute.  Yes, you got it: a language with that
passport usually meets a lot of disdain outside of academic circles
and is the object of many clichés thrown by (usually misinformed)
practitioners.  Nevertheless, over the years this language and its
cousin F# have settled their mark in the industry, as the
[growing list of consortium members][ocaml-consortium]
testifies.[^1]  Some recent events reflecting this adoption are
the
[acquisition of Unikernel (an OCaml shop) by Docker][docker-unikernel],
or the
[release by Bloomberg of an OCaml to JavaScript compiler][bloomberg-ocamljs].
There is however still a domain where OCaml is not expected to be met:
*operations*.   We started to use OCaml for operations at
[quintly][quintly-home] in place of the more obvious
Python or JavaScript and I am writing today to share our experience:
this is an excellent choice!

*Your questions and remarks are welcome!*


## Just the facts, ma'am

Here are a few facts:

- We wrote an OCaml daemon to prepare and publish custom metrics to
  closely monitor some particularities of our systems.  This daemon
  perfectly illustrates the
  [*when it compiles, it works*][yminsky-tweet] phenomenon: it has
  been deployed on thousands of servers and various settings, with
  uptime ranging from a few day to a few months, and never failed nor
  required a bug-fix of any sort.  Really.

- We write custom deployment scripts, effecitvely implementing the
  immutable server pattern, which are written in OCaml.  The scripts
  are robust, had little-bugs (mostly caused by details about the
  underlying system) and are easy to extend, adapt.  Various
  refactorings never broke functionality or introduced regressions of
  any sort.

- We write custom backup procedures for some of our databases.  After
  a week of development, the script entered the final phase of
  testing, and had exactly one (trivial) bug.  It now dumps terabytes
  of data over hours of operation, without a hitch.

After these, hopefully teasing, statements, I would like to present
aspects of the recent development of this last program as a short
testimonial.


## Description of the backup procedure

We have some NoSQL databases hosted as a managed service in the AWS
cloud, the largest ones being several terabytes large.  Unfortunately
the managed service does not offer any backup procedure and we decided
to roll out our one.  It is made of three procedures *dump* performing
a full-dump of a database, *incremental* monitoring and writing down
subsequent activity of the database, and, of course, a *restore*
procedure, whose inputs are the artefacts produced by the previous
*dump* and *incremental* procedures.

The *dump* procedure must read all the items from the database, write
them to a file, compress this file and transfert it to a permanent
storage where it is archived.  In order to make the procedure more
resilient to errors, we decided not to work with a huge archive file
holding all the items but with several smaller archive *volumes*.
This choice:

- makes it easy to concurrently fetch items, compress and upload
  volumes;

- allows to work in constant disk space, independently from the size
  of the database being dumped;

- makes it easy to resume reading items or to resume uploading archive
  volumes if the process gets interrupted.


## Choosing OCaml for the job

The AWS cloud services we use are easily accesible using JavaScript
(NodeJS) and Python API and no native interface is available.[^1] This
means that picking OCaml implies writing a bit of plumbing code, which
can take up to 2-3 days of development.  This might seem a bit of a
drawback and many developers will prefer to use a language for which
an API to the required services is readily available.  This kind of
decision is usually sealed with the “We don't need to reinvent the
wheel” cliché.  During an internship at TÜV Rheinland, I had to
process geographic information automatically and decided to write my
programs in Python because I could find a library capable of reading
and writing ESRI shape files — the *de facto* standard for storing
geographic information.  This turned out to be a poor decision,
because the library was very brittle and not very nicely documented,
and also because I am not nearly as productive when writing Python
programs than when writing OCaml programs (I program OCaml since
1998).  You will recognise these points in
[the nice list][blog-dimitri] prepared by Dimitri about the
*disadvantages* of code reuse. Of course there are lot of situations
where code reuse is desirable, but it is worth noting that it also has
its trade-offs, especially since many persons consider this a
no-brainer.  Based on this experience, I decided to write the *dump*
procedure in OCaml and taking advantage of the JavaScript API to the
required services, using the [js-of-ocaml][ocaml-js-home] compiler,
turning OCaml bytecode into JavaScript.


## Development

The development occupied me roughly 8 days, spending about 4 days
writing bindings for OCaml to the JavaScript API.  While
**js-of-ocaml** makes this as easy as possible, it took longer as
expected because the original JavaScript is very sloppily documented.
For instance, if they write “The member X is empty.” we cannot
determine if it means “X is the empty string” or “X is set to null” or
even “X is not defined in the structure”. This sloppiness implies that
many tests need to be conducted.  The nice side of using OCaml is that
the signature of OCaml functions cleanly document, once for all, all
these accuracies.  Time spent clarifying the original API is time well
invested because it produces an artifact put under version control and
does not need to be done a second time.  If the API had directly been
used in JavaScript, then the time spent clarifying the API would most
probably not been saved in concrete artefacts, so its results would
“stay in the air” for a while and once they vanish, the time needed to
producee them must later be invested again.

On the 4 remaining days, 2 were spent writing the *dump* procedure
itself and 2 were spent writing a deployment script and performing the
first operational tests.

Writing the *dump* procedure was really fast, mostly because OCaml has
a wonderful threading library called Lwt, which continus to work after
the bytecode has been translated to JavaScript.  This library proposes
a monadic interface to compose cooperative threads, and many useful
higher level abstractions it provides can be leveraged to quickly
implement rather complex workflows.  Using a monadic interface to
write multi-threaded code is a far superior approach to the callbacks
used by JavaScript either in its usual form or in conjunction with
promises.  The reason for this is that the monadic approach allows to
simply compose treatments, while callbacks are just spaghetti code in
disguise — debugging or refactoring any significant application
written using this technique should be a convincing experience!
To put it shortly, a program structured in the form of callbacks
presents an inside-out control flow, where the elementary operations
occupy the control operations of the programs are nested one level
deeper, inside the callbacks.  Monadic code is easier to write and
understand because it presents a traditional control flow, where the
elementary operations are hidden under higher level abstractions.
*Promises* perform the same salutary reversal, however many APIs are
still rely on callbacks, so that using *promises* with them still
needs to write some adapter code.

At a higher level, the *dump* procedure prepares the streams of items
to be saved from the database.  This stream is a lazy structure, which
under the hood handles all the low-level details for item retrieval
(such as pagination of results).  This stream is then subdivided in
smaller streams of fixed size, each of them is given to a sink that
write its items to a volume file, compress it and upload it to a
permanent storage.  There is two little additional logical units. One
to ensure throttling of item retrieval, so that the *dump* procedure
interacts nicely with normal operation. A second that guarantees that
no more than a configurable but fixed number of volumes is being
compressed and uploaded at a given instant, which implies that the
procedure works in constant disk space, independently of the size of
the database being dumped.

The first test uncovered a single, trivial bug, that was quickly
fixed, after that, the program could be used to do a full dump of a
2,5 TB database in about seven days — the throttling made it last so
long.


## Maintenance

In the first iteration of development after the completion of the
working prototype, was expanded to split the *dump* operation across
several machines.  This iteration worked perfectly from the first time
it compiled, meaning that the refactorings performed introduced no
regression.  This is mostly imputable to the typeing system of OCaml,
which is a powerful ally when refactoring, as it signals through type
errors most of the the places where a given code modification induces
problems and needing some special attention. I am now working on the
second iteration that should improve logging facilities and the
monitoring of the dump procedure.

I was, in fact, kind of dying, but now I'm not, so it's okay.

**TL;DR - Drink more water or you'll end up looking like the [boneitis guy](http://established1975.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/boneitis-gif.gif) on that episode of Futurama. Milk/calcium legit apparently does a body good.  Also, migraines can take over your whole body like a gosh darn poltergeist, but, praise be, you can be healed by the power of morphine and Valium.**

So I opened up Reddit today and didn't even remember posting last night until I saw the little red envelope.  I wasn't quite all there when we last adventured together, so here's the best run down that I've got:

A dull headache started coming on around midnight and morphed into a full migraine by 1am.  I noticed that not only was my head aching, but my legs, shoulders, and neck were starting to hurt, then spasm.

I tossed and turned for a bit and finally decided it might help my muscles to take a hot shower, and then grab my trusty bag of frozen cauliflower to wrap around my head afterward.  

I went to go shower and something caught my eye in the mirror.  Is my ginger body becoming tan in small circles?  Maybe.  Am I turning into a dinosaur?  Please, God let it be true.  Are those bruises?  Let's poke them.  After much poking, I'm sure they are bruises.  Guess my ginger arse had about as much a chance of being tan as I did of turning into a dinosaur.  

By the time I posted on Reddit, some time between 2:30-3am, it felt like I was flexing most of my muscles nonstop.  It was like squeezing your fist as tight as you can, except every single muscle in your body, from toes to neck and I couldn't stop it.

I'm out if town visiting my parents right now and by 6am, I couldn't stand up straight.  My migraine made it so that every time I had a muscle spasm, the muscle just stayed tensed up.  My chest started feeling tight and I wasn't making much sense when talking, so so mom ran me to the urgent care clinic (the closest hospital is over an hour away).

Once at the clinic, my hands had seized up into fists and neither I voluntarily, nor the doctor forcefully could open them.  My fingers and toes were turning purple, I was slurring and mostly delirious, and couldn't answer questions because I'd forget what I was asked in the first five words of trying to respond.  They sent me straight to the ER.

Long story short there, in addition to an apparent ""whole body migraine"", I was suffering from extreme dehydration and a severe calcium deficiency.  

I received a full exorcism with fluids, calcium, Valium, and Morphine and volunteered to allow an EMT intern to take blood and set up an IV on a real person for her very first time.  I even offered to let her take a selfie with me afterward.

So, while the migraine issue was a huge part of it (and are a regular thing for me), the extreme super dehydration and calcium deficiency were the source of the delirium, sort of hallucinating, bruising, and initial muscle pain that brought on the migraine.


**Today's Lessons

1.  Water is important.  Like super important.  Take a minute to google the symptoms of mild, moderate, and severe dehydration so you can monitor yourself a little better.  Get a flask or bottle or whatever and get your drank on.  In fact, go drink some water right now.  GODOIT.

2.  Pay attention when your body suddenly does weird things and get that schnitzel checked out so you don't die of preventable dumb things like not drinking enough water.  Alternatively: check yourself before you wreck yourself.

3.  Take vitamins or something. Apparently they're important and I'm an idiot.

4.  You are probably not going to turn into a dinosaur and giving that as a deadpan, serious sounding suggestion as to why there are brown bruises everywhere will ensure a quick psych consult before you're released from the hospital.**


I appreciate you guys going on this big dumb journey with me!  Thanks for all of your responses last night and your concern today! "

Like a lot of people, I was super anxious about going into the free weights section of my gym. I started to go there 3 months ago. It's a small campus gym, everyone is super chill. I've *never* seen another girl use the dumbbells or the deadlift platform or anything more than 10 lbs plates so it was hard at first. I had to step in between the jacked dudes and while I'm pretty sure they didn't give a single fuck about me, my anxiety levels were off the roof. Months later, I'm a lot more relaxed as I'm part of the regulars. It's very nice, very comfortable.

Now, I have to go abroad for an internship (yay!) and I found a gym close to where I'm going to live. I've done my research, found pictures, testimonials, blog posts etc... It seems like a great place, full of every single piece of equipment you'd think of using, like a gym rat's gym. It also seems to be a place where all kinds of heavy lifters meet to press some iron (which is radically different from my small student's gym).

I won't be there for more than 4 months but I don't speak the local language at all (my internship is in English) and it's very hard to learn. I'm going to try to learn a thing or two before leaving but it's Icelandic so I won't make any miracle happen. It makes everything even worse. I have a hard time trying to explain what I'm feeling: anxiety, shame for not being stronger than I am, fear of losing that comfort I had in my campus gym, more anxiety, fear of looking lost and not being able to ask anything to anyone, did I mention anxiety?

I'm just a lanky 21 years old who's trying to learn how to squat her own bodyweight. I'm not strong and I'm terrified of looking ridiculous when trying my best.  I think I'll try to go there early in the morning at first so that a minimal amount of people can see me.  But what if they laugh at me? What if someone tries to give me tips but I'm unable to understand their language? What if I need help but I don't know how to say it? *What if they laugh at me oh my god* 

(I've looked for advice online and all I find is ""be confident"" (ahahah how do I do that?), ""you're here to press heavy"" (well actually no, I'm very weak) or ""don't worry, buff dudes only look at girls in the gym"" (so that would be me). Maybe there's just no answer?)

Does anyone have any tips? Ever had to go to the gym in an unfamiliar environment and dealt with the language barrier? I guess I'm more looking for advice and reassurance regarding how to enter a new gym. Sorry this is so long.

**Edit**: thank you so much for all your answers! I feel so much better. "

It has been awhile since I have posted in this subreddit, I have been taking uni courses and getting better at programming. I would be no where near where I am now without the help of this sub.

Anyway, so my uni courses are all structured around learning java, and I have learned a lot of java over the last year to where I feel pretty comfortable programming in it. However, I recently got an internship and they have been hinting that we will be programming probably in python and django to talk to all the back end servers to build a web application.

So my main question is, over the next month, what is the best way I can start learning python and django? I still have other classes to worry about and finals coming up but I would like to start learning as much as I can so I can at least hit the ground somewhat running in my internship. 

I should also say, I am a little familliar with python, I know its object oriented like Java, or at least it can be, and I know some syntax, but just like I said any tips that might help me make the transission would be awesome.

Thanks!"

Sometimes you go in looking for one thing, and you come out on the other side with something completely different. Often times you look for friendship, and find yourself with a potential life-partner. Other times you form a connection and find you significant other, only to realise down the line that the person you hoped to be with is actually a really great friend. Mind you, that second one is a bit more uncommon, at least from my experience. 

-

So like, I'm totally new to this whole thing. I suppose I should talk a bit about myself and my interests, right? Okay, so I'm 22 (23 in a couple of months) and from England. I've lived here pretty much my whole life, although I was overseas for the last four years due to studies. I was a medical student, but unfortunately things didn't work out the way I had hoped. Currently I'm working as an intern for a medical company; hopefully it will lead to big things in the future! I'm 5'6, black hair, brown eyes, I wear thick-framed glasses because my eyesight is awful. Umm, I'm so shit at self-descriptions, but I'd be willing to share a photo in PM. I suppose I can come off as a bit sarcastic and dry at times, but (not to toot my own horn or anything) I'm always caring and understanding, and have the best in mind for my friends and loved ones. I'm pretty outgoing, but I enjoy staying in too. Nothing beats a warm blanket and a movie on a cold night. I'm hopelessly romantic. Totally cheesy, full-on parmesan. The whole lovey-dovey, butterflies in the stomach kind of thing. I guess you could say I'm a bit quirky. Maybe it's come across in the way that I write. I'm a bit of a goof, I know :D

-

Things that interest me. Hmm, a lot of the stuff I like is probably gonna come off as super generic. Movies, music, the like. I like all of that, just turned way up to 11. I'm a HUGE fan of music, like I could talk for hours on end. There was a point where I would listen to like at least five different albums from start to finish every day :P Do you have a favourite artist or group? What was the last album you bought? Any recommendations? I really don't have a preference with genres, it just depends on my mood, which I suppose is how it is with most people. I've recently been listening to a lot of La Sera. Oh and movies, I watch SO many movies. Kind of like with music, there was a time when I would literally sit through 5 movies in a row. I'm a big fan of David Lynch, Mulholland Drive is probably my favourite movie ever. What about you? Seen anything good recently? I read a lot of comics too. Haven't had a lot of time recently though, with work and everything getting in the way. But Neil Gaiman's Sandman is just a piece of art, and I could talk about it all day long. I'm into art too, but probably not as much as a lot of other people here. Speaking of art, I really like art too, but probably not as into it as a lot of other people here. I don't draw or anything any more. I think one part of that is just a lack of time. Another is a lack of talent :P I'm a bit of a casual when it comes to games but I LOVE Bioshock and Fallout. My favourite game is probably Ocarina of Time though. And I still love Pokemon (we all do). I haven't played any of Gen 6 yet. I've heard X/Y weren't so great from some people. Did you play it? I still think Gen 2 is the best, but that's probably just from nostalgia lol. I'm pretty passionate about a lot of other things too, maybe we can talk about it all more? Let me know what interests you.

-

What am I looking for? Well like the first paragraph (in this WAY-too-long post) suggested, I want to form a connection with someone. But I'm not expecting anything. **Let's get to know each other.** Maybe we'll become friends, maybe more. Who knows? I'd like to know more about you. I guess I'm not really looking for anything specific from you, as long as you're cool with my amazingly lame puns and jokes. Oh yeah, and around my age, too. Also, I'm not looking for a fling or anything short-term, so if that's what you're hoping for, I'm probably not what you're looking for. But I want to talk to someone intelligent. Someone caring. Someone who knows what they want in life. Someone funny. In terms of distance, it's not really a huge issue for me. Of course being from England is ideal, but like I said at the top, you meet people in the strangest of places. And you never know how they'll turn out. Hopefully well, in any case!

-

So yeah. This post was *way* longer than I thought it would be. Pretty much just a wall of text at this point, right? I'm probably better at talking one-on-one. It's always a bit difficult to get all of the basic info out without rambling a little. Or maybe that's just me. Probably me. Anyway, not sure how I should close this.

Hello everyone,

I graduated from a competitive liberal arts college with a communication BA in May 2015. Upon graduating I came back to my rural hometown to live with my parents so I could work my normal summer job. I worked for a few months to get the financial boost I needed and then started the search for my career.

I had no idea that 8 months later I'd still be searching (11 months after graduating). Yet 200+ job apps later, here I am.

Here are some of the problems I'm encountering:

1 - The terrible career beginning double bind: I need experience to get the job, but can't get experience without getting the job.
2 - Lower level jobs turn me down because I am overqualified and they want someone that will work for $13/hr for ever. 
3 - I live in {very} rural America so it's impossible for me to start as an unpaid intern. I need a job that is worth moving for.
4 - I'm long-distance job searching. I've mostly been looking for jobs in a larger town 1.5 hours away and Portland, OR 3 hours away. That's doable, but I'd would be interested in moving to a different part of the country if that was possible.
5 - I have exhausted my network. I can't think of anyone else I am close to that I could ask for help.

Most of my work history is small campus or summer jobs I worked because I needed money. I don't have a long CV of irresistible experience, but it's not blank either. 

My academic success isn't terribly elite, but I am far from being dumb. Why can't I find some hiring manager that sees value in me?

I am honestly at a complete dead end. Does anyone have any advice for what to do next? "

It's such an open and flexible language, getting my barrings on creating something from scratch in there is still difficult even after a year. Even with code-academy and online resources, it's hard for me to feel like I've learned much beyond copy-paste jobs from jsfiddle/codepen/stackexchange. HTML and CSS have a level of rigidity in their structures that makes for a much easier learning curve  - I can build something from scratch in those, jQuery takes more hand-holding.

4ehh8j,5,2016-04-12,What should I do for the summer?,timestop007,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4ehh8j/what_should_i_do_for_the_summer/,"Hello everyone!

I have been a follower of this sub for a few months now, and I really need some advice. (BTW you guys are awesome, every piece of advice that I see here is so helpful)

A little bit of background:
I am a transfer student from a small college in Texas and now I am attending the University of North Texas and pursuing a Bachelor's in BCIS. I have an estimated 2 more semesters left. I have a 4.0 and I am going to start attending AIS (Association for Information Systems) meetings, as well as I just got through an interview with the Professional Leadership Program and will find out if I make it or not in late May (it is a year long program starting in the fall). I love to help people and I am very good with people/public speaking (my dream job someday is to do things such as TED Talks or be in some type of management position).

Over the last winter break, I was conflicted on trying to get an internship or not for the summer. I know that I need the experience and networking because all the jobs I have had since high school were all customer assistance oriented and not related to the information technology field at all. I decided I would try for a few internships anyways even though on a resume, it really is hard for me to show any technological background.

I was unfortunately turned down from the internships which I presumed is because of my background and lack of technical experience. So now I am at a stand-still on what I should do for the summer because most internships now are out the window due to time-constraints.

What could I do for the summer with 3 months of free-time to help sharpen my technical skills and give me some extra stuff to add to my resume? Should I look into some certifications or maybe try to learn a programming language here or there? I'm taking my first course in Java this semester so i'm just dipping my toe in the water. I really want to get some real world experience to help separate me from other students so I have a better chance after graduation to land a decent job and work my way up!

(Side note: A lot of advisers are telling me to go into things such as security or mainframes, but I don't start security classes until the fall and mainframe classes start in the spring of 2017, so for right now i'm leaning more towards security but that is just because of the job security (hehe) and opportunities it could offer once I graduate.)

Any piece of advice you guys are willing to sharing would mean the world to me. If you honestly want to call me stupid and say I'm on the wrong track, do it. I don't want to graduate and then find some job that I'll be stuck at for 15 years. I want to be a leader someday and help motivate people when it comes to things in the information technology field. 

Cheers!

4ehlhg,14,2016-04-12,In-Depth Guide to How to Use Snapchat to Market your Small Business,seanfalconer,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4ehlhg/indepth_guide_to_how_to_use_snapchat_to_market/,"""What is the big deal with Snapchat &amp; how can I use Snapchat to market my small business?""

This is a question I am seeing all over the Internet lately.  

Most people think Snapchat is a way to send a NSFW photo only to have it disappear within seconds.  Others think it's just a place to take a picture of yourself puking a rainbow.  

[How to Use Snapchat Infographic](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/665285/hubfs/snapchat-marketing.jpg?t=1460474032794&amp;width=818&amp;height=4008)

**So, what is Snapchat and why is everyone talking about it?**

Snapchat is an app that allows users to create “snaps” which are photos or short videos.  These snaps can be sent to a user’s friends or added to a “story”- a collection of photo and/or video-based snaps that live for any followers to see for 24 hours from posting time. 

Snaps, in their nature, are fleeting moments unlike the often highly-curated and planned photos created on the visual powerhouse, Instagram.  

Once a user creates the snap, they have the option of adding text, stickers, emojis, geotags, playing a video snap backwards, fast forwarding or even drawing on the image or video.  In addition, using the front-facing camera, a user can use an ever-changing variety of “faces”, morphing a user into anything from a cat to a wide eyed version of themselves puking a rainbow, because why not?

**All of that sounds fun (and it is!) but what does Snapchat have to do with your small business?**

Snapchat boasts over 100 million daily users. 65% of Snapchat users are active and collectively create approximately 400 million snaps a day!  Another huge draw for Snapchat is its user base.  With 60% of smartphone users between the age of 13-34 active on Snapchat, it taps into a huge Millennial market for businesses. 

Due to the high usage by Millennials, large businesses &amp; brands are latching onto Snapchat.  They use it to promote and provide access to live events, to engage followers by creating specialized content, to offer promotions and giveaways and to partner with other influencers to further engage a potential customer base. This is just a small sampling of some of the ways a business can use the app.

Additionally, Snapchat has been implementing huge changes throughout the app that make it much more than a place to take throwaway pictures. These changes have resulted in the average Snapchat user spending 25-30 minutes on the app everyday.   

**What are people doing for 25-30 minutes everyday?**

Aside from creating, sending and watching snaps, users can also access news and content from huge brands. Discover, for example, can be accessed by swiping left on the camera screen,  Here, you will find channels from both old and new school media outlets.  These powerhouse channels include WSJ, Daily Mail, Buzzfeed, Mashable and more.  Other brands, like Burberry, have run 24 hour content on Snapchat, a campaign that reportedly cost the high-end luxury brand anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000.  

While a $50,000 or $100,000 24-hour advertisement campaign is not likely in the budget for a small business, the move in the direction of native advertising bodes well for the future of Snapchat brand visibility.

How businesses use Snapchat marketing everyday (and how your small business can, too!):

**1. Coupons or Giveaways!**

Some businesses run giveaways and contests through their snapchat accounts.  This offers a great way for current and potential customer bases to get excited about the brand and share their own stories.

A great way companies have promoted flash offers is by posting the deal to your story.  This offer or code will have a 24 hour limit that expires once the story is no longer live.  A great example of a big brand using Snapchat for this purpose is GrubHub.  GrubHub has used series of snaps to reveal discount codes, enact an interactive scavenger hunt and even to hire interns from their own company.  If there is a company that has utilized Snapchat to its full potential, it is probably GrubHub!

**2. Behind the Scenes Access**

Another great opportunity to engage (for free) with your customers is by posting behind the scenes access to your business.  Aer Lingus, for example, has taken followers into the cockpit of their airplanes via snaps. 

HubSpot is a good example of a company currently using SnapChat to showcase a ton of behind-the-scenes footage. They showcase different offices around the world, products they use at HubSpot and their own employees at work.  

**3. Sneak Preview**

Snapchat can also be used as a hype tool, as if there is anything more Millennial than that!  Some companies can post daily snaps announcing a countdown or a sneak peek  to a new product or service.  

Taco Bell, NARS and Acura all gave a preview of their new products in exchange for a follow on Snapchat.  Small businesses could easily build excitement with sneak peeks or countdowns! A restaurant, for example, could preview an upcoming dessert special by posting a series of snaps depicting a pastry chef creating it! This is a proven engagement tactic as users love to go behind-the-scenes.

**4. Live Events**

Live events are hugely popular on Snapchat, whether planned or unplanned.  A few notable events that gained exposure on Snapchat are Coachella (planned) and the mid-Atlantic’s “Snowmaggedon” (unplanned).  

A small business could utilize this by snapping its own special event or by engaging in the events going on around you.  Is there a music festival going on down the street from your small business? Snap about it!

**5. Have Fun**

A business could also use Snapchat for its initial intention, to have fun!  Some brands will engage their followers by asking a question or encouraging them to share a doodle.  Of course, you could turn this into a contest or coupon giveaway.  Sometimes users are satisfied solely by the exclusive customized content being delivered to their phones by their favorite businesses and brands.  Snapchat allows users to interact on a very personalized level (a handwritten, exclusive snap!) unlike anything you could share on Facebook or Twitter.  

Again, GrubHub is a shining example of a company using Snapchat to its full fun potential.  Check out this PR Case Study of all the different ways GrubHub has combined these different methods of engaging with its followers.  

As with any social media platform, with a little trial &amp; error,  you will find out what works best when it comes to marketing your small business.  Some businesses live and die for Facebook and others find it useless.  In terms of marketing and engagement, Snapchat is an incredibly versatile app.  With a little creativity, there are endless ways to engage, entertain and delight your followers!

What do you think? Anyone have any experience using Snapchat for their business?

I'm graduating with my CS degree in May, and have been applying in more of wider net search around the New York City area.  In addition to taking my 6 courses required to graduate, I am working 40-45 hours a week manning an IT helpdesk, and managing various IT projects.  

I've gotten a few calls from recruiters, but they seem to be interested in my previous IT experience.  

My main issue I think, is confidence.  I don't think I do many things well, specifically programming solutions.  I can visualize the issue, and know *how* I want to solve it, but many times I simply do not know the correct syntax to use.  A simple google search helps out with this, but obviously, when applying for jobs I can't whip out my phone and google the answer should a question arise.

Whether it comes from a lack of experience or not, I do not know.  My summer experiences consisted of working in IT, and I did not find a development internship in time, or one willing to allow me to work for them part time.  

Given that my schedule is *very* hectic, and the days are long, I am finding myself not having enough energy to begin studying and reforming my skills when I get home.  A typical day is:

* Up at 5:00am
* Work till 2:00pm
* Class till 8:00pm or 11:00pm  

Rinse and repeat.  

In my courses I have taken Java I &amp; II, Python (For an AI Course), Distributed Database Systems (SQL), Data Structures, and Algorithms.  Other classes were also taken, but these are the fundamental core of my education.  

My job search as of today consists of using Indeed, Glassdoor, and my schools Career Services site to find anything involving Java, since that is my main focus, and what I am most comfortable with, and I think I have applied for roughly 50-75 places so far.  Perhaps more.  

I have one standing offer from a place called FDM group, but from my research, it seems that everyone gets an offer from them.  They promise two years experience, in exchange for a two year committment, and from what I can see, are generally regarded as a bad choice to work for.  The pay is *very* low compared to what I am seeing elsewhere, but perhaps the experience may be worth it.

My questions for you fine folks:

* Am I missing out on any resources to locate Entry-Level Jobs?  The ones I am seeing are asking for 3+ years experience, and while I know that is their optimal qualification list, I don't think I would be cut out for that level of work.  Not yet, anyhow.

* Would it be worth going to a BootCamp or other training course to enhance my programming skills and confidence?  I know the theory, I think, but falter on the actual code-writing.

* How do you deal with thinking you don't know enough to do anything in your desired field?

TL:DR

Low confidence, feeling like I know nothing.

Not getting many responses from my applications, probably due to mainly IT experience, and not programming / software development work.

Offer from New-Grad Scheme company, for a two year committment.

Thank you for reading my post, and I hope you all have an awesome day!

4ehqlo,0,2016-04-12,Advices on starting the development of a log analysis web app ?,Tokipudi,PHP,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/4ehqlo/advices_on_starting_the_development_of_a_log/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a student in Computer Science and I am doing an internship in an SEO agency. 
My number 1 task while I'm here is to create a web app that could analyze csv files, and basically track Google's behavior on a website. They need to be able to tell how often google bots crawl a certain page, compare it with other pages in different timelines, etc... It's basically an alternative version of the web app ""onCrawl"".

My issue with that is that I'm not really good with php. I know the basics, but as I've said I'm only a student and know only what I've learnt from school. So I would like to know if some of you could help me on this project (mostly on how to begin it, really).

I've tried to learn symfony for the past two days with a french tutorial (I'm french, ofc) because I thought it'd be easier in the end. But the more I learn about it the more it feels like I should avoid Symfony for professional projects while I don't know how to use it properly enough.
So I'm wondering right now if it wouldn't be best to look at some bootstrap admin template such as Gentellela's template (can't link, I'm on my phone sorry but you probably see what I mean) and just work with the php I know from there.

My main questions are :

- is it possible for someone, without using a framework and thanks to a template, to create such an app in less than 8 weeks ? 

- Is there any open source web app which does something kind of similar so I can understand better how it'd work from it ? (Tried to look for that but didn't find anything)

- If you had to create such an app, where would you begin ?


Thanks a lot for reading this, I hope you'll be able / want to take the time to help me on this project :)"

I have a (most likely) technical phone screen in a week-ish with a med-size/established company and wanted to ask some CS students a couple of questions. This is mainly geared toward people who had freshman internships.

I'm currently a freshman who has taken up to 12. For these phone screens, what kind of questions do they ask? I'm not too keen on a ton of algos because i'm in 21 rn and i've just picked up a copy of CTCI recently. The interview is 30 mins long (or so they say) so i'm hoping they won't decide to completely fuck me. Do you feel that they go easier on you because you're a freshman? Does being from UCSD have you held at a higher standard? 
Thanks in advance!

Option A: Company is one of the largest and most well-known in my field - to get to location will take 30 hours by car

Option B: Company is very large and broad, but relevant division is newer and much less well known in my field. Offering 16% higher salary, and location is 16 hours away by car

Cost of living is about the same in both locations.

Company A gave me the first offer with 72 hours to decide. I was very excited as they were my top choice, due to the company's reputation in my field and the experience i would gain from the project I would be working on. I spent 48/72 of those hours researching housing in the area, and was in communication with the in-house recruiter asking for advice regarding housing and such.

On the final day to accept offer A, company B sends me an offer. I really did not expect this as I did not think the interview went too well and did not hear back from them for weeks. I emailed the recruiter from A to notify her of this competing offer and discuss it with her - she gave me a call and sounded irritated, and asked for information regarding the offer. She said they would not be able to match it, and I thanked her and told her I would have a decision shortly.

I ended up going with company A, and sent in the signed offer well before the deadline ended. I chose them because the experience I would gain there greatly trumps the few extra dollars I wouldve made over the span of the summer at B.

What's bothering me is that ever since that phone call, I have not gotten any followup from A. I am supposed to be receiving background check information, as my offer was conditional based on that. I am worried that I may of insulted/greatly upset the recruiter and they have reconsidered, and now I may be left with 0 options from 2. 

It's been 3 business days now since I emailed my signed offer, and still no followup. 

Am I worrying over nothing or did i royally screw this up? "

I'm a computer engineering major in college, which means half my classes are CS but the other half are more EE and engineering based. I always wanted to get a job programming robots or doing something with embedded systems or maybe even low level programming / operating systems.

The problem is, as a freshman I got my first internship after programming software at a hackathon, and the next one based on that, and now I have a internship at a top company doing software development / database stuff.
My resume is so tailored towards software development, that when I've applied to more robotics type roles I've been rejected and my application has even been moved to the software development jobs for the same companies..

I think my resume is strong for software development, but it would be really cool to get something more computer engineering based.  I feel like I wasted all this time getting an engineering degree where a cs degree would work just as well and be easier. But I feel like I've cornered myself in and don't know what to do. Plus my GPA sucks so I leave it off my resume which probably makes things harder. And maybe if there's so many software jobs this isn't worth pursuing in case I can't make any money :("

I must have applied to hundreds of places online (indeed, looksharp, intership.com, etc.) and had maybe 3 or 4 phone interviews. The phone interviews didn't go so well due to questions I couldn't answer very well over the phone (ie ""what are the four pillars of OOP and what do they mean""), or lack of experience (Many companies wanted C#, and I also have never had an internship before). I was very depressed about having to get a minimum wage job having nothing to do with my degree which would mean my resume would have no tech experience (but at least minimum wage is 10$/hour now). Then I heard back from a tech start up I applied to. I interviews with them and they offered me a job as a ""1099 independent contractor"", and the pay is also 10$/hour (What exactly does being an independent contractor entail for taxes?). I would be interning making a mobile app, at a company with less than 5 employees. I have no other options for the summer as of now, but for some reason I'm nervous about excepting. 

Anyone have experience as a contractor at very small start ups that can squash my qualms?"
4ei9f3,571,2016-04-12,"Holy fucking potatoes, I actually fucking did it.",Niezo,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4ei9f3/holy_fucking_potatoes_i_actually_fucking_did_it/,"Shortly after I was born, it didn't take people long to figure out I was a bit different. I didn't interact a lot socially, and kept to myself a lot. The diagnoses came fast. Autism.

Now, this didn't bother me much at first. Just like how someone who is colorblind doesn't know how to enjoy paintings to it's fullest potential, so couldn't I imagine how nice a social life was.

Still, after thanks to my family and a nice environment at elementary school, I opened up a little bit. At the end of elementary, I was a little bit social. And a good piece of new came, for freshman elementary school I would be put in the same class as two of my friends from elementary. Sound ideal, right? If I do something weird or am struggling socially, they could help me.

But what would be the ideal situation turned into hell instead. They started to make ""jokes"" about me, which turned into verbal bullying instead. However, since they were ""my friends"" and it was ""just verbal"" I tried to rationalize instead. This destroyed me mentally. Even though I was put into different class the second year, I didn't open up again. Socially, I was frozen. Even if I had a nice interaction, I didn't really felt any enjoyment.

Luckily, my grades got a little bit better, and I got put into a higher level course. (I'm from the Netherlands, middle/high school is one thing, with different ""levels"") A completely new group of people. Since it was a completely different enviroment, I tried to open up again, with completely new people.

Which resulted in me, getting bullied. Again.

Now, if you've been bullied yourself, you'll know how important the first time you open up again is after having been bullied. The bullying lasted until the end of my middle school ~~torture period~~ life.

Afterwards, I started doing a vocational training. The first two years, it went well. My classmates were nice enough and I started to hang around with people again. I didn't really need to study because it was pretty easy for me. Things seemed to go well.

Until the third year, when I had to do an internship. The company I did my internship at wasn't suited for someone like me, who has a form of autism. This resulted in my internship getting cancelled, and as a consequence I got put of my vocational training earlier. I did get a degree, but at a much lower ""quality"" to get a job. (and with a story like that, good luck finding a job) Moreover, I wanted to study physics, and with that degree going to a university wasn't directly possible.

So I started to work my way upward. I did an extra middle/high school year, which allowed me to start my physics major afterwards. (It wasn't exactly easy... I had to go from basic algebra to basic differential calculus in 7 months)

When I started with physics, I felt straight at home. I made some good friends. Really good friends, of which some of them I would trust with my life. My confidence is actually returning thanks to them, bit by bit. And I'm actually doing well with my study despite my educational background.

However, there was one thing I had yet to do. An internship.

I took a gamble, and went overseas to the US. At a big university, alongside an internationally well-known project within particle and astrophysics. Normally, this is already a big deal. But with my educational and social background... I was gambling with my life.

And I had the time of my life over there. Again, I made some really good friends, and the research I did was *awesome*. At the end of it, the professor and other colleagues of me were really impressed with what I had achieved during those five and half a months. The teacher at my uni back at home was impressed as well.

Today, I actually got my credits from my internship. 30 fucking credits for all my hard work. But even if it was one credit my feeling wouldn't change.

Despite having autism, despite being bullied by my ""friends"", despite getting bullied again afterwards, despite getting kicked out of college. Despite fucking everything I actually made it. I have friends, my study is going well. I even managed to ask a girl out, twice.

There's still a lot I need to do. My bachelors is still going to take awhile, and I definitely want to work upwards towards a PhD eventually. Moreover, I still don't have a relationship. But that's OK. I actually got out of there. I actually did it. I FUCKING DIT IT.

Edit: Holy shit, I didn't expect this amount of responses and two months worth of gold! Thank you everyone!"

I was looking at how taxes would work, and I stumbled upon IRS Publication 463, ""Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses."" My question is whether I can use this. My thinking is that I can. Here is my reasoning.

- I'm currently a part time employee at my University, and I have a small sole proprietorship (repair/reselling), so by Chapter 1, I am traveling away from home, because I'll be away from my tax home and I need to sleep to work away from home. 
- My tax home is at college because that is where I work most of the time, I have rent that I'll need to pay while I'm away, and I'm not abandoning this area.


Thus, I should be able to deduct travel expenses.

- Transportation expenses - plane tickets to/from home/work, transportation while in California.
- Meals - 50% of the actual cost or the Standard Meal Allowance, which the GSA says is $64/day. 
- Lodging - Cost of the hotel/apartment while in CA.

My admittedly a touch pissed-off response:
&gt;So there are more of us at Ivy Leagues, so what? We also have to work harder to get in. On the SAT, out of 1600, we need 140 points higher than whites and 440 points higher than blacks. That's a ridiculous fucking handicap, are you serious with calling that ""privilege"" when literally every other race benefits from affirmative action? Don't bring up that extra-curricular crap either, at least looking at UCLA applicants there's no correlation between race and extra-curricular involvement.

&gt; Did you even read the full text of your own links btw? Even when Asian Americans make the same income as blacks and hispanics, they save more and diversify their assets, leading to more wealth. What part of this is fucking unfair?
&gt; 
&gt; Also why the fuck is not going to prison a fault on the part of Asians? 2.5x more go to university compared to blacks, 1.5x compared to whites. Wealthier, better educated people commit less crimes? Not to mention that most East Asian countries have much lower crime rates than the US in general
&gt; 
&gt; Going back to the 2.5x/1.5x more with college degrees, shouldn't it be expected that Asians are earnings more? Not to mention that we tend to live in California and New York, that have higher incomes in general. Median household income in Cali is 61k, the US if 53k, Indiana is 48k, and you can definitely buy a fuck ton more in Indiana for 48k than 61k in Cali. My internship last summer paid 8.2k a month and because I didn't live on campus the vast majority of it went towards cost of living. I think I'd be ecstatic to get the same 8.2k in a different part of the country out of college.
&gt; 
&gt; And yeah, polls show Americans think being Asian helps you. Statistics shows it hurts, with both finding a job and getting into a school. So fuck you, you're the one that's part of the problem. Asians even vote liberal despite policies like affirmative action hurting us, and I even advocate it myself as some sort of parity. Its easy to be pro-something when you're the beneficiary of it, how the fuck are we putting down blacks when we support something that hurts. The ""white establishment"" thing is just pure ridiculousness. The only group of Asians I'm aware of that really have a grudge against blacks are KTown Koreans, and they mistrust the ""white establishment"" for ignoring and abandoning them when they were attacked by black rioters (which is where the grudge came from in the first place.)

I'll be the first to admit that I don't have a ton of experience with any other minorities other than hispanics, but I find it concerning that any issues that we face are just written off just like that. I'm living in a small midwestern town where the vast majority of people are white, but most people seem to agree that Asians are oppressors and the ""white establishment."" Now that's concerning as fuck for me, since based on his sources most Americans think being Asian is some kind of advantage too, even if facts state otherwise.

I criticize this sub a lot for being overly-sensitive sometimes and my experience has pretty much been ""its not that bad,"" but I feel like all of this is especially impactful not for us that live in Manhattan, SoCal, Bay Area, etc. where there is a healthy Asian population, but instead the ones living in places like a racist little town in the Midwest (that's actually considered one of the least racist in the State) where they are one maybe five or six other Asian families in the whole neighborhood. Hopefully this attitude isn't present in other parts of the country, but I lived anywhere other than California in the States. "

Price: $29,99.

**Okay, so here's the whole story:**

Last week PSN had this great deal on Tom Clancy's games, one of them was Rainbow Six Siege, and the season pass was also bundled with the game at an amazing price.

I had sold some games these past weeks, and I gathered some of my internship money to get a good headset (got a TB XP Seven at a cheap price) and was saving the remaining money to get a new game. Rainbow Six was always drawing my attention to its cool destruction mechanics and CS-like gameplay, and it's been a while since I played a good online shooter.

The problem is that my credit card is not being accepted anymore, either at Amazon or PSN (it's fine on the Wii U, though). I called my bank and tried everything, even got a brand new card, but this issue was not solved.

Since I have multiple PSN accounts *(my main account, War_Machida, with PS+ and on the US region; my girlfriend's BR account on my PS4, to keep her saved games - because this console only keeps saves if they're from a local account, being used in its primary console; and my japanese account, that I used once to attempt downloading Xrd's japanese demo, but it was PS+ only, so it's been inactive since them)*, I decided to use my girlfriend's account (Brazilian region) to purchase the game.

Here's the math: this game's physical copy, used, costs around 150BRL, and in this weekly deal the price was 149BRL for the game + season pass! *What a steal*, I yelled. I even did some research about having multiple **LEGIT** accounts and dealing with game's licenses and DLCs and, apparently, it was OK to use DLC on multiple accounts. And the price on the US PSN was more expensive because of the Dollar&gt;real conversion.

Without arguing anymore, I bought the game on a Friday night, to play on Saturday after class.

I was spending my afternoon with my girlfriend when I first opened the game (now with my own account), but I was puzzled to see that those two extra Operators were unavailable. At that moment I thought that the Season Pass would *unlock* them for me to buy them, but I thought: ""So what's the point? The game even asks for 600 rainbow-dollars or whatever to buy them *again*"". Foolish me, my purchase went wrong.

At the end of the day, when I was finally able to play the game, I noticed that my account was lacking elements promised by the Season Pass, like some more weapon skins and money boosters. What an upset. Really, I rarely purchase Season Passes, but this one looked worth that price (18BRL more than the base game, around 5 dollars only!).

I decided to swallow this whole situation and just play the game. I was mad at first, but when I unlocked a couple of base Operators myself the game became so much fun! I started to learn the maps, understand the feel of the game, and right now, after almost 20 hours in, I'm really in love with this game!

Right now, after this whole time playing it, I feel I could enjoy those, at the moment, two extra Operators available, and the 6 others that will come. I love switching roles every match, trying different styles and surprising my opponents. The other bonuses are somewhat less interesting, but the value for these operators is already good enough to justify the steep price.

**Why can't I get the Season Pass myself?**

Well, I spent my whole money on it already, I can't afford it anymore. Now I will have to wait a couple of months to even begin to think about buying new games. But I feel my R6S purchase was worth it, I was so sure about this purchase that I decided I could wait to play both Dark Souls 3 (my favorite game series besides Metal Gear) and Star Fox Zero.

**About the multiple accounts thing**

It's not as shady as it looks, it's actually common practice on consoles to have multiple accounts, because they will act as ""profiles"", and most times even as ""saved games"", and this process of having at least two accounts is mandatory if you want to keep saved games for two different people, because the console will DELETE any saved data from Guest accounts, or even accounts that aren't in their primary console. I can provide proof of everything, like showing my girlfriend's account (that I haven't posted it here in the open because *rules*). The other account has no activity besides downloading demos at Japanese PSN.

Also, I only bought the game on her account (with my money) because there was no other way, and the price on our Brazilian's PSN is actually better, for some reason. If I buy something on US PSN (or eShop), I will pay about 4 times as much because of the monetary conversion, but in Brazilian's PSN, my region, prices are better if purchasing DLC, games in weekly deals or downloadable-only games (full priced games are awfully overpriced, though).

I know that there's an entire problem regarding those ""ghost accounts"" or whatever people call them outside Brazil, but I can assure you guys this is not about it. The purchase was made legitimately, the problem relies solely on the Season Pass being tied only to the account that purchased it, instead of being a content downloaded to the console and being able to be used by everyone.

I also couldn't just play the game on my girlfriend's account because it doesn't have PS+. And this game's purchase was the first one I ever did with this account because, as the time being, my bank will not accept PSN anymore, or *vice versa*.

I guess I made my request clear enough! I hope you guys understand my pain, and if **ANYTHING** needs any clarification I will be happy to explain even further."
4ej94x,2,2016-04-12,Internship in field of my dreams or full-time job in IT?,IDontCareMuchAnymore,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4ej94x/internship_in_field_of_my_dreams_or_fulltime_job/,"Ok. So I just went to a networking by major event. As a Computer Science major in a rural area at a small school, I was sceptical of the quality of panelists. I thought there would be three or four employers there, but there were only two. One employer was the administrator for Network Services at my university, where I already work. The other was the business owner of a local web development company. To my surprise he mentioned that they offered internships, which I had scoured the area for and couldn't find. Web development is what I'm studying on my own in addition to my schoolwork. I'm just barely building a portfolio. I had planned on studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the summer, build some projects, and send out resumes. I mentioned that I was learninging these technologies and he immediately offered me a 10 week internship.


What's going on in the background is that my husband and I are moving out this month and moving to my mom's house. My husband has been laid off since January and has had a hard time finding a job. I have a part time job at school that will only let me work 20 hours a week, so I have been job hunting too. I just received a promising job lead this week as a full-time help desk technician, making almost double what I make an hour. This is not what I really want but what I was willing to do.


Starting in the middle of May, I can work full-time at my present job. They would be very flexible and allow me to take on the internship too. The job lead I do not think would be so flexible.  My gut says this internship in the field I want to go in would be immensely valuable in terms of experience and would hasten my transition to web development. But I feel guilty for even thinking about this. Is taking this internship the right thing to do? I need an outsider perspective."
4ejba3,1,2016-04-12,The last five years,N0Answers,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4ejba3/the_last_five_years/,"In Spring of 2010 my father had a severe stroke and I had to leave college to go home and help him relearn how to speak, walk, and get his motor skills back on track with my mom.  I also had to go back and help with our family's business (horse products).  At the end of the year he was in much better shape , enough to the point that I was able to go back to college without it being too hard on my mom.  

In my first quarter back I got a D in a college course and my parents pulled me out of my university.  This was my first bad grade I'd gotten since highschool where I got the only other D I've ever had.  They blamed my girlfriend and my friends for this no matter what I said and forbade me from talking to them. (I was 19). They also took away any financial support so I had to come home and work at the company for room and board at their house.  

Every day my dad would tell me how disappointed he was in me.  What a pathetic man child I was for not taking my future seriously.  I just silently took the verbal beatings, I was too ashamed to say anything and I was too scared to stand up to him.

Eventually I couldn't take it anymore.  One day while my parents were visiting my grandparents in Colorado I just wrote a note and threw all my belongings in my friend's truck and went to stay with him for awhile.  My father was furious and my mom was inconsolable but I couldn't go back no matter what they said to me.  I needed to break out on my own.  After 3 weeks I left to go live with my girlfriend, her sister, and her sister's boyfriend.  From here I would bounce back and forth between my girlfriend's place and a close friend's place.  For weeks I frantically looked for a job until I finally found one assembling duplicator machines ( computer tower that makes duplicates of CD's DVD's).  In that time I had lost around 40 pounds from not getting enough food.  I would often overhear my girlfriend's sister talk shit about me and pressure her to not share food because it's their money.  Once again I just took it in and let it destroy my confidence, why not?  I deserved what was happening to me so I had no right to complain.

A few months pass and things improve but were still pretty shitty.  My girlfriend and her sister's boyfriend (who I became very close with) are both desperately trying to force a friendship between me and the sister but I just couldn't fake it.  I tried to stay with my other friend as much as possible but his roommate admitted that he ""loved"" me which caused a whole new array of problems.  He was in the closet at the time out of a strict fear that he would be found ""unemployable"" and hated by his friends for it.  I told him that I was sorry but I didn't feel that way about him and on top of that I already had a girlfriend.  He wouldn't drop it, he would corner me into talks about how depressed he was and how bad his life was and it would always come around to ""so you think someday it could happen with us?"".  I told him to not give up and that someday he probably would find someone but his response was almost always ""doubtful"".  I really couldn't take this negativity all the time so I would just avoid him as much as I could.  That was a big mistake... he began going around to our mutual friends and ask why I was ignoring him, why was I such a dick?, why was I so ungrateful for what he was doing for me?  I just stayed silent and tried to smoke and drink until I could forget about my problems.

In this time my father had secretly  researched many of my friend's facebook accounts.  He would send me email after email with pictures of my friends about how shitty I was for choosing them over family.  He would send videos of my mother crying in bed with messages like ""hope you're happy :)""  and he loved to tell me how my stupid, ugly, whore Filipina girlfriend was ruining my life.  At this point my coping mechanism was just to take it and silently drink it away.

By 2013 I had reapplied to a couple of colleges and I was trying to get my education back on track.  My father contacts me to say that they're willing to forgive me and help pay for college if I apply to Colorado State.  I took it and got accepted for the fall quarter.

While out in Colorado I fell into a deep depression.  I couldn't motivate myself to do anything, I made no friends.  My girlfriend back in California cheated on me and even though I kind of expected it I was still shaken.  We shouldn't have even tried to make it work with so much distance.  In the middle of my second semester my grades were in shambles, I couldn't motivate myself to do the work or even go to class sometimes.  I couldn't relive the shame of facing my parents again,  I already hated myself... I tried to commit suicide but obviously it didn't work.  I didn't have any life changing epiphany from it except that death is terrifying and I don't think killing myself was the right choice.

The semester ends, I tell my mother what happened.    I'll never forget what my dad told me after he had some time to mull it over ""you win"".  Never had I felt so pathetic or weak.  My mom flew out after a day or so and we just cried together for a long time. Afterwards she set me up with a psychologist and I made some progress with my problems. 

I didn't finish my degree.  I just wanted to work.  I applied for an internship with a small television production company in Los Angeles and got the position.  After a month and a half of no pay they brought me on as an assistant editor and I have learned so much about the industry since then.  I started seeing my old girlfriend again and I'm starting to feel happy.  Recently my dad heard I was dating her again and was irate.  And this time I didn't back down.  I told him to fuck off, I told him how shitty his behavior has been to me and despite how much I appreciated his help everytime he supported me.  I told him that I am just trying to be in a normal relationship and I want to be happy.   So now we've agreed to disagree.

So uh... In conclusion I guess.  Don't wait until you try to kill yourself to get the courage to tell your fuckwit of a father to fuck off.  Just because someone important to you thinks little of you doesn't mean it's true.  No matter what anybody says to you the sun will still rise in the morning and set in the evening and nobody can take that away from you.  Stand by the things you love and be able to agree to disagree.  I'm sorry if this seems pointless to everyone else but typing this all out has been really therapeutic.  

Thank you."

My sleep schedule is messed up but I get a decent amount of sleep overall.  I'm pretty happy with my life in general.  However I've developed some health issues that are directly related to the stress of the job.

I'm not an EU citizen. I got a chance to work as an internship last year until this past March. Now I'm in my country. My employer wants to hire me again as a full-time employee. Now they are working on documents. 

I want to know what are the exact processes of applying for the working visa. 

First, Do I need to wait for the work permit before I applying for the visa from my country? Is this process going to be difficult? I mean I already worked with them. They know me. We talked everything about me coming back. I have read that the employer has to do some stuff to get me the work permit. 

After I get the work permit, I just have to bring it to apply for the visa to come to Spain, right?

4ejs4c,2,2016-04-12,"Had to drop out of classes for two quarters because ""tinnitus""/hearing loss/health issue. What do I do now?",osututorhelp,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/4ejs4c/had_to_drop_out_of_classes_for_two_quarters/,"So, long of the short, I have completed 5 courses so far in this class, with the last one being Data Structures.  I was having my company pay for the classes.

However, this health problem basically shut me down from doing anymore classes and even semi threatened my job.  

Well, long of the short, I can't take doing my job further anymore.  I am probably going to have to quit after the summer.  I hated this job before, but it was at least tolerable without this issue.

I'm considering transferring to a local school in my city that also does second bachelor degrees for CS.  I wouldn't be required to take the gen ed's again.  Also, I get the impression the program would be more ""thorough"" (take Calculus courses, Linear Algebra, etc.) and cheaper (It would cost me $14,000 total for 2 years.  VS. $18k for the remaining 10 courses [assuming OSU doesn't increase tuition more, which I've seen them do once]).  Also, I would be eligible for health care through the school (OSU seems to not allow online students to get health care through them).  

I'm just debating what would be the best course of action at this point.  Do I complete this degree with this program still?  Or do I transfer over to the local college and give that a shot?  

The advantage I like with this program is that I can watch videos online and almost pace myself with things.  I've gotten A's and B+ in my courses so far.  

The advantages of the local school is tha it would be cheaper for way more courses.  Also, I would have connections to jobs in the area (many internships are linked to the city I'm at).  Also, heard many people who graduated from the program get jobs.  I know of some internships specifically made for the school as well (one that is about 1 1/2 years long with BofA for example).  But, of course, it would probably take longer to complete.

Also, currently attempting to get back somehow to a ""normal"" by learning web dev on my own right now.

I'm just at a lose of what to do at this point.  I have already determined I'm most likely quitting my job after the summer.  I just question what to do.  

Family is pushing me to go to local college.  But, I feel that is because they have the ""old"" idea in there heads that online college isn't serious and you need in person contacts to get places.  I agree in person can be helpful, but I don't see why I need to go to in person college to get that.  

Anyways, any thoughts on the best course of action for me?"

4ek5rz,18,2016-04-13,"I've wasted years of my life and thousands of dollars, and I'm continuing to make it worse.",engineerthrowaway15,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4ek5rz/ive_wasted_years_of_my_life_and_thousands_of/,"The summary: Went into engineering, regretted it because it was not right for me, forced to stay in it, may have failed some courses in my last (extra) year of university, don't know what to do. Feeling like a failure and like I've wasted my life.

In high school I was great and math and science so I decided to go into engineering. I had top grades in my school and got into a prestigious and expensive university with a partial scholarship. However I quickly learned that engineering was not right for me and I spent countless hours in my first year crying, struggling to focus, and overall got very mediocre grades and did not receive any scholarships for the remainder of university. However, even though I hated the actual work, I made a ton of friends really quickly, way more than I had ever had in high school. I partied A LOT, and a lot of my friends were slackers who were naturally smart so we didn't tend to do much studying together. I  managed to pass all of my courses, barely. 

I went into second year already resenting the program, but decided to stick with it because I got to specialize in my chosen field of engineering so I thought maybe it would be better. It was even worse than before, but I was determined to make better grades than in first year. So i stopped seeing my friends regularly, stopped drinking pretty much completely, and did fairly well. But this came at the price of my sanity. I was lucky to get 4 hours of sleep in a night, I spent hours locked in my room doing assignments or in the library studying, and began having panic attacks. 

At the end of this year I told my parents, who funded the entirety of my education, that I didn't want to do it anymore and wanted to switch into another program. They didn't let me, and convinced me to switch my field and continue with that. I did so, and the next two years were spent alternating between having panic attacks and giving zero fucks about school and failing courses. All the while, calling my parents on a regular basis in hysterics telling them I can't do it anymore, and every time they got angry and told me that I can't drop out now, I'm too far into the program, and I might as well stick with it until I graduate. That ended up being delayed a year, as I ended up having to take an extra year from both the failed courses and the change in program.

Now I'm sitting here, at the end of my victory lap, completely burnt out and I'm pretty sure I've failed another couple of courses. 100% my fault too, I just gave up on my life completely this year. I've gained weight, lost friends, and mainly sat in my house alone crying. I feel like I've lost out on 5 years of my life that could have been spent doing something that makes me happy. I don't even know what makes me happy anymore - every summer has been spent working at internships doing boring, miserable work, and hating my life. I haven't taken a vacation or traveled since I graduated high school. I even have a job in my field lined up for after I graduate, but the thought of spending the rest of my life doing engineering is giving me anxiety and I've already asked to have my start date pushed back twice. I'm still starting in a month, and which is barely even a break from finishing finals. However if I fail these courses, I'll have to quit to go back to school anyway so it seems like a waste of their time and money to hire me. 

I'm at a loss. I resent my parents for making me stick with it after expressing so many times how it makes me so miserable, but I also feel extremely guilty for wasting so much of their money coming back to this expensive school for 5 years.

I decided to write this because a terrible thought has been popping into my mind on a frighteningly frequent basis in the past couple of months. What if I just kill myself? I won't have to worry about any of this anymore. I've been unhappy for years and if I fail these courses I'm going to have so many more problems that I won't know how to solve. Killing myself seems to be the best solution for me right now. I don't have anything positive in my life going on anyway... no friends, no boyfriend, I'm ugly since I gained weight and my acne is out of control, no hobbies, no money... there's nothing for me to look forward to. Nothing to make me want to keep living right now. I guess I just want someone to talk me out of it but rationally I feel like this is my best option. I keep trying to tell myself that if I just make it through I can go home and start living the life I want to live, but realistically that's not going to happen. If I fail these courses I've fucked up big time and it's going to be very difficult to come back from. 

My fantasy choice would be to disappear to a different country, get a job at a restaurant or a resort or something, and just live a whole different life and start over. But I know I'd be tracked down pretty easily, and with only $500 in my bank account I don't even have the funds to buy a plane ticket out of the country. And the guilt I'd feel for just fucking off somehwere when my parents paid so much for my university would probably ruin it anyway.

I don't know what to do or how to stop feeling this way.  I feel like a loser, a failure, like I'm never going to be able to live the life I want, and it's all my fault. Every day killing myself seems more and more enticing. I just want to stop feeling like this."
4ekh6u,6,2016-04-13,All the things that no one knows. And I just want it to look like an accident,homealone17,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4ekh6u/all_the_things_that_no_one_knows_and_i_just_want/,"I feel like I was meant to die young.  That I was always meant to kill myself.  The thoughts of death and hurting myself weren't very frequent at first, but I remember having such terrible feelings even as a child of 7 or 8, of being unloved, hiding under blankets and crying because I felt so out of place and worthless.  It wasn't all the time, just every now and then it would be horrible.  

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was 20, was put on hormones.  I thought maybe that would fix everything.  Things got bad my junior year of college.  I had good grades, classes were easy for me, I had gotten this wonderful scholarship, gotten an internship for over the summer, I had friends that had become roommates and we would have fun together, but towards the end of the year, I started not wanting to do much with them, except for maybe drink.  I figured if I got drunk, I could just escape for a little while.  And it was fine for a short time.  

When I went out of state to do an internship things got really bad.  I met a lot of nice people, and a friend from my major was with me, but I felt so alone.  I felt like I needed to harm myself, but wasn't exactly sure how.  While everyone else we were working with went out and had fun, I stayed in and cried, drank alone, started taking handfuls of whatever OTC medications I had on hand, which wasn't much or anything good, and washing them down with alcohol.  I didn't know what they would do, I figured I probably wouldn't die, but I wouldn't mind harming myself.  I remember lying in bed, facing the mirror on the closet door, with my heart racing, skin strangely splotchy, and pupils completely messed up.  

Then I did something dumb.  I told my friend how I was feeling and what I had been doing.  He flushed whatever otc meds I had down the toilet and kept close watch of me.  At the time, I guess I felt grateful.  But as time went on, I wish I hadn't told him.  I didn't want him to stop me from doing anything dumb, but more importantly, now I felt like a burden.  I hated myself even more for stressing him out.  We don't really talk much anymore.  He's married and seems to have a good life.  

I told my doctor about how I was feeling, and she put me on 10 mg of citalopram. It didn't really help.  When I got back to college after that summer, I should have been so happy.  It was my senior year, I was living with my girls I had known since freshman year, they were all so excited.  At first I tried to act ""normal,"" we would go out to bars or parties, spend lots of time together.  But that got tiring.  I just wanted to stay in my room, live off of alcohol in hopes that I could forget everything, and hurt myself.  I started burning myself with a curling iron, I'm not sure why.  My thighs were covered with blistered burns.  Initially they left faint scars, but eventually they disappeared.  

The don't really remember when that stopped being enough.  But I do remember that the first time I cut myself, I didn't know what to use, so in desperation, I wrapped a beer bottle in a towel and hit it with a hammer.  I tested the pieces to find a sharp enough one and kept the shard in my nightstand, but soon I graduated to an exacto knife.  I didn't want to bleed out, I didn't want anyone to know I was doing this, so I only shallowly cut my upper thighs.  Somehow just watching thin cuts bleed was calming and made me feel better.  I still have the scars over 4 years later, but no one knows.  

My doctor increased my dose of citalopram.  I guess it kind of helped.  Somehow I made it through my senior year, somehow I got A's even though I missed so many classes, telling everyone I was ""sick.""  I guess it wasn't a lie, but I don't think anyone knew what was truly wrong.  There were I few times that year that I told myself I was nuts and threw out my exacto knife, but then I would just go buy another and repeat the cycle: cutting, convince myself I'm insane, throw it out, buy another a few weeks later.  The worst was when I got the codeine cough syrup from the clinic because I was ""coughing all night and couldn't sleep.""  I got super drunk alone in my bedroom and drank the whole bottle.  I was very upset to wake up the next morning.

I never applied to grad school like I initially planned.  I lied to everyone who asked why I wasn't going to grad school right away.  Time at home was strange.  I got a crappy job that I didn't particularly enjoy just to do something.  I was afraid to cut myself at home, afraid my parents would go in my room and find the blade.  But eventually the cutting cycle continued.  I'd take a razor blade, for the box cutters, from work, cut myself when I needed to, throw it out, then grab another a few weeks later.  Eventually I got fired for a ridiculous reason.  My parents were out of town that week.  I cut myself a lot, but always made sure to hide the razor blade.  

I thought things would be better when I went to grad school.  My doctor finally ended up changing my hormone dose, and I think it helped a little, but I felt alone and friendless in a new city, because I was.  That first year of grad school was the last time I cut myself, though I still do feel like I want to sometimes.  

Most of my time in grad school was relatively uneventful, but I did meet my boyfriend before my second year.  We've been together over a year and a half.  I love him so much, but even that isn't enough.  I finished most of my classes, but I don't think I'll ever graduate,  and I have lost all motivation to finish everything.  

I got a shitty job after I finished my classes, one that doesn't pay a whole lot, but somehow I'm still doing it, I guess I'm a moron.   I feel like half of the people at work hate me and the other half just put up with me.  I certainly don't think any of them would miss me.  

I don't even know if my boyfriend would miss me.  I think I just hold him back.  He doesn't know that something is wrong with me.  If he did, I don't think he would have gone out of town.  He's been gone for a few weeks.  He took most of his guns with him, but there is an assault rifle under the bed.  Part of me is upset that he took them, but then part of me wouldn't want to shoot myself and leave a terrible mess anyway.  

I just want to plan it out right.  I bought a ton of poppy seeds online.  Right after my boyfriend left, I shook up some of them with some lemon juice and water to see if they could get me high.  After I drank the liquid, I felt very warm and eventually couldn't keep my eyes open, I was so at peace.  When I woke up I got very dizzy and vomited a few times, but it was good to find out that the seeds worked.  

I still have about six pounds of seeds left.  I don't know how many I should use to make a strong ""tea.""  I guess I could use them all, then get really drunk, down the ""tea"" and hopefully fall asleep and not wake up ever again.  

I can't do it yet though.  Is it weird that I don't want to die on a day I'm supposed to go into work?  If I plan it right, I'll fall asleep forever on a day off, and hopefully they will find out in enough time to schedule someone to cover my shift.  Thankfully, my boyfriend should be coming home around the day after my days off.  I don't want him to walk in on me and call an ambulance or anything, I don't want to be in a mental hospital. I don't want there to be a lot of decay or anything by the time he gets home, I'm sure coming home will be a bad enough experience.  I also don't want him to have to drop everything and come home early if he doesn't hear from me.

I have a little over a week left.  I don't think I'm going to leave a note.  While it would be nice if the assholes at work felt bad and guilty if they knew I killed myself, I don't want the people that I like to feel guilty.  Part of me does want to leave something reassuring to the people who aren't assholes, but then that will give away that it was planned, and I don't want kind people to blame themselves.  After all, it's not their fault, this is just me. 

I feel the need to clean the house before next week, so I'll have to work on that for the next few days.  I bought a huge bottle of rum that I can wash down with poppy seed tea.  I just hope that everything goes the way I intend.  If I wake up next Wednesday morning, I don't know what I'll do.

4ekiuo,1,2016-04-13,Changing Majors. Planning to take 22 hours. Horrible Mistake?,aychtooessohfore,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ekiuo/changing_majors_planning_to_take_22_hours/,"I'm changing from Chemical Engineering -&gt; Computer Engineering this semester. In order to catch up and get on track with graduating on time, I plan on taking 22 hours this semester since it will be mostly lower level courses. Here is my schedule:


 * Intro to Programming (C++) - 4 hours
 * Discrete Math - 4 hours
 * Circuits I - 4 hours
 * Logic Circuits - 3 hours
 * Physics II Lab - 1 hour
 * Stats - 3 hours
 * Art class - 3 hours


I've done a large amount of programming for internships (3 work tours), so I don't think the Programming class will be too challenging. All of the homework for it is posted online as well, and I've done all of the assignments just this past weekend (just to make sure I could do it). I would have the option to test out of the class after the first few weeks, which I will likely try to do. 


Circuits I and Logic Circuits are both taught by amazing professors at my school and are generally considered fairly easy to do well in. The art class should be an easy A. Stats has a bad professor, but from what I've heard the actual content is pretty easy. 


Physics Lab and Discrete math are the two classes I'm most concerned about. Physics lab since it has a reputation at my school for being an awful amount of work and discrete math because I've heard it's very different from other math.


I do plan on trying to review basics and read ahead for at least some of the classes over the summer.


So what do you guys think? Doable or not?

Which is why I intend to do the following:    
1.Learn Java and make an app however simple it may be.( using Java a beginner guide by Herbert Scheldt).     
2.Learn how to make a resume using LaTeX and make a website to host it.     
3.Learn 4 finger typing.     
4.Learn CS101 worth of C(already know C++)      
5.Read a bit of Cracking the Coding interview.     
6.Prepare GitHub and LinkedIn and learn how to use them.    
I'm preparing for the AP calculus BC and computer-science A right now and thus I will get 2-3 months for the aforementioned activities.    
Is it possible and will it offer any benefits in internship search.

Basically Im doing a professional accountancy course called ICAEW which after your foundation(CFAB) requires you to do a 3 month intern. Now heres where the problem starts. When I was interning, I was not required to study when I got home and so i started smoking up everyday. As a result I ended up smoking like a chimney for 4 straight months. Now that Ive entered my professional stage,  things got alot harder. But with this brain fog, it just makes things way more harder. Im not able to easily understand complex concepts like I used to be able to. The scarier thing is that my finals occur every 3 months and right now I have 2 months till my next finals. Because of the brain fog Im not able to study as efficiently as I spend so much more time understanding way less information as a result of the brain fog. I really hope its not permanent which ca fuck up my whole life as youd never know if the weed may have a little extra ingredient in it which fucked my brain up. As I typed this, I dont even fully remember what I exactly typed cause of the bloody fog. My short term memory is so bad and Im really scared for my life. Sorry for the long post, i just had to get it out of me.

Does anyone have a similar experience and know how long till your mind is fully conscious and back to 100% capacity? And Ive stopped smoking for a week now and have seen very minimal improvements"

Hi! My name is AJ, I’m a freelance filmmaker from New Zealand who loves telling stories, being creative and collaborating to make cinematic magic happen.


I’m a creative guy, I spend both my free time and my time on the clock working on storytelling as well as the whole filmmaking process.


I have studied 2 and a half years at the New Zealand Broadcasting School and now have a degree in Film and Television. I completed a six month internship at Tait Communications + stayed on an extra 3 months to help finish off a few projects.


My experience at Tait has made me very savvy with corporate video, things like interviews, promotional videos, in-plain-english animations and educational material. Since leaving Tait I have filmed and edited for several well known companies, such as Harcourts, McDonald’s, Fifa, Microsoft and I am also the go-to film guy for My Milk Ltd, a subsidiary of Fonterra.


My passions lie in the more creative side of filmmaking, I love telling stories through writing, directing and video editing. I have written and directed a few short films among my friends. My 2014 team for the Royalto Channel 48 hour film festival got runner-up in Christchurch with our short film “Something New”. We also received several awards including “Best Script” and “Best Editing”.
For my final project at Broadcasting school, I wrote, directed, produced and edited a 20 minute Sitcom pilot called “Stubble”.
I run a Youtube webseries called “Cult Popture”, where myself and a few friends discuss different aspects of the media. I write, direct and edit most of the episodes.

4el9wu,3,2016-04-13,22M Student!,Swazzoo,howismylifegoing,https://www.reddit.com/r/howismylifegoing/comments/4el9wu/22m_student/,"I'm a 22 year old, 6'5, 190lbs geodetic engineering student pursuing a masters degree in geoinformation at one of the top universities in the world in that field. I'm living in a 'student' dorm in a major student city in my country.

I'm currently working as an intern at the land registration for the government. I'm not in a relationship but dating with an international student until she's going abroad to do a new bachelors degree. I've never had problems talking to girls or people in general so I've never had a 'dry spell'. I'm in a student organisation which organises lots of activities and parties. Combining work, the girl and the organisation makes me active an average 12-16 hours each day. I have a big social life with lots of good friends and people that I like hanging out with and who like to hang out with me as well.

Now, the negatives in my life. Because of my poor family I have to loan everything to get around. This will probably account to a student debt of around €40.000. Which is a **lot**. I have a bad relationship with my father which causes me to not see his part of my family. My brother has gotten depression because of the whole issue. I'm not sure how to make him feel better and that's kind of difficult to accept for me.

I hope I balanced out the postive and negative parts a bit so it's possible to give a somewhat good rating! :)

4elmre,0,2016-04-13,"My[20F] roommate[21F] is emotionally abusive and it has reached a peak. 3 weeks left of the semester, not sure where to go from here.",mindofabeast,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4elmre/my20f_roommate21f_is_emotionally_abusive_and_it/,"My roommate (who I'll call Ashley) and I have had a very tumultuous past. We met freshman year and she was suicidal and bulimic and very ashamed of her sexuality. I figured out about all this and she made me swear not to tell anyone, so I didn't (I know, I know, stupid mistake, but I was 17 and scared at the time). I singlehandedly got her through that very rough time in her life. I went into her shower multiple times to rip the razor blades out of her hands, I followed her to the bathroom to make sure she wasn't throwing up in the toilet, and I constantly told her I loved her to help her get through this. 

She eventually did, and we dated for a period of time, but we didn't tell anyone because she was too afraid of what people would think. This, paired with a lot of other problems, including her lack of support on things that I was excited about (ex: I was looking at an internship in Georgia over the summer, she didn't want me to go because we live in a state far away from Georgia and then she wouldn't be able to come visit me over the summer), caused our relationship to fall apart and she broke up with me last year.

About a month after we broke up, I started seeing someone else, which caused her to go on an extremely depressive spiral where she physically and emotionally abused me. I once had bruises all over my arm because I took her coat when she was drunk as a joke and she ripped it off me, and another time when she was in this spiral she cornered me in my closet and pushed me. Anyways, this caused myself and all of our friends group to stop speaking to her, and we basically didn't speak for the entire summer. I made a promise to myself that I would forgive her, but if something like this ever happened again, that would be it.

Before this huge blowout had happened, we had previous chosen to live together again and had already selected our housing for next year. I won't really get into how housing works at my school, but it is important to note that she chose the room with her better housing lottery number, so if we ever had problems, I would ultimately be the one forced out. We are in the same small sorority and live in the sorority's house.

For the past year, we have had few problems living together, and our friendship returned, though she still does some pretty uncalled for things, like boss me around to clean the room or to stop feeding my dorm pet because he's ""getting fat"". 


Now, onto the current problem --

I recently ran for a high position in my sorority against one other person. She did not support me in any way, did not wish me good luck before I gave my speech, did not give me advice, anything. She blatantly supported the other candidate from day one and never even gave me the chance to explain to her why I would be good for the position, and whenever I would talk about it with her(which was very rarely) she seemed annoyed. She also did a lot of really mean, uncalled for things like try to tell the other candidate what my speech was about, follow my in to my friend's room where I was trying to get feedback on my speech, etc. Anyways, I was really hurt by this, and when elections came, I lost.

I was obviously very upset about losing, but I was ultimately more upset with the fact that she never even tried to support me when I needed it most. I didn't speak to her the rest of the night and the following day (monday), which happened to be her birthday. I texted her on her birthday once saying ""Happy birthday, we will talk tomorrow"" because another friend texted me and was telling me about how she was bitching to everyone that I wasn't celebrating her birthday with her. In my eyes, how can she expect me to celebrate her birthday when she does not celebrate me as a person? 

Tuesday rolled around and we were both in the room at the same time (we haven't been speaking to each other) and I asked if there was a time later that night where we could talk. I wanted to sit down with her and explain all of this to her calmly about why I am upset with her lack of support and make up enough where the next three weeks aren't hell where we don't speak to one another. 

Instead of telling me a time where we could talk this out, she stormed out of the room saying ""I need space, I need space!"" to which I responded ""*You* need space?"" and we haven't spoken since.

In my eyes, this is an unacceptable pattern of abusive behavior that I need to get out of. I would love to pack up my things and never speak to her again, but that isn't an option. We are still in the same small sorority together and she's been slandering me to many other people, probably saying that I'm a sore loser and that I'm a horrible person because I didn't celebrate her birthday with her. She is an extremely vocal person and will tell anyone anything, whereas though I am extroverted, I believe that this is personal business and doesn't need to be broadcasted to the entire sorority. I do not want to move out with three weeks left as I would be much further away from my own support system and it would be a huge hassle, there's no way I can get her to move out as she originally chose this room, and she currently will not speak to me to have the conversation that we obviously need to have. 

I am completely done with my friendship with her. I fully plan on not being a part of her life once school is over this semester, but I do not know what to do in the interim. What can I do to help the situation out now? It makes me very uncomfortable knowing that she's talking all sorts of shit behind my back, as well as the fact that she's just being a complete bitch to me in general. Where do I go from here?"

I have a paid internship this summer ($400 a week for 14 weeks) and I will be applying for student loans in the $9,000 and $6,000 neighborhood with my dad and mom cosigning each respectively.

My plan is to open ~3 no annual fee credit cards a couple weeks after the internship begins, but before I apply for student loans.  I figure I may take a hit in the short term with the hard inquiries and the lowering of my average account age, but by the time I graduate, these won't affect my score negatively.  In a couple years, I will have a few credit cards in my name with gleaming payment histories that are all a couple years old, and I will be set should I need to apply for a mortgage or something of that nature.  I don't intend to spend nearly anything on these cards, just enough to keep them open.  I am purely interested in improving my credit score.

I was wondering what credit cards would work best for me if I were to go through with this plan.  I currently have a 729 TransUnion score, and I would really like to know that the cards I apply for I will likely get approved for.  I've been looking into CapitalOne, Discover, BankAmericard, U.S. Bank, and Citi's no annual fee students and regular cards, and I wanted to know if there are any that I should be pursuing or steering clear of.

I've planning on taking two classes during the summer if possible (differential equations and thermo) but I really need a summer project to occupy myself and put on my resume.

Having actual technical experience is one of my biggest detractors when applying to jobs along with my low GPA (2.7... The first 3 semesters kind of wrecked me. I'm on my way to having  3.5 this semester but it'll take more than 1 semester to bring myself up to a 3.0), both of which my advisor has chewed me out for.

I write relatively well and have some pretty weird interests and hobbies. My letters of rec are very strong, coming from teachers and counselors. I really need advice on what schools out there might be for me and where I have a decent shot at. This is my first reddit post, a friend of mine suggest I post something here due to my unique disparity between my GPA, test scores, and extracurriculars. 

**Demographics:** Male, Hispanic, Nevada, Magnet high school, Junior, First gen, lower middle class

**PSAT:** 1410/1520 (new PSAT scale) currently in the running for NM, commendation recipients announced yesterday

**Class rank:** top 25% unsure on my exact rank but I know it’s in that percentile.

**UW/W GPA:** 3.1/4 UW, 3.7/4.8 W  yeah, yeah, yeah I know it’s shit. Please don't give me unnecessary flak for it

**Coursework:** So far I've taken APWH, got a 4. This year (junior year) I'm taking APUSH, APES, AP Physics, AP Lang, AP Seminar (part of the AP Capstone program), and I'm self studying for the AP Human Geography test. Next year I will be taking AP Statistics, AP Government, AP Lit, AP Research (part of AP Capstone program), and maybe one other AP science class I haven't decided on yet (AP Bio, AP Chem, or AP Physics C). Besides the plethora of AP’s all other classes have been honors. 2 years of Jazz band, 3 years of Japanese, 2 years of Spanish. I’ll graduate with 5 language credits.

**Extracurriculars**: Ok so this is where the strength of my application is

- Speech and Debate: Lincoln Douglas debate captain, Vice President Junior year, President Senior year, top 5% ranked all around competitor in the state, top 10% ranked in the country, World Schools Debate qualifier for this year, heading to nationals in June.
- Model United Nations: Founded the club my freshman year. Officer position held every year, President elect for next year. Won Best Delegate in the Security Council at LVMUNIII this year.
- Varsity Quiz: Current Vice President of the most winning Varsity Quiz team in Nevada State history. Rerunning for VP for next year. 
- Habitat for Humanity Youth United: Out of school organization, Vice President for this and next year.
- Southern Nevada Water Authority Youth Advisory Council: Council member and project head for both junior and senior year.
- Mock Trial: Open only to juniors and seniors at my school, so this was my first year. Continuing it next year, running for office.
- We The People: The team for next year hasn't been picked yet but I think I have a good shot.
- Intern/volunteer with the UNLV Archaeology department: Work under Dr. Karen Harry, professor of archaeology at UNLV. Help out with lab work and on digs.
- RYLA: Rotary Youth Leadership Awards
- American Legion Nevada Boys State
- World Atlatl Association: The atlatl is a 30,000 year-old spear-throwing device. I happen to be only of only 3 registered WAA competitors and event organizers in Nevada. Atlatls are something I’ve studied for my entire life and along with other paleo tools and practices something I’ve become known for in the community and in the academic world, organizing community events and working with archaeologists from across the country on atlatl research. Still unsure how I’ll include that in my app but it’s such a huge part of my life I need to fit it in some how. Take a look at my username and you’ll see how important it is to me. 
- Part time job: Earl of Sandwich, junior and senior year.

**Schools:** I’m all over the place, but mostly looking at smaller, liberal arts colleges. I honestly have very few preferences on location or size. I need help finding target schools. With my crap GPA I feel like every school is a reach, which is bad.

- Oberlin (visited in February, loved it)
- Pomona
- UMich Ann Arbor (visited in February)
- Grinnell College (has an atlatl team! And archaeology professor is the most recognized atlatl expert/academic in the world, John Whittaker, aka goals)
- Middlebury 
- Swarthmore 
- UCLA (visited last year)

    Budget range: 1000~1500€ (1500~2200 AUD) for the beginning

    Purpose: programming, writing/reading reports/presentation/papers (phd student, astrophysics)

    Screen size preference: 13"" to 15""

    OS preference: Fedora or Ubuntu (depend of the compatibility). I have nothing against OS X but I heard macbooks can be more expensive for the same specs.

    Gaming requirements: none

    Other performance requirements : can display hd videos

    Portability requirements: Frequently moved

    Brand preferences and reasons: none. I used a cheap samsung n130 netbook with a fedora lxde desktop for my undergrade studies and used a desktop during internships

    Any particular style that you like: not picky here.

Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)

    Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: Good battery and decent perfomance (even though big stuff like simulations are not done on your personal laptop)

    Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality

List any critical features:

    8/16GB RAM, i5/i7 (suggestion from a friend)

    Ethernet Port, hdmi

Finishing thoughts : 

1) I am not very knowledgeable about the laptops in this budget range since I've never had one of these.

2) I might also get a discount (student or from my lab) for some brands. I will also have a skype session (still abroad) with my team about any specific needs (compatibility with some specific tools for instance).

3) How do the warranty work if you put a linux distro ?"

When a new employee is hired HR was *supposed* to give me around a weeks worth of prep for new computer setup (we can't do images), email, etc. So long of a heads up for my sake because shit goes wrong with computers sometimes or I'm working on a time sensitive project and need to schedule stuff to make it work. The habit with our new HR manager (been here ~6mo) is to verbally tell me the day of.

I have spoken to and emailed him multiple times about submitting a ticket and he started doing it about two weeks ago. Though he submits the ticket in the wrong format and with the fields filled out incorrectly. He also fills in info for our payroll system wrong, incorrect birthdays and stuff.

I have been keeping my boss informed about this and forwarded some email chains to him. Last week my boss sent an email to the HR guy and CC'd me, our finance director, the manager in charge of interns, and the VP (HR's boss). It basically stated that he's not doing his job and that if I am not given 72 hours or three work days (I agreed to this amount of time) notice with a *correctly* filled out ticket that I am not responsible for getting it done.

This morning I sent out another email to the HR guy telling him to fix the tickets he submitted incorrectly and CC'd my boss on it. The HR guy asked me to help him fix one to make sure he does it right, I helped of course. He then proceeded to leave work, at 11am not 5pm, before correcting the other three... Chances are he'll get chewed out by my boss again tomorrow.

Now to see if he starts to follow through. There's already one new hire next month that he hasn't submitted a ticket for which I'm not going to do crap about until he does his side correctly. This was my boss's command for handling it."

So it's rather early for me to post, I usually post nights but today is my day off and my kids are gone so I was looking to have some fun till I have to go and get my kids. But don't worry, I will come back and keep playing when I can. 

So, I've had quite a bit of fun here, exploring new things and if you want a different idea always check out my previous posts, last night I posted about *fantasy creatures* but I know that isn't for everyone. 

Right now, I am hoping to find some partners that would like to take part in my idea(s) right now. Here is my first idea:

*I am a very successful businesswoman and I just hired you as my new intern assistant. You've heard stories about me being a mean and uptight lady, but you weren't scared of it at all. On your first day here, you knew you'd expect a lot of running around and what not. But you never knew anything else would happen.*

*I had a secret, it's not a knew one. I've had plenty of assistants before and they have always been told to sign a contract stating that they can't talk about anything that happens in the company. If anyone outside of work finds out. The assistant is to blame, since they would be the only one to know. And they would be sent to jail.*

*I like to have sex with my assistants, at work, at my home, even in the limo that drives me home. The assistance is mine to do with as I please. If I wanted her to walk around with a buttplug, she would. If I was stressed from work, she'd be on her knees, eating my pussy under the desk. Hell, if I had a business partner come to visit, she'd be pleasing him or her.*

*The assistant was mine. I was paying her to work for me and I was paying her to please me. Things couldn't be easier for the intern I hired.*

***

So that's my big idea right now. I just hope I can find someone to help me play it out at this time. I know there aren't a lot of people on now because of their real lives, but I am always looking no matter how old the post is. 

I would love to chat about this before starting, I hate not being able to get to know my partner before starting cause I need to know about appearance, kinks and limits, and anything else. 

Thank you so much &lt;3"

I made the mistake of thinking this would give me a good shot of landing an internship; however, the 32 applications resulting in only 1 actual interview (made it to final rounds and got rejected) say otherwise. I'm not sure how to proceed and it feels disheartening as far as if I can't even get an internship how am I supposed to get a full-time job next year after graduation? Is there anything I can do maybe outside of school so up my chances of at least getting an interview?

I'm excited to buy my first gopro but not sure yet if I buy the hero session now (limited budget) or wait more to get a hero4 in 2 or 3 months.
I've read about the specs of all cameras and their price.

Here are more information that might help:

I plan to use the gopro most of the time attached to my helmet piloting my motorcycle in the city as well as off-road (I do motocross) so the session looks convenient because of its size.
Also will use it for water sports as snorkeling and kayaking.

Is it really ""uncomfortable"" to use hero4 in a helmet? (I've heard that it can be heavy with the case and sometimes can obstruct the pilot's vision)

I dont have my motocycle right now because I'm abroad doing an internship in Europe so the gopro would be use in the meanwhile to shoot holiday trips only.

Here they cost (secondhand):
Hero Session: 180€ 
Hero4 Silver: 300€
Hero4 Black: 400€

New: 220€, 430€ and 530€ in the same order.

However I would need to get my joining date extended if that is the case. Do you think it makes sense to discuss this with my manager now, or should I wait until I get the job offer?

4emxfe,5,2016-04-13,Getting interviews but not job offers. Hitting a Wall and need some advice,Jayarch,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4emxfe/getting_interviews_but_not_job_offers_hitting_a/,"I'm job hunting in the digital marketing field which I've held a few previous positions in and have been on a number of interviews for the past year. Though, I seemed to have hit a wall in terms of getting offers am reflecting/ trying to take a hard look at my current interviewing skills. I've been on enough interviews where I should have received an offer or two but I haven't received any. I have been close for interviews where it's been a choice between me and someone else but almost getting the offer is still not getting the job. It's making me reflect since I don't remember having this much trouble getting my internship and entry level positions I've had in the past, I just applied for jobs like everyone else, went on a few different interviews, received a few rejections but most of the time there would be at least one offer from one of the places I interviewed with after only a couple of months of job hunting; this was the post recession economy too. 

It's a numbers game but now that I'm trying to move up into higher paying positions though can't seem to break through this wall standing between me and potential offers. I suspect it's largely due to my interviewing skills which were enough to get entry level jobs are but are not enough to get higher paying positions to move up in my career (though I've been on a few interviews for entry level paying positions where the responsibilities were nearly the exactly same as my previous jobs and didn't get those either). I've emailed for feedback a couple of times but have either received no response. The one time I did was a reply informing me “We can't give feedback to rejected candidates, just company policy. Thanks for your understanding and best of luck in your job search.” That interview went pretty well I thought.... It could've been a case of a candidate being more qualified or having better interviewing skills but my confidence is a bit dinged over these past couple of months.

What's strange is I've been told I have a good resume by a couple of my previous interviewers at the start of the interview but a few times when I talked about my previous experience I can see disappointment come across their face or they become disengaged when I answer a question honestly but it's not the answer they were looking for and made their mind up they're not going to hire me but continue on with the interview anyway. Then I'll recognize something just went wrong somewhere and wonder whether I should have said more about my experience, specific project, if I didn't tie my answer back to the duties of the position such as to the question “What's your greatest weakness?” or just am not selling myself as I should be since I'm understandably a bit nervous. Something is going wrong somewhere along the line. 

I think what's happening here is the good on paper scenario with with my resume vs me. In person my personality is a bit of reserved and modest but this can have a negative effect during an interview since you really need to sell yourself,  skills and experience. I think part of the problem is how I'm coming across to interviewers; a nice honest person who has some skills that they're looking for but probably leaving them with doubts about the depth of my skills/ not explaining them fully enough and possibly even not being a good cultural fit which can be a bit tricky since that deals with personality.

Another issue I think is my degree which in architecture but having much of my work experience from previous jobs in digital marketing. One reason for that is I initially applied for architecture jobs when I graduated but couldn't get any entry level jobs in arch since I lacked real world experience in the field (applied for internships in college but this was during the recession when architecture firms were laying off workers. I did manage to get a marketing internship in college which lasted a year and then got a low paid digital marketing position at a startup which lasted about a year also which lead to another digital marketing position which lasted a few years. Around this time I thought, “hmm.... a marketing career seems to be working out better than the arch; and I don't even have a degree in it strangely. But some interviewers have asked me when they see my degree on my resume. “So what about architecture?” Which is a deeper question really asking “Are you going to jump ship a few months from now if you find a job in your degree field?” I try to make it clear that I've made a career change to the marketing field which has more opportunities and even how there are even transferable skills between the two industries but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Though, there's plenty of people working in field which they don't have degrees in so they're navigating this question in a better way than I am.
 
Finally, I think some of my interviews are not going as they should is when it comes time for me to ask questions. I like to think I generally have good informed questions based on my research beforehand though have caught myself asking a general question which they've already stated during the first few minutes of the interview due to nerves or not asking questions that are in depth enough perhaps which can be shooting myself in the foot. 

Sorry for such a long post but I'm a bit frustrated and especially now being laid off, my saving getting low and seeing friends move up in there careers making pretty good money, buying homes, going on vacation, etc... It's not good to compare to others but it's dinged my confidence a bit and made me think “What are they doing that I'm not?” 

I'm thinking about just getting a part time job but worry if I can't even get an offer for a full time job how am I going to get an offer for a part time job? With a college degree and several years work experience at that since many part time positions seek college students or non college graduates. 

Can anyone relate or do you have advice if you went through the same thing of getting interviews but not offers?"

I've posted in here before, and will post again, based on my most recent thoughts.

I received my B.S. in Psychology in 2011.
I received my M.S. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling in December of 2015.

In the last year of my Masters program, I realized that although Counseling is fun, and has some excitement, the bad feelings towards it outweighs the enjoyment. I know it sounds crazy to not want to do something without even officially starting, but my loss of interest, terrible internship experiences, and overall lack of earning potential has really disheartened me.


I currently work as a youth leader at a religious institution for the last 4 years, and this year I have grown to not enjoy it. I am up for a promotion for the coming year, starting July, and I'm really worried that I will be miserable working there still.

I have discovered that I am more interested in things like budgets, benefits, etc, although lacking a solid knowledge base. I have been researching accountants, financial advisors, Human Resources generalists all as options to explore.

I am currently engaged, getting married in June of this year. I hate to put my fiancee through this uncertainty.


I would appreciate any direction or advice on ways to progress."

Sent to my boyfriend of course... And my other friend. The one that I fooled around sometimes. It felt wrong to say that I was cheating on him. Cheating sounded so dirty, so wrong, so naughty. Which was nice when I was in the moment, riding my lover...

I preferred the term knowing what I want and taking it. I love my boyfriend but he really can't pleasure me like Nathan can... I grabbed my morning apple from the side, striding over to the couch and laying down, turning on the TV. The news was on.

""Something has happened, there's a virus, Quanxin Corporation have spread their nanobots, infecting anyone... Lock your doors. Supply food. They're coming... No... Please!"" The middle-aged, balding man pushed away on his office chair, and... A [stunning blonde girl](http://i.imgur.com/WeJiRRd.jpg) that must be some intern or something stumbled into shot, giggling as she planted a soft kiss on his lips, her fake-nailed hands slowly sliding down to unzip his pants...

And I watched as before my eyes his hair began to grow, his face change, watched as she pulled out his hard cock and watched it shrink into... Nothingness. ""Not again, darn it! Come on, Kandy, let's find some more cock."" The bimbo intern giggles, taking a lick of the fresh pussy that just appeared in front of my eyes before moving away from the camera, leaving the... Bimbo? What was once the news reporter there, panting, his... No, her hands rubbing furiously as she experienced her first orgasm. The camera was knocked over, the screen shattered and somebody pulled the wire out. Or tripped over it.

What the actual fuck happened. I turned off the TV, throwing my apple core into the bin as I looked out of the apartment window. My phone vibrated twice in a row. I picked it up, seeing texts from both my boyfriend and lover. Both of them were saying to get to their places as soon as possible, that they would protect me. I turned my phone off.

It was an apocalypse. I had to save myself. I grabbed one of the big kitchen knifes with the serrated edge, and grabbed a sweater to pull over my skin. How did this... Virus work? I looked out of the window again. Blonde bimbos with massive fake tits were chasing down girls and boys. I watched one of them take down a mother running with her two twelve-year old children, turning the mother into a bimbo almost instantly. I turned away before they caught the children.

As I opened the door out of my apartment, I heard a scream. At the end of the corridor I saw one of the girls I share lectures with on her knees, her mouth eagerly licking out a bimbo with... Brunette hair? I watched Cathy's hair bleach blonde, her tits balloon as if it was some sort of voodoo magic. I turned around and sprinted towards the staircase.

---

Who are you? My boyfriend who found out I was cheating? My lover who wants to hunt down my boyfriend and get two bimbo babes? Another survivor entirely? The idea is that we don't get infected instantly, so it will be a bit of a story... Of course, with all these bimbos letting off all their pheromones, you can get awfully horny...

I prefer people who actually reply to the roleplay. No limits, I have a lotta kinks."

Let's call them A and B.

Offer A is in the clothing industry, and is something I'm really interested and passionate about. However, the company is only a start-up which means that there are some positives and negatives. For one, my voice will be heard and I will be able to grow more freely. But on the other hand, they don't have a set ""Internship Program"" where they train you and teach you specific technical skills. The internship is going to be more broad and general. Offer A also pays slightly more than Offer B, but is slightly farther away from home. 

Offer B is something more professional, but is in the pharmaceutical industry. I'm not really passionate about this industry, and I don't know if I want to be stuck in it. From interviewing with this company, I can tell that they are understaffed and the workload is heavy. However, this company provides more specific technical experience, which may become transferable skills when I become a junior next year.  

I'm stuck between choosing between offer A and B. To add to the problem, I accepted offer A about a month ago, and would have to renege on the offer in order to accept offer B.

4en05b,0,2016-04-13,What can I do to get into HBS?,MBAGMATGUY111,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4en05b/what_can_i_do_to_get_into_hbs/,"Hello, 

I am currently a junior at Cornell looking for advice on what I could do to increase my chances of getting to HBS specifically.  The reason I am fixated on this school despite not having entered the work force full time is that I had wanted to attend Harvard for my undergrad but started thinking about my education/future too late while in high school and could not build a strong enough profile to get in, and want to avoid a repeat of that by getting a headstart. Also it's obviously a great school and very well suited to my goals. 

Moving on, my profile is as follows:

-20 year old Indian male (green card holding permanent resident)

-double majoring in economics and statistics, minor in government,  4.08~ GPA which I will hopefully maintain to graduation, but probably won't be able to. My GPA is higher than 4 due to some graduate level stats and Econ courses I undertook. 

-I have not yet taken  the GMAT but based on advice given to me in my other thread, I will probably start preparing for it soon before I am working full time. I anticipate that I will be able to score quite well on it as I have  always been quite good at standardized testing and scored a 2300+/2400 on the SAT and scored a 710 on a GMAT practice test I gave without prep. I anticipate that with a good amount of prep I should be able able to score 760 or above. 

As for work experience, after freshman year, I had an internship at a venture capital firm in India which i finagled my way into through ""networking"" i.e the firms director went to college with the father of one of my friends from high school. I am unsure of the value of this experience as it is not US based, but both of the firms directors hold M7 MBAs if it makes a difference. After my sophomore year, I was an investment banking summer analyst at one of credit Suisse/Barclays/deutsche. In the coming summer i will be a summer analyst at Goldman/JPM/MorganStanley. I was hoping to get an MBB consulting internship, as most other Indian males I know of at HBS and similar schools had MBB experience, but unfortunately was unable to. However, I do not want to work as a consultant myself. 

The main issue with my profile is that as a result of focusing mainly on my academics and work experience I have neglected my extracurricular activities. I have leadership roles in my schools investment and economics clubs. I'm also a member of some creative clubs but pretty inactive in those. I write a semi regular column on economic policy/politics from an economic perspective in a college news publication. Also I had a short research stint with an economics professor and group of undergrad and grad students but in hindsight it was pretty inconsequential. I participated in it because I was considering going into academia and getting my PhD in economics but after some self reflection I probably won't. Basically I want to know how I can boost my profile, especially the extracurriculars. I was thinking of starting a political/economics/stats blog like fivethirtyeight out of my own passion/interest but honestly I don't think i could take out the time and doubt its impact would be significant given the amount of time invested. Still, it's something I'm into and would like to do if I had the time. What are some activities or initiatives I could take up which could boost this part of my profile but not require as much of a time commitment?

As for my career goals, I want to work in finance. I definitely don't want to work in the sell side long term, and hope to work in either private equity or hedge funds, and am also considering VC. Obviously buy side jobs are very hard to get as a fresh grad, and I will probably work for in IBD after grad before breaking in. Is it worth pursuing opportunities in MBB consulting after grad given that I am sure that I want to work in finance long term? I ask because as an Indian male I face particularly stringent admissions standards and nearly all of the Indians I know at HSW have had MBB or tech experience. However if I were to somehow get into consulting, breaking into PE would probably happen only after my mba.

I guess I'm basically looking for advice on how to become the most attractive possible candidate. I'm  sorry for the long rambling post, I'm typing on my phone and English is my second language. Thanks for reading.

I took vacation, turned out to be unpaid, I thought I was salaried, but I guess I am hourly, while on vacation a few mistakes I had made came out, I realized I had made them right before, I got the calls on them, so after a good chewing out, I carried on with my vacation. 
First day back at work, my boss presents me with a list of shit I need to unfuck myself on, on there was a customer complaining about my children being too loud, all I can think and eventually say is, this woman isn’t even a paying customer, she is my bosses friend, he didn’t feel like providing her IT service, so he threw her to me, I helped her during my off time, and I monitored her computers until everything, was done while she was out getting drunk, and she call’s my boss to complain that my kids are loud, it was unprofessional and he fucking agree’ s with her, Bruh. 
So then after discussing that I no longer want to provide afterhours system maintenance, because it really interferes with my ability to get sleep, and complete my college course work, we have some customers who live at their desks, my pay gets cut $300 a month, which made no sense since I wasn’t even getting paid extra, to do the afterhours system maintenance because I thought I was salaried. So in 2015 I made $27k after tax, and in 2016 I am looking at just $23K, I saw the numbers cause he left his computer unlocked of the $300K the NY office generated, I alone brought in $120K and when I had to go to Miami that I had to pay, I brought in another $80K. Also the dude bought a Porshe. 
I have a Job interview with a new company on Friday, and 3 others interview next week.

Original post:
I have been at a small IT consulting company for 2 years now, I do owe this place a bit, I started off with just knowing how to format a hard drive and now I handle all the LVL 1, LVL 2 and some of the LVL 3, onsite, remotely and after hours system servicing. Recently I have been having the F@ck its. It maybe because I haven’t taken an actual day off in a year, even when I am away I still do remote support, on the other hand, my salary. My pay is based upon my certification, the more certs I have, the more I make, currently I have an MCSA in Windows 8.1 and have 2 test tests left till my MCSE in Server 2012 R2 Desktop infrastructure, but MCSE is my pay cap, with a family to support and only making $27k for 2015, if it wasn’t for my Veteran Benefits supplementing my income drastically, I most likely would have left a long time ago, but out of both loyalty and the fact that I received heavy exposure to different IT environments, I am staying in this limbo, it doesn’t help that I am relied upon heavily. Since our interns don’t last more than month, they all either don’t get it or fail there exams several times, the other guy had a psychotic break, after falling asleep on a train and waking up thinking God was trying to kill him, Seriously that happened. I think I should go, but it would hurt this company to go, at the same time since we handle mostly Microsoft, I realized that I allowed myself to specialize and not also learn the different OS’s in-depth and other virtualization technologies, so I am concerned that I may not be an appealing prospect. Well I am looking for advice to go or to stay or just anything really?"

4en6rm,5,2016-04-13,Freshman trying to network into a PWM internship and Need Advice.,sprezzaturian1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4en6rm/freshman_trying_to_network_into_a_pwm_internship/,"So I'm a freshman Business major at a CA community college who is currently trying to network my way into a summer internship for Private Wealth Management. I will be applying for transfer this Fall to UC Berkeley Haas, USC Marshall, UCLA, and a few others. I am trying to start a career in finance after college and I want to get a head start on networking and gaining experience. I have an Excel Spreadsheet with names and have been networking heavily. 

I'm still trying to get the hang of networking as it is a skill gained through lots of practice. 

I recently did an informational interview with the Senior Vice President of a Morgan Stanley PWM office in my area, it went really well and he was impressed by my knowledge of the industry and said I asked really good questions. In my follow up thank you email a day after the call, I said ""If you are offering any internship opportunities at your office over the summer please feel free to contact me. I would love to learn more about your company and the Wealth Management Industry. "" and also said that I hope to keep in touch. When I asked about whether their office offer opportunities for experience I was told that ""it depends"" and it was left very open ended. So maybe that is a good sign as its not a flat out ""no you don't have the experience"". 

Is this too forward and too soon? I understand you cannot outright ask of an internship but I think I worded it in a laid-back kind of way. I feel if I'm not at least a little aggressive I won't get one. They usually take juniors from USC and UCLA as interns so I'm really up against it but am determined to work for it. I also have been networking with my local smaller Wealth Management firms as well, but I really want that name brand to stand out. Worst case scenario I gain good contacts, mentors, and have great phone and in person interviews where I learn a lot, even if I don't get the internship opportunity. Am I being too aggressive or committing any faux pas? I am trying to show my contacts that I am smart, trustworthy, and would fit in well with their team over the summer. But I need to go from the interview to actually being offered a summer position.

4en93u,4,2016-04-13,Rant,labratthrowaway12321,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/4en93u/rant/,"About half a year ago, I was at the point of finishing my undergrad so I was looking for a lab to take me in for a Masters/PhD. I had stellar grades and research experience, so I was confident that I’d have no issues. In the end, I couldn’t find a lab of my choice so I contacted a postdoc in another lab for a paid internship position in her lab. Through an interview, she said that she saw promise in me, so she agreed to take me under her wing. Getting my name on papers before I apply for graduate school was our key goal. She was my saviour. 

It’s been a couple months since I started and I’ve let it boil to the point where I hate my job. I mean I love lab work, but whenever I make a mistake my supervisor chews me out really hard. Some memorable mistakes I’ve made would be leaving uncleaned equipment on a shared bench space, running western blots on lysates that were insufficiently sonicated, and etc. Some mistakes were truly my fault, but most were honestly trivial and a few weren’t even my fault. But every time something goes wrong she chews me out. This isn’t even constructive criticism or an act of teaching me lesson. I can sense anger and sometimes animosity. Each and every time I have always owned up to my mistake, apologized, and pledged to prevent future happenings. But it doesn’t matter. The worst is when she takes the shit out of me for something that wasn’t close to my fault..

This situation wasn't so bad in the beginning, but recently it’s gotten to the point where she’s bullying me. She’s not even reprimanding me anymore, she just does things that are mean. I can’t even be in the same general area as her right now because it makes me anxious. I mean, fuck, I’m a hard worker. I work so much overtime without banking a single hour, I NEVER take breaks, and there are many days where I don’t even eat lunch just so I can get the work she wants done. I even send her emails proposing different experiments that might be our next steps, and I send her literature that she might not have come across. There was a month long period where I came in every day of every weekend for HOURS in hopes of making her happy about my performance. I don’t even want any complements about my work ethic, I just want her to stop being mean. 

The other big issue is that I’m starting to feel that I don’t matter anymore. It’s been four months since I started, and I’ve only been only doing cell culture and western blots. I was promised by her that I’d be learning MANY other techniques, but now I feel that she’s actively depriving me. She never tells me to “come and watch” when she’s doing the things that I haven’t learnt (ie FACs). And she ignores my active requests to learn new things like IF. I’m getting the feeling that she thinks I’m not worth the effort to teach because of the occasional mistakes on my western blots (ie air bubbles in transfer). She also isn’t letting me get my own project, so I’ll never get to present in front of the entire lab. Hell, even the other undergrad and the other techs present in lab meetings. 

My contract here is 1 year but I don’t know if I can stand 6 more months. The only silver lining is that this lab is extremely successful and I’d be getting my name on one or two of her publications, though it won’t be close to a second or third author. I’m also doubtful of any letter of recommendation that I’d be getting from my PI since I’ll never get the chance to do my own work or present. He's very hands off so he doesn't know me that well either. 

I don’t even know if a year of western blot and tissue culture is worth my time. My supervisor has done a lot for me by hooking me up with this job and I am extremely appreciative, which is why I haven’t spoken up thus far, but I’m beginning to hate the way she deals with my mistakes and I feel like I’m not being used to my fullest potential.

Just so lost.

4enawv,3,2016-04-13,What sort of applications do Electrical Engineers (or EE students) use SQL or Visio in?,BabyLizard,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/4enawv/what_sort_of_applications_do_electrical_engineers/,"Hello all. 

I am currently a 3rd year EE student trying to get an internship for the summer. I didn't get one in my preferred field but a friend is trying to hook me up with one in a software company where he works. The job primarily uses SQL (and Visio) and so he has told me to modify my CV to show that I have SQL/Visio experience/worked on a school project which utilized SQL and/or Visio.

The thing is...to date I have never used SQL in school. I know it sounds weird but it just never came up. I think one of my 4th year courses brushes up on it and that's it. I did use SQL when I was operating a point-of-sale at an electronics store but that was almost 4 years ago. As for Visio...a quick google search tells me it is a data modelling software but that's about all I know.

So my question is this: what sort of projects or applications do you (or have you) used either SQL or Visio in? I know SQL is used to access/edit large databases but I would like really specific answers that give me some sort of technical idea of how these tools are used.

Enough to where I can consider going to EDCLV. I live in Texas so I'll have to fly. Throw in a few hundred to the cost. I would need to take off work on the Friday and Monday around the weekend which will cost me $300+. I would need to book 3 nights at a hotel. $300-500 for hotels? Then I'll have to pay for travel to and from the venue. $100ish. Plus event ticket, +$430.

Adds up to $1500+?

I just had my first festival locally this past weekend (Euphoria) and it was great. I went to see if I liked the festival life and I do. But I wouldn't have spent big money on it if I were an out of stater. EDC on the other hand, I feel like I would be falling in love the entire time, well worth the grand or two.

After some searching, I saw that Vegas hotels are like are 21+ for check in. So is it impossible for me for an 18 y/o to find a room in 2016? I assume the hotel would be the only hassle. Unless, do you need a CREDIT card to book a flight? Never booked a flight before either. Not interested in all the pool parties and such going on EDC week at all. Welp, I just don't want to buy tickets and go my hopes up for nothing.

Tide: I went with a Hostel. Anything that's not on the strip with a casino ended up being only 18+. Went ahead and bought everything today. Flight + hostel + shuttle + ticket = $968"

Offer A is in the clothing industry, and is something I'm really interested and passionate about. However, the company is only a start-up which means that there are some positives and negatives. For one, my voice will be heard and I will be able to grow more freely. But on the other hand, they don't have a set ""Internship Program"" where they train you and teach you specific technical skills. The internship is going to be more broad and general. Offer A also pays slightly more than Offer B, but is slightly farther away from home.

Offer B is something more professional, but is in the pharmaceutical industry. I'm not really passionate about this industry, and I don't know if I want to be stuck in it. From interviewing with this company, I can tell that they are understaffed and the workload is heavy. However, this company provides more specific technical experience, which may become transferable skills when I become a junior next year.

I'm stuck between choosing between offer A and B. To add to the problem, I accepted offer A about a month ago, and would have to renege on the offer in order to accept offer B.

4enqge,1,2016-04-13,"Budget ""mid-range"" gaming PC to use for ~3years",GoingToSimbabwe,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/4enqge/budget_midrange_gaming_pc_to_use_for_3years/,"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming (and some office applications, but those shouldn't be any probs given my first reasoning). Doesn't needs to be high end gaming on topped of settings (medium settings is prolly enough for most games if I get a stable 60fps). 
Dark Souls 3 is what brings me to making this post.
Not too intrigued to play BF4, Witcher 3 or GTA5.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

~450-600€. Not perfectly sure, as I will most likely need to save up some month anyhow.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

In 2-3 Month from now (I do understand the build will be out of date till then, this post is more about getting a general overview of what is doable in my budget). 

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

GPU, CPU, MB, 1 TB harddrive (no need for SSD for now), casing, probably about 8GB of RAM (could keep an old 4GB bar; see below)

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Germany.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Mouse: Razer Naga      

KB: random off the shelve MS keyboard     

Monitor: ASUS VE247     

RAM: the one I could keep (4GB): DDR3-1333 (not perfectly sure about the producer atm)


&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

Maybe. Depends on how long a rig in my budget will be able to run newish releases on medium setting/stable framerates (my current rig actually managed to stay kind of relevant for my interest for around 7 years with some minor tweaks).

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Not exactly.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

A normal tower is perfectly fine.     

Color: something 'gentle' (black, grey, whatever. not too fancy).       

No need for LEDs or anything, casing fans prolly wouldn't be too bad of an idea.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Nope. Got Win 7 Ultimate 64.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Some reasoning: 
Currently still studying so I am kind of low on cash. I will probably get a better rig when I finished my studies and got a job (~1.5-2.5 years if all goes well and depending on internship plans). 
So I am more or less only searching for a PC to bridge the gap till I got enough money to get some high end stuff.
Tripple A releases normally do not tease me too much, playing lots of indie stuff. It really is Dark Souls 3 which tips me over to buy something new for now (and I guess I surely will find some stuff I eventuelly want to play when I can).  
I am not too much of a sucker for maxed out graphics, but stuff should run on medium at least. A staple 45-60fps however is a must.   

As mentioned above, I will need to save up some month, but I want to get a general overview of what is possible in this price range in general (and see if what I want is doable within my budget).
Probably will post another request once I actually got the money.

Anyhow, I seem to repeat myself.
Thanks for your contribution kind stranger!"

I've know my GF (Ex?) for over 2 years. about 6 months ago, I started thinking maybe it could be more than casual friends. We started dating, immediately had chemistry we never knew we had and everything was great. The only issue was her best friend who felt that she had ""changed"" since she started dating me.

Mainly, the complaint was that she didn't have as much time for her friend. At one point her friend used the phrase ""after everything I've done for you, I just feel under-appreciated."" That was a HUGE red flag for me regarding the health of their relationship. At the time that we started dating, she also started a stressful internship for a career change, and I felt that was responsible for a lot of her being less considerate in her friend's eyes, etc. Prior to me coming along, I gather that they spent 4-5 days/evenings a week together.

A bit of back-story on them. When my GF moved back to my state, she was in a rough spot, prior abusive relationship, etc. Her friend had recently been through a divorce. They bonded, naturally. Her friend is now engaged to a very nice guy with all the check boxes. My GF and I fit. Similar backgrounds, religion, family plans, etc...

Today, we went to coffee. We'd had a great date last weekend, had gone away for a week about 3 weeks ago, things were good.

Today, she tells me she's changed since she started dating me. She's been lying to friends, etc. Specifically, lying about spending time with me when they want to hang out. Her specific example was a friend (different friend) wanted to go to the gym last Saturday and her saying she ""overslept"" when in reality she was just cuddling in bed with me. She also admitted that it was mostly her best friend who she had been lying to about how much time we spend together. FYI, we live about 45 minutes apart, spend 1, sometimes 2 nights a week together, and sometimes spend all of one weekend day together.

I told her that it's normal that a serious relationship will take time from other relationships, especially her ""best friend."" I told her straight up today that she had created an actual relationship with her best friend, and that any relationship, be it me or someone else, will affect that relationship because she is supposed to start relying on me as a partner for some of the emotional support she has come to rely on her friend for.

She just said she needed to work on herself, alone. Of course, she won't be cutting her friend out of her life, just me.

I told her I'm here if she needs me, but that I can't be just casual friends right now, maybe eventually, but I said ""if you ask me to walk away, I can't talk to you or see you if I can't call you mine, at least not for a while.""

I just don't know what to do... I've fallen for this girl, she's everything I want, and I just feel like a poisonous, unhealthy friendship has sabotaged us...

Before it's suggested, she's been seeing a counselor for a couple of weeks who apparently told her she needs to do what ""she feels is best."" I'm betting she hasn't gone into detail about the nature of her friendship.

Also note, I'm a decent catch. I have a career, car, relatively fit, I'm polite, no drugs, don't drink, don't smoke, never abusive, etc.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend broke up with me because her friend feels that she's ""changed,"" i.e. doesn't devote all her time to her."
4eohoc,5,2016-04-13,Decision Support Needed! Fuqua ($$) vs Yale SOM vs Stern,throwawaydecision88,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4eohoc/decision_support_needed_fuqua_vs_yale_som_vs_stern/,"I could use some insights from the broader community on my decision. 

To start, my post-MBA goal is to join a F500 corporate working in a leadership development/general management/internal strategy/or product management role in NYC/NJ.  My girlfriend and I will be moving to this area together, but she is 1 year ahead of me in the MBA process and has an offer in that region for an internship already. 

I received some dough from Fuqua (&gt;$15k, &lt;50k).  Until recently, I was between Yale and Fuqua.  I think culture-wise, Fuqua is a better fit and the money is a nice bonus (Yale likely won't match). In analyzing the employment placement rigorously through conversations with multiple parties, despite popular belief that Yale places better into the area given its proximity, the numbers don't seem to support that.  Fuqua seems to have just as strong, if not stronger placement, for these roles in NYC/NJ both out of school and in looking at number of people in the top F500 firms from each school.  Yale is of course rising in the rankings (could make top 5 over next few years), has a better university brand (but not as good for BSchool IMO), and offers a more diverse experience. 

I had largely written off stern from the onset - never really liked the culture, don't want to be in the city for my 2-year MBA, and it is on a downward trajectory, possibly in a tier below the other 2 schools.  HOWEVER, in doing alot of recent analysis as far as alumni network in the region and corporate placement in the region, Stern definitely is the strongest given its regional status. 

My questions are - what would you guys do?  Is there anything else I should consider before making my decision?  Stern decision is due 4/18 (which literally until yesterday had been a non-issue for me), with Fuqua due the following week.  Do I go with the fit angle (and money) and pick Fuqua, expecting to still get a job through on-campus recruiting and individual networking (I am a multi-year experienced strategy consultant currently, not super worried about getting interviews). Or do I go with a shorter-term given with Stern, but not have as strong of country-wide network for the rest of my life.  Or pick Yale given the recent ranking increase?

Thanks in advance for all advice /sentiments - much appreciated!

4eoj7a,4,2016-04-13,"Holy fucking potatoes, I actually fucking did it.",VodkaAndDietSprite,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/4eoj7a/holy_fucking_potatoes_i_actually_fucking_did_it/,"Shortly after I was born, it didn't take people long to figure out I was a bit different. I didn't interact a lot socially, and kept to myself a lot. The diagnoses came fast. Autism.

Now, this didn't bother me much at first. Just like how someone who is colorblind doesn't know how to enjoy paintings to it's fullest potential, so couldn't I imagine how nice a social life was.
Still, after thanks to my family and a nice environment at elementary school, I opened up a little bit. At the end of elementary, I was a little bit social. And a good piece of new came, for freshman elementary school I would be put in the same class as two of my friends from elementary. Sound ideal, right? If I do something weird or am struggling socially, they could help me.
But what would be the ideal situation turned into hell instead. They started to make ""jokes"" about me, which turned into verbal bullying instead. However, since they were ""my friends"" and it was ""just verbal"" I tried to rationalize instead. This destroyed me mentally. Even though I was put into different class the second year, I didn't open up again. Socially, I was frozen. Even if I had a nice interaction, I didn't really felt any enjoyment.
Luckily, my grades got a little bit better, and I got put into a higher level course. (I'm from the Netherlands, middle/high school is one thing, with different ""levels"") A completely new group of people. Since it was a completely different enviroment, I tried to open up again, with completely new people.
Which resulted in me, getting bullied. Again.

Now, if you've been bullied yourself, you'll know how important the first time you open up again is after having been bullied. The bullying lasted until the end of my middle school torture period life.

Afterwards, I started doing a vocational training. The first two years, it went well. My classmates were nice enough and I started to hang around with people again. I didn't really need to study because it was pretty easy for me. Things seemed to go well.
Until the third year, when I had to do an internship. The company I did my internship at wasn't suited for someone like me, who has a form of autism. This resulted in my internship getting cancelled, and as a consequence I got put of my vocational training earlier. I did get a degree, but at a much lower ""quality"" to get a job. (and with a story like that, good luck finding a job) Moreover, I wanted to study physics, and with that degree going to a university wasn't directly possible.

So I started to work my way upward. I did an extra middle/high school year, which allowed me to start my physics major afterwards. (It wasn't exactly easy... I had to go from basic algebra to basic differential calculus in 7 months)
When I started with physics, I felt straight at home. I made some good friends. Really good friends, of which some of them I would trust with my life. My confidence is actually returning thanks to them, bit by bit. And I'm actually doing well with my study despite my educational background.

However, there was one thing I had yet to do. An internship.
I took a gamble, and went overseas to the US. At a big university, alongside an internationally well-known project within particle and astrophysics. Normally, this is already a big deal. But with my educational and social background... I was gambling with my life.
And I had the time of my life over there. Again, I made some really good friends, and the research I did was awesome. At the end of it, the professor and other colleagues of me were really impressed with what I had achieved during those five and half a months. The teacher at my uni back at home was impressed as well.

Today, I actually got my credits from my internship. 30 fucking credits for all my hard work. But even if it was one credit my feeling wouldn't change.

Despite having autism, despite being bullied by my ""friends"", despite getting bullied again afterwards, despite getting kicked out of college. Despite fucking everything I actually made it. I have friends, my study is going well. I even managed to ask a girl out, twice.

There's still a lot I need to do. My bachelors is still going to take awhile, and I definitely want to work upwards towards a PhD eventually. Moreover, I still don't have a relationship. But that's OK. I actually got out of there. I actually did it. I FUCKING DIT IT.

There probably aren't many who are going to read this wall of text, but if you did: thank you."

I hate almost everything to do with special education and I want nothing to do with it. The last thing I want is to be considered anything aside from normal. If I say outright that I have Autism to people I know IRL, then they will treat me differently. I know from talking to all of my female friends  that Autism is very unattractive.

I never got back to her, so I still assume the answer is no. I just recently (last week) asked out my crush that I have had for most of the school year. Turns out she has either a Girlfriend or Boyfriend. I don't know which. I hate how people think just because someone has Autism that they cant feel empathy. I am a very empathetic person despite my Autism. I can feel and express my emotions very well. I don't really express my emotions too much because I want to keep a low profile, and I can also unintentionally become intense and come off as rude or angry. I act just like everyone else, except I don't talk very much. I am always one of the quiet kids. Compared to other autistic people, I am most likely the most articulate and socially able person. I don't have many friends because I am pretty shy, which has nothing to do with my autism. I do have my few friends, but they all live in another city. Luckily I am moving schools next year, so hopefully I can drop this horrible reputation as the weird quiet kid and actually gather a good friend group. One of the bigger things I hate about having Autism is that when I get angry and get a harsh tone of voice, people always assume ""Oh he's having an autistic fit"". No I am not. I am expressing my anger the way anyone else would. I don't raise my voice, and I don't hurt anyone. I keep myself calm and composed unless it is absolutely impossible. I, and most of the other kids I know, would say that I am one of the more mature and calm people in my grade, although my special education teacher doesn't seem to think so. I can get very aggravated, although it only comes up in the bigger arguments or fights I have. If you ask any random person I have known for at least a month, they would guess that I do not have Autism. Apparently my special education teacher and the rest of the school administration think I have major issues. They have only seen my bad side, which is only me 25% or less of the time. Another thing that really pisses me off is that whenever I have a ""major"" incident in class 75% of what actually happened gets lost in translation and then I get called out for only what my special education teacher heard. A little while ago, I was feeling frustrated because I knew I had failed a math test, so I got up and walked over to my teacher's desk to turn in the test. I put it down in a slightly frustrated way, and then apparently my math teacher goes ape shit, saying I ""slammed my paper down"" and ""stormed out of the room"", when in reality I did none of that. I just  handed my paper in, only slightly more exaggerated than normal. Another thing I hate is that they always take situations so much more seriously than they actually are. I was having an argument with my special education teacher about a letter of recommendation for an internship at a city planning and transportation department of my local government, and she mentioned at least 5 times that I have autism in the letter. This is not okay for me, because I want to keep this ""issue"" as quiet and little known as possible in the rest of the world. If she had kept this in the letter, I may not have been selected for this, or if I am selected, they may have treated me differently based on the minuscule amount of information about this ""condition"". The argument got heated, and I started getting slightly angry. She told me that she was offended in a very angry and disrespectful tone, so I was like, ""Nope I'm done. Fuck you."" and left. She then acts as if I had done something so much more horrendous than I actually did. Overall having Autism is a real struggle because people treat me much differently than how I actually am, and because they take my anger so much more seriously than it should be. If you meet someone with high functioning autism like me, don't treat them any differently. Speak and act to them as normal human beings, just as you would with anyone else. I am a special case, because I am so much more normal and so high functioning,and my personality is so indistinguishable from a normal person's. I get sarcasm, and I can tell when someone is joking, while a lot of other autistic people cant. I am sick of feeling abnormal and incapable of doing things just based on what other people think of me. "

4eovtm,1,2016-04-13,Summer Internship Decision,GoldStandard7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4eovtm/summer_internship_decision/,"Hey guys, I'm a current sophomore in CS at a well-established university, and I'm choosing between two possible first-time, full-time software engineering internships for this upcoming summer:

1. Accenture Tech Labs - Pays decently well and I'd be doing interesting work.  I would also be working with a number of other software engineers, though not many other interns, and the company culture seems pretty laid-back.  The software engineering internship program is small, but established, so I'd likely have some mentorship and guidance.

2. Startup - A very small startup that went through YC last summer, made up of only two people - a business guy and a CS guy.  Probably wouldn't be making as much money as at the other internship, but would have a ton of autonomy and responsibility.  It's also right by my school, so I'd probably have housing there already anyway.

As far as I can tell, both involve full stack development of product features, as well as shipping code.  I'm not as interested in money as I am in career growth and experience... though money is nice too, of course.  Ideally, I would choose the internship that leads to the most development as a software engineer and opens the most opportunity for future jobs.  Alternatively, I could just take summer classes and/or find something at my school's startup incubator.  What do you guys think would be the best option for me?"

When is it too late to fix and open bite with braces? I went to a few orthodontists around my area in oregon and while the first one recommended to pluck out teeth, the second one informed me that removing teeth was unnecessary and that braces alone can solve the problem. (I was told I had a class 2 overbite) However, I am broke as heck and have absolutely no money. 

I am now 20 years old and I am scared that if I wait to long my teeth will become harder to fix in the future. Furthermore, I am entering college and I'm not sure if I can pay for braces until it is over, at least until I start my engineering internships. The orthodontist also told me that my type of case would require me to wear retainers years after corrective braces. 

I might try finding some orthodontists in Corvallis, but I am very worried about cost. Once I secure a good job, I can pay for braces, but I'm afraid it would be too late by then.

Thanks for your time."

   ‍   
I can ""build"" a computer from the ground up. With a little research to verify certain components are compatible as I don't stay up to date with new hardware until it's time to actually build a computer.

I do not know how to code, although I passed an intro C++ course with an A, I remember nothing. I have a fundamental comprehension of coding, but no active memory of the language.

I worked as an IT Help Desk assistant under a paid internship for some time. Mostly software issue diagnosis, password resets, printer issues, my mouse doesn't work, A LOT of backing up and re-imaging, you get the picture. Some bits of software updates pushed over the network using McAfee and LanDesk. It was with a BIG organization and made my resume look very fancy.

No certificates. Although I've studied for my A+, I can no longer recollect the difference between DRAM, SRAM &amp; SDRAM, or anything along those lines. If I don't use it I don't keep it.

I installed Ubuntu once or twice and played with it for a couple days.

I know that arctic silver does not taste good.

I'm very good at learning when it's necessary. This is why I'm here. I start in 2 weeks and I'd like to be directed towards the best resources possible to accumulate as much as I can before my training starts, and during my training period.

   ‍   

Now for the job info to help clarify my situation a bit.

   ‍   

They know my knowledge is limited.

Some of the monitoring software they use will require me to learn shell commands for Linux/Unix.

The position is contractual. If I acquire enough knowledge in the time frame of the contract (6 months) to impress them enough to offer me a permanent position, I'll officially have a career.

This is very important to me and I appreciate any direction you may have to offer."

4ep9rc,1,2016-04-13,17F. Posted here before about my anxiety. Just freaking out. Just needing to post. Read if you want. I'd like you to. Just to help.,twentyonecliques,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4ep9rc/17f_posted_here_before_about_my_anxiety_just/,"I may repeat myself. If I do, I apologize. I'm just having a rough time. And I'm sorry about my typing. My mind is racing. I am gonna go all over the place, so just try to keep up please. So, I am still on 20 mg Prozac. Asked for Klonopin. Begged for it. And my therapist was like, ""They're not gonna do that for health reasons. Just ask your primary care physician if they can prescribe you Klonopin if you need it that bad."" Something along those lines. 

So, I texted my mom as soon as I got out of my therapist and got in my boyfriends car. I told my mom what she had said about the primary care physician. She informed me ARCare doesn't prescribe those kinds of meds. I didn't know that. I really thought maybe I could get some relief. And, I know everyones anxiety is different. 

But I have this thing that happens to me about every month at least once and I call them anxiety episodes. I used to call them hormonal anxiety because they would happen around my cycle and go away before, during, or really after my cycle. I've had these happen every since 7tg grade. When I was about 13, I got on birth control pills. The reason wasn't because I was sexually active. It was because we thought that my anxiety was because of my period. That lasted for a few years and didn't do anything to help my anxiety episodes. Then I became sexually active and my mom put me on the depo shot. That didn't do anything. 

Now I know you're wondering what are these anxiety episodes and what do they do to me? Sorry. I just threw everything out there and almost forgot about that. 

Still havent exactly triggers these episodes. But I have trouble focusing. I am affected very easily and can cry over anything at any time. I shake and look to others for help in class but don't want to bother anyone because they won't understand. And even if they know about the episodes, they aren't in my head and can't help anyway. I can't sleep very well. I sometimes will just stare out into space or at my mom or another loved one, over thinking everything and silently pleading for help with my eyes. I freak out over time because it passes so fast but so slow during these episodes. I have 45 minutes in my classes in high school. If it's 10:30am and I have to leave the class I'm in at 11:15am, and am given a lot of work to do like today. I honsetly try the best I can and try to get it done so I don't have to worry about it. Then when I get the work back, I did shitty. Like I'll get 30/80 on a project grade like I did today. I almost cried. I tried. I didn't understand one question about the way to write the quiz questions for each section in Civics and I lost 50 points because of it. Ugh. That doesn't help my anxiety. And, I have trouble listening. Because my mind is racing. My friend will tell me how she's being bullied and I'll hear her but if she asks me a question I have to double back and think about all she said. Then I have to get her to repeat it and I feel so bad but I have trouble just focusing on one thing. Like, if I have to text someone, I stop her talking and text. It's like this armor is on me and I can't take it off. I feel so weighted down and overwhelmed. My mom got so tired of seeing me suffer that she put me in counseling at Children's Hospital. The therapy is connected to the hospital and one other hospital. They put me on Zoloft for a while. Then they put me on Klonopin for a month only to take as needed and gave me the 20 mg of Prozac to take daily  because Zoloft wasn't doing a damn thing. They put me on the Klonopin so I could help my episodes and get used to the Prozac. My doc at the therapy office put me on Klonopin also because she could see a huge difference in me than the last time she saw me. She could tell I was a completely different person. So, we stretched the Klon out for about 3-5 months. I ran out about a few weeks after I got with my boyfriend which was a little less tsn 3 months ago. My anxiety got out of control. The Prozac was starting not to work anymore. So, I why to see my new doctor for the first time. We have doc interns up at my CH therapy center that change every spring and fall. So my fave doc left. The one who tried everything go get me stable. And she did. She loved me and my mom. My therapist and her love us like we're family. But she had to leave and a new doctor came in. I don't like her. She decided to bump up my Prozac to 30 mg and the way she told me to do it was take one capsule of Prozac which was 20 mg one day and then the next day take  2 capsules which was 40mg. I did that until I went back to my therapist a few weeks back. And I told her what the doc said. She looked through the docs notes and saw that she had documented that and then she scrolled down and saw that she then said for me to take only  40mg every day. She put that on my bottle so that the pharmacy would give me enough to do that. But, for me to know to take the dose she had specifically told me to. But her notes were definitely confusing. My therapist told me that if it just made my anxiety worse to just go down to 20mg again and then stay there. So I did that. And it never fixed my anxiety. So, now I'm back to having anxiety episodes. I'm having one right now. But I'm actually handling it better than I ever have. I'm not crying or anything. Or shaking. I've started bresthing through my diaphragm like I've been told by my therapist to do. I'm trying to practice more cuz it does help me to relax. But, just like she said to me, when I start freaking out I do forget to breathe through my diaphragm. That's about the only thing I'm not having to deal with yet at least. But I don't want to deal with it at all because I'm not even me. It's like I'm a different person. That's all I can think to tell you to try and help you understand my pain. But, if you need me to elaborate on something or tell you more on a situation to help you understand, then please just ask. Have a good day."

So I only chose this major because 

1. Engineering majors lead to some promising jobs and internships

2. I like math and physical science

3. I like technology

I have no experience with computer science whatsoever, or engineering stuff in general. 

Also, idk if this is worth mentioning, but I have noticed that I am pretty bad when it comes to following instructions when building something. For instance, I tried to build a ping pong table and I had so much trouble with it. Maybe engineering just isn't for me? Or is computer engineering different? I specifically just don't like working with drills and what not (like construction work).

please help me out, I chose my major like 6 months ago without thinking, I just heard that this major is good so I picked it. What should I do?"

I am a sophomore studying CS with a minor in Finance and Advanced Technology. My internships fell through this summer due to recently switching to the major and lacking programming skills (I really only know web design, but I know that well).

This summer, I will work 15 hours a week (or more if I'd like) for a startup company that a friend (years older and graduated) recently started. It is just him and one other, both of them are salesmen for the company and could use some extra help. It is unpaid, but in return I will get my own office space to run my web design business after hours as well as the freedom to use the title of ""software engineer"" with his permission. He said that since I'm unpaid, I can really do whatever I want, but he will probably have small jobs for me to do and I'll be able to travel with him and the other owner on the company card for expos and conferences. They're both 23, graduated, and I'm 20 (he's actually an old high school friend of mine). They've made decent success so far and I think it will be impressive to work for a drone company instead of just working retail all summer.

**Company Summary:** They are a middleman for clients requesting drone footage/surveying. They find licensed drone operators who pay them a monthly fee, and in return they get connected to clients. Their main clients are large farms and real estate developers (for both land surveying and for mansions for sale that want an aerial video).

I would like to continue taking CodeCademy courses and finding projects to put on GitHub for my portfolio. I will be working on my web design business for about 30hrs a week as well, so I will make a good amount of money and hopefully raise my client count (about 35 right now over the last 3 years part time).

**What can I do that will impress employers for next summer's internships?** They already have a website obviously. He mentioned lead generation and developing a few scripts to fill out forms a lot faster. Perhaps work on a simple mobile app for the drone operators to accept jobs? Would that be software engineering? I would like to practice actual software engineering with the company and include it in my resume. It is a bold title to assume, so I want to ensure that I can back it up in interviews. I have very good social skills so as long as I get an inch I can make a mile out of it (as my southern grandpa always said).

What would you do?

**MORAL OF THE STORY**

So that’s a total of 17 schools with 9 acceptances, 5 waitlists, and 3 rejections. I realized I applied to a lot of schools I didn’t really care about (Trinity, Willamette, UW, Rice, etc). My dream schools were UC Berkeley, USC, and Cornell. I actually can’t believe I got into 2 of my dream schools!! I will be attending Berkeley in the fall. Honestly still can’t believe I got into 2 super dreamy schools with my aggressively average stats.

How would you suggest that we manage this intern, how do we select what tasks they should be involved in and how do we gauge if the intern is doing well or not?

I imagine the same applies when employing your first sales &amp; marketing employee if your co-founders are non-marketing guys.

Long story short is I'm 23 years old, I've been in this job for the past 2.5 years where I started as an intern, worked my way to a junior and now in a middle weight role. I've been feeling unhappy for the past few months mainly due to management putting too many time constraints on the projects that we get leading the team and myself to be unhappy, stressed, making mistakes because we're rushing etc.

So I'm at the tipping point where I've come to work on wednesday after a 2 day break and been told that a project that went on hold (the client delayed constantly for the past 3 weeks) has now started again and we have a weeks worth of time to do 4 weeks worth of work, no extra people helping out, just 2 of us. The project manager specifically said we were going to have to give up our evening and weekends to finish the project.

I asked for more time and they said no, I asked for more people and they said there was no one. I left the meeting room gob smacked and furious. I have commitments outside of work such as volunteering where I've now had to let people down. I reported it to HR later in the day who said she'd speak to the project manager and I saw later the two of them in a room together having a chat.

A day later, I've heard nothing. I've asked again if theres anything we can do to reduce the workload and the answer is a straight no. I'm considering quitting, but I dont have anything lined up afterwards and I've never got time to find a new job or go to interviews so I'm starting to think I should just blind quit and use my savings to support myself until something else comes along. 

I have no idea what to do so any advice would be helpful."
4eqwg2,1,2016-04-14,"I'm 21/M she is 21/F , am I meddling in things I should not be involved in anymore, since she is now my ex?",throwaway78645312,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4eqwg2/im_21m_she_is_21f_am_i_meddling_in_things_i/,"Hi /r/relationships

I want to preface this by saying we're actually broken up, but I am not a man who will sit by idly as a person I love dig herself deeper into a lie that I should not have enabled her to do in the first place. Yes, I admit I helped her with this lie, and I now realize I shouldn't have, even if it meant we would break up back then I should not have helped her lie, I am regretting my decision. Now I am asking for your opinion on whether or not I am stepping out of line by trying to solve a family issue that is not from my own family. I won't go too in depth and I apologize if the story may sound incoherent because of this.

My ex is an independent young lady, she supports her own studies by various sideline ventures, one of the reasons I fell in love with her actually, her resourcefulness and independence. I won't go into detail why her parents aren't supporting her education anymore, but that is the case, every other need however is given, food, shelter, clothing, all her basic needs are met. She is supposed to graduate a few weeks from now if she kept on track with her studies.

Rewind to December we were still together , her funds start drying up, and she kinda gave up on studying since she can't really get her grades and graduate if she has no means to pay the university. I talked to her and told her that I want to help and try to fund her schooling for now, she can just pay me once she graduates and gets a job. She just straight up tells me that she does not want to study anymore, she wants to save up and start her business. I try to convince her of course that I am against this, she should finish its only a few months away why stop now... This always devolved into an argument, of whether or not I am on her side or not. 

I caved, this is the part I regret, I helped her with the lie, we covered up her plan from her parents, as far as her parents know she is still studying and that the job I helped her find was an internship to finish her school requirements, 300 total hours of internship experience, but in reality it was an actual 9-5 job that pays her (dead end job for undergrads but it pays good compared to other jobs that would accept her), and she keeps all she can save to eventually try and start her planned business. I know wanting to start a business is great, it teaches you a lot, but she can do that after she finishes, whats important is she finishes, then she can do what she wants.

Fast forward to January, her job starts, it puts pressure on our relationship, long story, eventually we break up on first week of February. I tried reaching out to her for the past few months since then to try and make amends and apologize for closure, for the both of us, but she is having none of it. 

Present:

Just this week I tried to get copies of our photos from her, I deleted our conversations on facebook and that is where we share our photos together, we were a private couple, never posting pictures on social media, I regretted suddenly deleting our conversation thread out of anger and emotional strain from the break up without first, saving the photos, so I asked her for digital copies. She agrees but I guess she took this as an opportunity to get a favor from me too. She asks if she could borrow my graduation gown, I'm assuming she is trying to make her own graduation photos via a photography studio to show her parents. I said sure, but told her that I can't agree to just hand it to her, I want to have a proper conversation if I was to lend my gown to her. She says never mind and I should just keep it and she thanks me. I said the offer stands, if she changes her mind she can just text me and tell me a place where we can meet up to talk this coming Saturday. She does not reply anymore, now I am waiting.

I want to talk to her because I want to convince her to end this stupid lie. I want her to be the one to tell her parents the truth because I believe that will be the best scenario. So that they can finally try and solve this together as a family. I love her, I want her to be happy and successful, I can't let someone I love dig themselves deeper into a lie I helped create. I am planning on telling me ex's mom everything if she does not accept my offer to have a conversation this coming Saturday.

My question is am I stepping out of line if I go straight to her mom and tell her and confess to her what has been happening? According to my ex she and her parents have had family issues, its one of the reasons she was scared to tell them her funds were drying up and try to get help from them, it was the root cause of the lie. I'm just an outsider looking in now I don't know if I should do this or not, am I overstepping? Am I wrong in wanting to end this lie? This may cause a bigger rift between them I don't know if that risk is worth it or not.

TL;DR: My ex and I started a lie to her parents when we were still together that she is still studying, and her job is an internship, but in reality it is a 9-5 job that pays her, she intends to use the money to start a small business. I regret enabling her to do it, I regret helping her lie, I should have stopped it the moment she suggested it. Now that I am her ex am I meddling in things I should not meddle into? Am I overstepping on their boundaries as a family by confessing to her mother about the lie? Should I let them sort this thing out on their own?

Edit: There may be those who will just say, ""cut ties and run, that is their shit to deal with"", please don't comment anymore, I have received that bullshit response from people I did not expect to hear it from so don't just don't.

Edit 2: People have presented valid points, yes I am wrong to try in meddle in this, I'll lend my toga no questions asked, its her life, I want to help and that is the best way I could.

I managed to land two interviews, the first one I botched and the second one went really well. I got a call back from the second company a week later saying I was a great applicant but they decided to go with someone with more experience.

I have taken the introductory programming course and the data structures course at my college, which many different sources said would be enough to be considered for internships. My question is how to get my foot in the door with no internship experience, in order to get an internship that will get me experience? How can I land my first internship? I feel like getting the first one will be the hardest. Thanks for any input!

BUT I've been still getting a little bit done and trying to pull myself out of it as best as I can, and I just called insurance to clarify maternity coverage and got it confirmed that my pregnancy and labor will be 100% covered (not even a co-pay or meeting the deductible for a lot of things), and that includes birthing centers (we want to avoid a hospital birth unless we absolutely require it). They even cover home births, though that's not really something I'm interested in. As long as the facility and provider are in network, I don't have to pay a penny. This of course makes it even more important that we start trying relatively soon, because I lose all of this coverage on my 26th birthday.

Also, last night my husband checked the status of a job he applied for last week, and the online system says his application was routed to the next step. It's with a government organization he worked for as a paid intern in college, but left because they had no salaried positions available. They all loved him there, and this job pays more than a lot of the others he's applied to, is completely in the field of his degree, and comes along with solid healthcare benefits (the biggest benefit of a government job, of course. My insurance is federal government). So it's super early on and I don't want to get my hopes up too high, plus these people are notorious for taking MONTHS to complete the hiring process, but it's still a glimmer of hope.

The main two things we want to do before we start trying are have my husband in a new job for 3-4 months (to make sure he likes it and will be eligible for any available leave) and we want to try our hardest to do one vacation we've been wanting to do for years (mostly me), and that's to go kayaking with orcas. So the other day I was looking at plane tickets (flights to Seattle are insane), and I found some for half the price of what they usually are, provided we go after Labor Day. So of course we still need more income to make it responsible, but this brings down the cost of our trip by a whole lot and makes it seem a whole lot less scary to do before having a baby.

I do not have an associate degree yet (I believe I am missing just 1 course for it), I don't currently have any certifications, and while my work experience is extremely relevant, I fall short of the 3 years that they seem to be looking for. Is there any chance of me gaining admission as is, or should I either finish my associate degree or get a certification before I apply?

Which certifications are gained with this program? I have seen a list for IT, but didn't notice one for HI. On the same note, if I choose to get a certification to help my admissions process, which one would you suggest?

Does the program require any sort of internships or on-the-job experiences? I already work full time, so I'm not sure how I would be able to accomplish that. Should I be concerned?

What should I expect when it comes to the portfolio courses? I read the descriptions but I'm not entirely sure that I understand what they mean.

3. The problem is, there is no job opening in his company.

Even though I already have professional experience before, I wouldn't mind working as an intern, again.


I already know his name, and personal email, but I don't know him personally. So, what is the best way to compose a cold mail asking for a job. I don't want to sound desperate, but I also don't want to sound arrogant in my email.


On top of that, do you think sending a cold email directly to the future employer is a good idea?

I have an internship lined up for this summer and am planning on buying a surface to use for that as well as for community college.

I'm torn between the SP2, Surface 3, and the SP3 currently. The Pro 4 Core M version looks nice, but I can't shell out that kind of money.

One of my friends has a Surface 3 (Sold his pro 2 to get it) and another has a Pro 2. I've used them both a few times, and it's pretty obvious how much physically nicer the 3 is than the pro 2.

For school I'll mostly be using one-note (hours at a time writing with the pen) and chrome, however, I'm going to most likely be using visual studio a lot this summer. I'll also eventually end up using some CAD software (could be 1-2 years though).

I also have a Dell Latitude e6330 with an Ivy-bridge i7 (integrated gpu) that I can use in a pinch.

However, if I buy a surface, I'll most likely not carry my laptop around with me all the time, so I'd like it to be semi capable.

The surface pro 2 is the cheapest of the bunch (Bundle for around $400-450 used), followed by the surface 3(Refurb bundle $540), with the most expensive being the pro 3(Approximately $630 used bundle).

I'm used to not being to game very well on my laptop, so that isn't of much concern.

Basically, what I am asking is, Should I just get the pro 2 because it's cheap? Or are the better form factors of the newer ones worth the extra price, and is the pro 3 worth the price? (Also, are there heat issues with the pro 3?)

Again, 90% of my usage will be Google Chrome, OneNote, Visual Studio, and probably some Android Studio.

Her parents were always pretty strict about dating so we did not see each other a lot outside of school, summers were hard but we saw each other everyday for 10 out of 12 months and spottingly during the summer so we delt with it. We both fell for each other hard and were very happy.

Before my Jr. year of HS I switched schools but we stayed together, we lived in different parts of the city and public transportation wasnt great (and we were young and broke) so we saw each other less, this was our first taste of 'long distance'.
We went to different colleges, I stayed in the city and she went to a state school in the suburbs. We took turns traveling on the weekend and I stayed with her on campus a lot. We were very exicited to graudate and live in the same city and be close.

After college I ended up getting an internship a few states away, I visited every weekend and while we were still long distance nothing BUT the distance prevented us from seeing each other, we both hard cars and free time so we saw each other whenever we could.

My job ceased operations in our state, located on the east coast, and after some tough conversations I decided to move to the west coast to continue my job and come back east after a few years. A few weeks ago my girlfriend ended up getting a job at my company and our primary residence will be in the same city for the first time since 2009. We're excited but honestly I'm nervous about how to transition to this next phase. We are going to live separately because she's never lived on her own and wants her independence, but we are going to live in the same neighborhood and with all the free time we have it's going to be quite the experience having almost unlimited access to each other.

One big concern of mine is our social lives, she has been hard at work and school for the past two years and has admittedly said she misses having a social life. I have a very active social life and go out to bars, shows, parties, events, etc. all the time. I have a solid group of friends but only some of them have met her.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the transition from long distance to very close distance after such a long period of being away? There are parts of her that I feel I haven't really experienced and vice versa because we've been semi-separated for a long time.

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend have been LDR for 8/10 years of our relationship, now she is moving cross country to live in my neighborhood, how do we transition smoothly?"

I was already going to be taking one more class than recommended, and advising really suggested that I take another semester to graduate, so I am fine with that.

I want to find an internship for fall 2016 if possible. I can complete one class online during fall 2016 and then take the rest of my classes in spring 2017 and graduate in the same amount of time but with more experience. 

I have been looking for fall internship postings, but there aren't many up yet. The only companies I have found fall 2016 postings for so far are Twitter and SpaceX. 

Does anybody know when I should really start looking for a fall internship? I am guessing by Mid-May there should be plenty of postings, but I start an internship around that time so applying and interviewing will be hard. Has anybody applied for fall internships before, and if so, when did you do the bulk of your applying/interviewing?

Also, I start an internship at the very end of May. If I begin applying before I start, should I put the internship on there anyways? I want to show that I *do* have a good internship lined up for the summer, but I don't want it to come off as weird if I haven't started yet. 

Maybe I should just wait to start looking/applying until after I start? Will applying for fall internships in June be too late?

So I've been applying to a ton of places since January and haven't been super successful. I don't have a big portfolio of work and I'm not super good at a single programming language either. I applied for a front end internship and the interviewer told me that I just don't have the same portfolio to match other top candidates, but liked my previous work experiences and told me to apply for their business development internship.

&amp;nbsp;

I applied for a data analysis internship position for another company and they told me the same thing but once again liked my previous work experiences and told me they want me for their marketing team. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I'm currently a junior and graduation is looming next year. I switched majors and I have a lot of work experience, but they're all really irrelevant to comp sci. Should I reject the offers and just spending the summer working part time waiting tables and work on independent projects?

My residents and I power walk to the ICU. We arrive to find the code team in action, - a controlled chaos made up of what seems like 20 people packed tightly into the tiny room. I listen to the report our resident is receiving while watching the raw scene in front of me. 

*""70+ year old male status post coronary stenting 1 week ago. He had gone home and felt fine but returned with chest pain two nights ago. Found to be in asystole in bedside chair. He's received 2 rounds of epi so far""*. The lifeless man's body is spread eagle, intubated, with people all around him. His chest looks surprisingly soft and squishy, his limbs are bouncing in sync with the chest compressions he's receiving. It makes sense now but it was never something I thought about when training on the hard dummies - what a human body would look like when undergoing CPR. 

Despite the noise in the room my resident makes sure to single me out and remind me that I had mentioned I wanted to get CPR experience before 3rd year is over. She hands me gloves and lets the code team know to make room for a student to jump in on compressions. I realize I have been dead silent since we got there, standing off to the side watching. I put the gloves on and move in line behind the person currently pounding on the old man’s swollen chest. Suddenly I feel my body telling me it wants out of this situation. My mind is rational, telling me everything I’ve learned says the patient was dead the minute he went into asystole. Low CPR survival odds, let alone brain damage free survival, especially with his history. And this is a skill I need good practice in. What better person to learn on than someone who I literally can’t harm in any way, I tell myself. But a small voice inside is yelling at me to get out of this line. I’ve never gone skydiving but I imagine it is similar to what deciding to jump out of a plane feels like. 

***”Hold CPR, pulse check…still in PEA…. resume CPR”***

It’s me at the bedside now. The internal voice that had been screaming at me is now drowned out by the intensity of the moment. I’m smashing down on the soft chest in front of me, counting outloud to myself to try and keep a good rhythm and aiming for fast and deep compressions each time. I’ve never been one to enjoy exercises in futility yet something about this scenario demands that I give my 100%. I can hear the gasps of choked air being forced out of his lungs with every couple of compressions I give him. *”Good compressions”* I hear the nurses coaching me but I don’t acknowledge it. The idea of saying “thanks” right now seems inappropriate, and being encouraged on my technique in smashing an old man’s chest is strange and foreign to me.  I avoid looking at the patient’s face to spare the chance of some morbid recollection later on but at the same time find myself thinking about why his chest is so soft - his rib cage has already been broken apart by those before me. Still, I feel one, then two separate cracks. I remember reading that this was most likely cartilage and not a rib cracking I remind myself. 

We repeat this exercise for another 15 minutes only to end up with the result we all expected when we got there. The patient never recovered out of PEA and was declared dead. My resident called time of death, exchanged pleasantries with some of the code team, then went off to write her note. I followed and watched her explain to the intern how to pronounce someone dead. 

I felt nauseous and numb the rest of that morning while we rounded on our patients. I couldn’t tell how much of it was from sleep deprivation and fatigue and how much was from what I had just taken part in. At the same time I felt a small sense of accomplishment. I went through what I believe is an important step of medical training, which is facing death. Being able to do difficult things to your patiens because it’s what they ask you to do, or because it is what is necessary. Up until that moment I had never seen this patient and I never even caught his name throughout all of this. But this nameless person, whose face I can’t remember, is who will stay in my memory as the first person I performed CPR on. After rounds my resident asked me to join her for lunch and we talked about my experience. I explained the feelings of fear, intense focus and subsequent sick feeling I had along with a sense of accomplishment. *“Yup, sounds just like my first time”* she said.

4esy2q,1,2016-04-14,Just your traditional ex girlfriend rant,LoneWords,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4esy2q/just_your_traditional_ex_girlfriend_rant/,"I'm just so sick of this situation. I'm not even looking for advice anymore I just have to get it off my chest. So back in September 2015 I ran into an old acquaintance on the bus. She was cute and to my knowledge she liked to dance. I very much like to dance. You'll understand what I mean by ""to my knowledge"" in a minute. So I was reeling back from an ex I could rant pages about if I didn't despise that person so much. The current girl I'm talking about, even to this day I can't say much bad about, that being said it's absolutely her fault we broke up. In all we're together about six months.

We were *courting* about a month before I even touched her. She was a really innocent type of girl and later I even find out, a virgin. She had rejected my moves to kiss her at least twice but at one point I asked her to hang out, she said yes, I finally kissed her. So now, we go another like two weeks before we go to a dance event a couple states away and I officially ask her out. The next weekend we have sex for the first time.

Now keep track of the time count, it's very important. After explaining directly that I was interested in her, we probably go a solid month an a half before ever having sex.

So the good times. The relationship is awesome. She's a little busy but I admire it because she volunteers under two charities, works for groups on campus gratis and is doing a major research study. Like I said, the girl is awesome. We get dinner and go to beer festivals and dances and road trip a lot. Nothing is setting off alarms for me at all. No fights for five months. Just a pretty girl, having fun, going out and well... just okay sex. But that was fine. 

The last month of our relationship comes along and we have this completely random hell week. Like on day her dog dies, the next day we go out to a concert and I almost get into a fight which she wants me to apologize for (not gonna happen the guy ran into me). We also learn I'm leaving the country for an internship and the same day she tells me she's four days late on her period.

Im panicking thinking she's pregnant but she gives me no mercy. I promise to get breakfast in the morning and I say let's go to health services to which she responds ""oh it's fine I had my period."" Note that I had stayed up all night and she didn't tell me until that moment. We have breakfast and later  that afternoon she decides she's going on the pill. From this moment, we never have sex again.

 A day later she has to talk to me so we drive to a restaurant where Im pretty sure she's going to break up with me. 

She doesn't but she talks about how I keep hurting her feelings and Im insensitive. Specifically she brings up that I called her lame when she wouldn't go sledding with me. That's true, I did call her lame, but as a joke obviously. And then she cried about it when she told me it upset her and she said I've been being to harsh on her since day one! Really?! So why didn't you speak up day one? You don't communicate until like month 5?

So from that whole conversation and that whole week everything goes down hill. I'm trying to reason my way out of it like I explained everything she was addressing and on top of that I now feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. So this is my greatest mistake. I ask her if these arguments have something to do with the pill. She loses her mind. *FUCK YOU! IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PILL! WHEN IM MAD IM MAD! ITS NOT THE PILL!*. Deep down I still think it was a reasonable question.

But she got off the pill and the bullshit didn't stop. She stopped coming out with me. This is why I said she liked to dance ""to my knowledge"". She would stay home and watch TV when I wanted to go out. Dancing no longer interests her apparently. Eventually Id relent and stay home and not have sex, but Id try to have sex with her and of course stop when she said no. But the thing was, she never ever ever initiated sex. It always had to be me, so how was I supposed to know if I was going to be able to have sex with her?

Skip to me asking her if we're going to last long distance. This isn't even an argument. It's a very reasonable conversation. I think this is the break up moment. I've been thinking I need to breakup up with her for about a week at this point. Things definitely aren't working out. I explain what I've explained here and she sort of apologizes but agrees we aren't right for each other. She does say things like I try to have sex too often... you know when she would never have sex with me. And she says she thinks we got physical too early, which was her doing. After we got back from that dance weekend she texted me one morning asking me to come over because her roommate's out. I walk in and there are lit candles everywhere. It's a clear message. Greenlight. But anyway, she brought it on so it makes me mad that she implies it was my fault we had sex ""too early"".

But then she sort of says something rude like:

 ""Do you think we're compatible because there have been a good few days when I thought otherwise.""

So what I thought she meant was, the 6 month relationship only had a few good days. What she actually meant, according to her months later was she thought we weren't compatible on some days. But thinking what I thought she meant, I got mad and I broke up with her. She collapses on the floor crying and I go home. I'm way too mad to sympathize. This is 2 days before my birthday.

The next day I ask her if she wants to talk and she says yes. I apologize, she's not really upset anymore it seems. She gives me a present with a card that says she loves me and she's happy to be my valentine. I get all remorseful and feel I was too harsh on her. I try to open a conversation but we go a couple weeks without talking. I ask her if she thought we broke up too prematurely or if we just weren't thinking. She doesn't feel the same way, she's fine with it now. Says she doesn't have romantic feeling for me anymore. Like a switch just went off in her head the moment I broke up with her. And that kind of scratches at my brain. It bugs me that she's fine, but I don't freak out about it. **She** asks if we can be friends so I say fine. We go another solid month not really talking but doing each other favors whenever. Like I needed a flashdrive for class and she ran it by.

But now I have about a month before I leave the country. I ask if we can get dinner, not as a date just to leave things off clean because Im not mad anymore or anything. She says no, I have to ask why. She says we aren't friends. I ask her why she thinks that and she says ""I feel like if we were friends you would try to turn it into something it wasn't"". **REALLY?!?** We've only been getting coffee once a week for the past month and walking to class together but we aren't friends because you think Im going to make a move on you? With what time I have left in this country do you think Im going to try to win you back at this point? Are you out of your mind? So **BOOM!** argument. She says decision is final. Im kind of pissed because this is condescending to me. I extend the olive branch to her and she spits in my face. I even get to the point where I tell her Im not trying to date her anymore Im seeing someone else, and I am. She doesn't care. Decision's final, we aren't friends. We need more time. I say ""Don't say *we* need more time when what you really mean is *you* need more time."" But she still seems to think Im trying to date her and there's no way to reason against that perception. Finally I see this argument really isn't going my way so I just start ranting basically this rant out to her and she says something about the break up to so I rant that whole thing out to her how it's her fault and I tried to fix things and she wasn't making any effort. She's unfazed. She says we have nothing in common, that's why we aren't friends.... We have nothing in common. How exactly did we date for six months then?! 

Jesus this whole thing just pisses me off. Im not suggesting she isn't over it, that's obviously not the case. But by the time comes that she wants to be friends Im just going to remember this whole thing. It's childish and condescending and an insult to me that she would act all friendly but when I suggest we're friends she pretty much says she's been humoring me the whole time.

Just. what the fuck, guys? I did so much for that girl and She's the one who wanted to be friends! I seriously thought for a while I was the one humoring her.

She hasn't blocked me yet. I don't have any more argument to give her. She participates, but I haven't gotten back about it. It's just a waste of time.

We could've been friends. But, just like the relationship this is pretty much on her. Okay, Rant over.

I have had both a audit internship as well as a tax internship and I prefer tax hands down. However I do know that there is a chance I won't find a tax job after graduation. Therefore, I am willing to work as a cost accountant job full time ( or whatever accounting job that averages about 40 hours a week) and complete masters of taxation degree online. What would be the online schools to pursue masters of taxation? I heard Syracuse program treats you like any other student, and you can network with their alumni.What are the schools that come to mind for you all?"
4et885,1,2016-04-14,I made a mistake,throwawayperson435,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4et885/i_made_a_mistake/,"I was doing okay about a year and a half ago. My treatment-resistant depression and anxiety finally ran into something that worked, for a while. I had TMS treatment. It was very expensive. My family paid around $8k for it. The insurance didn't want to cover it, even though I'd tried so many other meds with no effect. I felt really good afterwards though.

But it didn't last.

Now I'm back to freaking out all the time, self-harming, suicidal thoughts. I am miserable. And my life is good, I guess. I'm graduating this semester, my family is supporting me. I don't have a job lined up and I never got any internships or work experience in my field though, so I feel useless. I feel like I failed already. I never got my driver's license either. I've tried a lot but I'm too scared of driving, and my city has terrible public transportation so I really can't get anywhere without a car. Not reliably anyway.

About two years ago, I fell in love with one of my online friends. We dated long distance for a while, then got married. It was earlier than we really wanted to, but he was here on a student visa and it was running out. Not many opportunities in his field, and not much time to search for a job before his time was up, so we got married so he could stay. I would have been devastated if he had to leave. His country is very far away. He's provided me with so much support. I don't think I would even be graduating without him.

But the stress and fear of the immigration process has really taken a toll on me. There are so many ways I could fuck it up and lose him. Like even if things go well now, if we don't have jobs soon... it might be over.

I should not have married him. I was stupid. I thought my good state would last, but it hasn't. I don't think my family can afford another $8k treatment to fix me for a while. And now I hurt him. I hurt him when I freak out and he can't do anything to help. I hurt him when I hurt myself. I went into the bathroom to hit myself half an hour ago and he was gone when I came out. I don't know where he is. He was upset because he felt he couldn't do anything while I was freaking out.

Someday I know I'm going to kill myself. I've always known. Every thing I do to treat my illness just buys a little more time. But someday I'm going to do it, and he's going to be hurt so badly as a result, and I could have avoided it all if I had just not been selfish enough to marry him. Someday I'm not going to be able to stop myself. I'm not strong enough to live in this world.

I really fucked up. Don't get other people involved in your misery... no one else should have to suffer like this. I'm just a terrible pain factory. I cause everyone close to me to suffer emotionally and financially and all the pills and therapy sessions they pay for don't stick. I'm never going to be functional. I will always be a burden.

Maybe if I can stop being such a spoiled shit I can get better at bottling it up, so he will hurt less. I'm a terrible wife."

##/r/RandomActsofCards 

**5,104** Card Lovers for **2 years**

Random acts of kindness are totally in vogue right now. Your Amazon wishlist, pizza, oral sex, it's all covered by a random acts subreddit. For those on a tighter budget, not willing to pleasure a stranger or who just enjoy the simple joy of a hand written note in their post, I present today's subreddit of the day!

/r/RandomActsofCards is another of those genuinely nice subreddits. The people seem lovely, the mods are engaged and friendly, even the CSS style has a comforting feel. You can offer cards, request a delivery or arrange an exchange. Using the simple flair system, it's also possible to filter posts to help find the ones of interest to you. 

A lot of people hand make cards, but you could just as easily send local postcards or seasonal greetings cards. 

The subreddit also encourages friendship building and conversation. With a weekly discussion thread and a reasonable amount of comments on posts, you can see how nice these people are. So, if you fancy making a new friend or a whole group of them, maybe consider sending a card.

A word of caution. Due to the nature of the subreddit, you do have to be pretty open with your address. Please keep that confined to PMs and not posted on the sub itself!


The interview portion of this feature was carried out some time ago by an intern lost to the sands of time. I'm a little jealous because they seem so lovely! Enjoy this upbeat interview with the mods /u/Lehmongeloh, /u/Amaurotic, /u/Cheapishowifeel and /u/mellywobbles.

&gt;##Tell us a little about yourself!

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** I'm lehmongeloh. I'm on reddit pretty much every day helping to run the sub and sister subs we have with my wonderful team. Outside of reddit I'm getting my masters in social work and do a lot of nonprofit programming with LGBTQ communities. Some of my favorite hobbies are comic book reading, exploring abandoned places, co-op puzzle platformer gaming, and lifting weights.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic** Howdy, I’m Amaurotic. I live on the Canadian West Coast, and I’m currently taking my B.Sc. in Cognitive Systems. I also have a passion for tattoos, and illustrate on the side. I think one of the most magical ways to pass the time is by having a meaningful conversation with someone.

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** I'm CheapIsHowIFeel and I live in central Ontario, Canada and work in the Veterinary Administration field. I completely switched careers a couple years back having gone back to school in my 40s, and I haven't looked back! My dream is to be a Veterinary Practice Manager or a Shelter Manager and it's getting closer every day.

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** My name is Melody and I'm a full time student studying electrical engineering. I enjoy baking, taking my dog for walks, kayaking, reading(huge fantasy nerd), playing video games, and sleeping because even though I'm only 24 I'm actually an old person. I love animals- I have 2 cats. Florida has always been my home.

&gt;##How did you get involved in /r/randomactsofcards?

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** I'm the creator of /r/randomactsofcards and initially did a lot of the CSS work. My intent was to create a safe and welcoming place for anyone to come to that can spread a little joy to people who want it. I used to make a lot of custom pop-up cards for people, and it was a pleasure to get to know other redditors about their likes and interests and hear about their surprise when they received it in the mail. Anyone is capable of doing a random act of kindness, and it's so humbling to see the subreddit grow from others who feel the same way.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic**  I joined /r/randomactsofcards early last year both out of curiosity and excitement. I’ve been making hand-drawn cards for family &amp; friends since I was a kid, and I’ve always loved the feeling of personalizing a card for that specific person. Once you’ve found yourself sending and receiving cards from across the world, you’re hooked. I fell in love with /r/randomactsofcards, and I figured since I’m on Reddit so often, I may as well lend a hand behind the scenes.

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** I joined /r/RandomActsofCards in the Spring of 2015. I absolutely adored the idea of spreading love through the mail and had just recently started re-connecting with family and friends that way - so this was a natural progression. I only recently became a moderator at the sub to give back to the group that has given me so much.

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** I found this awesome subreddit one night while looking around r/penpals. I joined this community because of a request to send a sick girl in the hospital cards. I spent like an hour on making that card, and knowing that this will make someone happy had me hooked. I have since then enjoyed making friends here and it feels awesome knowing that a simple gesture like sending a card can make someone's day a little better. I have received so much support on here as well, many kind people are in this community and I'm proud to be a part of it.

&gt;##What was the best card you have ever received?

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** The best card I've ever received is from /u/Ashlene88 who gifted me this Batman birthday card. Of course it's sideways. Batman is my favorite comic book character, and I really love homemade cards.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic** This is a tough one! Every card is special in their own way. One card that comes to mind is from /u/Drnkslv . I sent him a drawing of his local park in the Czech Republic, and he sent me back a card with a photo of him holding my drawing, at the park (so the obvious thing to do was to take a picture) of his card at my local park!)

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** My very favourite card is a card I received as a child from my grandmother. It was a hand-made flat card. I can still picture it in my head (and I actually had it displayed at her memorial). Unfortunately I couldn't find it in time for this!

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** The best card I ever received was definitely one of the handmade ones from u/Amaurotic and u/cannedpossum . Both have sent me amazingly well drawn/painted cards that took a lot of creativity to make. I cannot choose a favorite card, I love them all so much! :)

&gt;##Tell us about your community!

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** Our community is made up of thousands of people from all over the world. People here love to send cards, expand their collections, or look forward to opening their mailbox for something fun addressed to them. A good portion of our community has a colored envelope next to their username. This means that they have sent at least one card to someone (and usually people start sending more when they discover how much fun it is for them). We have a couple star users that have sent over 250 cards and counting that we track in our sister subreddit /r/raocflair. Every request post has had at least one response from someone willing to send a little happiness. This community works hard to make sure everyone feels welcomed.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic** /r/randomactsofcards is a constant reminder for me that such a sincere degree of generosity and compassion exists in the world. We’re a very tight-knit community, yet everyone is exceptionally welcoming and supportive of each other. It’s truly a little oasis of its own.

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** Our community is about connection. In a world filled with instant communication, it is oddly difficult to feel truly connected to another human being. A card requires more than just typing a few words and clicking a button. The thought that goes in to choosing the card for the particular person (or making it), the words to convey a specific message, addressing the card, going to the post office to purchase the stamps and send the mail -- and then the wait until it arrives. It's an entire journey towards letting someone know they matter. And, quite strangely, the journey gives as much to the sender as the receiver.

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** As I said above, this subreddit is home to sooo many awesome people. You'll find a warm welcome, kind words, friendly people, and immediate support. Everyone here is kind and I have made several friends through this subreddit. I'm so happy to see that it's growing in size. The act of sending snail mail is a dying practice and I'm happy we can keep the tradition alive. Its very rewarding to see thank you posts done on behalf of those who requested for others or someone who's asked for emotional support; it reminds us that a simply gesture can make a huge difference to someone.

&gt;##Anything else you would like to tell us about /r/randomactsofcards?

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** 
Anyone is welcome to sign up and subscribe. We run contests and give out prizes, we have various weekly discussion threads, the subreddit changes with themes, and we're always thinking of new ways to improve. The success and atmosphere of this subreddit is due to all our subscribers and community members, and I truly appreciate what a pleasure it is to be a mod of this sub. I never thought it would attract as many people as it had, and I can only hope it'll continue to grow.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic** You don’t always need a special occasion to send out a card. From the celebratory to the loss, from the made-up-holiday to the bored, our community is about all about sharing our life experiences with each other.

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** We're waiting for you!

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** This is the best subreddit... that is all. :D

Just realised my title makes me look like a prostitute.

4eth7n,12,2016-04-14,"Shower thought: The real weakness of the corporation is not fraud, but the hazy distinction between employee and volunteer.",WillyPete,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4eth7n/shower_thought_the_real_weakness_of_the/,"The church uses ""volunteers"" (people who perform services without thought of recompense) in order to function properly.  

Problem: The church exists as a religious society, maintained and supported by a for-profit corporation.  

Here are some of the points which place the church at risk:  

* The church dismissed thousands of maintenance staff and instead asked members to contribute time to fulfil roles previously held by employees, or that could be expected to be held by an employee.  
* The church expects set hours of service each week.  
* The church promises both physical and spiritual rewards for such service. (Health in the navel, marrow in the bone; Patriarchal blessings promising material blessings in this life; eternal life and exaltation, including more wives and dominions, etc )
* The church lists members on well maintained records, following up on inactivity, encouraging regular participation and performance of services beneficial to it.  
* The church often takes disciplinary action and may even dismiss certain members.  
* The church issues explicit invitations for services for long periods of time: Callings.  
* The church expects its own employees to perform voluntary duties that are for the benefit of the corporation: Temple management, management of members, retention of active members, encouraging tithe payment, etc.  
* The church asks many members to volunteer large amounts of consecutive hours operating sections of the for-profit corporation, such as ranches, welfare farms, administration, genealogical records, maintenance of temples, laundry work, etc.  
* The volunteers may sometimes be given large budgets to pay expenses, in advance, before such expenses are catalogued or incurred.  
The budgets may sometimes be used at the volunteer's discrimination, and for the benefit of other volunteers.  
* Volunteers who may rely on the church for survival over extended periods may be required to work for the corporation without contracts of employment.  
* Gender discrimination is real amongst volunteers, with women barred from carrying out many roles.

I think the grounds, particularly with the nuances of international labour laws, are there for many thousands of people to claim National Minimum Wage from the church, or to sue for violations of gender inequality or other employees rights, relative to their country of residence.  
In the case of church employees also performing service for the church under a volunteer status is shaky, and could lead to a challenge by the FLSA against the Corporation of the President.  
There may be a case for ex missionaries to claim that the work was not charitable in nature, but designed to enroll new tithe payers, without commission or salary having been paid.  

The church straddles a large swathe of law that may or may not be favourable to it, and many volunteer roles might not be in place today were any similar starting corporation to look at those laws and decide they placed the corporation at risk for giving volunteers the status of employees.  

The church's status as a for-profit corporation places extra risk on this issue.

All it would take is one woman in court proving that her status at some point was that of employee, and point to the gender discrimination of the priesthood for the whole volunteer nature of the church to collapse.  
What would happen if an illegally resident person was seen as having employee status?

Some reading for those interested:  

What is a volunteer, according to US labor law?  
http://internationalcenter.umich.edu/immig/fvisa/fj_emplvolunteer.html#employ  

&gt;* No expectation of compensation,  
* **The volunteer cannot displace a genuine employee**, and the services provided by the volunteer should not be the same services for which he or she was previously paid and/or expects to be hired and paid for in the future;
* Services are performed for a non-profit organization for public service, religious or humanitarian objective.  
**Work for a for-profit entity is considered employment and must be for pay**. The only exception is made for training programs where the trainee functions, to some degree, like an employee, but is under close supervision and provides no significant measurable work for the employer.  
The trainee must not take the place of a paid employee. For example, students who are considered student interns may engage in unpaid internships at for-profit organizations.

http://www.nonprofitrisk.org/library/articles/employee_or_volunteer.shtml  
&gt;To determine whether an individual is a true volunteer engaged in “ordinary volunteerism,” the Department of Labor considers a number of factors.  
No single factor is determinative. The factors include:

&gt;* Is the entity that will benefit/receive services from the volunteer a nonprofit organization?
* Is the activity less than a full-time occupation?
* Are the services offered freely and without pressure or coercion?
* Are the services of the kind typically associated with volunteer work?
* Have regular employees been displaced to accommodate the volunteer?
* Does the worker receive (or expect) any benefit from the entity to which it is providing services?  
**A volunteer position at your nonprofit is likely to be regarded as “ordinary volunteerism” and safely exempt from the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA if you can answer “yes” to the first four questions and “no” to the final two questions.**

http://www.forbes.com/sites/richardtuschman/2012/08/24/using-volunteers-and-interns-is-it-legal/#18490b222dcd  
&gt;Under the FLSA, a volunteer will not be considered an employee if the individual volunteers for public service, **religious** or humanitarian objectives, **and without contemplation or receipt of compensation.**  

... 
&gt;For example, the DOL has opined that there is no employment relationship between a for-profit hospice and individuals who volunteer their services to perform activities of a charitable nature, such as running errands, sitting with patients so that a family may have a break, and going to funerals.   
**However, individuals may not donate their services to hospices to do activities such as general office or administrative work that are not charitable in nature**.   Moreover, with respect to those individuals already employed by a hospice, the DOL has stated that they may not volunteer their services to the hospice.

https://www.oneoc.org/media/1098/volunteers-and-the-department-of-labor.pdf  
&gt;In the absence of any statutory or regulatory exemption, the U.S. Department of Labor has utilized statutory precedent to formulate an exemption for the employees of charitable entities who wish to perform volunteer work for their nonprofit employers.  
The Department has drafted a set of six criteria that will qualify nonprofit organization employees for an FLSA exemption.  
**Volunteer status will be granted under the following circumstances:**

1. The services are entirely voluntary, with no coercion by the employer, no promise of advancement, and no penalty for not volunteering;  
2. The activities are predominantly for the employee’s own benefit;  
3. **The employee does not replace another employee or impair the employment opportunities of others by performing work which would otherwise be performed by regular employees;**  
4. The employee serves without contemplation of pay;  
5. The activity does not take place during the employee’s regular working hours or scheduled overtime hours;  
6. The volunteer time is insubstantial in relation to the employee’s regular hours.

&gt;*Preventing Employment Status*  
Ways in which employers can reduce the risk of establishing legally binding contractual relationships with volunteers include:

&gt;* avoiding a contract– often employers will have a volunteer agreement in place, setting out the hopes and goals of the relationship, but this should not be a legally binding contract. Employers should avoid certain contractual language such as 'rights' and 'obligations' and might also wish to state their intention that the agreement is not legally binding. However, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has suggested that, where an employer is paying an intern at the NMW rate, a standard short term contract should be in place;
* avoiding financial remuneration **or benefits in kind, and anything which may be construed as 'consideration' for the purposes of establishing a contractual relationship**;  
* allowing volunteers to refuse tasks or choose hours of work and not requiring a certain length of volunteering arrangement will help in establishing that there is not a contractual relationship;  
* reimbursing only for expenses incurred and not estimated expenses;  
* differentiating between volunteers and paid staff - this does not mean treating volunteers less fairly, but having separate policies and procedures in place to deal with volunteers;  
* **avoiding disciplining volunteers. Employers should not discipline volunteers or threaten disciplinary action if certain standards are not met.** In reality, issues such as poor attendance, misconduct etc can be dealt with by no longer using the volunteer.

&gt;It is important to know if, based on the reality of the relationship, the individual is a 'worker' and therefore entitled to the National Minimum Wage.  
**The consequences of non-payment of the NMW can be serious -the employer could be required to pay six years backdated pay and could face criminal charges if found to have wilfully neglected to pay the NMW.**

http://www.volunteernow.co.uk/fs/doc/publications/volunteering-and-the-law-information-sheet-nl.pdf  
&gt;An individual has a contract of employment.  
**A contract does not have to be a written document. It refers to the relationship between the individual and the organisation.**  
In order for a contract to exist there are two legal conditions which must be met.  
These are consideration and intention. Consideration, intention and other related concepts are explained below:  

&gt;* Consideration  
**The individual and the organisation exchange something of material value**. The value of what is exchanged can be minimal.

&gt;* Intention  
The individual and the organisation intend to enter into a legally binding contract i.e. they can each go to court to enforce their rights.  
Intention is usually implied by looking objectively at all the circumstances.  

&gt;* Obligation  
The employer has an obligation to provide work and the employee has an obligation to do the work.

&gt;* Employment Rights  
An employee has protection from unlawful discrimination across equality grounds, i.e. age, race, **sex**, religion, politics or disability.  
Employees also have protection against unfair dismissal and unfair redundancy.  
Employees have rights to sick pay, maternity leave, trade union activity, holidays **and the national minimum wage.**

Church employees ""volunteering"". The church is very exposed when it comes to church employees also doing work for the church.  

http://www.wardandsmith.com/articles/wage-hour-law-volunteers-interns  
&gt;For private for-profit employers, the FLSA's requirements are clear that **there is no such thing as an employee providing ""volunteer"" time**.   
The U.S. Department of Labor (""USDOL""), the agency that enforces the FLSA, has plainly stated that ""employees may not volunteer services to for-profit private sector employers.""  Additionally, even the courts have agreed that the label ""volunteer"" doesn't matter; simply calling someone a ""volunteer"" will not shield an employer from its FLSA obligation to pay the required wages **if that individual performs work that benefits the for-profit organization.**

http://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/docs/volunteers.asp  
&gt;Under the FLSA, employees may not volunteer services to **for-profit private sector employers**.

4ethh5,0,2016-04-14,[Sexual frustration] I haven't gotten off in a while,CheezusRollie,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/4ethh5/sexual_frustration_i_havent_gotten_off_in_a_while/,"My girlfriend of three months is not satisfying me lately, and it's starting to get me sexually frustrated, I believe. 

We're both university students and we're approaching the end of our semester, and we're trying to see each other as often as possible, but we're both busy with classes, work, internships, etc so the only time we've been able to see each other these past couple weeks is around 11 PM. 

We usually talk about what's going on and all of that good relationship stuff, and a couple of hours later, we go to sleep/have sex. Keep in mind that, every time, we have got to get up early because of our school/internships/work the next day. 

We've had a great sex life since the beginning of the relationship. We both are very attracted to each other, and know how to get each other off. My girlfriend is unable to orgasm from PIV, and 90% of the time after copious amounts of foreplay, I will end up fingering her or performing cunnilingus until she orgasms, at which point we will cuddle for a while and she will end up giving me oral and/or we will have PIV sex. When we do have PIV sex, she is always insanely wet and enjoys it immensely, even if she cannot orgasm, so I know that she doesn't dislike it.

However, these past couple of weeks, something different has been happening. I've been doing most of the work, she is very passive, but still very down for sex. Then, after I end up making her climax and we cuddle, she ends up falling asleep/not having energy for sex/sexual favors. We end up getting five or six hours of sleep afterwards, wake up somewhat tired, snooze a couple of times, and have no morning sex either. In short, she's getting off, and I'm getting nothing.

Thing is, she's aware of this and considers it to be a problem. This morning, when we woke up, she apologized about not satisfying my needs. I completely understand the situation, and to me, her orgasm is more important than mine, but I can't help but feel somewhat sexually frustrated. The semester is ending in less than two weeks, and I'm sure that the situation will be resolved once summer rolls around, but is this normal behavior on her part? Yesterday, for exemple, I tried to initiate PIV after foreplay but she wouldn't let me go get a condom. I feel like she just wants to get off and go to bed, and doesn't prioritize my orgasms the way I prioritize her's/the way she prioritized mine prior to a couple of weeks ago.

We have good communication about our sex life, and talk about it often, and I already told her this morning that I was disappointed that this was happening somewhat often, but that I understood the situation. She said that it was not okay, and she promised that this wouldn't be the case next time. I hope that she's serious, but if this keeps happening, what should I do?"

#/r/AskAnAmerican

**12,101** people curious about Americans for **3 years**

As a Canadian, I've grown up feeling quite close to my more rowdy neighbours to the south, and yet I've come to find out over the years that there's so I didn't know or understand about the United States. Take this upcoming election for example. This past year when we elected Justin Trudeau as our handsome Prime Minister, the election itself took a total of 11 weeks (about the same length of time as a season of *The Apprentice*). Now that the primaries have started in the states I can't help but wonder what's taking so long, and have had to ask a few of my American friends about how this whole complicated process works exactly. Luckily for me, /r/AskAnAmerican also exists, and they currently have a [stickied thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/48t0ni/us_presidential_election_primary_megathread/) dedicated to simply explaining the primaries leading up to the election. 

Maybe you have a less serious question to ask, like [what is meatloaf?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/44jt7m/what_is_meatloaf/) or [why do Americans seem to hate New Jersey?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/41pi0q/why_do_americans_blindly_hate_new_jersey/) It's both interesting to read the answers as well as to see what those who are unfamiliar with the States will ask. Going into this sub for the first time, I was honestly expecting more of the patriotism and stereotypical comments you'd see over on /r/Murica, but I was pleasantly surprised by the seriousness of both answers and responses. People are genuinely interested in getting to know what it's like to live in the States, while others are genuinely helpful and take time in crafting their responses. You can see this come across in the most upvoted question [How much choice of brand variation do you have?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/40mhx5/how_much_choice_of_brand_variation_do_you_guys/) And 1000+ comments later you have a really interesting discussion develop. Other questions like [What are some culture shocks you've had within the US?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/421dl1/what_are_some_culture_shocks_youve_had_within_the/) make you think more about your own experiences and show just how different the US can be from State to State. Other posts like [""show me photos of mundane America""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/3ptpt8/picture_time_please_show_me_mundane_america/) really get at the heart of day-to-day life in the States, a glimpse that you don't really see through the media and through tv shows or Hollywood films. Places like [this hot dog shop](http://imgur.com/5FNSq62) or this [Iowa State Fair](http://i.imgur.com/qyWVmtr.jpg) or [Florida before a storm](http://i.imgur.com/0A5qH1o.jpg) were among some of the interesting responses.

So if you're not from the United States and would like to learn more about it, or if you are American and feel like sharing with others what your life is actually like, then I'd suggest heading over to /r/AskAnAmerican for some thoughtful discussion! There's also /r/AskACanadian, /r/AskEurope and /r/AskAnAustralian as well if those are also your cup of Tim Horton's tea. 

&gt;##1. Could you tell us a bit about yourselves?


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5:** I'm an engineer who moved to Detroit - after finishing my masters - to join the auto industry. I'm originally from Connecticut, and I lived overseas in Italy for a few months as well. This is probably the most active subreddit I moderate, and I'm only active on ones that are within my interests - cars, Civ, RCT, cooking, that kind of stuff.

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky:** I'm also an engineer, working in Southern California, in the Aerospace Industry. I grew up in North County San Diego, in a tiny little town with a weird obsession with avocados. I started Redditing because I was bored in class, and now I can't stop when I should be working. I think that fans of the Cardinals suck.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack:** Howdy I'm a senior at a small private college studying math and economics. I love starting and growing ideas, founder of 4 clubs on campus, and looking to make that hobby into a career as an entrepreneur one day. I really dig E-Sports and truly think it will rival traditional sports in the future, following E-Sports is mostly what I do on reddit. My personal favorite are league of legends and super smash bros melee. (shout out to r/smashbros)

&gt;##2. Tell us about your subreddit!


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5:** /r/AskAnAmerican was started when we had a weird ""Americans of Reddit..."" trend on /r/AskReddit. It was slow growth at first but we've been trending twice now, and while the first time was a struggle to deal with, we seem to have a better handle on it now. The subreddit itself really is intended to be a place to look at some of the things that don't normally get asked on /r/AskReddit, while getting real answers (example, questions about Detroit get actual answers from Detroit here, where on the defaults you'll get...less of that).

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky:** /r/AskAnAmerican is a subreddit that primarily has two userbases. Curious foreigners who see a lot of American culture and are confused or curious about our strange little land where fat people can take the prom queen on a date to the gun range. (This is a joke, by the way.) Then we also have actual Americans who are willing to clear up misconceptions about our culture, our politics, our lifestyle. Being a smaller subreddit compared to something like /r/AskReddit has really affected the quality of the posts here, and you get a lot more genuine responses to questions. We don't need a serious tag on our posts. Not that our userbase is perfect, but the regulars really do try to make an honest effort to provide an honest look at our country.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack:** Others have said the main ideas of what I will say but AskAnAmerican is a unique play even though from the description it might not seem so. The sub is a place to ask questions to Americans and get answers with wide ranging backgrounds. Which encapsulates a lot of America, many different people, many different cultures in one big place. I also don't like the stigmas, stereotypes, and misunderstandings associated with the US (no we don't eat hot dogs and burgers for each meal, well at least most of us). I thought this place would be a decent way to combat that.

&gt;##3. What do you like most about your subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5:** Our userbase is great. What's nice is, really, it doesn't lean heavily conservative or liberal (in American terms, anyway); there's a good balance and people are generally respectful of each other. The users definitely don't put up with people being assholes either, which is nice. We're also aware of and try to account for bias when we're answering things, which is always a plus.

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky:** I like the questions. You'd think that a subreddit like this would get overloaded by the same questions over and over again, but there's a lot of misconceptions about America or interesting things that I as an American would never ever think about. We just had an /r/bestof post the other day where a guy was interested in the varieties of pizza that we had in our supermarket. One of our users recorded a video of a pizza aisle at our stores and blew everyone away with how much pizza we had. That's not something I would ever think about. Questions like those are my favorite, because they help me look at my own country from a unique perspective and appreciate the small details that are absolutely absurd from a foreign perspective, and those kinds of questions usually are fun as hell to read.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack:** I love how there are some true golden answers given in response to questions. A simple question can lead to a HUGE detailed post giving multiple perspectives and intricacies. Check [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/3spncw/so_what_exactly_is_prom/) out for example.

&gt;##4. What does it mean to you to be an American?


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5:** Interesting question. This one is tough, because a lot of what I think of can be applied to many other countries. I think, in essence, its knowing that your ancestors (or your parents, or even yourself) came here seeking a better life, and worked hard to achieve it. To me, being American means being hopeful, industrious, hard-working, and stubborn to the point of near stupidity. I could prattle on about freedom and all that, but really what makes us Americans is our shared background as a nation of immigrants (minus the native Americans...) who came to find something better, and never stopped trying to make a better life.

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky:** I think of America as a bizarre, experimental attempt at building a first world country from scratch. We're so weird. Being a part of this subreddit has really opened my eyes to a lot of the weird and wonderful things about this great country. Our history is really short. This country changes fast, and so do the people living within it. Growing up in this country, I was born to a poor family, living day to day with less than a hundred dollars in my parents' joint checking account. As I grew up, my dad got his home business off the ground, my mom got several promotions. We got rich for a while. We owned 7 cars, 10 motorcycles, moved to the rich side of town, and my life changed accordingly growing up. Then the housing market crashed, my dad's business tumbled, my mom's company closed its doors. We kept the house in the nice neighborhood, but we lost half of the cars and went back to worrying about how much clothes were going to cost. Now I've moved out and I'm completely separated from my parents. I'm building my own career. I'm not rich at the moment, but I've got a degree, a stable job at a stable company, and I'm digging myself out of the typical college poverty. 

&gt;&gt;I've been rich, I've been poor, I've lived in nice neighborhoods, and bad neighborhoods. The biggest thing that America has given me is the chance to have that kind of financial mobility, where my future has never really been decided by my past, or by my family's origins. Who I am, what family I'm from, how much money my parent's had, what kind of opportunities I had growing up, and where I used to live, have had very little effect on where I am and who I am today. I'm here where I am today because of what I've worked towards and my own efforts. And no matter where I've been financially, I've been treated the same by every single one of my peers and I've always felt that the world was always being fair to me. Life changes quickly. Where I am today is only because of the choices I've made within the past five years. Where I'll be in a decade has almost nothing to do with where I am today. That, I think, is what the American dream is all about. I've never felt like I was constrained by a destiny.

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack:** Hard to say exactly, Hard working is definitely an attribute associated with us sometimes even to a fault. I think Americans have a little bit of everything so it makes it so hard to say. If you are looking for somethings specific in a type of person or people you can find it here in America.

&gt;##5. Anything you want to potential subscribers to your subreddit?


&gt;&gt;**/u/cardinals5** We always want new perspectives and new people. As long as you're respectful and not here to lecture us on why things suck about America, we are always happy for more people! I think we'll also have an FAQ and some new stuff going on soon, so keep an eye out for it if you subscribe!

&gt;&gt;**/u/EagleEyeInTheSky** We have one rule, and one rule only in this subreddit. [Everybody Love Everybody]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nXJe9i70DE&amp;feature=youtu.be). Also, all of our other rules on the sidebar apply. BUT EVERYBODY LOVE EVERYBODY!

&gt;&gt;**/u/CoCaptainJack** Even though this subreddit is based around questions for Americans, American subscribers here can learn a LOT about world culture that is hard to get elsewhere. Some of the differences in different cultures are subtle but have interesting details. ""Do Americans really not use cursive that much?"", ""Ao does your country still?"", ""All the time! almost exclusively!"" is a rather mundane example, but you get the point.

This summer I have a government internship out of state. I was informed and required to sign a 1099 Form, so I know I will need to save money for that. I also receive work study during the school year. I have two questions:

1: How do I create a budget knowing that I will have to pay taxes? I've never been great at savings, but I do okay and have a tiny emergency fund (about $1k) in case something goes wrong and I need to get home in a hurry. My expenses are VERY low, and all I'll be paying this summer is $650 a month for housing and money for food.

2: I have absolutely no credit (but I have small student loans), and my father has suggested I start looking at starter credit cards to begin establishing credit. I'll be in college for a Masters, possibly a Ph.D, so I'm look at another 5 years of schooling. (majoring in CS/Mathematics with a focus in Cyber-Security if it matters). How important is it that I start establishing credit now.

Thank you for all the help. I'm also open to any advice in general on how to be good with my money in the future. I've read horror stories and I don't want to be screwed later in life by a bad decision now.

Im 22 now and I started out at a community college right out of high school and did okay the first year. Some crap happened in my life going into year 2 and i was dealing with some serious anxiety and depression and my grades really went down, but still transferred after that to a school pursuing a degree in Marketing. Was living at home for all this and during the first semester at the new school realized i needed to get away because i was still depressed and just needed a change of scenery. Transferred to a school about an hour away still pursuing marketing and my grades yet again were just bad but i started to feel a lot better. As i got out of my depression i started to really crank down on school but by this time my grades were ruined and i ended up having to switch to a degree in Interdisciplinary studies with minors in Economics, Sports Communication, and Entertainment Media because i couldnt get into the business school. Im now about to graduate with this and a GPA that isnt good, but i have managed to get way up from where it was after i started to focus on school. I really have no idea what to do and its started to get me really anxious and worried. I have no internships or anything. I have a real strong interest in Sports, really anything to do with sports, its my biggest passion and also i am quite computer savvy. Any suggestions on what to do?"
4etyel,5,2016-04-14,Calling anyone who has experience with federal prison records-help!!,fullmetalyoga,Genealogy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/4etyel/calling_anyone_who_has_experience_with_federal/,"Hi guys, 

So i've posted here a few years back about finding a rumrunner ancestor in a census, showing he was incarcerated in a federal correctional institute in Florida and wondering what that prison's name was and what not.  

Well I had written a very pleading letter to the Bureau of Prisons back in summer 2013 asking for any info they had on him and after about 8 months with no contact from them, I kind of gave up hope of ever hearing anything.  To be honest I had long forgotten about that letter and just accepted my fate of having to make a trip to Washington eventually to personally search.  

So finally, this week-about three years later!-I got an email from them with some minimal, index type info they had found. Shocked would be an understatement. One of the bits of info they listed for each stay in the federal hotel is his inmate registration number. Now, we're talking about 1945-1952 here.  One example of his inmate number is 70858-A. 

According to the student intern who sent the email and was amazing enough to correspond with me to answer a few questions about what a register number was, etc. told me the letters at the end correlate to the prison where they were held.  But after an exhaustive google search, i'm coming up with nothing trying to figure out which institutions the letters correspond to.  

Does anyone have any advice on how to match the prison to the register number letters?  Also, in the email with the index info, they said that this was the only information available because federal prison records are destroyed 30 years after the release date.  But surely this is not the end of the line, right? Is there anywhere to go from here?

Thanks in advance to anyone with any input or suggestions!"

This is for a college IT internship.  I feel like wearing the first option makes me look more put together, but the second option is probably a little more professional."
4eu2dx,0,2016-04-14,Fall16 Schedule,umd_throwaway_sched,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/4eu2dx/fall16_schedule/,"I'm considering taking the following schedule:

MATH241, MATH461, CMSC430, CMSC451, CMSC498I and ENMA150.

Am I crazy? Is this realistic or am I just going to hate myself for four months? I plan on self-studying a ton of Algorithms (interviews/personal interest) Linear Algebra and Calc3 over summer anyways, so I figured I might as well get credit for them. 

I have three semesters left to graduate, and I realized it's not too late to add a mathematics minor. But if I make that decision it's now or never. I've always felt like my math background was below where I want it, so I figured rounding it out over the next three semesters before I'm done with college would be my best bet. 

One of my major concerns is allocating enough time for interviews without failing anything. I'm fairly certain that I will be interviewing with a few of the Big 4 as well as other similar companies, and hopefully will land a few offers. I'll be doing a ton of prep this summer, but I'm a little worried that this schedule will end up being detrimental for my internship oppurtunities.

I'm not particularly concerned about getting a 4.0 in every single class I'm taking, but I also don't want to barely scrape by. I'm very confident in my ability when it comes to the CS classes, especially Algorithms, I don't really expect to struggle in those courses. But is the overall workload just too much? Even if I familiarize myself with the majority of the Calc3/Linear content?

They liked me and told me to reach out to them in February about coming back again.

Since then I haven't talked to anyone from the company nor my IT boss. 

I'm just curious if I should send an email or something to make sure they haven't forgotten about me or anything. Maybe email the HR director asking what time I should be in on my first day? Or should I just not worry about it and wait until May 9th "
4eub14,6,2016-04-14,Need some advice...,curlytoot,AskTrumpSupporters,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4eub14/need_some_advice/,"Hi everyone,

I started seeing a girl a couple months ago; things have been going really well, we seem to click on a lot of things, are into a lot of the same things, etc. I'm 23, and she is 24. I'm her first ""serious"" relationship-ish-thing (she's still hesitant to put a label on it). We both moved here to NYC last summer. She is from a Mexican family in CA. Her parents are both conservative. 

Well, last night we were having one of our regular chats over the phone, and she asked me about my/my family's political views. Then she asked who I was supporting for the presidency. Now, I had suspicions she might be a Bernie supporter, but wasn't sure; either way, I tried to play it safe and decline to answer. She wouldn't have it. 

So I eventually told her I like Trump, that I used to *not* be pro-Trump largely due to the dishonest media, and that I used to think he was a joke/clown candidate, but that I had changed my mind after doing some research. She interjected here, and said that not only is he a joke, but is ""a racist jerk"" who has said horrible things about women. I asked her how he is racist. She couldn't come up with anything (of course). She tried to say basically he just is, but I didn't let her get away with that. I offered to prove to her that he's not racist, but she just started repeating the word ""No"" as if trying to shut me up. Then she said ""Well, even if he's not racist, he's still an asshole"" and that Trump ""is not a kind person"" (but Bernie is a kind person). She said that she's not thrilled with the everything Obama has done, but that ""at least he has class. Trump is just crass"". And she said that although she has problems with Hillary, she would vote Hillary if Bernie doesn't get the nomination, as the lesser evil (compared to Trump or Cruz).

Now, I know some of you are probably going to say run for the hills/break it off right now. And I hear you. But the fact that she pretty easily conceded ""Well even if he's not racist..."" gives me hope that she may be willing to open her eyes more to the truth. She seemed pretty shocked/upset that I support Trump, but told me it didn't change her opinion of me and that she respects me still. She said that Cruz and Trump ""are fucking idiots"". I pointed out that I wasn't referring to Bernie or Hillary as that, and she said the reason I'm not is ""because they aren't""... She wound up apologizing for bringing up the topic, period. Said she would be happy to have a nice long argument/discussion sometime in person.

What is the best way to approach this? What links should I show her that could help turn her around? She's a really sweet person, and contrary to most BernieBots, she has a job. (She is a stage management intern at a top music conservatory. She also has some summer jobs lined up.) Admittedly, her job doesn't pay very well, and she oftentimes finds herself working crazy hours, like 9 AM to 9 or 10 PM on some days. I don't know if she thinks Bernie will somehow help with this, or what, but she isn't the lazy sort of person we usually like to make fun of here. Far from it. 

I largely suspect that she's just been indoctrinated by the same media buzzwords and inaccurate word of mouth that tends to hate on Trump. It was very telling that she didn't really have any examples to back her up, of how horrible he supposedly is.

So, I'm basically wondering how best I can convince her that 1. Trump is not a bad person. 2. I am not a bad person for supporting Trump. 3. Trump's policies actually make sense. 4. If she still picks Bernie, she doesn't need to hate on Trump supporters. It's okay to pick your candidate for their policies/values, but don't throw around stupid buzzwords and rumors about a candidate that simply aren't true. Any advice on how to convey this?

P.S. She said she hopes I eventually change my mind about Bernie. And when I said that I had been scared the past few weeks to mention this to her, she said maybe that's a sign that I am supporting the wrong candidate. -_-"

My thesis is: Due to its security, stability, cost-efficiency,  and admin management capabilities, Linux provides a reasonable alternative to traditional computing and contains added educational benefits.
I'll edit this post tomorrow night and I'll have a link to the full essay :)
 Super nervous though. I'm still in high school, and I TA for the district's tech department (their office is right across from the campus) so I invited one of the guys I practically intern for to come watch my presentation on my paper (a whole 45 minutes worth!) and he says: ""Oh that's funny, come to think of it, I'm going to a board meeting that morning and we'll be discussing educational technology, mind if I bring a few guys along"" My spirits soared and my ~~cpu~~ *heart* jumped around in my chest. But of course, yes man me, said ""sure!"". Yeah, I am really excited (I mean, I might have an influence on **board members** and show off Linux) to have this opportunity, but there is so much more pressure now. Well, as Sherlock once said, ""the game's afoot!"" Wish me luck, everyone.

4eux47,0,2016-04-14,Should I stay or should I go?,h4lp23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4eux47/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,"Please community, hear my plea. This is the biggest decision that will dictate my future. 

I'm a new grad that's being offered full-time by my previous internship. I've been hesitating on accepting because of a couple reasons listed below. I am lost because I don't have mentors listen to.

Pros:
- I learned a lot there. Like the difference in my technical abilities is mind-blowing after the 8 month internship.  I'm working on important product features.
- I am treated like an equal, not a kid. It feels weird since most are in their 40s. But they respect me enough to contribute and listen to my opinions.  
- I like my coworkers a lot. Everyone is great to get along with. 
- I could live rent free and pay off student loans
- The product is exciting and the environment is fast-paced and fun. 
Cons: 
- Starting at such a small company could make my career projection worse than others. If I ever decide to leave, I will struggle a lot to find a job because my experience comes from startups. I never worked in a large corporation before and feel that it'll hurt me.
- The lack of guidance could hurt my growth. So far I had to figure out most things on my own. Nobody is senior level. I feel more like a hacker than a software developer.
- Reiterating above, but I did not learn deeply about something yet. I don't get to have training days for learning new technologies.
- I don't like the city and could enjoy moving to somewhere larger closer to people my age instead of a suburb. 

This community is great because it helps me grow. I have learned solid career advice, my resume is on point, and I am in the career for the right motives according to y'all. I love creating software, and more specifically working on interesting software. But I also love getting paid. So I'm trying to find the best of both worlds.

So I would appreciate your experiences, comments, concerns and advice. Thanks!"
4euxkl,1,2016-04-14,"[21/M] What to do next with ""friendzone""? [21/f]",asd13241,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4euxkl/21m_what_to_do_next_with_friendzone_21f/,"TL;DR: Met this girl a few months ago. We become close, says she wants to be just friends. Leads me on and super flirtatious still. We make out one night when she was drunk (I'm sober but going off a double all nighter). Now she's suddenly super awkward around me. Move on or what do I do?

So little bit of background info about me and her so you guys have a better idea. I'm a Chinese American student that goes to an engineering school. I have super asian traits (piano, cooking, etc) but a super white personality. The only thing I don't do like a white person is dating (mainly because I'm just bad at dealing with girls). She is a Chinese international student. She's super pretty (like out of my league pretty) and a lot of guys are always going for her (as expected from a school with 30% girls and 70% guys). 

Now to the story. Basically I met her through a professional club called SASE. She was in my group during a overnight conference so we pretty much hung out every night with a group of other members. I didn't expect anything to go anywhere, but apparently they did, for better or for worse. So several days after regional conference, she sends me a text asking me if I want to go to boston with her. She has a interview and doesn't want to drive alone. I say no because I'm had lab that day. Later that night I asked how her interview went/talked. I invited her over and she actually come over by herself, while all her friends when to go watch a movie together. Few days later, we continue to hang out more. I was raised as a chef so I cooked for her. She also always does some things that throw me off like ask ""what type of girls am I into?"" and I responded with a similar description of her. Her response to that was ""oh, so kinda like me?"" When I say ""yes"", she say ""check"" and makes a check mark like shes checking something off a list with her hands.

 We became fairly close but I didn't want to make any moves/ask her how she felt about me. This is because we had to go on a road trip together during spring break. So during the road trip, she's with me the whole time. We were in the same car, and most times it was just me and her. As the other people on the trip would describe it, we were ""inseparable."" We talked a lot, laughed a lot  and could always keep the conversation going. Needless to say, this was probably around the time I was falling for her but didn't realize it yet. After the trip, the question finally came around. Not because I asked, but because one of my friends txted me asking if we were dating and she saw it. She says she just wanted to be friends and I was completely cool with it, at this time. Pretty much we hung out every night after the trip for the last remaining nights of spring break. She'd always come down and I'd cook dinner for us both. Then we would continue to just talk.

 Then there was a weird night. She was offered a position summer internship position so we celebrated a bit. I gave her a cup of moscato and half a smirnoff ice. Somehow, the conversation come up to she only wants to be friends. Then suddenly she asks ""do I want to have sex with her?"" Odd question, but she already said she only wanted to be friends twice so I thought it was just a joke. We hung out later that night in my bed room, pretty much alternated txting one of my friends and fought over a blanket. Then randomly she sits up and says ""we shouldn't make out right now"" I thought it was another joke, but we make eye contact and I went in for a kiss......I didn't follow through with it  (the shy/pussy asian side of me is too strong) and she kinda looked away. Her reason for not kissing me was she didn't want to lose what she we have. We hang out a bit more then I drove her home. In the car she finally says to me ""you can tell I really like you right?"" and I say ""yea I can tell.""

 Now I'm confused as shit. Apparently a lot of differential equations and complex transport mechanics (I'm a ChemE) doesn't prepare you for this shit. I consult a few friends about it and I reach a conclusion that I have to talk to her about it. I needed to tell her that I would always be her friend no matter what, but I can't stand being in this grey zone. When I txted her saying ""we need to talk"" she says ""why"" followed by ""I know why."" Again, back to square 1 again, she only wants to be friends and I'm like ok no more flirting shit. We talk and I told her that I consulted a few friends about what I should do next. She flips out on me, tells me we can't be friends anymore. I feel like shit because it felt like my friends opinions, who she hasn't met before, matter more than mine. I felt like I was just a boy toy, or like a cat trying to catch something dangling in front of them. I snap at her and this is the first time I've snapped at someone in about 4 years now. I apologized later, but she refused to talk to me.

 This is when I knew I was fucked. I had developed feelings for this girl and I didn't know what to do. I hadn't had the slightest bit of emotions since freshmen year highschool, and suddenly I went from no emotions to almost a emotional breakdown. We don't talk for a day and one of our friends realized that there was something wrong between us. He patched things up between us and again we started hanging out. 

Then I realized I had to keep my feelings under control. I began avoiding her as much as possible, but that doesn't really help that much. Any time I wasn't busy doing with, I was thinking about her. After a few days of no contact, I get drunk, friend txts me which bars shes at, I go, we talk for a bit (not emotional shit, just something fun), and I headed out because I know I'm just hurting myself. 

Next day, I finally went to go talk to my friend (the one who patched us back up) about my feelings for her, hoping it would make me feel just a bit better (and so I might be able to sleep at night). He says she called him that night when we argued. She was upset and doesn't know why she got mad at me. I pour my heart out to him, with everything I felt about her. Honestly, being at engineering school and having parents with really high expectations, you can end up in some pretty dark places. Spending time with her was the first time I was actually happy, in about 4 years of my life. This guy ends up telling her everything. Why I like her, how I feel about her, literally everything almost word for word. But he tells me that she only dates people she's 100% sure about and she likes me. She just sends me a message of a picture of this friend. We talk a bit more and she invites me out for a night. 

We go out to a party, but I was sober D so looks like I was everyone's caretaker for the night. We leave, everyone who was with us is hammered. I drop everyone off, but bring her inside cuz she was way too drunk. I bring her up the stairs, to the sofa, and grab her a cup of water and her blanket. Just before I leave, she grabs my hand and holds me there. I was like, K, guess i'll stay for a bit. We talk for a while and suddenly she leans in to kiss me. She falls off the coach and is super embarrassed. I'm laughing really hard right now, but help her back onto the coach. She's too embarrassed to look at me. Honestly, I should have probably left here, but I didn't. I just looked her in the eyes and we started to make out. After a while, we cuddled and talked for a bit. She admits that while I was avoiding her, she missed me and she was really happy when I showed up at the bar. Then just before I leave, we kiss again, about 3 hours later (she was sobering up then). We promised to never talk about it (at least with people that she might know). 

We hang out the next day, but it doesn't feel the same. She just felt so much more conserved and it was the first time it was ever kinda awkward between me and her. I said maybe it was just me since I pulled another all nighter so I haven't been able to think clearly for a while. I asked her if she was doing anything the next night. She just says she's busy. Day afterwards, I see her in the club meeting and see if she wants to hang. Same thing, so now I'm pretty sure she's avoiding me.

 So what do I do guys/girls? I know I'm pretty muched fucked considering that I bought a motorcycle in order to try and get over her. Literally I've been doing everything I can to keep busy (yes that includes writing this long ass story) but I just end up thinking about her. She was the only light I saw for a while and now I'm returning back to a dark place. I need help. I don't know what to do; if I should move on, if I should go tell her myself how I feel, if I should just ride my motorcycle across half the country? I'm lost and any piece of advice would be helpful.

From a twinkie,
Thank you for your time

4evk44,453,2016-04-15,My Google Tech Interviewing Decoded Experience,madnessman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4evk44/my_google_tech_interviewing_decoded_experience/,"## Introduction

Last Friday (2016-04-07), I was invited to Google's new Sunnyvale campus for a new Google campus outreach program currently titled Tech Interviewing Decoded. Over the course of approximately five hours, Google hosted a number of talks, panels, and demos to ""demystify the [Google] interview process and give you the opportunity to have your questions answered about launching your career in tech"". Approximately 100-150 computer science/engineering students from four invited Bay Area universities attended the program. I suspect that many readers here would have liked the opportunity to attend such an event so I've written up a quick summary of the day. I suspect that nothing here will be new to some readers on this sub but hopefully it helps some people!

## Mock Interview 'Demo' with Googlers

In my favorite segment, two Google interviewers demonstrated what the technical portion of a Google interview looks like along with tips on what interviewers are looking for. Both the interviewer and interviewee were named Jonathan so I'll refer to them as the interviewer and interviewee. I think it will be more useful if I describe some notable points rather than regurgitating the interviewer's code so the code/solution is left as an exercise to the reader (hah). 

Problem: Write a program that returns the length of the longest chain of consecutive numbers in a grid of natural numbers.

The interviewee began by asking clarifying questions about the problem. An interviewer may give you an intentionally ambiguous or vague problem to assess your attention to detail. Some questions asked in this demo included:

* Q: Can we assume that the grid is square (NxN rather than NxM)? A: Yes, let's say it's square for now.
* Q: Do we have to worry about the grid being so large that it can't fit in memory or anything like that? A: No, let's assume the grid is reasonably sized and will be given as a 2-D array (e.g. int Grid[n][n])
* Q: Do we have to consider diagonal elements? A: Nope. An element is adjacent to another element if it is positioned immediately to its left/right xor top/bottom.

The interviewee then solved an example by hand on the whiteboard to ensure that he was on the same page as the interviewer. Working out a problem by hand is also a good way to gain some intuition on how to design an algorithm for the given problem.

    [0, 1, 4]
    [2, 3, 5]
    [8, 7, 6]
    Longest chain is [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] with length 5.
    
    [0, 2]
    [3, 1]
    Longest chain is [1, 2] with length 2.


It was only after asking questions and solving an example by hand that the interviewee began to actually write code. He began by writing a suboptimal but straightforward brute force solution: iterate through every element in the matrix and see what the longest chain of increasing, consecutive neighbors you can form from each starting point. Keep track of the maximum length encountered and return it after checking all starting points. While writing his solution, the interviewer called a function for finding the longest chain given a starting cell rather than writing the entire solution in one block. Writing modular code in an interview is not only neater but also opens the door to the possibility that the interviewer lets you skip fully implementing some functions. In this case, the interviewer only asked the interviewee to describe how he would implement his getLongestPath function. 

The interviewee then noted that this solution is inefficient and repeats work. Iterating through the grid takes O(n^2) time and finding the longest path takes O(n) so his solution is O(n^3). If I'm not wrong, there seemed to be some inconsistency on whether n referred to the dimension of the matrix (e.g. n = 3 for a 3x3 matrix) or the total number of elements in the matrix (e.g. n = 9 for a 3x3 matrix). He then came up with an O(n) by creating a custom data structure that maps the value of a cell to its index in the matrix.


    [0, 1, 4]
    [2, 3, 5]
    [8, 7, 6]
    -&gt; {0: (0, 0), 1: (0, 1), 2: (1, 0), 3: (1, 1), 4: (0, 2), 5: (1, 2), 6: (2, 2), 7: (2, 1), 8: (2, 0)
    
    [0, 2]
    [3, 1]
    -&gt; {0: (0, 0), 1: (1, 1), 2: (0, 1), 3: (1, 0)}

Then he ran through his new data structure sequentially and checked if the current index is adjacent (e.g. x1 == x2 and y1 == y2+-1 and vice versa) to the next index. Since you only need to iterate through the grid once to fill in your data structure and iterate through the data structure once to find the longest chain, the new solution ran in O(n) time (where n is the total number of elements in the matrix). 

I don't have the interviewees exact Java solution but I whipped up a quick Python implementation of his algorithm ([link](https://gist.github.com/danong/67fe6d1c81cb3ba72c137cf7d64e4168)) as I understood it.

Tip: if you see the opportunity to write a class or use some design pattern, you might as well take it to demonstrate your knowledge of the OOP paradigm. 

It's important to note that throughout the entire interview, the interviewee and interviewee were talking to each other almost continuously. Instead of standing silently while thinking to himself, the interviewee thought out loud so the interviewer could follow his thought process. The interviewee also described what he was attempting to do while writing each line of code. Communicating your thoughts in an interview has the added benefit of allowing your interviewer to give you feedback and hints if you're going in the wrong direction. Multiple Googlers emphasized that your interviewer will want to see you ace your interview and solve the problem so if they give you a hint, take it. They aren't trying to trick or mislead you. Remember that interviewers are also assessing if they would like to work with you and ignoring their hints could make you seem like a stubborn developer who has to do things his or her way.

Tip: identify possible errors or bugs as you work. For example, while writing code to get a cell's neighbors, the interviewee noted that there may be an off by one error when the cell is on the edge of the matrix and said he'd go back to fix it after getting the general algorithm down. This prevents the interviewer from asking you 'gotcha' type questions when you finish. It can also be useful for the interviewer to know that you recognize a problem area so he or she doesn't focus on an error he or she thinks you missed.

## Follow up Demo Q&amp;A with Googlers

Following the interview, the two demonstrators answered questions and gave more tips on how to have a successful interview.

* Q: Will your interviewer run your code? A: Maybe. Some people take notes and run your code later while some don't. If you see your interviewer typing during your interview, it is highly unlikely that he or she is transcribing your code into an IDE however. They're most likely just taking notes.
* Q: How important is syntax? A: You want to show that you know the programming language you're using but it's not like missing a semi-colon is going to ruin your chances.
* Q: What language do you have to code in? A: Your recruiter should talk to you about what language you would like to code in beforehand and you'll be matched with an interviewer who is familiar with that language. We don't recommend trying to do an interview in some obscure language. You're definitely safe if you code in C++, Java, or Python.
* Q: Is it always a good idea to work on the obvious brute-force approach before giving a better or optimal solution? A: Not really. It's impressive if you can briefly describe the obvious solution and its time complexity before going right into a better solution. In this context, the interview from the demo wasn't actually the strongest interview a candidate could have given.
* Q: What if you get a problem that you have no idea how to approach? A: Try to stay calm. Panicking is going to hurt you even more. It's especially important to ask questions, do an example or two, and communicate your thought process to your interviewer.
* Q: I failed an interview in the past. Why didn't I get any feedback on what I did wrong? A: Legal reasons. If you're interviewing again, try to show noticeable improvement. It looks really bad if you fail to solve a problem that you failed to solve in a previous attempt.

## Googler Panel

Following the mock interview, four Googlers took the stage and opened the floor to questions.

* Q: What are some tips that you have for current students? A: Show your passion for CS by participating in organizations and events outside of classes. Work on your own projects or contribute to open source. Study hard and practice for interviews. Try to get as many internships and experience under your belt as possible.
* Q: What are some tips for people trying to get a job at Google? A: Persevere - I waited 5 years before I first applied to Google and when they finally hired me. Make your life easier by letting your know interviewer know if you're having any problems that they could accommodate. Practice interviewing on a whiteboard and do as many interviews as you can; the general tech interview form is pretty similar across companies so there's a lot of skill transfer.
* Q: How is the work-life balance at Google? Do you ever feel burned out? A: Google is so large that the atmosphere/pressure varies from team to team. All the panelists agreed that they had good work-life balance and a lot of stress they feel is self-induced.
* Q: I'm interested in CS education. Are there opportunities for this at Google? A: Again, Google is large. A better question would be what field isn't Google interested in? To your specific example, I know that Google often sends people to teach at historically black colleges and universities. 

## Spotlight Talks

Two Googlers gave slightly longer talks specifically about what they do at Google. The first speech was by someone who entered Google through the Engineering Residency program. The Engineering Residency program is a yearlong training where residents are attached to 2 different teams for training and hands on experience. Apparently it has a ~90% conversion rate and many residents like their first team enough that they choose to stick with it and convert to a full time role. This was the case for our first speaker and she ended up on the Chrome for Android UI team where she worked on implementing features such as the close all tabs button for Android on tablets. She is currently working on features such as split screen support on the upcoming Google N. 

The second speech was largely about the importance of data health, the process of building systems to monitor Google's data systems, and how Google deals with system failures. Rather than naively recording all system logs and informing everybody about the failure, Google has systems in place to identify the root cause of problems and only notifies teams that will be negatively impacted. He also talked about some of the techniques (e.g. power capping) that Google uses to reduce costs in their data centers. 

## Ask a Recruiter! Q&amp;A

The final panel consisted of four recruiters who took questions about the whole recruitment process.

* Q: How long do you spend on each resume? A: Resumes are actually sent to a dedicated resume screening team in Houston who take 10-15 minutes per resume. If your resume makes it past that stage, it gets into our (a recruiter) hands. Since there is such a high volume of applicants, it isn't feasible for recruiters to spend too much time on every resume.
* Q: If I'm rejected, how long should I wait before reapplying? A: Officially it's a year but it doesn't have to be exactly one year to the date.
* Q: How important is it to include links to your portfolio/GitHub on your resume? A: It's definitely helpful. Many interviewers will take the time to look at a candidate's GitHub before interviews.
* Q: What are some resumes do's and don'ts? A: Definitely include your GPA. Unless you have industry experience, keep it to a single page. Be truthful about your knowledge or experience.
* Q: What is the minimum GPA needed to be competitive at Google? A: Google takes a holistic look at each candidate.
* Q: When is the best time to apply for an internship? A: As early as possible after the application opens. It's tempting to wait to give yourself more time to improve your resume but recruiters will have more time to spend on each applicant early in the application period and there are finite number of spots that get filled up over time.
* Q: I dropped out of a PhD program. Does this reflect badly on me or hurt my chances? A: Google is filled with people from non-traditional paths. I wouldn't worry about that at all.

## Closing

In addition to the scheduled talks, a few lucky people were selected for their own practice interviews. Sadly, I wasn't one of those ~20 people. Of course, no Silicon Valley event would be complete some company swag. All attendees received a bag full of Google swag that included a subtly branded Google notebook, plastic sunglasses, socks, and a 2200mAh external battery pack. Some lucky winners also won a free copy of Cracking the Coding Interview.

I thought the event was very well run. All the speakers and panels were good about keeping to the schedule and there was no dead or wasted time. One issue was that other Googlers kept accidentally connecting to the projector in our room. I suspect they have some sort of campus wide conference call/meeting network setup but it was pretty funny to see the projector switch from the presentation slides to some random person every now and then though. Thanks again for hosting this event, Google!

Let me know if you have any questions!

This should be obvious but I'm not associated with Google in any way. The opinions and views expressed are solely my own and do not reflect the view of Google.

4evlxa,1,2016-04-15,"Seeking remote work: sales operations, enablement, proposal writing, presentation design, RFP developement",Wellesley_,hiring,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiring/comments/4evlxa/seeking_remote_work_sales_operations_enablement/,"Thanks for taking the time to look at this post! I apologize for the length, but wanted to accurately convey my experience, expertise, and what I’m looking for in a new role.

TL;DR - I am a sales support strategist with expertise far outweighing my ‘career experience’ in:
* Creating &amp; developing tailored sales presentations for potential and existing clients.
* Managing sales proposals (RFP, RFIs, RFQs) across the US, Canada, EMEA, APAC and LATAM
* Supporting sales teams in new business development efforts: industry specific market research, targeting HR executives and decision makers, competitor research, current account analysis, emerging trends, and the creation of sales collateral.
* Collaboration with all business functions has helped to strengthen sales strategy, improve operational effectiveness, and maintain process excellence.

I've been working as a ""Sales Support Strategist"" for the past year, although my job responsibilities far outweigh the title. While I am currently satisfied with my responsibilities, level of pay, and scope of my role, I feel like I've hit a wall with growth within my current company, and I’m read to explore new opportunities to work remotely and continue to assist the sales department in booming more efficient, developing strategy, and representing itself in the market in such a way to differentiate itself form competitors to drive new business acquisition. In short, I’ve been with my company for close to 3 years (this May!), and previously worked as an intern and recruiter, before being hand-picked by our CSO for my current role.

I currently manage, develop, and strategize on all content (including RFPs, Proposals, Quarterly Business Reviews with current clients, lead generation, and content management) for a rapidly growing talent acquisition, recruiting, and human capital consulting company. I manage all of the above for all of our lines of business - market research, talent consulting, recruitment process outsourcing, executive search, and contingent talent solutions (temp-to-perm, etc.). Over the past year or so, I’ve been an integral part in my organizations growth from a US-based firm, and assisting with the scale to global operations. When I first started with the company, we had one office in the US and about 300 employees. Since then, we’ve grown to support our clients on a global scale - increasing our headcount to 1000, our global capabilities to EMEA, Canada, South America, and APAC, and played an integral role in driving revenue through strategic positioning in the market from $11MM in 2014 to $34MM in 2015. Our clientele has grown from recognizable, regional firms to global corporations which are household names and are top employers in their respective industries. I’ve also been a key player in developing content and sales strategy as we’ve acquired two firms (one in the US, one in the UK) as we’ve expanded our service lines and global capabilities, and I’ve had the opportunity to work on multi-million dollar deals that span several nations for companies in industries such as finance, retail, hospitality, technology, manufacturing, healthcare, sales, media and telecommunications, along with many others. Along the way, I’ve had the opportunity to shape my company’s strategy as we shifted from a regional, boutique provider to a global player in our industry.

Opportunities I’ve worked on for our sales department range from small local and regional startups on the rise to large, multi-national corporations and Fortune 500 companies. I feel that I’ve been fortunate to gain a thorough understanding of the procurement, sales, and HR/talent acquisition processes for companies across the globe that have widely varying expectations of service providers. In my current role, I am responsible for any and all opportunities that include a US-scope, and as we’ve grown, my role has grown to include project management and content development of any opportunities on a global scale that include US delivery.

Along the way, I’ve worked directly with our Chief Sales Officer and our Director of Global Strategy and Partnership (as well as our CEO and VPs of Client Strategy and Delivery) to accurately define, optimize, and drive efficiency within our fledgling sales operations, strategy, and enablement departments. Prior to this role, I was working for my company as a recruiter, and was identified for my work ethic, ability to handle pressure/quick turnaround times on project requests, and knowledge of our industry to be the first employee in this role. As we’ve grown tremendously in the past few years, our executive team recognized the need for someone to work solely on sales strategy, optimization, and content creation, and I’ve stepped in to fill that gap. Since then, we’ve grown to add two more resources  - on in the UK who works on EMEA-specific deals, and on in Canada who handles deals specific to that country,

Over the past year, I’ve managed and directed the strategy for and incredibly complex sales cycle. Often, prospects approach my company due to our paid growth the market, and have requests for immediate delivery for HR/talent acquisition solutions (which stems from our industry rapidly gaining recognition over traditional models -  internal talent acquisition models, which can be very costly, time intensive, or both; and a combination of an internal talent acquisition function with recruitment agency support - which is extremely costly and can often produce mixed results). A large part of my role is strategizing and directing how we represent ourselves in the market, which often leads to an extensive educational process we conduct with prospects, as our solution is rather new and intimidating to buyers who are expecting a better way to deliver on the traditional model (i.e. recruitment agency support). Additionally, I’ve taken our content management and process from copying and pasting from old RFPs and proposals to several Sharepoint-based knowledge bases which house all our our new content, which I designed in conjunction with our IT team. While not a perfect system, its is miles ahead of our previous system, and I’m actively research and implementing ways to drive further efficiency in our process.

Prior to assuming this role, my company had approximately 20 US-centric clients, and completed about 10 RFPs, 30-40 quarterly business reviews, and 50-60 proposals in the year before I started. Since assuming the role, I’ve managed 50 RFPs, 120 quarterly business reviews with current clients, and approximately 200 new sales proposals, as well as numerous market research reports and analytics reports designed to present an accurate depiction of the current state of delivery and how we can improve, or where we need additional buy-in from our client to improve our delivery function. Additionally, I am the sole “market research consultant” used to develop market intelligence for our current clients and prospects, and this has become a central part of our sales strategy. As we’ve gained recognition in the market, I’ve been asked to develop intensive market intelligence, using limited or free tools, to support our sales proposals, including: employer brand and recruitment marketing analyses, market analyses to determine viability of opening new offices, competitor research, talent mapping, etc. - all of which are my creation (drawing upon excellent sources online), and have completely differentiated our company’s offerings from that of our competitors, and won quite a few large deals. 

While I’m grateful for the opportunity I’ve been presented, and the ability to grow my skill set rapidly during a period of rapid growth, I’ve begun to notice a sense of complacency from the senior leadership. Having direct access and daily communication with our CSO, CEO, etc. and sales team, I’ve seen that this sense of complacency has developed deep roots -  every proposal I’ve presented to drive efficiency in the sales process, optimize current processes, and obtain new business has been graciously received, only to have been ignored as ‘unnecessary at this time’ or determined to be ‘not in the budget’. While I recognize budget and time constraints, the solutions I’ve presented (free solutions, or software providers I’ve taken upon myself to demo and validate, etc) are relatively low-cost, especially when compared to adding another person to our team (which we’re in dire need for, and have been since Q2 2015). Further, my assumption is that there seems to be no growth in this role within my company, as there have been many empty promises of career growth, and the only avenue for growth within this role a try company - outside sales - is unattainable as our CSO prefers to hire tenured sales professionals that have 5-10 years experience selling all or part of our services.

While this may be a long-shot, I am hoping someone views this that shares my passion for optimizing the sales process. All of my experience has been within the HR/talent acquisition sector, but I’m confident in my ability to quickly understand and grasp new concepts and industries.

If by coincidence, your company may be looking for someone with my expertise, I would absolutely be willing to have an initial conversation, just shoot me a PM. While I prefer to work at home, I am open to relocation anywhere. If you have any questions regarding my experience, or would like any further information, I am always available.

I had a pretty productive day today, even though I graduated from this internship and do not have a job momentarily. I used the time starting early in the morning, to handle things I've been putting off for months. I also felt generally good about myself and was more focused into life picking up on insights, mainly from a philosophical point of view. 

As my day started slowing down, and I got back home I met up with one of my friends and I asked him to confirm on whether my assumption was right about other people we normally hang out with avoiding me for some reason. He told me I was right. I didn't want to go into specifics for I'm still early in recovery and couldn't go through emotional turmoil because of others disapproval of me. So I told him how ironic it will be when things turn around and they all want to be around me again. He agreed and I appreciated that for he maybe the only one of my friends left who believe in me.

Now knowing that my circle is  broken and almost every bodies against me, I didn't feel any remorse, nor did I react badly to those who continued to talk to me knowing they ridiculed my shy demeanor and low esteem behind my back. I knew if I gave in to their opinions and retaliated, it would be exactly what they wanted, so I stay calm knowing the situation is only temporary and I gotta bite the bullet.

When I got tired that evening, the urges crept up. As I was laying down, I started fantasizing about having sex until the craving to watch porn videos emerged. Without thinking I grabbed my phone and started looking at vids which triggered me. Lookin back now, the three factors of being tired, bored, and lonely where probably the reason why I would pick up my phone. Then along came the feeling of impatience knowing that this was my first day all over again which made the urges unbearable.

I began edging myself to the limit knowing, that I had to take a cold shower to alleviate things. In the back of my mind I knew it was truly a test on whether or not I'm really down to quit. I struggled harder than you think trying to make the decision to hop in the shower while slowly succumbing to the urges. It was too the point where I could either orgasm from a couple more strokes, or hop in the extremely cold water to shock me out of the urges. I got down on my knees, butt naked, my johnson  ready for action, and prayed to God. I asked for His guidance, courage, and humility, and begged not to be led into temptation. After saying amen, I jumped in the shower quickly and to my surprise it was colder than expected but was quickly jolting me out of the current mindset I was in. 

I got out feeling a lot better, and proud for making the right decision. At the same time I felt guilty for edging myself for it felt I had no control for a minute but looking back now I see the circumstances which led to my actions. I learned from this point on to never trigger myself again unless I changed my mind about quitting PMO. From what I did today, I know that I'm serious and want to change my life for the better no matter what I have to sacrifice."

I've failed to graduate before and this time I'm heading the exact same direction. It's eating me alive and I noticed I'm falling back into depression.

Everything just feels bland. In fact, it's like I can't feel anything. No emotions other than how sad and miserable I feel when I wake up every day. Thinking everyday will be another step towards failure. Time feels like it's speeding up while I'm only slowing down.

It's such a stark contrast of how things were a year ago. Aside from failing my first graduation project, the first portion of last year was one of the better parts of my life. I got my first girlfriend and I was at my lowest weight in years. I was so proud of what I accomplished and I really miss that feeling.

I feel like things started to go downhill when I got a knee injury last year in may while running. Running daily was my way to vent and feel better about myself. It was the one exercise that I could easily do every day when I got home. The injury took that away from me, and it badly affected my health. I gained weight due to the lack of exercise and because I felt bad about gaining weight, I started comfort eating. I gained back about 6,5 kilos in a year.

Then I failed to graduate, which made me feel even more awful. My girlfriend supported me through it and motivated me to drive a bit on my birthday (I'm very afraid of driving). I managed to get two tickets with a combined worth of €270, which mostly emptied my bank account and even partly indebted me to my parents. Now I felt like a complete loser. I was poor, fat, a bad driver, failed to graduate and a leech to my parents' wallet.

Then I had to get set up for the next six months. I had to spend those six months looking for a new graduation project and to just stay alive. I picked up my part-time job again. I hate the job, but at least they'd have me and I could use the money pay off my debts and to afford to take my girlfriend out to do stuff together. These six months weren't so bad; I got to spend so much time with my girlfriend and managed to be financially independent.

At the end, though, I really felt the pressure of finding a new graduation project. Like last year, there wasn't a single company that would have me, and I never understood why. I had to painstakingly go through the process of applying for an internship again and each rejection made me feel worse. Two companies would have me and I picked the one that was most close by. I regret this decision.

Getting started at the internship, it all went well. I had a clear sense of purpose and just knew what to do to get going. After a while, I just got stuck. The tipping point happened many weeks ago and I still haven't crawled out of it. This makes me feel useless. It also doesn't help that it took me weeks of intense effort to get paid for the internship, meaning that I'll finally receive all of salary since February next week. In the meantime, I had to leech off of my parents again, which made me feel financially dependent.

It all made me depressed. I just don't care anymore. I haven't showered or brushed my teeth in a week. I haven't changed clothes in three days. I sometimes feel suicidal on the days that are particularly bad.

Today, I finally realised that I cannot take this on alone. I'm reaching out for help. Not only on Reddit, but also at school and on the internship. If no one knows what's going on, no one knows that I need help.

I apologise for the text wall.

**TL;DR Went through a rough patch after failing to graduate. Trying to graduate again, which isn't going well. Feel depressed and need help.**"
4evz65,3,2016-04-15,"A full-time work AND an internship in my field, is it unrealistic?",deadend2016,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4evz65/a_fulltime_work_and_an_internship_in_my_field_is/,"Hi /r/jobs,

so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4a3nbc/thinking_about_leaving_my_new_job/) about a month ago about me considering to leave the retail job I was just hired for. Well I stayed, and now I do not feel so incompetent and it's becoming a part of my life, though I am still constantly applying for jobs related to the creative industry.

One week or so back, after applying for approx. 30+ places and 10+ rejections, I thought maybe the problem is the lack of my work experience, or a specialized skill, I have always been a generalist and never focused on anything except painting which I highly doubt can make it to a work, not at a moment anyways.

My work is a shift work, and I have two days off on weekdays (I work on weekends) so I thought hey why not, let's just apply for an unpaid internship at one of the local creative agency as well. It's only two full-days a week for a month, plus a potential full-time job in future, what will I lose. I can survive. And, great, I did get to their interview stage.

The thing is, now I finally started to concern about my time management skill and if I will need to confront my manager regarding my time shifts. 'A day off' in retail is never a promise. For three times already since I started working, my manager asked me to work on my day offs because something happened or somebody wants *their* day off. My usual excuse is that 'oh I've already planned a day' but I doubt that'll be convincing after a month.

So if I get an internship, the best option for me is probably to tell my manager about it and if I can get fixed days off during my internship (and I can envision a frown on his face perfectly well). I know that is the rational thing to do, that confrontation issue I can easily fix. All I am concerned now is about my time. I will literally working my ass off if I do get the position, and although I am 90% certain that I can manage, I guess I just want some inputs from you guys.

Any comments or suggestions will be appreciated."

4exh1r,9,2016-04-15,How do high-achieving ADHDers cope with the heightened expectations?,adhdnerevarine,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4exh1r/how_do_highachieving_adhders_cope_with_the/,"I was diagnosed earlier this year with ADHD-C. I'm 23, female, and no one ever hinted at something like this when I was growing up. (Well, they did, but they didn't know what they were hinting at.)


My (half, different dad) brother was diagnosed ADHD in the 1980s and my mother is a dead ringer for ADHD-PI. Mom and brother are more...typical, I guess? Mom is dyslexic and possibly dysgraphic, brother has severe test anxiety, neither of them finished college. They both hated school, but are brilliant at creative endeavors.


By some freaky genetic flip of the coin, I got the ADHD and all its awesome/suck, but combined with my dad's book smarts. In everything.


So all my life, I've heard the usual complaints: ""Doesn't follow directions."" ""Is sometimes a distraction to the other children."" ""Has trouble knowing when to stop talking and focus on the work."" ""Isn't living up to her potential."" But only because I'd get an A- for a careless mistake, instead of an A. School was easy but boring, so I'd race through the work or test, get bored and whisper with a classmate, and end up with a 93 instead of a 98. I didn't have test anxiety so much as I had test anticipation. When they said ""potential"" they meant ""potential to cure cancer/be a rocket scientist."" And the expectations rose accordingly.


I went to kindergarten a year early, fought to move on to first grade (Teacher: She's emotionally immature. Mom: She's a year younger than everyone else, yeah, but she's also reading before every other kid in that room. Teacher: ...crap.). Had to be tested at the end of 4th grade (Teacher: There's something wrong with her. She makes careless mistakes on her math sheets. Mom: She's bored. You've been doing long division for weeks now. Teacher: I put extra challenging work on the board and she doesn't do it. Mom: ...so you've just been offering MORE boring, OPTIONAL work with no incentive?). Testing revealed math capabilities at the 8th grade level, and reading ability at college level.


High school: more of the same, except directed at me instead of my parents. Every Honors and AP class available. Straight 90s and 91s with a minimum of effort, anything higher was fine but certainly not worthy of actual effort. SAT? Pfft. Drove teachers insane with my lack of f***s given. (I even had a teacher give me a B in her course overall, insisting my bare-bones essays would never be accepted on the AP exam. Guess who got the only 5 that year?) Got accepted to a top-tier college and decided to study computer science. Ran straight into the wall of No Study Skills Whatsoever, developed a wicked anxiety problem, but made it through with successful internship experience and a 3.2 overall.


Now I have a fancy job and great performance reviews and the impostor syndrome has never been stronger.


When I finally suspected ADHD could be the reason I was Little Miss ""THINK WHAT YOU COULD DO IF YOU APPLIED YOURSELF!!!"" I got a LOT of pushback. No way YOU could have ADHD. You don't do X. You can do Y. You did Z. That's impossible with ADHD. Now that the dust has settled and I'm getting treatment, the high expectations still remain. I've explained, over and over, that since early school was easy, I got positive feedback that encouraged me to keep at it. College, or any other project that requires a million tasks to actually complete? That triggers anxiety, which requires therapy, and lots of medicinal wine. Or it triggers virtually nothing, and I get distracted. THAT'S WHY I HAVE THE MEDICATION.


""But you didn't need medication to do this before!"" But I didn't do anything LIKE this before! *launches self into the sun*


tl;dr ADHDers who are 'conventionally' 'successful', how do you deal with this post-diagnosis bullhockey of ""it was easy for you before, so why [do literally anything at all to improve your life because it looks PRETTY GOOD TO EVERYBODY ELSE and asking for any improvement is UNGRATEFUL]?""

I hope I’m wrong and you do read it though.  So here it goes…

Thinking back on our lives – we’ve spent 11 amazing, yes amazing, years together, which got me to thinking about the past.  Why did we marry each other, why did we stay together, why were we in love?   At the age of 29, 11 years is a significant portion of my life, our lives, 37.93% to be exact.

What got me thinking about this was I was thinking about the day I asked you to marry me.  I was so young, so were you.  I knew my parents would go WTF, and yours would think we’re crazy.   But looking back I remember the one thought that went through my head that day, and the same thought occurred to me 8 months prior when I bought the ring (yes I had it that long).   It was literally the thought that I wanted to be with you the rest of my life – but even more so, you were the person that completed me.

I had been planning for months to wait until our trip to NYC to ask you and do the big grand proposal.  But I just couldn’t wait any longer, I had gone to work that day just like every other day while I was working – waking up earlier than you in the morning and kissing you on the forehead before I left for work.  What was different that day that has always stood out in my head was the way you said “I love you, Have a good day at work”.  They are simple words, but what I realized is how much love I really had for you – and I couldn’t live without that in my life, forever.

I went to work that day and couldn’t focus. I was nervous, and unsure of my self – because this was the biggest leap I had made my entire life.  Until you came home, excited to go out for dinner on our date!   All was right in the world.   What I realized – we were meant to be, and I knew you would say the one word that would change our lives forever, “Yes”.

What’s interesting about that day is to me it has always been a link back to another important day to me.   After I proposed, I remember clearly being on the bridge in that park in Downtown, and the kiss you gave me it was something I’ll never forget.  But it also reminded me of the first time we kissed.  When we were at Derek’s and just randomly walked part way down the block to kiss the first time.   What was the same? That spark that we clearly had between us.

Then came our wedding day, and I remember my heart skipping a beat as you walked down the aisle, as the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.  But what I saw next stunned me.  Your face when right before we kissed, the way you lit up.  I knew right then I was the luckiest man in the world, and that you truly saw the same thing in me as I did you. Love, joy, happiness, excitement… maybe more.

All along I knew why I wanted to marry you and why I loved you so much then, but I don’t think I’ve ever LITERALLY told you the reasons why I was so madly in love with you from then up to now.   So here it goes:

·         Your personality: the way you treat others, the way you really care for your family, the way you even treat your patients.  You’re very kind and gentle, and loving.

·         Your passion in life: The fact that you are and always have been extremely passionate about the things you most care about in life.  From as simple as taking care and loving our dogs, to putting in the EXTREMELY tough work of going to school for PT.

·         Your support: You always, and I mean always are someone that I and everyone else could count on.   Through the thick and thin you always did what you could to be supportive.  I remember going to my grandma’s funeral and how you latched to my side when I had to walk over and see her one last time.   Or after I found out I had celiac disease, and you hugged me when I got home from work.  And many other things.

·         Your beauty: You are everything I ever looked for in a person.  Both physical beauty and emotional beauty.   I wish I were the type that said that more often.  But know I do think you are beautiful (including when you’re naked ;)  ) 

·         Your strength: That you even in tough times are able to stay very strong.  When you were going through your tough PT internship – you showed this character trait the best.  It was tough but you made it through.  You did the same when things were rough with me going through the changes with celiac disease – and you even became an awesome GF baker because of it (mmm)

·         Your love of family – The way you loved my family and pulled me into your family.  The fact that family is of the most important things to you.

·         That you’re very motherly and would be a wonderful mom:  From way back I could see it in you, just from when we first got Lexus and how you treated and cared for her, to more recently that look when you were pregnant.  This is literally one of the things about you that makes you so beautiful to me in a non-physical way.  You are the mom I wanted for my kids in the future.   You will be the most amazing one someday.

·         That you are literally my better half – I’m not perfect obviously, but you make up for that in so many ways, and literally push me to be a better person because of that.

·         Your ability to push others to be better- just as simply as you pushing me to go to college, or even to progress in my career.  You did this for me, but I know you did for others.

With all of this, it’s clear from day one I was head over heels from you – but over the course of our marriage the reasons I’m in love with you have grown as I didn’t know at the time all of these things were the reason why I loved you.  But, I knew that our love was real and we would grow with each other, which we really did along with the reasons we loved each other.  Even just looking back at the day I met you I longingly stared across the room and saw you.  I stopped and had to take a picture of you standing with Clark to remember the moment, only minutes later to be introduced to you. (See attached!)  What holds true is I have looked at you the same way ever since we met.   On lazy weekend nights when we just sat around home and you were sitting across the room – the way I looked at you longingly has always had the same feeling.  That feeling of wow…

However after all of this I never imagined you and I, out of all the people in this world, would go through something as devastating as this.  The last month has been an emotional rollercoaster and I’m sure it will continue to be for the both of us.  It’s hard for it not to be after 11 years.  But it’s also hard not to forget about those 11 years while we go through this - remembering all of the good, and love filled times we had together.  There truly was love in both of our hearts and a reason we stayed together.  We built a beautiful life together and were on the way to having a beautiful family.  Did we have obstacles to overcome - sure, with all marriages you go through the tough.   But by no means does that mean it can’t be sorted out.  It’d be tough – but a divorce is as well.

I have to ask again though, I know you say you love me but don't want to be married to me and you are doing this to be happy.   Wouldn't you like to have both if you could?

I know we both let things slide over the last months/year's and fell into a bad place.  For that I regret.   And I recognize the failing points in our relationship there. That said, over the last 11 years our love and desire to be together was very clear.  We just did not do a good job of putting in the work needed to be successful.  The work in being literal partners in our marriage, keeping each other aware of how we feel and what each of us need to be happy.

I also want you to know I’m sorry for not being the partner you needed, to keep you from feeling unhappy.  I wish I could have done better for you, for us, for our lives.  I know I tried very hard to be a good husband, provide for you/us – and do what I thought you needed to be happy but it’s clear I needed to do more.  I know that I didn’t always realize the things that you needed from me – but I tried to make up for it in the ways I did know how to do.

Looking back there were times that I know you were overwhelmed, or stressed out – whether it be work or school and I wasn’t the best at knowing how to handle those things best.  But what I tried to do was the things I was good at, whether it be being silly or just making sure I cooked you a good meal.  Or even, just letting you be alone if you needed it.   But looking back I wish I had just given you a hug more often and said it was going to be ok. 

At the same time – I wish our communication wasn’t always a problem.  Because it is one of those things that we were able to overcome, it would solve a lot of things (obviously not even close to everything though).  But, inherently there really was a further problem because our communication problem was masked very clearly over the last years because we were always busy.  First finishing up school at UNL early in our marriage, then dealing with finding jobs, moving to Florida, you going to school and me working hard to support you during that time – only to just recently be “free” of distractions for it to have a huge impact.  If there was any point in our marriage we need to work on our communication the most and been talking it is recently but both of us buried ourselves in our work instead.

What I realize though is that even though I see the problems we had with communication and these other items clearly today. God has a plan for us – but it’s just not clear right now. I just know he will guide us to the best resolution possible. I have been praying every night for you and us – and I hope you have too.   But, do I have an answer that would keep us together, absolutely not.  But I know God would support us to be strong if there was a way.

I truly believe this because of what my mother had told me the other night, that my dad and her went through a similar time in their early 30s.   My dad had been working long hours, my mom was struggling to stay happy because of how stressed he was when he was home, and she got to a point one day and just up and left.   She went to Kim house and stayed – but the conversation they had changed things.  Kim told my mom – life has its ups and downs, but don’t forget the person you originally married.  You said your vows that this was through thick and thin, and even though things are tough now – you will get through it.  “You aren’t the type to get a divorce”, even though it may seem like the best and easiest route to happiness, in the long run you will regret it.  My mom told me after this – that she looks back at that day occasionally and realizes how lucky she was to have a friend that told her that – because she knows she’d regret every day if she had actually left my father.   God had a plan for them and kept her strong to make it through those tough times and come out better.

I know you are very set on your decision at this point and I get that. You see this as the only route to happiness – and I get that.  However I know at some point you didn't feel this way in the past and I hope you’re not making this decision just because you think its too hard to overcome as a couple. With that said you know I would fight (not literally) every day to make sure that we were able to stay together, and more importantly that YOU were happy.  You know I've already moved forward with things you were concerned with. And I intend to continue to improve myself whether it is for you or otherwise.  I’m not saying this to convince you or otherwise, but I want you to know I want you to be happy, with me or otherwise.  But, I would do what it takes for it to be an US again. I just wish you would wake up one day and see what I see, and remember what we had together that is worth saving.

That said - I’m just really worried that the trauma of losing the baby and post-mortem depression is driving a portion of this.  I know you disagree, but it is apparent to me and others losing the baby changed you very clearly.   And my support wasn’t strong enough to prevent you from feeling like you weren’t happy.  Do know, even if you don’t think it – realize having a miscarriage causes very clear changes in how people think after the fact.  I just hate the feeling that you feel it was a distraction – when I saw that it was actually the wakeup call that was in the process of bettering US as a couple.  It made me realize the things I needed to work on – and I did start working on them at the beginning of the year.   I also think it started to improve how you were as my partner in our marriage, communicating with me when you were concerned about things, voicing your opinion about things, or even simply just working together on picking out things for the baby room.  Could things have gone better, yes – but I don’t see it as being a distraction, instead it was laying the ground work for us to be a better couple, we just didn’t have the time to finish working on it.

With that said my biggest regret in all along is how I did not go with you to your D&amp;C.  My heart literally breaks every single time I think about that.  The fact that you woke up crying afterwards and I wasn’t there breaks my heart.  I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you.  I should have known better. I should have been better.

Especially since – even though it isn’t completely comparable, but knowing what it was like when we lost Lexus almost two years ago – unfortunately I had never seen you as sad as those days.  The feeling of that loss sure can’t compare to losing a baby – but I saw the same look and feelings in you as I have recently. And I can only imagine what you went through at the doctor.

 The difference here though – is we were able to work through those feelings of loss and sadness together when it came to Lexus.  We did do a better job of supporting each other those days.  We also through ourselves into making sure Ralley was happy and you showed the best side of yourself there with how caring and loving you were to him so that he didn’t get sad. But, at the end of the day we were able to work through it – unlike I don’t think we ever really worked through the loss of the pregnancy.  In that I very much regret.

To be honest, I know I can’t take back all of the hurt or things that made you unhappy, even though I wish I could.   But I know I can do better and be better.   Sometimes it takes a wake up call to realize all of the things you’re doing that are wrong in life – and realize the need to re-evaluate ‘you’.   This has done that to me, do know that – I’m not the same person anymore, nor will I let myself continue as the old me anymore.

So what’s next, I have no idea. But I know there is nothing I can say or do that will change your path, unless you decide for yourself.  All I can say is I’m here for you – ready to do what is needed to make everything work if you’ll let me.   I’m not oblivious to the fact that the likelihood that you’d ever come back to me is less than even zero at this point.   Nor, am I oblivious to the fact that it will be hard work – but when you believe in US like I do, its worth the effort.   And honestly speaking – there is no other girl in the world that is worth the effort.  Yes, that seems narrow sighted – but there is a reason I stayed with you for 11 years, and that was because I could see us together for 50,60, ++++++ years if god allowed us to.   You are the person I dreamt would be be the mother of my kids, and the person I grew old with, my partner through thick and thin, in sickness and in heath, til death do us part. 

Just know I will forever cherish the 11 years we were together, because you have been the one constant in my life for so long.  In fact – longer than any other person in my life besides my family.   I will love you always and miss you dearly if this is to go through as it is now.  There is one thing though, there is nothing that could happen that would convince my heart to stop loving you. 

With that said, it is still up to you how this goes and how we proceed and I will leave it at that.

Always and Forever"

I've noticed many wg-gesucht tenants are looking for renters who are of a certain age range (25-40 or even 22+), which doesn't exactly play in my favor (I'm 21). My internship adviser and I also applied for the university system housing but it seems there are no more rooms available at this time. I realize this is a really specific window, but does anyone have any advice at this point? 

I've combed wg-gesucht results for the following regions: Bilk, Unterbilk, Flingern-nord, Wersten, Pempelfort... any other suggestions?

All answers appreciated!"

Okay so here's the story: I started as a Computer Science major in the engineering college at my university. I am required to take up to Cal 2 and discrete math, but this field isn't driving me to use my skills and talents. I'm not bad at math at all, Calc 2 is just damned near impossible for me, everything else I can do. I am going to change to a more business discipline and had to do a project for Cal 2 about the crash in 2008, which interested me into maybe going into Quant Finance instead of Management Information Systems. 

A little more info: Doing Quant Finance would net me a double major in Math and Finance and probably a triple minor in French, Chinese, and Economics. Would my language skills be useful if I were to go into finance? I know there's tons of opportunities for internships in Shanghai for American students. My school focuses more on mathematics than CS for Quant Finance, but I can code in C and C++ (not my strength) and a bit of Java. And I'm better at math than the average student (though sometimes I feel like I'm not as smart as the ECE's and Aerospace Eng's in my classes, but oh well). 

I guess my question is: what are the job prospects for Quant Finance majors? What would be some good reading material or online courses I could do to familiarize myself with the subject? Any words against or for? Or just any words of advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

So this is my situation:

Had 2 rounds of interviewing with Arista Networks and the first interview went okay, and the second interview was probably the best interview that I've had so far. I got along really well with both interviewers, and I was able to confidently solve the problems that they gave me. I even got them to mention that I had the best knowledge of C++ among all the candidates they've interviewed so far. At this point, they said they were interested in making an offer and wanted some of my references. I've done really well at my past internships, had great relationships with my bosses, so I'm confident my references would put in a good word. 

Then today I received an email saying my references were fine, but that they made an ""uncommon last step"" and reviewed their data and decided I wasn't a good fit. I am extremely disappointed and surprised with the outcome. I suspect that they made this decision because they reviewed my transcript and didn't like my 2.9 GPA. But it seems unfair to me especially since I did really well in their interviews, resonated with their values, and showed great thought process/problem solving skills. 

I feel like inquiring more about their decision and even try to convince them otherwise, but I think it will be futile. This honestly feels like a gut punch. Should I still try to convince them otherwise? Has this happened to anyone else? What should I do?"

Could somebody help me to build a system (this is my first time building a pc, most of the time I'd always use a laptop). I might like to enjoy VR gaming later at some point. Should I wait til July 4th to get even more cheaper prices, considering I’m quite busy at this time?

Anyway, here are all the available parts in their store:

4eyycl,3,2016-04-15,"Ruined my academic career, what should I be doing next?",cluttermind,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4eyycl/ruined_my_academic_career_what_should_i_be_doing/,"tl;dr: Long story short, I've messed up my academic career, and I am looking for advice on what kind of options I may still have, and what I should be doing next.

**How I messed up (some context)**

I was a good student in high school, and managed to get into one of the top 5 schools in Canada, a school that consistently places at least within the top 100 in the world each year. Going into university, I had plans of becoming a doctor, but by the end of first year I realized I didn't want to become a doctor, and wanted to pursue a degree in astrophysics instead (I wasn't too sure where that would take me, but I did want to pursue graduate studies and eventually become a researcher).

In my first year, my grades dropped significantly compared to high school, from being an A average to a C average. Despite that, I still wanted to pursue a degree in physics. Unfortunately, my grades weren't high enough to get into the honours astrophysics program for second year (at my school you start in general science, then specialize), but I was still able to get in a 3-year bachelors program in physical sciences instead, and shadow the honours physics program until my marks potentially improved enough for me to switch in. My marks never improved, and dropped even further, to where I'm sitting at around a C- to D+ grade (I've also failed a few courses along the way and have retaken them).

Basically, all of my hopes of pursuing graduate studies and becoming a researcher are gone, and I'm going to graduate with a 3-year bachelors degree in physical sciences. I have no idea what to do now.

**What I have to work with**

I was fairly active throughout university in terms of extracurricular activities, being president of a few clubs, tutoring at a physics help centre, teaching guitar, and a few other volunteering gigs. The most significant thing that I have to show was that I was a volunteer intern at a technology transfer office (doing prior art evaluations for potential patents) for almost a year, and I do have a good connection with the business development manager there, as well as a reference letter. In addition, I got into computer programming sometime around second year after taking a scientific computing course, and have worked on it a lot on the side, building physics simulations and some basic apps and programs.

**What I'm thinking right now/looking for**

As of now, the only option I see is trying to find a science-related entry level job. I don`t know how realistic this is, but I do want to further pursue computer programming, and eventually get a job doing that. Are there any other potential options that I may have with regards to education?

I will be graduating in a few months, and am not sure what to do next.

Thank you very much"
4eyyo1,0,2016-04-15,"My first job title was too senior for my experience, what should I do?",blank_this,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4eyyo1/my_first_job_title_was_too_senior_for_my/,"My first dev job while still in school was a several month project to get a student management system + database up and running at a small private school. I was at the school as an ESL instructor, my first career, and since I was in the process of getting a BS CS at the time, I was able to take on the project. Aside from the networking guy that set up the school's wifi, I was the only tech person there, and my boss told me that my title would be ""Database Administrator."" The title does pretty much fit what I did: designed/normalized the database, implemented it, managed it, monitored/backup up the database, etc. I also developed the backend php and frontend html/css for the student management system and got the interface on the school's server, which is outside of the DBA scope.

So here's my problem: I'm in the process of finding internships or part time dev jobs while I finish the last year of my BS CS degree, and I'm worried that having a title like ""Database Administrator"" would make hiring people think I'm inflating my title, which could cost me offers. To compound the problem, I can't use my boss as a reference to back up my claim because the school is closing due to enrollment and management issues, and I was also a whistleblower about some labor and accreditation problems happening at the school. 

Here are the choices I'm considering for interviews/applications:

- keep the title as is

- adjust the title (php developer, database designer, junior database administrator, etc)

In either case, I'll be clear about what I did and what my duties were. I also have the repo and database backups, so I plan on redacting everything personally identifiable and making the repo public as part of my portfolio after I do a fair amount of refactoring and rewriting to make the code nicer.

I'm most likely failing all of my classes. I didn't go to a single class this week, which is a new all-time low. In one of those classes, I was supposed to give a presentation which contributes to a large chunk of my grade, but I just couldn't finish it. I've also missed very important assignments in my other classes. I've just been at a school I hate for so long, that I've finally reached the point where I can't do it anymore. I didn't sign up for housing or my classes next semester, even though the deadlines for both have already passed. Due to my depression and anxiety, I have literally no friends on campus, and I also have very few interests. For two years, I tried as hard as I could to make friends, but after being rejected so many times, I just had to give up. The only good thing about my life is that I still have a couple friends from my hometown who I get together with every now and then. I'm visiting them this weekend, so while I'm happy to finally spend time with people again, I'm also VERY anxious about meeting new people, going to parties, and attempting to socialize like a normal human during my visit, which I haven't done in a long time. I'm contemplating telling one of my friends about my terrible situation, because I really need support, but I'm not sure if I should. When I return from this much-needed visit, I want to call my parents and tell them what's going on, because they have no idea. I'm just so afraid that they won't understand. They don't know that I'm depressed or anxious (I'm self-diagnosed, which sounds bad, but I have practically every symptom). They will be extremely upset about wasting their money towards an education that I've single-handedly thrown out the window. But I didn't want it to be like this either. I wish I could still care about academics. I wish I was motivated and genuinely interested in something. But I'm not. They really want me to be applying for jobs and internships for this summer, but I feel extremely under qualified, uninterested, and unmotivated. With my current mental state, I don't think I could survive in the ""real world"". So basically I just don't know what to do. I'm either going to have to drop out of school, or fail every class. And I have no idea of how to tell my parents this. I feel guilty for even seeing my friends this weekend instead of trying to do homework, but I'm so far behind in my work anyway, and so tired of complete loneliness that I couldn't say no when they offered to make plans. I'm so scared though. I can keep avoiding these problems, but at some point within the next month it's bound to blow up in my face. I'm so scared of being seen as a failure or disappointment, but I fucked up too badly at this point. I have no idea what else I can do. It sounds cliche, but I feel like I'm drowning. That's the only way I can describe it. "

My converted GPA is a little above 3.4 though, because of different grading standards in my undergrad country

During my undergrad I came to an exchange program in the US for a year and I took mostly advanced (senior/graduate) Computer Science courses. On my second semester I ended up failing one core course though, because I had to leave school before finals week. My exchange year GPA still ended up as 3.2 because I got mostly A's on the other classes.

Nowadays I'm working at a big American tech company (I did an internship in the US and they offered me a full time position) and I'm thinking about applying for a Computer Science Masters program around next year. I wonder how bad will that F be in my application if I want to get in a top 20 or so school. I took the GRE already to see how well I would do and my grades were not bad (170Q/160V). I would have really good LORs (including current CS department head of my undergrad university) and I have good professional experience, but since I saw that I need to submit all post secondary transcripts to grad applications my confidence ended up going down a lot. 

Do you think I should do something to compensate for that F grade, such as retaking the course in another university as a non degree student, or do I have a shot at my MS objectives in my current situation?"

He has what he needs to do his job so I have no reason to install anything on his computer.

4f0085,267,2016-04-15,My godfather finally got to fuck me [m/f] - part one,Wetandlonelyxxx,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4f0085/my_godfather_finally_got_to_fuck_me_mf_part_one/,"This is a story about the first time I fucked my dad's best friend and my godfather. Let's call him Mr West (not his real name).

As you can probably tell from my last post I have a thing for older men … or they have a thing for me :-)

I've known Mr West my whole life. He's a big shot creative director in the ad world. I've grown up going to his house, playing with his kids. He and his wife are pretty hip, I always thought of them as being super glamorous. Their house has an incredible view of the water and always looked photo-ready for a fashion spread.

As I got older and entered my teens, our relationship changed, of course, and Mr West became more like a friend. I was having issues with my parents, so I used to come over and talk to him about it.

After I graduated from school Mr West asked if wanted to do an internship at his agency. I was going to study graphic design in college so it made sense.

I guess it was while I was doing the internship that I noticed … uh … vibes? He was always super attentive to me. He's a really busy guy, right? But every day he found time for me, asking me to come into the office to chat, or asking me out to lunch.

A few times I caught him looking at me. Definitely not a fatherly look, either.

One day I wore a particularly sheer top with a very short black miniskirt and his eyes widened where he saw me. He could barely speak at first.

I guess we always usually hung out at his house with his family or my family, but now that it was just him and I in this more adult environment he started to act differently.

That said I still wasn't sure if it was all in my imagination. I mean this is Mr West. I've known him since I was a kid! How was it possible he was into me? The thought sent thrills right down to to the tips of my toes.

After about three months in he asks if I want to come to fly with him and the rest of the team to Chicago for a pitch. It's pretty much unheard of for an intern to come for an interstate pitch, but he babbles away about how it would be a good experience for me etc etc I think he was trying to convince himself more than anything!

I was incredibly excited about going.

Even more excited when I reach the airport and we all gather to check-in etc and it is just obvious by the way he looks at me what he wants to do to me.

As we are all walking towards the gate he sidles up next to me. He begins to walk a little slower so we drop behind the rest of the group and he briefly touches my lower back.

""You excited?"" he asks.

My whole body feels alight just by this one, brief touch. Excited didn't begin to explain how I feel so I just nod.

""Good,"" he says and murmurs softly, ""Well you look beautiful.""

When we arrive in Chicago the team does the pitch. I am so turned on watching Mr West do his thing. He has the client eating out of his palm. He's handsome, cool and incredibly good at what he does. 

In the afternoon we all go to our hotel rooms to freshen up before the afternoon meeting and a big night of dinner and drinking with the client that night.

I am feeling incredibly horny, like I am on drugs, and decide to have a shower. It is this amazing sensation lathering up the soap and spreading it all over my breasts and in between my legs.

Then I hear the door knock, sort of quiet but insistent.

I turn the shower tap off and wrap a towel around myself. When I look through the spyglass who should I see but Mr West. The sight of him almost makes my heart stop beating, but I compose myself and open the door.

He is almost slack jawed at the sight of me just in a towel but manages to mumble that he wants to have a quick chat with me.

I let him in and ask if I should change first.

He shakes his head and says he won't be long. ""Strange to think I've given you a bath when you were a kid.""

It's a strange thing to say and I think he knows it so I laugh, nervously. I am almost certain we are both thinking about the fact that he'd love to give me a bath right now!

We sit on the beds opposite one another. We warere both feeling so self-conscious – which is really strange for two people who've known each other for 18 years. I feel light as air, like if he reached out to me I'd turn into a puff of smoke.

He doesn't say anything immediately. There is drops of water dripping from my hair onto the bed.

""Did you have fun today?"" he finally asks.

""It was amazing, to see you work."" I feel so flustered I barely know what I was saying.

""Am I giving you enough to do?"" he asks.

""Yes, I mean, well, I'd be happy to do more. I'd be happy to do whatever you wanted.""

""That's a dangerous thing to say"". He says it almost under his breath but there is nowhere to hide in there.

I keep my voice as steady as I can. ""What would you like me to do for you now?"" 

At first he has this shocked look on his face. I guess it's the first time I've really given him permission. And then he gives me this monstrous look of naked lust.

""Whatever I want?""

I nod, without taking my eyes off him. I can't believe we're about to do this. My godfather. My dad's best friend. The man that when I was a kid used to buy me the absolute best birthday presents and who used to let me stay over and when his wife and kids had gone to bed we'd stay up till midnight eating icecream and talking about music and books and he'd give me advice about my fucked up parents.

""I want you to drop that towel,"" he says.

I look down at my chest, still dripping with water, and trembling slowly undo the knot of the towel. My breasts feels heavy and round.

He drinks the sight of them in. I swear a fire alarm could go off now and he wouldn't leave.

I notice the bulge growing in his pants and he shifts uncomfortably. ""Put your finger in your mouth and then touch your nipple.""

So I do. 

He swallows hungrily and rubs the stubble on his face, never once taking his eyes off me. He takes his T-shirt off and his pants. He's in his late 40s but still has this wonderfully fit physique, with power in every sinew and muscle. The thought, ""I've never seen his cock before"" hits like a bolt through my mind.

It is long and thick and growing harder by the minute. I can't believe the sight of me is making that happen.

He notices that I am looking at it. He puts his hand around it and pumps it a couple of times.

""You can't imagine how long I've been wanting to do this.""

I bite my lip. ""Since I started my internship?""

He shakes his head. ""Earlier. Too early.""

He comes over to me. Everything about him is turning me on. The way he is directing me. His hulking figure. His hard as fuck cock. 

He gently pulls the towel away from me and breathes deeply at the sight of my naked body.

""I watched you grow into this beautiful young woman."" He gently pushes my shoulders down so that I was lying flat and strokes with his fingers the rest of my body: over my breasts, my stomach and my legs.

He continues: ""Do you know how many times you've come over, and all I've wanted to do was sweep you up, take you to my bedroom and have make love to you all afternoon?""

I am kind of shocked. I had no idea he's been lusting after me so long.

""I don't think Mrs West would have liked that too much.""

He smiles, cheekily as he kneels on the floor. ""No, I guess she wouldn't have.""

He pries open my legs and grabs onto my ass, burying his face into my pussy.

Immediately I begin to moan as he licks and sucks me. I can feel that stubble on his chin grazing me softly.

I arch my back in pleasure and cry out and widen my legs. I am grabbing fistfuls of sheets. 

I try to move away because I can't handle how good it feels. But he won't let me. He grabs my waist and pulls me back, sticking his tongue back in.

It feels so fucking good. I am being so noisy but I don't care. 

I keep thinking ""I can't believe my father's best friend has his tongue in my pussy"" and it just turns me on even more.

Suddenly the door knocks. I don't know if I can handle any more surprises – but it is just Mr West's PA reminding me it was time for the pre-dinner meeting.

Even then Mr West doesn't stop his ""harassment"" and I have to bury my face in a pillow and just try and yell a normal ""OK!"" between moans.

But she won't leave us alone. ""Are you OK in there?"" she asks.

Mr West finally stops what he is doing and looks annoyed. ""You'd better answer her,"" he whispers.

I nod and wrap the towel around me again. He goes into the bathroom to hide.

I open the door. ""Sorry I was just having a shower. It's at 5.30pm right?""

She nods. I wonder if she can smell the sex on me! ""I'm not sure where Mr West is. I've knocked on his door but no answer. You haven't seen him have you?""

I have to stop myself from laughing and shake my head.

She finally finally goes away!

I open the bathroom door and gingerly look inside. Mr West comes out, still stark naked, and cups my face in his hand. He pries open my mouth with his thumb and I suck on it.

""You don't know how many times I've dreamed about this mouth,"" he murmurs.

He slides his hand around my waist and brings me close to him. I feel his cock swelling again between my legs.

He sighs. ""All I want to do is fuck you all afternoon but I really have to go to that meeting.""

""At least let me …"" I stop, embarrassed.

He laughs and grabs my chin, tilting my face up so I'm looking into his eyes. 

He can see I can't bring myself to say it. So he decides to help me. ""You said whatever I want, right?""

I nod.

""Well you've got me all hot and bothered and I really want you to put your mouth around my cock.""

I sit on the bed so that I'm eye-to-eye with his cock. He strokes my hair and grabs it in a bunch so that he can see my face. He wants to watch his cock going into my mouth.

I open my mouth and let his big beast enter me. He lets out a soft moan almost immediately.

I make my mouth as soft as possible and suck on it. He starts moaning even louder and closes his eyes.

I can feel it getting harder and harder in my mouth. I put my hands around his ass and try and open my jaw wider so that it can go deeper down my throat.

He's groaning now and thrusting faster into my mouth. ""Oh fuck,"" he says and then cries out my name.

I can barely breathe there's so much cock pumping away in my mouth. But I don't stop. I grab his ass even tighter and keep everything in my mouth tight and wet and warm around him. 

His cock is rock hard and I can feel he's about to blow.

In one big thrust he fucks me and releases his cum and cries out.

I go to the bathroom to spit it out and rinse my mouth.

When I come back out I feel shy and strange. I know nothing will be the same between my godfather and I again.

He kisses me hard and long on the mouth. He grabs a strand of my long, silky hair. ""You're mine, you understand?""

I nod as his hand slips around my waist and draws me close. He strokes my ass. ""The last few years have been torture, waiting until you turned 18 so I could do this. And I wasn't sure if you'd even want to.""
 
He nuzzles his face into my neck. ""And now you're finally mine.""

He dresses and just before he leaves says to me with a smile, ""things might get a little crazy tonight - the clients always take us for the wildest evenings"".

I grin. ""I'm up for anything.""

He laughs. ""And we're not to tell Mrs West about any of this.""

""Mm, because I was just about to call her and say, 'I just had your husband's cock in my mouth and he couldn't really get enough of me'.""

He slaps my still naked ass. ""And I'll call your dad and say, 'I just spent the last hour making your daughter's pussy wet and sticky'.""

We both laugh at the total ridiculousness but that lustful look never really leaves his face.

""Oh fuck, I can't wait to have you on top riding me,"" he says, huskily.

I smile and gently push him out the door before he starts up again. ""You'd better go or you'll be late.""

""Don't forget, you're all mine honey,"" he says as the door shuts."
4f03x2,1,2016-04-15,"Laid off, opportunity to start in real estate",howl,RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/4f03x2/laid_off_opportunity_to_start_in_real_estate/,"I was recently laid off with several months severance.  I consider this a god-send, as I have been itching to get into real estate investing.

My ultimate goal would be to become an apartment building investor.  How can I best spend these next 3-4 months to wisely go 100% into this, learn as much as possible, and determine in about 6 months whether this is for me, or if I should go back to the corporate world?

I have a real estate license, and about ~$50K to invest (above and beyond the personal expenses I would need over the next 6 months).  I know there are many options:  

*I could try my hand at being a real estate agent.  

*I could rehab a property.

*I could work as an intern somewhere.


I'm just not sure what the best path is into apartment building investments.  I've read that the best thing is to go directly into it, meaning that buying single family homes, or even multi-family homes and commercial property doesn't help as much as really getting into apartment building investing.

I have the entrepreneurial spirit, lots of corporate skills (communication/presentations, leading teams, financial analysis, managing large projects, I've worked on Private Placement Memorandums), and I'm willing to work extremely hard -- but I just need to know what to focus my time and energy on.  I'm confident I could put together the analysis and presentation package for investors -- but I would a couple pointers along the way, and perhaps some referrals to build an excellent team that's done this many times before.  I may be able to put together everything, but I think in the end, savvy investors want to see a successful track record.

I would love a mentor, but I need to know what value I can provide him as well.  I think I have a lot of skills and some money to invest, I just need to develop that type of a relationship with someone who's done what I want to do.

TL;DR:  Have ~3-4 months where I can try out real estate investing -- how can I best use my time?"

4f06vh,31,2016-04-15,Hey my trucking family. . I need some advice.,amazonallie,Trucking,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trucking/comments/4f06vh/hey_my_trucking_family_i_need_some_advice/,"So yes.. I am a female driver.   I need some advice and help.

I started my career as a solo driver.  I was single.  2 months in I met a man.  At 6 months I started driving team with him.  And we drove together for almost 2 years.

We broke up in January.  And yesterday I rescued a truck for a local company as a favor.

It went fine even though it was flatbed and I hadn't done it since my internship.

BUT.. and here is where I need advice.  Every exit, every truck stop, every stretch of road. . The memories were overwhelming.  I cried.  Several times.  And then I cried the 4 hours back home and I have been crying for the last day.

I want to hang up my keys because I am covered every inch of highway in Canada and 3/4 of the US with him.

I don't want him back.. he hit me.  But the good memories are so painful.  

Has anyone gone through this before?  Have you ever been able to go back to work?  Does it get easier emotionally? 

I would really appreciate some insight into this.  

Thanks guys and gals."
4f07w4,5,2016-04-15,Desperately need some college advising for CS and don't have anybody to turn to,wantingmore123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4f07w4/desperately_need_some_college_advising_for_cs_and/,"I don't know what to do. I made so many mistakes in my college career path and I'm only a freshman. Basically I'm currently a freshman at FIU and I'm insecure the university will set me up with an internship/job during my studies. Any internships available seem to be with these small wishes-washy local Miami companies that nobody has ever heard of. This page basically consists of all career options available for CS students: http://www.cis.fiu.edu/careerpath/

This is one major reason I want to transfer out of FIU. I have other reasons for leaving this school too (hate Miami culture and traffic, don't like the excessive focus on Hispanic culture among campus, dislike the ""commuter"" vibe at FIU since everyone goes to class and goes home, lack of student life, etc etc)

But I messed up on all my classes since I originally majored in business. Now I have a crap load of excess credits for a computer science degree and I'll most probably hit the 132 credit surcharge that the state of Florida imposed on all students

These are the classes I've been taking this past fall and spring



Fall 2015:

MAC 1105 (College Algebra)-not required for computer science WASTE OF A CLASS

SPC 2608 (Public Speaking)-satisfies humanities requirement

CGS 2100 (Intro to Excel)- not required for computer science WASTE OF A CLASS

SLS 1501 (First Year Experience)- satisfies university core curriculum

BSC 2023 and 2023L (Human Biology and lab)- satisfies university natural science group 2



Spring 2016:

CHM 2032 and 2032L (Chemistry and Society and lab)- satisfies university natural 
science group 1 but NOT the chemisty class required for CS majors! So I basically have to take chemistry again, this time CHM 2045 and 2045L

GEB 2011 (Intro to Business)- WASTE OF A CLASS, not required for computer science

ECO 2013 (Microeconomics)- satisfies university social science group 1

MAC 1140 (Precalculus)- WASTE OF A CLASS

So let's assume I decide to stay in FIU and finish my degree. According to their major track I am SIXTEEN credits behind schedule due to all the useless classes I've taken (GEB 2011, CHM 1032, CHM 1032L, MAC 1105, MAC 1140, CGS 2100). This is all assuming I stay at FIU which I mentioned before has several issues such as insecurity of job offers after graduation (I do not want to stay in south Florida for a job) and so on.

Now let's say I transfer to FSU/UF. This makes it even worse because I have no idea what credits FSU or UF would take from my FIU transcript. Their university core classes seem to be extremely different than that of FIU and I feel like more of my classes would just be a waste towards my degree. 

For reference here's both UF and FSU's CS tracks:

FSU: http://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/Maps/MapBScompsci.html

UF:https://www.cise.ufl.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/CSETrackingSheetfeb2013.pdf

I'm really anxious right now. I don't know what they'll take. I don't have anyone to advise me on this. Obviously my FIU advisers can only advise me based upon finishing my degree at FIU. 

Please I'm begging you, give me some insight on this. Is it worth it to stay at FIU for the sheer simplicity of already being indoctrinated in their degree requirements? And if I do stay, will I have any luck in finding a job outside of south Florida? 

Or should I make the jump to UF/FSU where the career options are much more lucrative in terms of computer science?"

My issue is, I can't figure out what ""keywords"" to search to actually find internship opportunities for my major.

So the dream started off with me in a male only farm. I was among other males eating humus on a field. We were cattle and the useless men were killed off. There was this really tall red headed ginger cunt with awesome tits and an hourglass figure, but she was horrible. She would insult every male, kicked you in the balls when you least expected it, and was racist and secist as hell. Nobody was safe, not even her female underlings! I saw her sexually harrasing some big butt barely legal intern one time as I was stuffing my face with humus. At one point she rounded up all the males and was herding us behind some small shed. She verbally destroyed some Tom Hardy looking white guy with a big dick and dragged him behind the shed. Suddenly the shed became see through, and we could all see her rip off his dick, and fuck him with it. Then I was suddenly teleported to some trippy Disney land amusement park, it was more pleasant, but men could only go if they were accompanied by a woman. So all the men stood outside the amusement park waiting to be picked. A hot black girl that looked like Zoë Kravitz had her eyes on me. Then a girl that looked like Cara Delevigne grabbed me. They proceed to fight over me. I get hard for the erection test, which was weird because i knew whoever won would ask me to get hard for them before she would take me to the amusement park. Then out of nowhere a fat redneck looking hamplanet fucking bulldozes through the forming crowd. She takes a hammer and bashes the girls fighting over me and pulls on my dick and leads me into the amusement park. Then I teleport to a museum setting. I'm in a glass box and in front of me are a bunch of cute Japanese schoolgirls giggling. I'm naked, erect, and had some sort of upperbody Knight armor, covered in big ass dildos. Dildo armor. I cant move, but when i use my full strength i take off the armor and use it to break the glass and start running. It feels like some fucking weird rave type, Hentai, super sexualized version of the Museum of Natural History. I felt hopeless and horny the whole time I was running, and my vision was getting darker, until everything went black. I hear giggles all around me, moans, wet squishing, pussy farts as dicks penetrated pussies, and the repeated smacks of flesh as the fronts of thighs smacked against the backs of thighs. I also start hearing violent growls. Instantly i know they were pissed off dogs. Everything is echoing, and I hear it behind me, its very far away, but it's gaining on me. I sprint and hit a wall. I start clawing on it, and feel a bunch of fit women surround me and rub me, the smell of vanilla and roses fill my nose. My dick is getting harder, but the harder it gets, a dagger is pressed harder against the area between my balls and asshole, and my armpits. I feel a tounge licking my ear, all the while the fucking dog is closing in. Suddenly the wall breaks, I fall through for what seems like ages, and I land with a hard thud. Sight comes back, and it looks like I'm in some sort of gift shop. I stand up and I'm dressed like James bond. I have memory of what has happened to me in the farm, amusement park, and museum. Im confused and stumbling, then bump into a woman by accident as I'm calming myself down. She drops some post cards, and I don't help her. She stands up and it's motherfucking Wonder Woman. I'm afraid after having to deal with all these cunts, and I prepare myself for the worst. She just looks at me with these kind eyes and smiles, and I trust her. She says she knows everything, and that I needed a long vacation, and that I could tag along to Themyscira. She makes a joke that it's just like the the amusement park from my experience, but fun and not a fucking shit show. She kisses me and sings some song in Greek with a ukelele, she then says Game of Thrones is coming on soon so we should get going. I pickup some Themysciran pizza and we laugh happily and then I wake up. Really fucking weird. I like Wonder Woman a whole lot more now. "
4f0hmn,2,2016-04-16,Not for the faint of heart,CluelessIndividualA,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/4f0hmn/not_for_the_faint_of_heart/,"I don’t know if this is going to be a rant. A plea for support. Asking for advice. Or something else. Right now, I’m just writing this post to get this off my chest and other people can comment as they please. This is going to be a long post. So if you’re faint of heart, I recommend reading other posts before trying to tackle this mammoth of a post.

First off, a little bit about me. I’m a 30 year old loner, who is a homebody all of the time. I’m not looking to change that. I like the way I am. I have a few friends that I see every couple of months or so. I get along with people at work. My biggest problem is I’m not relatable because I never go out and about. I can’t relate to other people and other people can’t relate to me. I can talk about work/school, but if the conversation isn’t about work/school, then I have nothing to contribute. I do get a little bit lonely now and then and try to look for a girlfriend, but it eventually leads me to feeling down in the dumps and wanting to be alone for the rest of my life.

This all started in August of 2015. There was this cute girl in my class and she didn’t talk to anybody. She had her headphones in before class and was the first one to leave the class when it was over (not wanting to talk to other people). I put her on a pedestal and in my warped mind, she became the perfect girl for me. She appeared to be a very boring person (like me) and did not talk to anyone (I still made the effort to talk to others, but that’s sort of like me). That’s the perfect girl for me. Anyway, the entire class was in a Facebook group, so we all had each other’s contact info. One day, I was feeling especially lonely, so I messaged her. To my great surprise, she responded. We messaged back and forth about how boring we were and eventually, a few days later, I gathered the courage to ask her out. She agreed, we went on a lunch and it went ok, not great. When I messaged her afterwards she replied that she wasn’t looking for a relationship. That hurt. A lot. I got severely depressed, but I eventually moved on. For my sake, I established a no contact rule and eventually I stopped thinking about her except for some occasional thoughts. For the rest of the calendar year, I caught her looking at me a couple of times, but I marked it off as accidental, so I did nothing.

All the students in the class went on Internships from January to March, and then classes began again in April. We hadn’t seen each other since December and had not talked to each other since September. We made lingering eye contact a couple more times the last week or so and then today happened. She came into class and we made eye contact for what must have been three seconds. That was it. I decided you only live once, and I messaged her. I said that I wanted to meet with her and ask her how her internship went. She responded back within a minute saying she was free after class. So, we went out for boba tea. I thought the conversation went great (much better than the first “date”). A couple hours after we left each other, I messaged her saying “thanks for meeting with me today and it was great to catch up with you. We should hang out again. I still haven’t seen the new Star Wars in theaters yet. I’m going to go this Sunday if you want to join me.”

Her response: “Np. I’ve never seen any of the Star Wars films, will I understand it?”
My response: “I think so, but we can see something else if you don’t want to see Star Wars.”

To which she didn’t reply. She has seen my message, but she has said nothing. I’m taking that as a subtle rejection and now I’m down in the dumps.

So, what should I do? Wait until Sunday and message her saying “I’m going to be at this theater at 1 pm if you want to join me?” Should I do nothing and hope she messages me later asking where to meet? Move on? Please don’t say to move on. It’s damn near impossible for me to find another relationship because I’m not “fun.”

4f0j62,97,2016-04-16,"Nope, Sorry Not The Helpdesk",KazuoKuroi,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4f0j62/nope_sorry_not_the_helpdesk/,"So I currently have a job at a firm where I'm the manager of a team designing a multi-faceted collection of programs, databases and scripts to replace a number of software used by the company, such as their CRM, web applications and a whole bunch of scripts, APIs and infrastructure to make it all work because their current solution is a bunch of disjointed products lacking single sign-on, unified databases and automated import/export so it costs them thousands a month in just paying for a 20-man team of tech support reps who are admittedly highly overworked. 

Why is this all important? Because an entire department mistook me and my department for the helpdesk due to poor undestanding of what the ""Development"" department actually does. 

I'm sitting at my desk, checking progress in the SVN trunk of one of my contractor's assignments, when my phone rings. 

&gt;Hello? This is KazuoKuroi. 

On the other line a woman frantically starts rambling about a problem with her login to the CRM.

&gt;Hi this is Ashley over in Billing, I can't login to the CRM and I'm really getting tired, your software sucks.

I facepalm and realize she's trying to reach the tech support department. 

&gt;Sorry Ashley, I'm not a tech support rep. I'm the manager of the Development team building the software to *replace the software you're having problems with*

She immediately gets angry, for seemingly no reason.

&gt;Yeah well the support department is not picking up! You have to help me, I've got a job to do! DO YOUR JOB YOU MORONS!

At this point I'm already annoyed, so I say,

&gt;Ashley, I don't have time to listen to you complain about a problem that's not my department's business. Call tech support, not development. 

I hang up. My phone rings again immediately. I look at the extension, its from Billing, so I unplug my phone. I look up the email of the manager of Billing, Allen. 

I go ahead and set up an email to him:

&gt;Hello Allen,
&gt;Today one of you reps called my phone, Ashley, proceeded to demand I help her with the CRM - when that's not my department or our responsibility. She should dial tech support, extension ####. I don't appreciate your staff calling me a moron when I politely tell them it isn't my duty to fix the problem.

I send, and no sooner do I hit send that one of my interns, Khalid comes in and says,

&gt;I've got a call on my desk phone from Billing, someone claiming to be looking for tech support from you for the CRM. What should I do?

I respond,

&gt;Tell them to call support, if they continue to call unplug the phone. I'm getting ahold of Billing right now. If others get called, unplug your phones until I tell you otherwise. 

I go ahead and plug my phone back in and dial Allen's extension. 

&gt;This is Allen.

&gt;Hi Allen, this is KazuoKuroi, Development manager. I need you to get your employees to stop calling us for problems with the CRM - they need to call support. 

&gt;But tech support's not picking up! We've been without the CRM for an hour now. Can you guys please help us out?

&gt;No, we know nothing of *CRM SOFTWARE* I'm sorry, we're not able to help. Tell them to stop calling immediately, your employees have no right to call us morons when we're rightly confused about why you're calling us in the first place!

&gt;Alright alright I'm sorry, we're just desperate to get back online.

I later found out in the employee lounge that the tech support department was having phone problems but were aware of the issue so they had no choice but to ignore their phones and focus on their work. "

I enjoyed system admin work more, because there's so much to learn under the hood of Unix systems. And I enjoy the feeling of being the master of my own domain, unrestrained by the project specifications - I just have to make it work and scale well. However, SDEs are seemed to be more respected in the industry, and generally they are the 'revenue-drivers'. So there's some sort of dilemma here. 

Would like to know about your guys' opinions!"

Lately these feelings have gotten worse and worse. My brother is the first person in my family to graduate from a 4 year university, my parents always like to praise and compare me to him. I've always been the nice guy as told front my friends, always looking out for my friends, the friend who listens when they need to vent or talk, smiling every day. Deep down I'm fucking miserable. My job sucks, I'm not smart, I have no confidence, I have no fucking clue on what direction my life is headed. I just have this huge sense of guilt on my family especially my parents that I'll never amount to anything. My parents are such hard workers... They're so kind. It's a shame they wasted all their time, effort, sweat, blood, and tears on someone like me... My friends are pretty great. But lately they are all doing these amazing things. Internships, camps, sports, and I'm here with no achievements whatsoever. They have all left me behind.

Lately I've been hearing these thoughts in my head... ""Kill yourself... Just do it"" ""what are you waiting for? Kill your self already"" these thoughts pop up more frequently through out the day. Sometimes it gets really intense.

I keep thinking about where my life is headed, am I going to rely on my parents forever? Will I ever get my life together? Maybe, but it's looking doubtful each day. Waking up is a pain. 

There was a time where I went to the gym everyday. I haven't gone in three weeks now. Back then I was working towards a goal, working towards something... But now I see that it doesn't matter anymore I stopped. No motivation. What was this goal I was working towards? I'm always a nervous wreck, anxiety will be the death of me. I have no special talent, I really have nothing. I'm below average. I fucking hate it, I fucking hate myself.

I've tried venting to my friends, but it always comes out wrong and I'll stutter and lose my train of thought and I just stop. I have a constant feeling that I'm being judged every second of the day. I'm sleeping less, eating less, he'll I've lost weight. Not much but I'm starting to see changes. 

I try and picture my life 30 years from now... I always see myself as a fucking homeless person on the verge of dying. No family, no loved ones, nothing. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm scared, and these thoughts are getting louder and louder. Maybe I should end it... It'll save my parents from working themselves to death for me. I fucking hate myself. "

This will be my second degree. First being an associate CIS degree. I have received an internship offer for a software engineering position at an international company for the summer which is contingient on a background check.

I unfortunately have a criminal record. Stupid decisions when I was younger. This has never effected my previous employment. I have a misdemeanor driving while ability impaired (like a minor DUI, .05 vs .08 BAC) and a petty theft misdemeanor. Both about 5 years ago.

I have always operated on the don't ask don't tell principle. meaning I dont talk about my criminal history until asked on the application or otherwise. For this position it never came up, and they gave me a verbal offer, passed me the initial paperwork, saying welcome to the team, contingient  on their BG check.

My concern is that they will rescind their offer after the background check. The BGC is due to be initiated in around two weeks. Can I request that the company HR rep accelerate the BGC and paperwork to secure the position for the summer? My concern is that I will end up having no job over the summer if they rescind the offer.

* **What?** Airport Night Run (Berlin)
* **When?** April 9, 2016
* **How far?** HM
* **Website?** http://www.berlin-laeuft.de/Airport-Night-Run-ergebnisse.html

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A |&lt;1:55 | *Yes* |
| B |PR (&lt;1:57:16) | *Yes* |

### Training
Over the past few months I have mostly been training in the cold and snow of northern Sweden. The hilly trails there were a lot different from the flat runway this race was going to be on, so I was curious how the training translated to the race. Training went well until halfway through February, when I foolishly tried to make up for not running for 4 days by running too much in the days following. This lead to a variety of small injuries, which together caused a decrease in mileage (although I still tried to run about 25 miles weekly). This also meant I didn’t run any run over 9 miles in the five weeks preceding the race. However, my tune-up 10k went quite well (sub 50), so I was confident I could PR.

### Race strategy
The race had a pacer for 1:55, so I decided to just follow him for at least the first 10 miles, and try to push the last 5k. I know 1:55 is quite a conservative goal, but given that I hadn’t done the amount of long runs I had wanted, I decided better to be conservative near the start than to burn out halfway through the start.

### Race
The race itself was held on the south runway of Berlin Schönefeld Airport. The race was a week after the Berlin Half Marathon, so I didn’t expect it to be too fast (as most of the really fast people would have ran the week before). There were about 6000 participants between the 10k and the hm. Overall everything was well organized, I was able to get all the way to the start by shuttle bus. They had a nice little area set up with food carts, tents and tables. There were more than enough toilets set up as well. 

The hm was two laps, the first lap was 11,2 km, the second was exactly the course the 10k runners ran. They started 30 minutes later, so the quicker hm runners would catch up to slower 10k runners, and vice versa. 

### Kilometers 1 to 14
So for the first 14 kilometers nothing much interesting happened. I started near the 1:55 pacer, and once we got past the first 500 meters, I was able to move in behind him and just get on his tail. I stayed in this position for the first 14 kilometers, in which we ran very consistently about 5:23 min/km. This pace felt nice and easy. Since it was ran on an airport runway, we could see all the runners in front and behind us, which was very cool. The start was at 19:00, so by the time we got to around 7k, the sun was setting, creating a nice few. At 7k there was also a checkpoint and a water stand. Now, I have two things to say about these. First of all, I don’t get why they set up a fog machine, especially right before the water stand. On the second time around, I almost ran into some people, because I literally couldn’t see more than a meter ahead. Secondly, they had way too little volunteers handing out drinks. I ended up grabbing one from the table. Lastly, the cups were quite sturdy, so I couldn’t  use the technique of pinching the top to drink neatly. 

### Kilometers 14 to 21
So, after running extremely consistently for the first 14 k, suddenly my stomach decided that it was enough. I suddenly felt extremely nauseous and very lightheaded. I wrecked my mind thinking about what could have caused this, maybe I ate something weird that day, but I couldn’t think of anything. The first few kilometers I thought it might go away, but I kept on feeling miserable. I must note that the course did look amazing, since it the sun had gone down and they turned on the lights on the runway.

At this point I had abandoned the plan of breaking away from the pacer at 10 miles, and decided to try and hang on. By the time we got to the checkpoint at km 17 I couldn’t even think about drinking water without feeling a new wave of nausea, so no water for me, just kept on running. Because of the fog machine and hectics at the water station, I lost sight of the pacer for a bit, but I knew I was ahead of him. I tried to keep up running 5:23 kilometers, motivating myself by trying to overtake the 10k walkers that we now were passing. Around km 19 the pace caught up with me again, and I tucked in behind him. At this point I felt really lightheaded and also like I could pass out. I kept on running though, because my legs were feeling fine. 

So the last 2 kilometers were really hellish for me. During running, right before I crossed the finish line I gagged a couple of times (but due to my inability to vomit, luckily nothing came out). As soon as I crossed the finish I hung over the railing for a while. Then collected my medal and thanked the pacer, who is literally the only reason I finished sub 1:55. My chip time was 1:54:32 (which let's be honest, is a beautiful time :P)

### Post-race
So, it’s currently almost a week later, and I still don’t know what was wrong. I’m pretty sure it wasn’t caused by something specific I ate on the day, because for the two days after the race I was still feeling nauseous all the time. By now I have ran a few times again, and each time feel nauseous during/after the run, although not as much as during the HM. If anybody has any idea what might cause this, I would love to know.

### What’s next?
I really want to do a marathon this year, but if I do, I want to give my best shot at a sub 4. I am looking at doing one around september/october, 22-24 weeks from now. I will spend the next few weeks recovering and building my base back up and want to give Pfitz 18/55 a try. However, I’m not committing to anything yet, because I know I’m quite injury prone and I have just started a new internship, so I’ll have to see both how my body will handle and how much time I will have. I definitely want to run another HM in the summer/early fall, because I’m confident I can go much faster, since my legs were feeling surprisingly fine after the race.

I am 37yro mom of a 13yro boy. My boyfriend of 3 years is 40 with a 5-yro.  We are both divorced and have 50/50 custody, live together, and ""trying"" to blend families.  We are in it for the long haul - at least trying.  

Here's the problem.... we have the daughter waaay more than 50%.  If I average the actual HOURS out, we have her 210 days and her biomom has her 155 days.  In three years she has taken the daughter ONE NIGHT for us. She refuses to ""give up her Fridays"" as well.  For the entire school year, we have taken his daughter every morning and after school to help her with her work schedule.  We take her to school 5 days a week, and have her after school every day of the week as well.  I have been working my schedule around to help him and to accommodate my son and my custody schedule.  Meanwhile, he has accommodated all of his ex's ""needs"" because they ""impact his daughter"".  He doesn't consider how it affects me or my son.

I am in school and he needs to work on weekends.  I told him that I need to have her pick up her daughter on Saturdays at 8 am rather than 2 pm because I am going to be starting an internship on Saturdays and my son has soccer games every Saturday.  

She declined because ""it's my only day to sleep in.""  That is an exact quote.  So we suggested that she pick up every other week on Fridays so that we can have 2 Saturday mornings.  BTW - She has ADAMANATLY refused to ""give up"" her Fridays the entire time I've been with SO because she goes to concerts, parties, etc.....

She declined.  The earliest she will pick up is 12 pm on Saturdays.    I said no. I'm done accommodating her laziness, drinking, concerts, sleepovers at boyfriends,etc.  So I refused to watch the daughter on Saturdays.  So, today, he went back to 2 pm pickup with his ex.  I am so furious.

I am so hateful towards his ex now and so angry with him for accommodating her for 3 years without consideration for me and my son that I think we are now halfway down the path of breaking up and I want to fix this.  I can't stay calm anymore and he is disengaging.  Our whole household is run by this little girl.  I get putting kids first, but seriously?  There are limits - especially with the ex.  Especially when you're blending families.  You can't favor one kid this much and neglect the other.  What am I doing wrong?"

Two of them are very dear friends of mine. I’ll call those roommates B&amp;C. But I would love some advice on roommate A and his girlfriend (who I will call A+).

**1.)**	Towards the end of finals last semester, roommate A and his girlfriend decided that they wanted a dog. The way that we were informed of this for the first time was by way of roommate A and his girlfriend informing us that me and roommates B&amp;C had approximately thirty minutes to decide because they had found a dog that they wanted to get and everything was time sensitive. I voiced my opposition to the idea, where roommates B&amp;C, despite being opposed to the idea, didn’t want to have a confrontation with them. Roommate A and A+ addressed my concerns and said that the dog would stay at her apartment unless she was over.

This was a lie.

The dog has been at his girlfriend’s apartment for about two and a half out of the twenty weeks of the year that we’ve had so far. Despite never coming into my room, the dog leaves hair all over my bathroom and bedroom floor by merely existing. Our apartment is barely big enough for the four of us to be in the same room. Add in a Labrador, who has nowhere to lie down, and we’re cramped as hell.

If the dog isn’t fulfilling his role in the living room as a crotch sniffing, walking stumbling block, roommate A keeps him locked in a kennel for approximately 8-12 hours of the day other than to bring him out to piss or whenever we’re all in the living room. Roommates B&amp;C as well as myself can’t stand the dog being in the apartment. The other two are leaving in a month and aren’t worried about it, however.


**2.)**	Roommate A’s girlfriend A+ is both toxic to himself and to everyone in our apartment. She grew up with coddling parents as an only child.  While roommate A was gone, A+ decided that she wanted to go out to a bar at one point. I was the only one around, and when I told her that I had to study for a test that was in the morning, she proceeded to become hostile and tell me that she and roommate A constantly have to bend to our will. This was said in spite of the fact that I have almost exclusively been their designated driver for any sort of drinking that I’ve been assigned to go with them upon.

A+ is over almost all of the time. Roommate A calls her a bitch and becomes livid with her on a regular basis. She shit talks about every single one of us behind our backs and puts on a smile in front of us.

Roommate A has confessed to me that he rarely ever has sex with A+ anymore, and it’s terrible having to deal with them taking their broken relationship on each other. Constantly having to walk on egg shells because either one of them is usually pissy. They’ve been together for over six years at this point, and he plans on marrying her. A year ago he was questioning whether or not she was a good fit for him, and I feel he’s giving in to habit instead of listening to his heart.


**3.)**	Roommate A is insecure. He’s portly, covered in stretch marks, and feels the need to prove that he’s not inferior to anyone consistently. He’s recently taken to the gym to try to eliminate his beer belly. This has led to several issues. He constantly watches body building documentaries and has become a total gym bro. He mocks all of our diets despite any one of us weighing a good fifty to one hundred pounds less than him.

One of his worst issues is that he’s decided to not be home for any of the day anymore. When he does, he’ll cook in the kitchen to follow a diet that he read online (which he abandons every weekend for pizza, greasy Sonic burgers, and the occasional beer.) He’ll leave his dishes out and never touch them again. He used an electric oven of mine and left the remains of his greasy chicken and vegetables for over two weeks before I gave in and finally cleaned it myself. Instead of cleaning up after himself this week, he wrote a note for himself to take out the trash on Sunday before I finally caved in and took his trash out that Wednesday.

He constantly leaves a mess in the living area and kitchen, and it seems addressing him on the issue did no good.

**4.)** The most upsetting of these issues comes with how he treats my girlfriend. I went on an internship recently in a town about two hours away and have begun a long distance relationship with a girl. I suppose I’m roommate D, so we can call her D+. A and A+ don’t like D+ because she’s more liberal than either of them would like.

Recently, roommate A decided to buy a sports car with a military scholarship that was grandfathered to him by his grandfather. Since abandoning his truck, he has consistently relied on me and my truck any time that he’s needed to have something hauled. Deep freezers, tents and tables, etc. were all my responsibility for me to lug about. I’ve probably done it for him a good ten times at this point. Roommate A sent me a message two days ago asking me if I could drive over an hour away for him to fill up some propane tanks that he had. I told him that I had plans to see D+ that day and I didn’t think that I could make time for it. He became what I can only describe as indignant, asking me “Really. There’s no way you can do it? I’m only asking for two to three hours of your time.” I told him that I could possibly help him out next time, but today I had other plans.

When I got back to my apartment with D+, A+ sat by herself and refused to make eye contact with me or acknowledge that I existed, I assume because I refused to give up a day with my girlfriend for a last minute request to change my plans to help her boyfriend out. D+ and I left shortly after. When I returned alone, A and A+ sat in the living room, both trying to ignore me, and I promptly walked to my room and went to sleep.

Roommate A is now angry at me, saying that we clearly have a problem.


      
**5.)** I’m currently signed up to live with him in the same apartment for another year, but I don’t think I can do this anymore. The tension and anxiety that I get from being in the same room with them sends my heart pounding. I’ve been trying to talk to leasing office about moving me to a different apartment next semester.

I don’t know how I could have handled this situation any better. I feel like they don’t know me. I hide myself from him all of the time. He’s extremely religious, so I hide my atheism. He believes in Reaganomics, I don’t. I thought that I could just ignore our differences and be fine with each other. But I don’t think I can anymore. I feel like we just don’t mix at all anymore. We’ve confronted each other on a few of the issues. But the dishes go uncleaned, and they still act coldly to my girlfriend. I feel like talking to him is fruitless, and I don’t know what to do.

**TL;DR**: My roommate makes me anxious and stressed out, and I don't think any amount of confrontation or mediation will make him change his ways due to his manly man attitude.

Also really very interested in all aspects of business in general and plan on getting an MBA and like big picture stuff in general. I studied abroad and am very interested in interacting with people in places all over the world.

4.	Money – I want to make a decent salary by the time I am 30, but money is not everything. Being extremely wealthy is definitely not my major goal in life, but I do want to be a decent salary in a field rich with those opportunities so I can provide the essentials for my future family.
5.	Work Life Balance – I do not mind working longer hours if it fulfills the other criteria. But obviously, the less hours and more benefits the better!
6.	Flexibility – I don't want to be stucking doing the same thing over and over again, I want something that is flexible with alot different responsibilities and tasks every day.

But instead of Finance, I am looking to either minoring in or even changing my major to Management Information Systems. Like I said based on the information, should I stick it out with Finance and maybe just learn to code on the side or looking into getting head on into IT. And also what types of internships and entry level jobs should I be aiming for.

Also my resume is pretty average. I go to a state school, 3.53 GPA, studied abroad, and involved with a few clubs, but nothing with serious leadership. Some volunteer experience. No prior internship experience though.

Right now I have two options:
$1200 sublet in Williamsburg, living with 3 other people
$800 sublet in Inwood/Washington Heights

The internship is modestly paid and I'll expect to earn about $650 a week before taxes. 

Part of me says to pick the cheaper option, as I'd save a total of $1200 in rent the entire summer, but I'm concerned that it's just too far out of the way for me to properly enjoy the city, hence the Williamsburg option.

Also, I plan to move to the city next summer after graduation, so its important that I save money now for that, but I don't expect I'll be able to save that much over the next year....

Any suggestions would be much appreciated!!!"

So this summer I will be interning at Google as an Engineering Practicum Intern (freshman/sophomore program). I know that depending on my performance, I may get a return offer for either the same position or a SWE Internship. 

However, last week I was interviewed by Microsoft for their Explore program (for next summer). I am fairly confident that I can get the job. 

 Should I get that offer, I will probably have to decide before knowing the details of my Google return offer (or perhaps even if I have one). 

A couple questions:

Should I intern as a sophomore in one of these programs? Or should I start seeking a ""real"" Software Engineering Intern position? 

Would interning at the same company twice look better on my resume than the diversity of working at both Google and Microsoft? 

Thanks!

He was a brilliant scientist, she was an awaking conscious built into a shell of a human.  She looked like a person, but they both knew that she was nothing more than wires and bolts inside.  

He had named her Alice, from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, to highlight how everything had seemed so strange for the AI.  Alice tried her best not to disappoint him, but everything seemed so alienated.  He created her as an assistant to his work, but she always seemed to mess up even the simplest of tasks.

But he showed her love and patience. 

She learned and became his friend.  He taught her how to cook from scratch.  He took her out on shopping dates to find her clothes.   And on summer evenings, he danced along the sand with her, the two of them laughing as they held each other's hands.  It was over time, she began to feel an emotion she didn't know how to explain.  She kept it to herself, knowing that emotions didn't suit a machine of just wires and bolts.

The years grew by.  He continued to age while she stayed the same.  But his love for her never ceased, and she never left his side.

""Alice,"" he brought up at one of his birthdays, ""You know you're an AI.  You're capable of so much more than me.""

""I'll be with you always,"" she smiled, ""Always, Master.""

""Please,"" he looked embarrassed, ""I told you to call me Edward.""

The man continued to walk along the path as his secretary followed behind him.  She was a young college intern who worked hard to make things work.  Perhaps he would consider hiring her after she graduated.  She seemed out of breath as she caught up to him.

""What is it, Stephanie?"" 

""Director,"" she caught her breath, ""We had just received word that Dr. Edward Greene passed away today from old age.""

""Ah yes,"" the man muttered, ""The professor with the AI 'Alice'.""

""Sir, the unit has also ceased its functions,"" Stephanie read from the file, ""At the same time of his death.""

The man stopped as a shock took over his body.  ""I-I don't understand.""

""We're looking at the research now,"" she continued, ""It seems that he has managed to implement a system of... of human emotions.""

""But it's a robot,"" the man lit a cigarette, ""Why would...""

The cigarette fell to the ground.  He had met the doctor once with his lovely wife.  She had beautiful blonde hair and a cheerful smile, but she also introduced herself as...

""Alice...""  He had never seen someone happier that day and even felt envious of their relationship.  What a fool he had been to not realize that she was just an AI.

""Sir, we can transfer her data to another unit,"" Stephanie pointed out, ""We can reactivate her so tha-""

""No.""  He stomped the unlit cigarette on the ground, ""Leave her alone.""

""But sir, the AI has so much new information that we've previous been unabl-""

""I said, leave her alone,"" the man's statement was final, ""Tell them to let her rest alongside him.""

Stephanie nodded and made her way back to the site.  The man looked up into the sky and shook his head.

""Emotions, huh Edward?"" he chuckled, ""Hope you found what you were looking for.""

He let out a sigh and wondered to himself.  The love the doctor had shown for a robot was extraordinary, more than human couples ever shared.  Was their bond forbidden simply because it was between a human and an AI?

Hundreds of miles away, she was resting next to her creator on her death bed with a smile on her face.

I currently have two options which I'm contemplating and would like some outside advice that isn't my parents. I have two choices for post secondary, the first being a more well known institute, where I'd learn Network Admin fundamentals and get some certifications. The second option would be me going to a smaller less known college which would be about a year and it would get me certifications for Cisco, Microsoft Network admin and A+ or something. They are both relatively similar in price and course load, as well as what I get out of the course from what I see. My big question is would it be more beneficial to go to the larger school, or go to the small one and use the second year to work part time, get certificates for MCSE, MCSA, Network+﻿, ITIL and Security+﻿ on top of the one year diploma? (also the one year school course will get me work experience because they make you intern at a company.)  I'm sorry for the mess of a question, I'm really just in a bind.

She's narcisstic, passive agressive, very petty, self centred etc. the usual of a narcisstic parent.


I never had my own room until I moved away to college. I even had to share a bed with my mom until I moved out even though we had an extra room, that wasn't in use, and it really wasn't fair my brother had his own room. (I feel like this is a first world problem). We are not poor, our house is rather decent sized. However, my mom will refuse to spend money on much needed maintenance, and renovation. House is molding, I've done some DIY in my time there to fix things, and bleach mold wherever I can, and crawl into the attic (it's gross) to do as much maintenance as I can as a kid. 

I've always been a good student, never had bad grades. I even had to fuck up my post-secondary school applications so that I didn't get accepted to the local schools (which were lower tier), I made sure to go somewhere very far away, and I did happen to get into an ivy league school so I'm there right now. :/ She isn't proud of me in the slightest, I'm studying Engineering at a prestigious school.


Mom has quite a bit of money (not filthy rich, but decently comfortable with money), but will always give attitude to me, as if she owns me and that I'm an object because I popped out of her vagina. The slightest thing would piss her off, and it was like walking around eggshells whenever I'm around. My dad has cancer, and my mom will still yell at him, they would still have physical fights (usually initiated from my mom). My mom hates my dad, and they don't get along. I am also not allowed to speak to my dad, or I will get my hair pulled or beat. I will usually communicate with my father via e-mail.


There's one thing that happened on my 17th birthday that really hurts every year. And it tears me apart everytime I think about it, because then I relate back and realized I've never had a good birthday, it's just the 17th one was the worst.


Roll back a-bit. On my 6th birthday my parents had a little birthday party for me. There was mini-games etc., and one of the games was bingo or something and it was with other parents as well. I didn't want to play bingo, my mom was forcing me to play bingo. (I was also fucking 6...) I started crying and said I didn't want to play bingo, and I went to another parent and told them I didn't want to play bingo and my mom was forcing me to play bingo.
- This isn't very memorable to me, but my mom would always bring this incident up and use this as an excuse to beat me
- She would say from that moment onwards she knew she had to be careful with me, because I'm not loyal, and I'm not disobedient, and I'd be ready to betray her at any moment.
- She brings this incident up at-least once every 2 weeks.


Fast forward to my teen years. At this point I've been working at a part-time job because I was tired of using mom's money, and having it held against me as she would always keep saying that everything I'm wearing, the reason why I'm breathing, and all my accomplishments are because of her. She also tells me the only reason I have friends, is because she lets me buy expensive things and that my friends are with me because she makes me look rich. Because of this, I've always made sure not to wear brand-name clothing. I did not want to seem rich, I want people to like me for who I am, not for what I appear to be. This is the disciplining I've had all my life growing up, and in a way that's how I've reacted to it.


During my high school years, I had almost no freedom. I was never allowed to hang-out with friends. If I wanted to go out I'd have to ask permission first. When I started working part-time, my mom made a lot of effort to make me quit. She didn't like that I was working so much. In reality, I worked a lot to avoid her, and be able to be self-sufficient.


In high-school, I worked about 20-30hours a week, taking night shifts and weekend shifts whenever I could. I would skip class to work sometimes, I don't know how I managed my life at this time but I did. My mom was embarrassed that I was working so hard, she would never let anyone know that I was working. Obviously I was working at a restuarant so I would run into familiar faces ocassionally. I ended up serving one of our family friends, and even my aunt (her sister). When she found out that they knew I was working she would beat me, pull on my hair, kick me out, because I made her look bad because since I was working, it meant she wasn't providing enough for me. I ended up leaving that restaurant for her wishes, and I applied to yet another serving job. I was working somewhere at this point, which was intro-d to me by a friend's mom.


I hope that's enough info to paint the picture of what my mom is like. 

16th Birthday:
This would be the first time I decided to celebrate my birthday with friends. I invited 20+ people who I thought were my friend to a nice restaurant. Only 3 people showed up, and it was embarassing because I made reservations for 15... I was also an hour late to my own party, because my mom made me go with her to a business trip to a city that was 5 hours away on a single day. (Go in the morning, and return in time for my birthday).

17th birthday:
I still cry about this. I think this is the worst birthday I've had in my life. On a typical birthday, my family (just mom, brother) would usually go out to a nice restaurant and have some cake. I had an evening shift, so the restaurant ended up being a lunch thing. 


It was my birthday on a weekend. My mom chose the restaurant: ""Spoonful"" a buffet, simply because they have free buffet for birthday with proof of ID. I did not want to go here, because I did not like buffets and I was also on a cleanse(diet). She would pull on my hair, beat me because she should get to choose. Since my birthday is  to mark the day she had to suffer birthing labor to bring me to this day, and that she had poured so much effort in making me the person that I am. I was sad, because I really did not want to go.


We get there, and in the car I realized I do not have my ID to prove my birthday (I forgot). My mom yells at me, and claims that I did it on purpose so that we do not go there. I get dragged into the restaurant with tears, and into the washroom to get beat and my hair pulled. She forces me to stop crying to stop embarassing her. My eyes are obviously watery, and it's embarrassing for me. My mom explains to the hostess (and makes me stand next to her) that it's my birthday and I forgot my ID, and if I can still count for the free buffet. 


Hostess tells us, we can pay in full now. And come back for a refund if I bring back my ID a later day. (To match the receipt day and my birthday). So we go sit down and eat. It is incredibly awkward because it's obvious I've been crying, and the fact that they knew it was my birthday.

So after lunch, we go to the supermarket. We get a cake, and go home to 'eat' it. We get home, and we had the candles on the cake just needed to light-it up. At this point, I've cheered up a bit and was trying my best to be optimistic.

I hold my cake in my hand in the kitchen, and all of a sudden my mom slaps the cake out of my hand. I'm confused, and I start crying uncontrollably again. (Thanks bro, for cleaning it up). My mom starts telling me i'm useless, all I do is betray her, and that I forgot my ID on purpose, and that today is the day of her suffering, and that me doing all of that is disrespecting her. She proceeded to beat me, and pull on my hair as usual, persistently accusing me of betraying her and doing everything possible to oppose her. 

At this point, I cannot stop crying, after everything's that happened from the beginning of the day. I look at the time, and pretend that I have to go to work soon because my shift ""started soon"". I drove to work (kind of). On the drive, I contemplated really hard killing myself that day. How I can do this, and I could not stop crying. I arrived to work almost 3 hours early, and I went to the McD's next to my work. I grabbed a McFlurry, sat in a corner and just cried uncontrollably for a really long time. 

Shortly about an hour before my shift, my friend's mom (the one who got me the job), came into the McD's to grab a bite before her shift. She sees me and is concerned. I tell her that it's my birthday, and then I just cry uncontrollably on her shoulder. She is very confused, but does her best to comfort me. I clear up my tears as best as I can before work.

I show up to work, Manager sees I'm not in shape to be serving customers (my eyes look like I've been crying). She has me work in the back to do behind the scenes kitchen work. The entire shift, I was just thinking about ways to kill myself. I felt like there was no escape, no hope and no happiness to be found. I feel like I'm the reason for many issues in my mom's life, my brother and my dad.


I am the reason my mom cannot retire. She feels she still needs to support me financially. I am the reason my dad cannot have a good relationship with my mom. I took his spot on the bed next to my mom growing up against my own will. I've never seen my parents be together happily, or on good terms without fighting. I'm the reason my mom got fat over the years. She was skinny before my birth. I am the reason why my mom's personality changed. My brother once told me mom wasn't this crazy before, and something in her had switched once I was born. I don't think I'm a product of love, and I don't think I'm loved here. I really wished I wasn't born.

Sorry if my thoughts are a bit sporadic, I'm just typing them as I remember the events.

I remember going on facebook on my phone at work, and seeing everyone else have such amazing birthdays, getting presents, lots of people showing up to their party. I just feel like utter shit, like no one gives a fuck about my birthday, which is why I'm ending up like this. I thought of jumping infront of a train that night, driving the car into a lake. Co-workers were talking about me, and looking at me weirdly since (I don't know how) but they knew it was my birthday. Everyone was a bit puzzled as to why I was crying since it was my birthday.


Then at the end of the shift, my friend's mom had gone across the street to the bakery and bought me a birthday cake. She gave it to me, and I started crying uncontrollably again. That cake literally saved my life, I think if I didn't have it, I would have killed myself that night. I don't think she realized it. I am forever grateful for this lady. it was a brownie cheesecake, it had a layer of brownie, a layer of cheesecake, with caramel layer, and covered in chocolate.  


I ate it in the car-ride while driving, and I ate the entire thing while crying (stress eatting I suppose), and debated on saving some for my mom since she ended up slapping our original cake on the floor. But since I ate it, she never knew about the cake.


My mom would not speak to me for a week, and I had to keep apologizing to her for my ""behavior"" that day. This day honestly still haunts me, and I cried a bucket while typing this up.


I feel like my 17th birthday has changed me completely. 


18th birthday:
It's a better birthday. My mom flew to asia on a business trip for a month at the time. I chose not to celebrate my birthday, and cried a lot this day.


19th birthday:
I was on an internship, away from home (about 1hr+ drive from my mom). On the 6th of my birthday, I decided not to celebrate and stayed at home. My mom drove up to my apartment on the 8th (2 days later) on the weekend. She was angry that I did not even call her on my birthday, or acknowledge it to her. Because it's the day of her 'suffering', and the day that she went in labor to bring me to this world, and that I should acknowledge and appreciate all that she has done for me, including providing for me, and raising me. She would come to my apartment without asking, and say all of that, beat me, and pull on my hair. Then leave. I had to call her everyday for a month frantically apologizing.

Is it so hard, all I want to do is not celebrate my birthday anymore. My 20th is coming soon, and I really don't want to have anything done. I don't want it to be acknowledge, I want it to be just a passing day.


I can't help but feel like a piece of shit, I wish I didn't exist sometimes. One of the things that keep me going is that I know I'm decently intelligent. I can make an impact on the world, I'm a future engineer. I can make a decent impact on society. But at the same time, I'm internally conflicted.


My mom will keep claiming that all my accomplishments are because of her. She claims she's paid for my tuition. She has not paid a single penny for my tuition. I have paid internships, which pay a lot of my tuition. I also paid for the first year on my own entirely using money I saved from working in restaurant since I was 15. I stopped asking for money in the 10th grade (because I was working) I was also tutoring younger kids math, because I was smart.


I have other events and occurences, to complain about, but this is the most deepest cut and hurtful event of them all. 


tldr: had a bad birthday because of my NMom, cannot ever celebrate birthdays again."

I REALLY want to find some kind of a project to work on (even if its small) but I can't find anything I really want to work on. Am I looking for the wrong things? Will I never be truly excited to work on something? Or does that passion just take time to develop?

I'm 18 years old and a freshman computer science student and while I understand I'm young and inexperienced, in my opinion the best time to start learning and working on things is now. My university requires five four-month internships before I can graduate, so I'll have work experience soon, but there is no other point in my life where I'll have this kind of time to really put something into action."

Most of my class work has been leaning towards systems design, with some DSP and microprocessor embedded systems design. I learned about VHDL, Xilinx, OrCAD and C processor coding.

4f662j,51,2016-04-17,"For all the people considering CPP, I'd like to share my adventures as a Civil Engineering Alumni with you.",arflol,CalPolyPomona,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPolyPomona/comments/4f662j/for_all_the_people_considering_cpp_id_like_to/,"I graduated not long ago, and I'm not sure if my experience is the same as many other alumni, but attending &amp; graduating from Cal Poly has got to be one of the smartest decisions I've ever made.

When I was in school, I had a internship but I wasn't sure if it was going to turn into a FT job or anything meaningful. Likewise, I was in a relationship that ended and left me super jaded. I decided I needed a change of scenery. As you'll discover later on, I make a ton of reactionary life changing decisions based on my relationships with women. So I applied exclusively to jobs that were NOT in Southern California, this is typically a no-no because a lot of out of state companies hate taking risks on out of state employees, and even more so with entry-level positions because moving is expensive. After much struggle, I got a job offer in Miami

&gt;( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

and I moved my shitty life out to South Florida. Miami is a crazy fucking city, and that's about all you need to know. I was working as a consultant and while I was working I realized that a lot of coworkers/subs/clients had a lot of experience with people who graduated from CPP, which makes no fucking sense because CPP is a tiny fucking campus in the furthest corner of the country. But still, I heard NOTHING but good things about our alumni that emigrated out of state. This is all good and well, but graduating from CPP had yet to do ME any favors. I was an entry level engineer getting paid an entry level salary. Anyway, so I fell in love with another girl, because that's what idiots do at that age. The thing was, she was from Dallas and she was moving back home. I don't know if you've seen Good Will Hunting where the guy is in love with the girl that moved to Standford so he drops all his shit and moves out there with her? Well yeah I kinda did that. 


&gt;MFW moving from 2nd most conservative state to the only state more conservative than that one


Anyway, I guess this is the only part that is relevant to you guys. When I first starting applying for jobs in Dallas, I was expecting Texans to throw my resume in the trash, but I was getting a decent amount of responses. Being an idiot that I was, I had already moved to Dallas, so I thought I should try and be employed as fast as possible. This was my first mistake, had I waited and entertained more applications/interviews/offers I would have been set from the get go. But I accepted a slightly above average offer and I thought I was pretty lucky to get that, WRONG. Anyway fast forward about a year or so later, the girl and I broke up and the company I was with wasn't winning enough contracts to keep me entertained, so I put my two weeks notice in and figure it's time to move on to somewhere else. As SOON as I updated my LinkedIn, the recruiters started spamming ME with messages/requests/etc. This was new to me, because I had never been in a position where I had a decently marketable amount of experience. After I left my first Dallas company, I applied to ZERO jobs but I somehow had requests for SIX interviews 

&gt;can'texplainthat.jpg

with the biggest Civil Engineering companies in the nation (AECOM, HDR, HNTB, CH2M, Kimley-Horn, Michael Baker, etc). Usually, recruiters on LinkedIn work for a 3rd party and get paid solely on commission. All of the recruiters I responded to were in-house HR talent acquisition, literally holding the door open for me to put my foot in.

The first interview I had, the first thing the interviewees talked about was Cal Poly Pomona. My first thought was, dude how the fuck do these scrubs even know what CPP is? Impossible. They go on to say how their department had hired several alumni from both SLO and CPP and that they were by far the most reliable/knowledgable and required the least amount of training to get started, regardless of the fact they were out of state. I am not joking, we were talking about Cal Poly for like 15 minutes and I was the one that had to change the subject. 

&gt;I've got shit to do bitches, let's wrap this up

The interview went really well, needless to say. I got an offer before I left the building, and it was more than a 10% raise from my last job. I was gonna accept it right then and there, because I was already making above average at my old company, but I had like 5 more interviews to go to, so it couldn't hurt to entertain a few more. I say to them, thank you I'll consider it and let you know.


Second interview. Literally first thing they talk about is Cal Poly. Jesus fuck I thought it was deja vu. Since I am retarded, I let it slip that I interviewed with a different company literally the day before and they were also very high up on my alma mater. They told me the same thing, Cal Poly alum need the least training. In my head, I'm thinking surely they don't know what the fuck they are talking about, because to me CPP will always be that cow infested little shithole of a campus whose best food is Panda Express. Whose parking situation is a joke and is impossible to register for fucking classes

&gt;Fuck BroncoDirect

 and graduate on time. Anyway, they said their office is over 200 (AECOM/URS-DFW) people and they already have a handful of Cal Poly alumni and try to recruit them if they have TxDOT experience (which is like the equivalent of CalTrans). They offer me the maximum my job title with my experience, unfortunately it's lower than the last offer I got. I'm not here to fuck around so I tell them straight up, that's not good enough fgts. Immediately starts click clacking on keyboard

&gt;let's see what we can do about that

the HR/talent acquisition lady says they will match their offer and throw in a signing bonus.

&gt;Shiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeet I LIKE MONEY

I fucking poker face that shit and sound disappointed they couldn't offer a higher salary. For those that don't know AECOM is by far the #1 largest C/E/I company in the world, and I got to be like

&gt;nah bruh


My usually rock bottom self esteem has sky rocketed to below average self esteem for a normal human being.


Third and final interview. I'm not gonna say which company I accepted the offer to, because my comment history is probably nothing but video games and marijuana posts and I'm not one to self incriminate. I was interviewed by HR and two project managers, one of whom did 90% of the talking. This fucking guy was so fucking gnarly Texan that I struggled to understand his fucking English. He was so Texan I just assumed he hated black people, voted for Ted Cruz, and shot Mexicans jumping fences on his day off. Long story short, he was a Texas A&amp;M alumni and for those of you who have never known an A&amp;M alumni they are annoyingly proud as fuck about where they come from. Anyway this post is getting long as fuck so I'll cut to it, this fucking guy SENT HIS SON TO CAL POLY SLO. I asked him why he sent him to the wrong Cal Poly and he said ""Pomona had a nice campus, but the neighborhood was too rough"". Which was fair, I'll give him that, but I count that as a fucking win. The day a super conservative Texan A&amp;M alumni sends their kid to hippy liberal Cal Poly in California is the day every Texan admitted defeated as far as I'm concerned. I only did 3 interviews and accepted this one. Straight to numbers I got a 22% bump in pay, and my signing bonus will pay for both of my vacations this year, one of which was for snowboarding in California...

&gt;California here we come, right back where we started froooooom CALIFORNIAAAAAA

**TL;DR** I feel like I owe it to the prospective freshmen who are considering CPP (I'm also going to recommend SLO, because even though they are our rivals in everything we do they are still a fucking amazing school to go to hands down; also their weed is better and their campus is amazing) over some of the lesser choices. I have friends who got into UCI/Fullerton/LongBeach and went through their CE programs and I don't know why the fuck anyone would ever do that to themselves. Don't be that fucking person. The graduates of Cal Poly (BOTH of them) have made such an incredible name for these universities that you can't truly appreciate it until you get some experience and start traveling around. You don't know it, but **WE are known out here** in the middle of fucking nowhere and **people are tripping over themselves to get US**. The number of schools that can offer you more, typically cost at least 4 times as much. If you're like me and had to take out loans (that are paid off now by the fucking way) do yourself a favor and go to Cal Poly. There is no alternative. Period."

I'm 23 (MTF) having my first appointment with my endocrinologist on the 10th of May, my therapist is gonna give me an indication for it on the 25th of April. 

So friday night I came out to my parents. So far so good, they were really supportive and I was massively relieved. I talked a lot about how I felt during the whole time, I told them about the endocrinologist and that I plan on starting HRT soon. Fast forward to the next morning, I come down for breakfast and she's crying. It really hurt seeing that an she kinda mumbled how it feels i like a loss for her. I told her i can understand and she replies ""no you don't"". That response was the first moment where I realized things weren't going in a good direction. She seemed very tense the whole day, in the eveing we had dinner with my 2 brothers who came visiting (one from abroad) so it seemed better. 

Then, this morning the same situation again. But now she's not only crying but now she's kinda angry and making me feel guilty. She accuses me of just telling them and leaving them in the dark about how this is actually going to go about. Now it is true that I dont have everything 100% planned out, I finished my bachelor in february and doing an internship till the end of July now (in an other city, so I live in that city during the week). Afterwards i planned on probably finishing my civilian service (instead of military) for 5 months and then starting my Masters somewhere next year. I initially thought of socially transitioning in late summer maybe. That said, I have a lot of question marks still, but I'm sure I want to transition as well. But the only thing she does right now is making me guilty about how in the end it's always them having to deal with everything and so on. She said if I were independent it were no problem, but that she and Dad would like to  finally ha some time to do stuff on their own and everytime there's something more coming. The thing is, there was a situation a couple of years ago where my sister wanted to go abroad to study (which she did) and this whole thing really reminds of that. Right now, literally everytime I talk to her its a fucking accusation about something. 

In her view, I was making demands to them when coming out, even though that's literally the last fucking thing i thought about on friday night. She's coming at me with all this questions about what exactly my plan is. I told her, that first I wanted to go on hormones and about my the rest, but she makes it seem like I am suppposed to have some kind of masterplan for everything right now. I was opening up to them with my biggest fear in life and all I get to feel is guilt now. I completely understand her grief and that it's difficult, but I feel so fucking bad now. My dad is really cool with it, but he's also the quite one and doesn't stand up to her. My sister is coming for holidays in June and I told them I might tell her then. Today she even accused me of that, of how I'm so selfish, she's coming for holidays  and I'm gonna tell her something like that. Btw, medical costs for transition and stuff is all covered by insurance in my country, so that shouldn't be the problem.
 
Wow, writing this I realize how fucked up this all is. I know that she's going through a process of grief now and that I shouldn't let myself dwell into that as well, but it just feels like my life has become a fucking mess now in an instant. I can't even think about transition stuff right now, it's just making me feel so bad. Sorry for the text being such a mess, but I just don't know what to do right now. I feel like the relationship with her is never gonna be the same again.."

Georgia Tech

Pros:

-High engineering ranking

-More research opportunities?

-More internship opportunities(Fortune 500 companies at Atlanta)

-More prevalent startup culture?

-Close to airport of a major city(means easier international transportation)

-More selective

Cons:

-Grade deflation?(How is this at UIUC? Is there grade deflation at UIUC too and would this affect me negatively in graduate school applications)

-Little social life?(Although I don't want to be in a fraternity, I want to go out and relax from the stress of classes. Also can somebody who got the chance to see both universities compare the social life?)

-60/40 male-female ratio

-Urban area(Higher crime risk?Does anybody know the reality about this crime rate?)

-Not as good as it is in engineering in different areas

UIUC

Pros:

-High engineering ranking

-Balanced focus on different areas

-50/50 male female ratio

-Great social life

-Less crime?

-I am interested in researching in plasma physics/electronics and I realized since physics department is bigger and better at UIUC, I believe there are more opportunities in this field at UIUC than Georgia Tech.(Is this correct if anyone has experience in this field)

Cons:

-Slightly lower in engineering than Georgia Tech in rankings

-Less selective?(I couldn't find acceptance rates for engineering at UIUC but I know it is 55% in general. However this is not a big con for me)

-Harder transportation

-Huge party/drinking scene(I am not into partying everyday although I would like to do it every now and then)

Also I absolutely don't like drinking. I heard due to stress, alcohol is a problem at Georgia Tech but since UIUC is a party school again drinking is prevalent. Can somebody illuminate me on these issues?

yesterday and today I only put it in while I was not working (I'm doing an internship at a restaurant so I have a big break inbetween work

and everything seems to be fine, I think

but I'm not sure... is it normal that you can really feel the cup? I looked in the mirror and it's not outside, but to me it feels like it's not really in there

also when I sit down and push down a little bit, I can feel the cup

I put the cup in half an hour ago and it doesn't hurt right now at all... I can feel it, but it doesn't hurt like yesterday

so am I doing anything right? I know how to put it in (I've watched the video of 'precious stars pads') but it just feels so weird

also after I took out the cup yesterday (2-3 times) it was kinda flattened... not like really flat, but it's not round anymore but looks more like a 0

I'm guessing that that's the form of my vaginal canal!?

also I wore it all night to get used to it

but I don't think I'm ready to wear it to work (although I do think that it'd help with my period pain)

4f6out,4,2016-04-17,"Me [23 M] with my GF [20 F] together 18 months, I want to break up but it's complicated and I feel helpless and alone",Clamps123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4f6out/me_23_m_with_my_gf_20_f_together_18_months_i_want/,"I've been with my GF for about 18 months and we live together, almost 4 months, in a house her parents bought and I pay half rent and bills on.

In the last month or so, while she's been away and much more when she came home for a two weeks (she's away on a 6 week internship with my older brother - another complication, yay), I've been inundated with intense desires to break up with her.

She's not a bad person in any way but she's not what I need or what I want any more. I love her, and on some level I always will, but it isn't enough.

Here are some issues I have with her:

- I don't like the way she treats her parents, especially her mum. She can be quite petulant, childish, and disrespectful to her when they are only trying to help.

- She can be incredibly ungrateful and self-centred. Last year I planned a surprise costume party for her and she ended up hating it. She's also recently told me, not in a mean way, that she has never really liked most of the gifts I have bought her for Christmas, birthday etc. 

- She can be both incredibly driven and lazy at the same time. She'll be driven with her work but lazy over stuff that requires little to no effort. I'm talking about me having to constantly get up and get the remote, a drink, food, laptop, or a blanket for her, even if she is closer to it or it's three feet away. She also expects me to constantly make her a hot water bottle when she gets cold and will never make one for herself. The reason why, and I'm being entirely serious here, is because her mum won't let her in case she gets burned. I feel like more of a man servant than a boyfriend at times and it makes me incredibly angry and frustrated.

- I have to constantly give her attention and cuddles whenever she demands it. Sometimes I get constant shouts, texts, messages, and phone calls from downstairs while I'm upstairs playing a game when she wants one. It's annoying as fuck. At one point I got called down about 4 times in an hour this way. I feel as though our personal interactions are always on her terms.

- She can be incredibly moody, petulant, and silent when I get angry with her and won't talk to me when I've upset her until I apologise, no matter what point I'm trying to make.

- She's not done this much as of the last couple of days but she'll also pinch, bite, and flick me, despite me asking her about 50 times to stop it (not an understatement). I don't know if you've ever been flicked several times in the face but it can make you incredibly angry in very short order. I used to retaliate in the same way but have stopped doing this because it upset her and I didn't like the idea of me retaliating against her and hurting her, which I admit I have done before. I'm not proud of it and it disgusts me to think of myself hurting my GF in any way or for whatever reason. That it not who I am or who I ever want to be.

- We rarely have sex because she's rarely in the mood and I've since given up trying to initiate because there is only so much rejection you can take before giving up. She has been initiating as of this week but I feel weird having sex with someone I want to break up with. I managed to hold her off with an excuse about exam stress for now.

- Because of some platonic and friendly interactions with some people on her course, she got jealous and now I can't be friends with them anymore.

- It's minor, but I always have to carry her bags and the shopping. Treated like a servant again.

- I'm always expected to clean up her mess.

- I never really get time to myself other than at uni and the gym. She always needs my attention.

- She rolls her eyes and slightly talks down to me when I do something wrong, now matter how minor.

- It feels as everything I do or wear is always up for an unwelcome critique or criticism from her.

- I have a fair amount of online friendships. I'm not an overly outgoing person and these online friendships mean a lot to me. My GF doesn't think they are as good as real friends because I've never met them in person (most live in the states or in other parts of the country far away from me).

- I'm having doubts about the whole kids thing and she definitely wants four and definitely with me. However, this will become my nightmare because I feel I will end up taking care of five children and wake up twenty years from now and full of regret.

- She constantly asks me if I love her and tells me that she loves me, and that I make her so happy. She's always on about the future we're going to have and I'm so sick of lying about what I'm feeling, especially when she asks me if I'm happy with everything.

- Honestly, I'm just not happy anymore and just want to be on my own again so I can figure out how to be happy again.

- I actually had to go to a doctor last week for advice because I was that stressed out about her and the relationship, and because I felt so alone and without anyone to talk to.

- Everything in the house we share is on her terms. I have no say in any decisions.

- I feel like a shadow of the person I was before I met her. Like I'm not me anymore. 

I'm not perfect by any stretch but I can feel myself getting worse and worse in my mind as this relationship goes on. I feel myself getting angrier, more frustrated, and irritable whenever she annoys me. To be perfectly honest, I'm turning into a mean, grumpy arsehole and that's not who I am or who I want to be.

Now for the complications. 

- I have only lived with her for four months and my family has put up with a lot from me, including a recent and dramatic moving out from my ex-flatmate. I don't want to put them through it all again, especially after the money they have put into the new place. I'm not even sure they would help. I just don't know.

- My mum is planning a big birthday bash and my GF and her family are invited. I feel I'm creating issues for my mum on a day of celebration that should be all about her.

- My GF is on an important uni internship with my older and suffers from quite low self-esteem and self-confidence, and I don't want to screw up her uni stuff in any way.

- I fear the logistical problems of moving my stuff out of our place in the middle of a messy break up. We have joint accounts and bills to pay, but I'm more than willing to pay my share.

- I will probably lose a lot of friends because of our break up.

- It's both of our first, serious, and long term relationship so I know it's going to essentially emotionally destroy her and break her heart.

My head feels like it's falling apart and my emotions are all over the place. It's the only thing I can really think about and it's causing so much unbearable stress. Honestly, I know what I want but I feel trapped and helpless, and could really use some advice or even, permission to break up with her.

**tl;dr**: I want to break up with my girlfriend because of widespread issues throughout our relationship but our living situation, family issues, joint friendships, and future events are causing havoc as to when and how I should do it. Help and advice needed."

I would really appreciate some advice.

BACKGROUND

I am a 22 year old college student with one semester left to graduate. I am pursuing two different majors in the business area (undergrad), and have been working since I was 16, having three jobs in the past six years.

Since I started working, six years ago as I mentioned, I have contributed to the expenses in my house, with my dad deducting 40% of my wages every month (both of my parents are co-owners of my bank account). This was always an issue with me because 40% is almost half of what I make. For some time we would always have fights in regards to this, but I learned to accept it and moved on. If I made less than $100 on a certain week, he would not deduct the 40%. 

My twin sister, let's call her ""Evelyn,"" graduated last semester on Fall 2015. My parents were disappointed in me for some time because I was taking longer to do so. I promised them I was going to graduate this semester and they were content with that answer. The same 40% deduction has also applied to my sister, who has been working since she was 18. 

Something very relevant here is that my sister and I have always shared the same room. In other words, we have never had privacy. When we were younger, she would lock the door to change and I had to wait outside, or she would have to go to the bathroom. We would have some conversations here and there about it with my parents but never got serious about this. They started to look into buying a bigger house two years ago, but nothing ever happened since the prices are very steep right now where we live.


THE BEGINNING OF THE END

Before 2015, I had never experienced the so called ""college life,"" since my university is a couple miles from home. During my first years, I would take the bus, until I had enough money in my bank account to purchase the 2005 car I drive right now. That was two years ago. My parents never fully approved my decision of buying a car, until I went to Craigslist and set up a meeting with a seller, telling my parents the day before. 

Because of my lack of college experience and friends, I decided to join a business fraternity (not social, not Greek like related) on Spring of last year 2015. I had not seriously been involved in any organizations before and wanted more out of college, seeing how I was graduating soon. My parents did not approve of this. The eight week ""pledge process"" was very demanding and for the first time ever I started getting home late. The day of initiation, on a Sunday, they told me I was not going anywhere and we had a huge fight that morning. They retrieved my car keys and told me I was not going anywhere until I promised them the fraternity was going to be a thing of the past. They brought up the fact that the car was under my mom's name (something I had allowed at the time for some reason) even though I had bought it, so it wasn't technically mine. Crying, I promised them I would not do anything anymore with the fraternity after initiation and got initiated that day. 

At the end of last year, I heard of a new job opening through a ""brother"" of the fraternity, for a one-year intern position in a Fortune 50 company with a facility located 40 minutes from my house. The position would pay $10 more the hour of what I was making, with the condition that I remained a student for the duration of my internship. After going through the interview process and receiving the offer, I delayed my graduation to the fall semester of this year, since it was a requirement for the internship to be a student. I was also very excited because my interviewer, now my current boss, told me how they prepared the interns to continue working for the company afterwards.

My parents did not approve (the distance, the graduation date, etc) but I knew I had to take it, since before that I had no real work experience to apply to my area of studies. 

After getting the position, I changed the direct deposit options so that the money I make goes to my other bank account, one to which they do not have access. The 40% was gotten rid of since I am making more money now, and I instead pay them $400/ month for the rent (my bed and the roof) and utilities.

Despite all that has been said so far, I have always respected and love my parents. I know that they care about me a lot, and I have always understood their reasons. In fact, I appreciate their concern. To some extent I would like to be like them with my future children.


PRESENT

My time is very limited nowadays. I have a full time position as an intern, I am very involved with my fraternity, I was working on creating a new club at school at the beginning of the semester, I am also working on a social media campaign on my free time, and I am also a full time student. I am rarely never home early. Even though I have not stayed at anyone's house overnight in the past couple years, because I am not allowed to do so, whenever I get home everyone is sleeping. I also go out on Fridays and Saturdays until very late, usually getting home at 4:00am. This never happened before the fraternity, which has made my parents really hate my involvement.

In fact, I have daily fights with my parents about the fraternity and the time I spend at school. I have lost their trust after lying in several occasions, mainly because they do not approve of me hanging out with people they don't know. When I get home late, my mom tells me to open my mouth to see if I had been drinking. This has also happened on some occasions when I have gotten home at 8:00pm. They also call me when they have not heard from me, even when they know my schedule and know that I am still at school. I was starting a project two weeks ago with some classmates at 7:00pm and my dad called me at around 11:00 because it was too late for me to be out on a Tuesday.

One week ago, last Saturday, I went to a party and got home on Sunday at 6:00am. I had lost track of time because I was talking to a girl I liked and we ended up kissing. 

When I got home at 6:00 am my parents were both dressed and about to leave the house to go to the party and look for me. To some extent I would have understood this if it weren't for the fact that my dad had called me one hour earlier, in the middle of my make out-session. When I told him I was with a girl, he immediately told me to get home.

This was on Sunday. On Monday I talked to a friend of mine that is leasing a small efficiency for $700/month (utilities included, no deposit, no last month), and on Tuesday we agreed on me moving in on May 1st. That same day I told my sister. She was very happy for me.

I also talked to my boss this week about staying with the company after the internship was over. We are currently working on me getting various certificates and licenses to get approved for a 3 year training program that the company offers to become a manager, which starts of June of 2017 and relocates me constantly to different states. My boss has also expressed how proud he is of my work and we have gone over educational opportunities that the company offers to pay completely for my Master's degree.

On Thursday I told my parents about this opportunity and my decision to move out. My dad begged me to stay. They both did. It is really hard to put everything here into words. We had a four hour fight, yelling at each other, crying, and doing it all over again. My dad called me a coward because to him, this is my way to flipping them off and leaving out of the blue. Both of my parents also told me how they thought I did not need to move out, since I already cook for myself and am very independent. They also told me not to leave the house because I had not graduated yet (I have two classes left, already chosen) and because I was going to get ""lost"" in the world of parties and drinking. Something that made it even harder was my sister taking their side.

I told them how I need to become independent. If I don't do this right now, I would be moving out of my house right before turning 24. I need to be able to learn to manage my time more, and my finances. If I don't learn this now, I won't be prepared for when I move to another state with the company I currently work for. I am also limited with dating, since I do not have my own room, so I cannot take a girl home, not even to watch a movie. 

I told them all this, but they still convinced me. I called my friend that night and told him I was not moving in after all. He said it was OK but gave me one day to change my opinion, before posting it online or telling other friends. 

I was super depressed. I thought that, after all, the right decision is to stay home and keep sharing the bedroom with my sister, like we have always had. The next morning I woke up at 6:30 am like every other weekday to go to work. When I turned the light on because I couldn't find a pair of socks my sister started yelling at me to turn it off because she wakes up later. 

This happens almost every morning. This happens almost every day when I get home when the sound of typing on my laptop bothers her. Or when the light from the lamp by my bed does not let her sleep. 

I texted my friend as soon as I got to work. I told him I was moving in. I really can't stand it. I understand my parents. I love them and respect them very much, but I think it is time for me to move on. I am a good student. My GPA is above 3.0. I have helped my parents financially since I was 16, and even though I do not constantly show my emotions, I have always been a good son and care for them.

My dad told me we could always negotiate as long as I stay home. He told me they could talk to the landlord to build a separate room in the living room, but I know this won't happen. As soon as I don't move out everything will go back to being the same. 

When I told them yesterday morning I was still sticking to my decision, my mom told me to forget about her being my mom. She told me once I stepped a foot out of the door, I would no longer be her son. We did not speak after that for the rest of the day. Today in the morning, my dad yelled at me, out of the blue ""YOU ARE NOT MOVING OUT, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!"" right before leaving and closing the door after him.

Right after that, I took my sister to see the place. She told my mom we had been there over the phone, but her reaction was not extreme. In fact, my sister told me how they were thinking of splitting the expenses in 3 now. 

I just need freedom. I really want some advice. This is no easy decision for me, but my mind is set. I would really appreciate some help.

I just got offered a summer internship working at an advertising agency in the Flatiron District. This will be my second internship at an agency. My first just wrapped up April 1, in my home state of NC.

I am 25 years old, currently working at the YMCA. I get no financial support from my family, and I have very little savings. (The Y pays 10/hr.) I know for sure that taking this internship would look great on my resume and hopefully connect me to a lot of good opportunities, but it pays $13/hr, no moving stipend and no transportation stipend. My dream is to eventually live in NYC and work at an agency.

I've applied for and interviewed with a ton of jobs in the city, but many have rejected me after three rounds of interviews or even just not followed up after interviews (sigh). So I am worried if I turn down this internship, nothing better will come up. And of course, I really really want to move up there. 

Do you think is possible? Surviving on such a low wage for 3 months? I have no relatives to help me pay the way and I'm afraid this is what most interns do. 

I have been obsessively stalking rentals on streeteasy and Craigslist, but it seems like housing in NYC is an entirely different beast to tackle. 

Other considerations: 
I have a dog. 60 pounds. If he was a baby I'd be more willing to part with him, but he is four and I've had him since he was 8 weeks old. So this means I'm not as available to couch-surf or stay in dorms.

From my past experience in advertising, I'm not sure if another PT job would be an option. I would be willing to FOR SURE but I also worry about my dog if I'm away for 12+ hours a day. The good news is I will make time-and-a-half if I go over 40 hours at the agency (that wasn't an offer with my last internship). 

Basically, I'm wondering if you think this is worth it? Are there some secret resources I can tap into?

It's definitely a power-move career-wise, but ""the rent is too damn high."" Hilariously, 13/hr is more than I've ever made before. But I live in Raleigh, NC and pay $500 a month in rent.

EDIT: I have to decide by Wednesday :)

Prior to this I've had no HIT experience. I've been in this position for roughly 4 months now I'm really enjoying it. If at all possible I'd love to continue down a HIT career path and improve my standing professionally speaking.

I wear a lot of hats at my hospital... I work within the Meditech 6.0 platform building anything my hospital and its physicians and nurses may require while adhering to company and governing body guidelines. I do end-user training/support/troubleshooting with Meditech and take on responsibilities as the de facto one-man IT department diagnosing problems, repairing equipment, training staff on Windows/MS Office and installing software. Thanks to my lifetime use of computers and a basic knowledge of programming I've really taken a hold of the job and am ""half a year ahead of where they expected me to be"" according to management.

I currently make what I consider to be decent money as a salaried employee. I've done a little bit of research asking employees at in-company sister hospitals and found that individuals with my same title make considerably more ($15,000 - 20,000) a year. I overheard a conversation my supervisor had with another employee saying that I was basically a well paid intern. She's mentioned to me directly before that ""The company will not be about to afford you in a couple of years."" 

I'm only an RN with an Associates Degree in Applied Sciences. I'm currently going to school part time for my Bachelor's of Science in Nursing and plan on starting my Master's in Health Informatics after that. The HIM director allows me to take time out of my day to attend any informational WebEx meetings Meditech hosts for their clients. I find them to be useful, but I don't want to pigeonhole myself into only knowing Meditech.

I feel like there's more I can/should be doing. Are there any certificate programs or classes that I can take that will help me stand out? What else can I do to improve my knowledge and credentials to leverage better positions and/or salaries in HIT in the future?

Edit: Grammar; and Thanks!

My boss asked me several times if I was staying for the summer or not, even as recently as the week before last because I signed up for a specialty training and he said ""oh if you are planning to stay here this summer then you can just do the training then."" I said ""I have been applying for full-time positions at camps but I'll be saying here if I don't find a full-time job."" He said that was fine and I could go ahead and do the specialized training.
So this specialized training was part of a training conference we went to last week.

Everything seemed to be going great until the day of the conference. (Or now that I look back, maybe it wasn't. I remembered a time where I tried to talk to my fellow coworkers but they literally turned their backs to me - I barely talked to them because all they talked about was Rap and Sports which I know nothing about - and if I tried to ask a question so I could get the jest of the conversation I would get an irritated responce, if I tried to mention my interests I got teased because I am a nerd).

We were told we did not have to come into the office that day because we were leaving at 1pm. So I set my alarm late so I could get some extra sleep in, I set it for 11am and figured I'd have two hours to get ready.

Right as my alarm I get a text saying we need to come into the office and go into town to pass out fliers. I tried to quickly pack but in doing so I kind of just threw whatever in my bag and went up to the office.

We run the fliers around and don't get back until right at 1pm. I ask for a little time to rearrange my bag and use the restroom before we left since we didn't really need to be there by a specific time - the conference didn't start until the next day. We left at 1:30pm, apparently this made my boss super mad or something because I've been treated like trash ever since - though I've honestly never been treated well here.

We stopped at a strip-mall on our conference travels and they said to be back at the car at a certain time, I got there on time and had to wait for them all. This happened twice, on the way to and from the conference.

On the first day of the conference I had to do that specialized training. My training was supposed to go from 8am-12pm and 1pm-2pm, however people in the session asked if we could just skip the lunch break and plow on through, so we went from 8am-12:30pm and was finished. I get a group text about my fellow coworker being hungry and another responded that they wanted to go to Olive Garden - we only had one car with us so my fellow intern was the driver. I told them I was in my session and asked them to please wait for me and that we had a break at noon. I then sent a revised text when I found out the new time.

They told me if I was not in the lobby in 5min then they'd leave me. I was working on a test and finished the test 8min later, needless to say, they left me. I was super mad...the only one out of the five of us to be left. They said it was because Oswald needed food so he could get back to his session.

I sent my boss a text asking how I was supposed to get food, this was my first time and day at this conference and I knew nothing. He told me to walk somewhere to find food. Great thanks, it was snowing outside. That didn't make me as upset as just the principal of being the only person left behind.

The last night of the conference after everything was over I went up to my boss and asked him if we had any evening plans because the first night we all went out for Karaoke and the second night we all watched a movie. He told me that we had no plans that night and he was just going back to his room to chill. I later found out that all of my co-workers went out for pizza without me. He lied to me.

The final day of the conference were two very silly ordeals. We would always wait at the bar outside of the dining hall for everyone to gather before going for lunch. I waited an hour and saw nobody, I sent a text and got no response. I finally decided to go into the dining hall and grab food even if I had to sit with a stranger...found them already eating. My boss was mad and asked ""where have you been?"" I told him I was in the usual location waiting for them.

After lunch I had to use the restroom, as usual the ladies restroom had a long line. My boss for mad at me for taking so long with that...sorry I am the only female of the group so you don't know what it's like to wait in line for the restroom! Ugh

On the way home there was one point where we stopped for fast food and I ended up last in the ordering line behind them. I forgot my wallet in the car so I ran back to get it, it took 6min from realizing wallet was gone to getting my food...not long at all.
I get my food and my boss is sitting at the table and I come over and ask ""are we eating here or taking it to go, I thought we were taking it to go?"" Because he was chowing down on his food.
He said ""I'm eating because once again we had to wait on you, tired of having to wait on you but no we are taking it to go.""

Monday was a blah day, we went around and passed out fliers again. I fell and scraped up my knee really badly but I continued going for another 2hrs before I was able to clean and bandage my bleeding knee - I made no fuss about this and continued to work.

Tuesday was an office day, just sat in the office taking phone calls because my boss and assistant boss were in meetings all day.

He got mad at me because of a call I got. Okay so my fellow intern Ray decided to go back to the house 30min early since we went doing much...I stayed in the office.
I get a call from a fast talking man with a heavy accent. I jot down what I think be said but when I tried to ask for clarity he hung up.
I didn't catch his name but I think he said something like Ron, he only gave me the last four digits of his phone number, and it sounded like he wanted us to unlock the maintenance house so he could till? (Later discovered he said...""to detail"" aka paint).
I called my fellow intern Ray and asked if he had keys to the maintenance house since he has a lot of the property keys, just in case it was locked but I figured it was open. He said he would call our boss about it.
My boss walked into the office asking why Ray was calling him about keys to the house, I explained it to him then left for the day because my shift was over.
Awhile later I get a text from Ray saying our boss was still confused and I needed to text him (why couldn't my boss text me and tell me that?)
I texted my boss and tried to explain the situation as best as I could, I am not sure why he was so upset about it? 

Okay so Wednesday and Thursday I was given the daunting task of shoveling and raking rocks out of the yard - which my assistant boss said ""I know it is a boring task but we want you to do it."" There were a ton of them and it took a long time but it was my only task assigned for me that week so I figured I'd work on it at a nice pace since nothing else is going on and tasks never seem to be a mandatory thing to finish in certain amounts of time there - unless it is stated as such but it was not. I sent some texts while working but that never seems to be a problem my co-intern is on his phone a lot and so is my boss and my assistant boss. My boss sits in his office watching Podcasts and sleeping instead of working.
He said I up and left yesterday, no I didn't. My Co-Intern Ray went into town to grab something to drink when he got back he said he was taking a lunch break then after that we should work on moving cinderblocks. I said alright but I'd you are getting lunch than I'm going to too.
I went into town and grabbed lunch and came back to eat it, I was done and ready to work. Ray turned on his videogame and said he wasn't in a hurry and I was like 'okay' since that seems to be the culture around here. I waited for him to finish his game then we went out and finished our task.
I explained this to him and he said it doesn't count because Ray was ""no longer an employee"" (because he found a better job and quit) but Ray was an employee when it happened!.
He also tried to argue with me that I didn't move cinder blocks yesterday...I know what I did. I did help move them, sure. I couldn't grab two at a time like Ray but I grabbed one each time and grabbed as many as I could.
He also got mad because I came inside and took a break yesterday, I didn't think anything of it since Ray and Oswald had gone into the office for 30min...if they took a break, why can't I?
He also said I am late to things, not often, but sometimes yes it happens. I was like 4min late yesterday but I didn't think that would be bad because it was just to the office in the morning and everyone comes in at random times - my roommate when into town and got a coffee and was 30min late, he never got in trouble. I was super on time for our Wednesday meeting which my boss never showed up to or informed us we weren't having.
He also said he was letting me go because they also didn't have a spot for me on the summer staff...he asked me a couple of weeks ago if I was staying for the summer and said yes - this is such a lie, I know they are not done hiring people.

I feel like it is double standards!

I think I figured out what happened. My title was Program Intern, before I got there I was told I would be doing a lot of career development and learn Programing and how to be a Director. I did very little Programing, maybe once or twice a season (Fall, Winter, Spring) I had to create a Day Camp Program. I thought I would learn how to plan and ready Summer Camp, but the only thing I got to do was come up with theme ideas. I did not learn anything about the process of getting everything set up for the summer or staff hiring or anything. - I could not even tell you what exactly my boss did all day (if and when he was ever in the office).

Mostly I learned how to be a maintenance man and grounds keeper.

I am not a very strong person so I cannot do a lot of manual labor and when I am able to I am a bit slower than the men. He would often assign me tasks that I physically could not do, such as pick up and move 20 bales of hay - I could not pick them up past my ankles so I was super slow about it and had to roll them end over end and get help from my co-intern. I believe that they saw me as useless once my co-intern Ray left for his new job because I would often need Ray's help to complete hard tasks. 

My College Advisor is very mad about this!

TL;DR:
I was let go from my internship early because my co-worker left the job for another one and they saw me as useless because I could not do manual labor tasks very fast or well because I am weak and often had to ask my co-worker, even though that was not the point of my internship - I was suppose to plan camps and learn how to run a camp not be a maintenance guy. I stayed to myself a lot during this internship because I had nothing in common with my coworkers and they treated me like trash."
4f96h8,4,2016-04-17,Final thoughts on the X260 before purchase,nh10798,thinkpad,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/4f96h8/final_thoughts_on_the_x260_before_purchase/,"This summer/fall I've had a internship at a company where they hand out X and T series machines to staff and interns. I still have a few months left but We get to keep them after! I was given at X230 and have loved the machine. (Is it possible to get a 1080p screen in the X230?) 

Anyways, I have to buy a new laptop to replace my older XPS so obviously I'm going to buy a thinkpad. I have been looking at the X260 due to the smaller form factor and full HD display. I'm comfortable with installing my own SSD and memory to save money on top of the corporate discount but I have some questions. 

If I order the machine with Win 10 pro will I use the same key to reinstall Windows on the new drive? Or will I have to buy another key? 

Is there a specific memory that will work for the X260? I understand that it needs a DDR4 so-dimm given the skylake architecture. Can I just order any DDR4 from newegg? 

Why are there so few reviews for the X260? If anyone has any advice for a first time X series owner let me know! "

4f9dgk,2,2016-04-17,I [24/M] don't understand why my coworker [24/F] is so mean to me.,9Virtues,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4f9dgk/i_24m_dont_understand_why_my_coworker_24f_is_so/,"Back in December we had a bunch of new interns start at our firm. I was assigned a female one to answer her questions for the first week or two.


Well that ""buddy"" relationship turned into a friendship. Soon we were talking all day at working and going to lunch 1 on 1 all the time (several times a week). At first I thought she may like me. If I'd say something slightly negative, I'd get things like ""sorry I'm not pretty enough for you"" and it seemed like she was always trying to impress. If I made a comment about clothing, she would wear similar. If I said that would look better with a belt, next time a belt would be worn. She'd ask what color nails to get, come in the next day with that color. We'd talk about our favorite movies/songs, she'd watch/listen to mine. Even outside of work she would text or snapchat me every single day for almost 4 months. 


In this time we learned ALOT about eachother. She even told me how she never opens up to anyone, but I learned her darkest fears, her insecurities, her family life, her dreams, etc.... A lot of this I learned one night where she got incredibly drunk at a company event. I spent an hour alone with her babysitting her waiting for her friend to come pick her up. She spilled a lot to me while in tears including how much she was in love with her BF of 5 years and how when she first started this new job she was looking to see if someone could treat her better (me?). Now I knew she had a BF, but this was the first time I heard about him in this much depth.


Things remained the same after that until another company happy hour an long ways from work. And because it was so far away, few coworkers went. I wasn't planning on going, but she insisted I go and she would drive the hour there and back. We went had a good time, left our coworkers at the bar, went to a winery for food and more drinks before meeting up with a coworker and his wife at another bar. Her BF was texting her all night (her being short with him from what I could tell) about how she needed to be home by 1. Well that didn't happen and that was the beginning of a change in our ""friendship"".


The days that followed, the instant messages stopped, the jokes vanished, no more texts/snaps. I questioned her on it, because I knew what happened. And at first she denied anything was different then it came to be ""I was putting her in a difficult spot between choosing a friendship and her relationship, and I was being selfish for not putting myself in her shoes."" After a heated conversation about it, I dropped it and she told me she would plan on us meeting.


But still we never talked outside of work again and everything was strictly work now. And everything I did was ""wrong"". If she had a question and I came over to help, touching her mouse was suddenly ""DONT TOUCH MY STUFF"". If I looked around while waiting for her to show me stuff, it was ""STOP LOOKING AT MY STUFF"". If I just tried to ask what you doing this weekend it became ""WHY ARE YOU SO NOSY?, HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS"", when before I'd seriously get waaaaay too much information almost a play by play of each day of names I didn't even know and she couldn't wait to tell me about it Monday. Then I'd get dirty looks all the time if I said anything ""off"". For example at lunch if we are all talking about favorite shows, and I said something she didn't like, I'd get a look of disgust like I'm a cave troll and then she would instantly change the topic. 


I could handle no talking if her BF said that or she felt guilty. But I can't handle this level of mean and these looks. I consider myself to have high self esteem, but this seriously puts me in a bad mood at work (and its effecting my work). And I don't know why she is doing this. Some days I see periods of the ""old her"" and we laugh and joke and it had been getting better as she aproached the end of her internship this past week, but then I saw her working on a school project that I was going to help with (to meet her BF, her plan from a while back) so I said hey thought we were doing that and I got ""You're not meeting him thats, not fair to him"". And it went downhill again. 



On her last day Friday she came up to say goodbye to everyone and came to me and told me that didn't tell her if she got a full time offer or not. The whole time I could tell she hated having this conversation with me and the only reason she was, was because I asked her to tell me how it went. She wanted this conversation not to last a second longer than it needed to be. But then I pulled out a card for her saying it was nice working with her I appreciate her listening and offering advice on stuff (back when we talked) that was very personal. And instantly its like the ""b word"" switch was flipped and she was the nice person I once knew. She demanded I get up and give her a hug (which was weird because she has told me she doesn't like touching people and never gives hugs) and how Monday (tomorrow) if I want to come to the after work after party she will for sure invite me.


I thought hey thats nice, but deep down I was happy. I knew this little nice display wasn't going to change anything and I was happy she wasn't getting an offer because I couldn't deal with the way she was treating me and I needed to get my work done. I hated when she called me over for help. I hated when she was at the same lunch table as me giving me the looks.


And then today I found out from a manager that she hangs out with all the time now outside of work, that she will be getting a part time offer for the next year and then full time after that. And now I don't know what to do. I spent so much of my own time teaching her. I spent hours extra a week teaching her to be great, meaning I'd have to work 12+ hours a day to make up for the time I spent helping her. I sang her praises to every manager and HR when they questioned how she was doing and if her work was her work or a lot of mine. And now I regret it. I don't know if I can work for years there with her. She has made me feel like an outsider at my work. And yea its easy to say ignore her, but to be honest she is like a 9/10 female, if she says everyone come to the bar and doesn't invite me, no one is gonna say anything. Our work place shifted to mostly men (she is one of the few females out of a 100 workers), so you can just imagine the attention she gets and how many people hated that I was the one way back going to lunch with her all the time and would pick on me for it.



So what do I do now? As shitty as it is, like I said I can handle her not talking to me (I loved the weekends when she wasn't there), but I can't handle the meaness. I get what she was doing was pretty much either monkey branching or having an emotional affair  so I've given up on trying to have a friendship, but I still want to enjoy going to work.

They are in order of what I really want to play first, but I will respond to all prompts :&gt; If something tickles you fancy, but you want to change it a bit, have some ideas of your own, feel free to message me and we can talk shop!

---------

- **[M/Futa4F/Futa]** ***Interplanetary Wrasslin' Federation!***: Want to suplex a planet? Put a God into an ArmBar? Sexualize every aspect of a pretty sexualized sport? Then, this is the prompt for you. In the near future, most conflic between the Galactic Federation is decided by a Pin and a count to three. Wrestlers from all over the galaxy fight for fortune, fame, and politics. But sexual moves are not only allowed, they are encourage. First to cum or get pinned loses! Let's get stupid and campy in this. I want to have fun coming up with ridiculous situations, worse outfits, and terrible bad guys with a tag team partner! This can be regular genders, or futas, i'm not too picky here. But let's bash some skulls and fight off an alien invasion that happens to follow out galactic wrestling's rules!

- **[M/Futa4F/T/Futa]** ***Crime in the Futa City*** Danger was written all over that pretty face, like the makeup that barely shined in the dim light of my agency. Her legs might have gone up to her chin if a gorgeous body didn't decide to stake it's claim on the world. Long locks like fell like my heart when I realized that she wasn't here for me, but for her husband. Lost to the streets of this city, and she wanted me to find him. Well, you couldn't win them all, but promises fell out of my mouth. Promises that I wasn't sure I'd be able to keep. Between the Brothels of Main street, the Sex-Queens that ran the crime and Racketeering in the city, and our corrupt government that would take a blow Job to lock someone up for life, I wasn't sure I'd even be able to make a difference. But your eyes, those beautiful baby blues, so filled with hope that all i could do was say yes and watch you walk out the door. I needed a drink to sort this case out.... I'd love to play a detective (Futa or Male) in a hyper-sexualized 1950's world of crime and noir. Maybe you are my partner or an intern, dedicated to watching my shapely backside to keep it intact for later. Maybe you are the client, pushing for me to solve the case. Futa and Male/Female live side by side, and sexual favors are traded like currency. I'd love an imaginative partner who love campy tropes to play with me and help me develop this world of mystery and sex.

- **[M4F]** ***Under the Veil***: There was a Vicky's Secret commercial a few years back, showing a gorgeous middle eastern woman dressing in a sexy black set of lingerie, complete with stockings and makeup before pulling on a Burqua and walking out with a saucy wink. That stayed with me for a long time as a kid. I'd love to have some sort of play with any woman that would wear a burqua, and start exploring a totally unknown lover who covers herself, but loved the feeling of silk on her skin. Maybe you are a co-worker and you want to show me exactly how much you appreciate my help the other day in the storage closet. Maybe we meet in a bar, and i'm the first guy to actually talk to you instead of insult your religion. Whatever we decide, I want it to be a slow burn. A little leg here in the office. A finger fuck in the backroom, where it's just my hand exploring you, without me being able to see. Let me undress you with my mind many times before you actually show me.

- **[M4F]** ***The Only One For You***: Gorgeous, stunning, enchanting, all words used to describe you. Your grace and beauty never fails to bring in the men, who walk all over each other to get just a glance from you. But you never care, you pick whomever fits your fancy, wink at them, and they are yours (Magically or otherwise). Except for me. I say no and go home. Whether it's because I have a wife and family or I just don't find you attractive. Whatever the reason, you are insulted and angry beyond words. No one says no. No one disregards you so blatantly. You tell your driver to follow me home and wait, plotting. You are going to show me exactly what I passed up, why you are to always get what you want. Crazy? Stalker? Never. Those words describe ugly people. You are Aphrodite incarnate, and you have been scorned.

- **[M4F/Futa/T]** ***Man's Best Friend***: My pacing back and forth would probably have worn a hole into the rug I was walking on. Today was the day, today, I helped someone acclimate to the new world of Humans. It's been a rough trip, the government wanted to make sure **everything** was on the up and up, including blood tests and personality tests (Did you know polygraphs now included a very uncomfortable probe?). But the Relocation Initiative was going to help all those effected by the Change to adapt to their new world. Ever since the sky ripped open and monsters started to appear everywhere, no one knew what to do. But it turns out that those monsters were just as scared as us. Eventually, we bridged the language gap with technology, and learned that they had been displaced from their own timeline, a slightly medieval time like something out of a manga. But they couldn't adapt by themselves, and since the rift sealed, no one knows what to do with them. Thankfully, someone suggested a foster program where you could 'Adopt' a Monster, providing them home and cultural/technological adaptation. And MINE WAS ALMOST HERE!! What would I find on the other side of that door? I'm looking for a long term RP with this one, no sooooo much focused on sex, but that will definitely be a fun part of it. Monsters of all kinds are welcome, furries, aliens even, and Futa are welcome in this prompt. We could even switch it up and have a Monsterboy visit you! Or a Futa ;&gt; We could even do a harem, with both of us coming up with new additions to the house!

- **[M4F/Futa]** ***Homecuming***: ""Hey mom!"" I called out, setting my bad down next to the doorway as I walked inside the old, familiar house. College had such a different smell, one of stress, release, sex, work... But home. It was always calming, the smell of cooking and warmth. It was nice to be home. I called out again with no response, and decided to check out the rooms upstairs, just in case you were napping or distracted with work on your computer. I know you worked from home, so you could just be on a call. But as I walk up the stairs, the sounds I hear are not any of these things. I hear sliding, I hear slapping and moaning. And instantly I am warped back to my teenage years, sneaking up to your door to listen, my heart beating out of my chest. You left the door wide open this time, my time at college leaving you with a sense of privacy. Or at least distance. It was true that since I saw you that first time and heard your lust soaked voice moan my name, I started teasing you. I would wear just boxers around, early morning wood poking out, and me seemingly unaware of my partial nudity. I would walk from the bathroom nude, right desire your wide open door. I'd fall asleep on the couch with my dick out and listen to your panting and moaning as your tried to hide your orgasm on the chair next to me. And tonight, your legs wide open, a vibrator shoved up your perfect pussy and your cock throbbing as you looked at your cellphone. Undoubtedly, you were looking at that pic i ""accidentally"" sent you that I asked you to delete, the one with cum on my chest for my ""girlfriend"". I slowly undress and enter your room, cock already free and throbbing. Tonight, you'd finally get what you wanted. I have all week off and for this week, I'll fulfill all your fantasies about me.

- **[M4F]** ***Metal Maiden***: You are my favorite person, my best friend for years. But after your first tattoo back in high school, something took over. Now, you are pierced in all the places you can get it legally, and your own artwork is displayed over as much skin as you can cover... And I must admit, I have never found you more attractive. Come to find out, in high school, you found my alt pornography, and wanted to be those girls I listed after. Maybe you'll get your wish with this six pack of beers? Or you slyly try to tell me the story of your new piercings, revealing yourself to me in the process?

------------

- **[Futa4Futa/F]** ***The Grand Experiment***: 

""There ya go, Lauren, you met your quota for the day."" I said breathless, laying on top of the woman's backside and we were both sweating and panting from exertion. My cock slid out of her fluffy pussy, my seed dribbling onto the floor as she stood up, pulling her skirt down and unhooking the pumps from her swollen and laden breasts.

""Thank you so much Lisa. It's very useful to have you around, you know. A lot of us pump so much more milk when we have a young futa like you to... well encourage flow."" She gave a saucy wink to me as i rested in the corner of the pumping room, cock still hard and throbbing. Milk was a huge export of the city, futa's breastmilk and semen becoming a huge commodity outside of our planet. So the planet's government set up a... well a farm, for lack of a better term. The government tried to call it a ""Voluntary Community Extraction Facility."" The locals called it the farm.

The Planet was one government, a galactic experiment in sexual values and genetic modification. Everyone is healthy from birth, strong, physically beautiful, and most of the population has a well hung, thick cock swinging below their legs. Everyone was encouraged to have sex, even family as they opened up personal borders. Sex was a pastime, orgy clubs a common site and nighttime destination to socialize. Businesses had set time for breaks so the co-workers could 'increase productivity', and even sex toys were carried around in public and used often enough to be on nearly every storefront. I had a buttplug in right now, actually. It had a fake ruby in it and i loved it!

Woman came in, pumped for a certain amount of time, and left, getting a small portion of the profits from the Milk sold. Lots of housewives did it to help make some money. That and they hired young, good looking futa's like me to have sex with them to encourage a heavier milk flow. Apparently, sex helps the nipples become erect and open up more, and other futa love having another cock in them to make them cum more often.

Not that I'm complaining, It's a great job. And they only hire the futa who have a low refractory period. Like me. I could knock out at least 10 women on my shift. I had a Facebook group. A Frakking Facebook group. I get Christmas presents. Most of these women are really nice, motherly types, so they try to take care of me in their spare time.... It's sweet really.

Thankfully, I'm single, but i think a girlfriend would be okay, since it's just for my job. I pulled my pants back up and nodded respectfully toward Mrs. Aberdeen as she closed the last few buttons on her blouse and gave me a goodbye kiss on the cheek.

""Behave yourself, Lisa. Don't do anything I wouldn't do."" Another saucy wink as she opened the door to leave

""If the stories you've told me are true, that doesn't limit much."" She laughed as she left, leaving me a small tip on the corner table. I smiled. She was sweet.

I wonder who was next?

------

- **[M4F]** ***Oh Mother, Where art Thou?***

I would love to play with an older woman who wants to raise her son specifically to breed with her. Everything you've taught me is up to the moment of budding adulthood where I can share myself with you. I am not allowed clothes, I am home-schooled, we cuddle naked, you wear lingerie as normal house clothes, all with the lead up to me becoming a man of your house. Maybe you can give me a Sex Ed lesson with some hands on work. Maybe we are sleeping together one night, and you feel my youthful erection or a wet dream. Surprise me with your lustful creativity Mommy ;&gt;

- **[M4F/Futa/T]** ***Monster ""Slayer""***: 

""Are you serious?"" The monster asked lightly, the mortal before them holding an offering of pearls and bowing.

""Of course! This is a gift of my intent."" He said simply, blue eyes sparkling as he reared up, still offering the beads and tribute.

""You see, I am a man that appreciate different ways of thinking. As you know, there is a bounty on you."" He said, glancing sideways at the pile of bones and armor that sat nearby.

""Many men have tried, many have failed. And honestly, I think fighting is only a last minute option to save your own life. Which you have been forced to do."" He motioned toward his belt, devoid of weapons, excepting a simple dagger.

""Well, my proposition is to slay you in a different way. I've heard of your agreement with items such as this and would like an opportunity to slay you in a much more pleasureable way for both of us."" He said with a smile and a wink.

""I have no intent to harm you, and the bounty on the board just indicates to protect the townsfolk. I intent to do both and charm your loincloth off."" His body was toned from adventuring, but the mischief in his eyes and the glint showed that he was very serious about his proposition.

""So what do you say? Care to take a break for fighting for your life, and instead, enjoy the creativity of a mortal?"" (Whatever monster you'd like, as crazy as you wanna make it. Cocks, tentacles, Naga, slime, weird parts, two rows of breasts... Let's do it like they do on a fantasy discovery channel!)

I ***guarantee*** that I will answer every message I get.

And as for anything else, just ask. I am a fountain of creative energy, ready to explore the worlds that you want to fulfill. I am a GM, a storyteller, and a dirty minded writer who loves to turn people on. Hopefully, I'll see you at the checkout counter."
4f9j4x,3,2016-04-17,How to bring up to mother that I'm terrified about applying and working a first job?,ADailyDream,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4f9j4x/how_to_bring_up_to_mother_that_im_terrified_about/,"So I'm currently 18, soon to be 19, and majoring in computer science. From what I know about myself, I'm incredibly socially anxious. I can't talk to someone I don't know, if someone talks to me I sweat and get a hot flash, and I usually try and avoid any unwarranted social interaction. Small things are okay for me like asking if someone is waiting in line, or forced conversations like if a teacher pairs us together.

My mom knows I have anxiety issues, and even is prescribed xanax and some ssri herself, but she has never really been understanding. She always tells me to suck it up, and I always bring up the fact that she has prescription medication and she just stands her ground. 

My biggest issue about bringing this up is because my social anxiety didn't really start until freshman year of highschool. All throughout elementary school and middle school I was the class clown. I would blurt things out, make people laugh, talk back to teachers, talk to anyone I sat by when the teacher moved me. It wasn't until I hit puberty that I started to change and become more socially secluded I guess would be the right word.

I'm also 19, so I could just go and see someone myself, but that terrifies me as well. What if they tell me I have nothing wrong and I just need to suck it up? Or they tell me they can't do anything for me. I need work experience, and I know that I really need it, but even while I was browsing for internships I felt anxious over the thought of having to do a phone interview, or meet them face to face.

I guess this got a little rambly, so I'm sorry about that. I just kind of need advice or guidance on what I should do. I don't want to live my life passively and do nothing about anything and not get anywhere...

Thanks :)

4f9ols,27,2016-04-17,I [24/M] don't understand why my coworker [24/F] is so mean to me,9Virtues,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4f9ols/i_24m_dont_understand_why_my_coworker_24f_is_so/,"Back in December we had a bunch of new interns start at our firm. I was assigned a female one to answer her questions for the first week or two.


Well that ""buddy"" relationship turned into a friendship. Soon we were talking all day at working and going to lunch 1 on 1 all the time (several times a week). At first I thought she may like me. If I'd say something slightly negative, I'd get things like ""sorry I'm not pretty enough for you"" and it seemed like she was always trying to impress. If I made a comment about clothing, she would wear similar. If I said that would look better with a belt, next time a belt would be worn. She'd ask what color nails to get, come in the next day with that color. We'd talk about our favorite movies/songs, she'd watch/listen to mine. Even outside of work she would text or snapchat me every single day for almost 4 months. 


In this time we learned ALOT about eachother. She even told me how she never opens up to anyone, but I learned her darkest fears, her insecurities, her family life, her dreams, etc.... A lot of this I learned one night where she got incredibly drunk at a company event. I spent an hour alone with her babysitting her waiting for her friend to come pick her up. She spilled a lot to me while in tears including how much she was in love with her BF of 5 years and how when she first started this new job she was looking to see if someone could treat her better (me?). Now I knew she had a BF, but this was the first time I heard about him in this much depth.


Things remained the same after that until another company happy hour an long ways from work. And because it was so far away, few coworkers went. I wasn't planning on going, but she insisted I go and she would drive the hour there and back. We went had a good time, left our coworkers at the bar, went to a winery for food and more drinks before meeting up with a coworker and his wife at another bar. Her BF was texting her all night (her being short with him from what I could tell) about how she needed to be home by 1. Well that didn't happen and that was the beginning of a change in our ""friendship"".


The days that followed, the instant messages stopped, the jokes vanished, no more texts/snaps. I questioned her on it, because I knew what happened. And at first she denied anything was different then it came to be ""I was putting her in a difficult spot between choosing a friendship and her relationship, and I was being selfish for not putting myself in her shoes."" After a heated conversation about it, I dropped it and she told me she would plan on us meeting.


But still we never talked outside of work again and everything was strictly work now. And everything I did was ""wrong"". If she had a question and I came over to help, touching her mouse was suddenly ""DONT TOUCH MY STUFF"". If I looked around while waiting for her to show me stuff, it was ""STOP LOOKING AT MY STUFF"". If I just tried to ask what you doing this weekend it became ""WHY ARE YOU SO NOSY?, HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS"", when before I'd seriously get waaaaay too much information almost a play by play of each day of names I didn't even know and she couldn't wait to tell me about it Monday. Then I'd get dirty looks all the time if I said anything ""off"". For example at lunch if we are all talking about favorite shows, and I said something she didn't like, I'd get a look of disgust like I'm a cave troll and then she would instantly change the topic. 


I could handle no talking if her BF said that or she felt guilty. But I can't handle this level of mean and these looks. I consider myself to have high self esteem, but this seriously puts me in a bad mood at work (and its effecting my work). And I don't know why she is doing this. Some days I see periods of the ""old her"" and we laugh and joke and it had been getting better as she aproached the end of her internship this past week, but then I saw her working on a school project that I was going to help with (to meet her BF, her plan from a while back) so I said hey thought we were doing that and I got ""You're not meeting him thats, not fair to him"". And it went downhill again. 



On her last day Friday she came up to say goodbye to everyone and came to me and told me that didn't tell her if she got a full time offer or not. The whole time I could tell she hated having this conversation with me and the only reason she was, was because I asked her to tell me how it went. She wanted this conversation not to last a second longer than it needed to be. But then I pulled out a card for her saying it was nice working with her I appreciate her listening and offering advice on stuff (back when we talked) that was very personal. And instantly its like the ""b word"" switch was flipped and she was the nice person I once knew. She demanded I get up and give her a hug (which was weird because she has told me she doesn't like touching people and never gives hugs) and how Monday (tomorrow) if I want to come to the after work after party she will for sure invite me.


I thought hey thats nice, but deep down I was happy. I knew this little nice display wasn't going to change anything and I was happy she wasn't getting an offer because I couldn't deal with the way she was treating me and I needed to get my work done. I hated when she called me over for help. I hated when she was at the same lunch table as me giving me the looks.


And then today I found out from a manager that she hangs out with all the time now outside of work, that she will be getting a part time offer for the next year and then full time after that. And now I don't know what to do. I spent so much of my own time teaching her. I spent hours extra a week teaching her to be great, meaning I'd have to work 12+ hours a day to make up for the time I spent helping her. I sang her praises to every manager and HR when they questioned how she was doing and if her work was her work or a lot of mine. And now I regret it. I don't know if I can work for years there with her. She has made me feel like an outsider at my work. And yea its easy to say ignore her, but to be honest she is like a 9/10 female, if she says everyone come to the bar and doesn't invite me, no one is gonna say anything. Our work place shifted to mostly men (she is one of the few females out of a 100 workers), so you can just imagine the attention she gets and how many people hated that I was the one way back going to lunch with her all the time and would pick on me for it.



So what do I do now? As shitty as it is, like I said I can handle her not talking to me (I loved the weekends when she wasn't there), but I can't handle the meaness. I get what she was doing was pretty much either monkey branching or having an emotional affair  so I've given up on trying to have a friendship, but I still want to enjoy going to work.



   
**tl;dr**: Coworker is mean to me after getting too close to her"
4f9omk,11,2016-04-17,My experience with antidepressants,systembusy,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4f9omk/my_experience_with_antidepressants/,"First off, I'm gonna start this post by saying that I am not a professional medical expert, and I know that there are countless antidepressants out there, all with their own purpose and all of them have an effect on everyone differently. There is probably nothing more complex in the known universe than the human body, and so I know that some people do very well on antidepressants and other meds, and some don't, and everywhere in between. But this is my story.

Over the past few years, I'd been taking Prozac for anxiety. For the first couple of years, it worked really well, and I found myself not ""caring"" as much about some of the things that normally caused me anxiety.

After a while though, starting with about a year ago, I found myself feeling different. I would wake up every day with an upset stomach. At first I attributed it to general anxiety because there was an increase in stress; I had to do a co-op (internship) over last summer for my bachelor's degree, and it was stressful finding a company to do one with and figuring out housing, etc. I would also be on my own in a very unfamiliar place, away from all my friends and family, so that was very nerve-wracking.

But then I noticed it was still happening on days where I didn't have that much to be stressed out over. I would wake up feeling sick, and generally over the course of the day, it would get better, only to start over again the next morning. I used to drink coffee all the time - now I was barely able to stomach a single cup of coffee or caffeine without throwing up, or at least feeling very sick to my stomach.

After a few months of this, I got a prescription for another antidepressant, mirtazapine (brand name Remeron). It was supposed to be very effective at combating nausea and improving mood. Great, I thought. I was eager to try it out. It worked well for a little while, but I noticed I was still feeling sick most mornings.

I talked to my doctors about it, and one of the guesses we came up with was acid reflux, as that described it pretty accurately. However, even after taking Omeprazole (prescription strength Prilosec) for a while, there wasn't much improvement.

Finally, one of my doctors suggested I skip a dose of Prozac and see how that made me feel. One of the side effects of Prozac is nausea and vomiting, and even though it hadn't caused that for the first couple of years of taking it, something must have changed and my body no longer tolerated it.

I did feel noticeably better the day after skipping the dose, and my doctor prescribed lower dosages to gradually get me off of the Prozac. Now that I'm off Prozac completely, I feel much better. Not 100%, as some of it is still lingering, but I don't wake up feeling like vomiting every day, and I can handle small amounts of coffee/caffeine without feeling completely sick.

Now my biggest problem is the Remeron. It does help my mood a little bit at night when I take it (I have to take it closer to bedtime because it has a strong sedative effect), but at a great cost. I feel like I have to sleep 12 hours a day to feel ""normal,"" and my energy is much lower during the day. I have low metabolism and low muscle tone to begin with, so that's definitely not helping.

The other drawback to Remeron is that it increases your appetite significantly, especially for carb cravings. Because of all this, I ended up gaining about 35 pounds over the past 8 months.

Before I started taking Remeron, I was already overweight to begin with. I had done Weight Watchers in the past, and I could easily lose up to 2 pounds a week as long as I stuck to the point system and exercised at least 2-3 times a week. That is no longer the case. After my spring break, I decided to start WW again because of the Remeron-induced weight gain. It has been over 3 weeks and I have not lost a single pound. It's extremely frustrating to me because I'm sticking to the point system, I'm exercising at least a couple times a week, and I made a lot of changes in my diet (cut out most all junk food, eating lots more fruits and veggies, yogurt, high protein, things like that). Still nothing.

So I'm gonna try talking to my doctor this week about tapering off the Remeron as well. I don't like relying on medication anymore. I'm sick of the fact that I can't even lose weight because of it. Low metabolism and low muscle tone runs in my family, so it is already difficult for me to lose weight without the Remeron making it even harder.

Last time I got a physical, my blood sugar was a little high, and I don't want to keep gaining more weight because then I'll be at risk for diabetes and other complications.

So that's my experience with antidepressants. I'm sick of relying on pills because they help a little, but at a great cost. I don't feel ""normal"" anymore.

**TL;DR:** Been on Prozac for 3 years, stopped working after 2 years making me sick to my stomach. Started Remeron/mirtazapine, gained a lot of weight, now frustrated because I can't lose it while still on this med."

The thing I want advice on is what I need to do in addition to all of that in order to make myself more marketable and more likely to land a Junior Sysadmin job. I think I am going to try to get a certification this summer. I was planning on getting my CCENT, and I have started watching the youtube series on that, but I want to know everyone's thoughts on what I should do before I commit to that. Is getting my CCENT/CCNA first a good idea? Or should I go for the MCSA or RHCSA first? I won't be able to get all three while I'm still in school, as this is on top of my regular school work, so I'll mainly be doing it this summer. 

I think I want to get into Linux administration eventually, but I would be okay taking either for my first job. I have also installed Ubuntu and been using that as my main OS lately just to get some exposure to Linux. 

Any and all advice in general on how to best maximize this time I have before graduating is appreciated as well. "

I'm a student majoring in film and media and I currently reside in Portland. I am going to school for film and media with an emphasis on TV Production. In the somewhat near future, I will need to get an internship and I'm really hoping to score an internship in Los Angeles. The only problem is that the place I am looking at usually wants someone with some type of production experience under their belt already.

This is where the core of my issue is. I have no idea where in Portland I could even begin looking for this type of experience. It cannot be a full-time or even part-time job, it would have to be a job as a PA or something for a few days a week and then break until I could find something else. I'm already working almost 40 hours a week at my current job and between that and school I simply don't have the time for another job. I need to keep the job I have now because it's paying for my school. 

So, can anyone point me in the right direction? Also, I have no car and rely on public transit since I don't make enough money to afford a car. Thanks."

4fast7,1,2016-04-18,feelings of cyclical depression,throwaway47019,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4fast7/feelings_of_cyclical_depression/,"I have no right to feel any of this. I have had lots of great opportunities and a supportive family. Yet, here I am, scraping by and screaming in my head.

I feel like my life is stuck in a cycle of starting off strong, then hitting a bump that triggers a downward spiral. Usually based around the turning of the seasons and semesters. I’m a college student studying civil Engineering. Usually the trigger is something small, like getting tired of or bored with studying/working and taking an hour or a night off when I shouldn’t. Then I feel bad about doing that and whatever bad consequences come out of it. Or sometimes the trigger is out of my control, like a hostile social interaction or an honest mistake that I worked hard enough to not make, but lost on the dice roll. Then I take the time off and it starts anyway. These cycles are long, sometimes with smaller ‘cycles’ within if something happens where I briefly get my shit together.

The two ends of the cycle are night and day. At the outset, I study hard, and get good grades to show for it. I start ambitious personal/other projects, and make good progress on them. At the end it has been as bad as barely being able to get out of bed in a day. That contrast is probably the worst part of it. Knowing that if I could find a way to get my shit together permanently, I could do really well for myself and help the people around me a lot more effectively. But instead I am struggling to survive.

(That covers the important bits, the rest is venting and context that I have never told anyone before)

None of this ever happened before I got to college, and I think I know why. I had a very tight, highly regimented schedule, and an extremely varied group of friends. I got about six hours of sleep a day, spent my afternoons on the trails with the distance guys, ate lunch and hung out before school with the theater and stage crew kids, could get lost in a variety of challenging subjects or good music (band class) throughout the day, and got out in the woods at least a couple times a year with the boy scouts. At the time I was actually annoyed with the theater kids asking me every single day how I was doing at lunch, I thought it was dramatic of them to talk about their personal problems with other people. Maybe it was to do it as often as they did, but now I don’t have to talk through emotional stuff like this with. I was never really interested in having a girlfriend, but lately I have been wanting one just to have someone to talk to. 

Not that there aren’t good things about college too. I definitely still have plenty of complicated problems I can chew on through my classes, and people to study them with. The ability to sleep eight hours a day and play video games/read books/whatever I want more than an hour or so a week is great too. Also the food is better. But losing friends to do more than study with and do basic hanging out with is more of a problem than I thought it would be. Most people in Engineering either just try to suppress everything or drink their problems away. That doesn’t work very well for me, clearly. I haven’t grown up with these people, but I have worked with them quite a bit. I just wish I had someone to talk to once in a while, you know?

That worst cycle happened the spring of my freshman year of college. At the end I slept twelve hours a day, but was always exhausted. Overate, but couldn’t taste any of it. Wasted more time than ever but was always stressed right up until I stopped feeling anything. I couldn’t motivate myself to do assignments, which spiraled into not getting motivated to go to classes (it’s funny how easily the brain justifies fucking up in advance but how difficult it is to find the motivation to take positive steps), which went to convincing myself to not even take a bunch of tests at the end because I had no chance anyway (by that time it was mostly legitimately true). At the end I failed every single class except one. A chem lab because I had to interact with other people regularly so to hide it I had to do the work. The only other mild success I had that semester was doing my job in the fraternity I had initiated in at the beginning of that semester, since that was part of hiding it as well (again, a very simple task, since I was in my first semester there-organizing the ordering of merchandise). Suicide was contemplated often. Fortunately I’m awful at knots and didn’t have access to firearms or industrial cleaning chemicals or a car. Of course even if I did I probably wouldn’t have done it because I’m such a coward.

This stress resulted in a minor stroke over spring break which I downplayed a ton to the doctor in the ER because I was embarrassed of my father (who had driven me) finding out about it. The downplay (or more accurately, lying about ‘recent stress’), along with my young age, resulted in nothing being done. I wish it had been that that woke me up to the problem. Or the failed classes. God, at the beginning of that semester I set out to get at least a B average, finish my first marathon in under 4 hours (finished it out of stubbornness, and the desire to hide the problem, but walked half of it in over 5 and a half hours), and actually start connecting with people in the house since the semester before I had not spent much time with them since I’m so socially inept. 

Instead I didn’t realize I had a problem until five months later when I was working a job whose interview I got out of a connection at the house (professional fraternity). I had started strong at the job, as I would soon realize was a pattern, but eventually something happened about three and a half months into a six month co-op, and I just stopped doing paperwork. I think the repetitive nature got me bored enough to start reading a book during breaks, and the cycle started as stated above. The job was extremely independent, with little oversite, so doing the field work and being on site every day kept the attention away for about another full month. Up until then I had gotten nothing but complements, from contractors, co-workers, supervisors and Engineers/managers higher up. When they found out I hadn’t been doing the paperwork the shit hit the fan super hard, since that of course left them open to all kinds of legal trouble. I wasn’t fired for some reason, and I liked my supervisor at the time a lot, and he monitored me close enough that I caught up on the paperwork (barely). I finished out the construction season with getting sent home at the same time as the other co-ops (although I was still not the first intern to be sent home due to lack of work-ND winters). I of course was not hired back the next summer, “choosing” to focus instead on hard math classes.

In the middle of that shit storm, during a shower, I saw very clearly my life diverting into two paths. Either I get my shit together on a long term basis and accomplish some great things with my life, or I continue on this path and eventually alienate everyone and die alone on the street somewhere. In my desperation, I tried meditation, since it wouldn’t require me to talk about my problems to anyone or get locked into a prescription to deal with the problem. It worked. Better than I could have possibly hoped for. The next day, I woke up feeling better than I had in several years. That was the initial feel-good, but the benefits persisted. Several weeks later, I thought I was cured, and stopped meditating (despite having read/heard about patients of depression/physical ailments going off their treatment and going right back to terrible), and started to spiral again. I quickly started again, and weird changes started happening eventually, a month or two later, now having finished the job and able to focus more on it for a few weeks over winter break, then going back into the school semester. I was rested after sleep. I tasted food again (I still remember that meal, scrambled eggs with ham and cheese, still eat that on a regular basis just to remind myself). Eventually I even started to forgive some of my past mistakes. But not one. Never the worst one.

In the spring after the end of that co-op, I found out about the results of that mistake. I had an unironic smile on my face from simply enjoying the weather, and enjoying being able to enjoy the weather. That was when I found out my friend from the house, the same one who had gotten me an interview for that job, had committed suicide. He was a veteran with severe PTSD, and when he was attending the university and living at the house, we were able to help him when he had severe flashbacks or bouts of depression (he was huge, and this sometimes resulted in drunken, angry, violence and property damage, pretty scary for everyone) (you could talk him down with comic books, which worked well in a house full of turbo nerds). Any fault lied mostly with me, since he had left the university and worked out of the same lab with me while I was out on the co-op for several weeks, and I clearly saw that he was deteriorating, having experienced and seen the symptoms in other people. I did and said nothing, even though I had ample opportunity to say something to him. Or I could have tried to talk to his family, or contact a veteran’s service. But I did nothing, and he ended up killing himself (after leaving to try a different job again) several months later, in a place where no one really knew him (probably thought running again like after leaving school would help). He got me my first real job, helped me through the pledging process, and I couldn’t even have a difficult conversation. 

Since then, I have had a series of more subdued sets of semester cycles. Meditation has become both a part of and trigger for the decline stage of the cycles. I get lazy and stop for a few nights, and that starts it, but when I do it consistently it helps a lot. Running consistently also seems to help, but that is one of the first things to go over the wayside as well. I slowly improved my grades, and got more accustomed to the people I now live with, and enjoyed a few things, but never so much as before I found out about his suicide. That is incredibly selfish, but every time I have had any success or a good time, the thought “you couldn’t even help your friend when he needed you the most” creeps in. I keep the funeral program to remind myself of him and my mistake. Right now I am looking at the end of a semester, and I have gotten worse than I have since that spring semester my freshman year again. I have once again failed a class due to depression, and am hiding it for as long as possible. I also dropped out of a class earlier in the semester due to difficulty and not being motivated to catch up, and recently I even didn’t contribute to a group project. What the hell. It’s just English class, but I’m supposed to be better than failing people who rely on me now. Now those people probably hate me, and justifiably so. 

Side note, I also took forever to find an internship this summer, due to not finding motivation to apply to very many, but when I finally did find one just a few days ago, it was because of the experience I got at that first internship that he got me. I will carry this to my grave. If there is a hell (I’m an atheist), I will am bound for it. Not that I’m scared. Dante lacked imagination, and if his version matches reality, there are far worse things here on earth, like depression, or being turned into a vegetable. 

In case you haven’t noticed yet, most of my self-worth comes from my work ethic and the results that come of it. I think that comes mostly from my dad. Almost every night growing up, I saw him come home from work tired, then make time to spend with us, help us with our stuff, eat dinner with us, etc. then go back to his day job late at night until two or three. He always told us we could do anything if we were willing to work hard enough for it. He also took most of his time off to spend with us, on camping trips or vacations or whatever. After his own series of accidents and illnesses put him in bed for a combined total of a year or so, he has started to even out somewhat, not working so many late nights any more, and taking a bit more time for himself, and allowing himself to have a beer once in a while (I never asked him why him and his side of the family never drinks, I probably should at some point). In addition, that led to me to mostly only see that side of people in real life, and characters in stories. My school was focused entirely on testing which reinforced that thought pattern (side note, fuck the vast majority of school administrators: reaction to a single streaker at a football game: take him to court, spend lots of money on case, highly publicize it. reaction to quickly escalating pattern of suicides: posters in hall). 

That led to my being slightly hostile to anyone who didn’t work almost unhealthily hard up until the first few months of college had passed, sometimes including my mother which still strains our relationship. When I ran for president of the fraternity at the end of last semester for example, I was beat out by someone who hadn’t worked anywhere near as hard as me for the benefit of the house, but has better social and leadership skills, which is really what the position is about. I was crushed, feeling like I’d had a core belief spat on, but didn’t realize that second part until later, that sometimes work ethic isn’t all that matters. 

I feel like a lot of my progress has been due to fear of making that same big mistake (inaction) again, or deteriorating back to where I was that spring semester of my freshman year, and being motivated primarily by fear isn’t how I want to live my life. I have high hopes if I could get my head in the right place for more than a few months. I would like to use my civil Engineering degree to help people on a larger scale, maybe volunteer for one of those organizations that works on bringing water to the developing world, or work on the hyperloop system or another ambitious human project to improve life for everyone. Doing that with challenging work that I enjoy and being able to reliably provide for myself and the people/causes closest to me is why I chose civil E. But none of that will happen if I can’t consistently keep my head in a good space.

TL:DR OP is cyclically fucked in the head and just wants someone to talk to about it/offer advice.

Has anyone dealt with a similar cyclical nature of problem, and what have you found to help with it, if anything?

I'm looking for some advice on realistic wage expectations, normally I wouldn't post so much information but... my work experience is as follows:

1. 4 years System Admin, 3 of which I was the shop lead. (Army experience if that matters)
2. 1 year owner/operator of a repair shop. (I failed at marketing myself)
3. 1 year as contractor ""intern"" at Intel.
4. 4 months working as regular intern at Intel (Review of Exceeds Expectations, I was told this is rare for an intern to get)
5. Another regular internship with Intel coming up over this summer.

As far as education goes:

1. I've an associates in Computer Information Systems. 
2. A certificate in Linux Network Administration. 
3. A Certificate in Database Administration. 
4. I'll be graduating with a Bachelors in Computer Science at the end of spring term next year. 

Realistically, I've built a network at Intel, and I feel I've got a good chance at being hired on at Intel as a Software Engineer in the Portland, Oregon area.

Does anyone care about my Sys. Admin Experience?
Does anyone care about my Linux/Database admin certs?

What should I expect as a starting salary? 

I was thinking of asking for $95,000 with the hopes of getting $85,000 - but I don't know if I'm lowballing, or highballing, and payscale.com is no help."

when I was in high school I loved to experiment with some overclocking (never extreme but had a lot of fun) and I have always built my own pc. However, with university, exchange programs abroad, master's, internships, etc. I haven't had a desktop pc in a lot of years.

Now I finally have a decent job that will allow me, in a couple months, to buy a decent gaming pc: I'm planning to spend around 1500 euros at first, excluding the monitor (I still have a honest samsung 26""), and add a better monitor and a second video card a few months later. FYI I am based in Italy, I used to know a few shops in town with the best prices but at the moment amazon.it seems the cheapest.

TL;DR could you please help me out with the build? I need a power supply that will be able to handle a SLI even if I will start with only 1 video card since it's so expensive, and a good cooler (not sure whether to go for air or water, never had water before, but I would like to go for some mild overclocking), and a monitor: I'm thinking 1440p (no need for crazy latencies since I don't plan on competitive online gaming, but I am not sure if 144Hz is worth it), any comments regarding this (and the rest of the build) are appreciated. I also have no clues about the cases: I don't really care about looks, anything with enough space, good airflow and on the cheap side will do.

There are two main companies in Malta, Melita and Go, and I inquired at Melita over e-mail for a price and they offered me €23.50 a month for three months and then moving up to €30 for the remainder of my time here, which I agreed to.

The engineer came and installed my hub and I signed the contract which looked fine to me, the guy was in a hurry so we finished up. Cut to two months later and I've been given a bill of €35 a month instead of €23.50, I inquired and they sent back saying it is what I signed in the contract, which I know puts me in a situation.

Anything I can do here? I agreed to one price but I'm now being charged more than expected, I can provide information if needed and our e-mail correspondence if needed.

THE 4TH-DIMENSION PSYCHEDELIC SUPER FROG

------


Have you seen the TED talk about the 4th dimension psychedelic super frog? The crazy old scientist that humiliated himself in front of the whole world? I know all about him, I've got his documents and recordings, and his video journal. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with them yet, but he’s not as bad as he looked on the TED talk, he had a pretty good reason to be paranoid. 


At seventy he was this disgraced scientist who knew he was overdue for dementia, the affliction having struck both his father and grandfather in their late fifties, so that his daily routine was filled with strange tests to his memory and critical faculties like counting and balancing and other processes in his every morning’s anticipation for whatever madness might be creeping at the edge of his vision. He turns on the camera, does the alphabet backwards like a sobriety test, counts his fingers, touches his nose with his eyes shut, lists colours and dates, then panics when he stumbles or gets something wrong.


So it was against the clock that he decided to salvage his reputation among the science community and rebuild his legacy and that of his demented lineage by pursuing his theories regarding a seemingly immortal species of frog that he thought could read his mind, or rather, a frog that died only after its predictable natural lifespan and not, it would seem, at the hands of the myriad natural predators of its surroundings despite the amphibian’s careless nature, nor by confused and frustrated trappers who left the island empty-handed (even as indigenous children were known to hold and play with the coveted frogs), so that although they were thick and meaty, brightly coloured, casually tempered, and totally without any natural defences to speak of, predators seemed to grudgingly obey some cosmic rule to leave them well alone even as they appeared so numerous and casual, languishing so closely, so trustingly, even resting near and even on the backs of panthers or the snouts of crocodiles.


Except the old man knew there was no rule. These carnivores simply learned not to waste their breath trying to lunge or claw or snap at the frogs because they were supernaturally impossible to harm, somehow predicting the very impulse and shambling away unhurried. This local legend had become an obsession for the old man and he resolved to spend his remaining life and life-savings on the study of these precious frogs that he might prove to the world what they were capable of and, perhaps, be the first clever enough to trap a specimen. 


He employs an intern named Tammy, who he discovered studying the habitat of the indigenous people around the island, admittedly unconvinced by the old man’s theories as she figures frogs are just real super difficult to catch—


No. They are not. Look at my machines, he insists. Even with my tools and creativity they evade me, yet look at them! Sitting there, sitting everywhere, watching me! I can step among them so very closely but if I dare stomp one there simply isn’t one close enough to stomp! These are not natural creatures. And, he only now realizes, it’s not that they can read his mind and understand his intentions, but that they predict his physical actions and the consequences of his super complicated traps, the hidden snares that even he sets off in error.  Traps designed so cleverly that no human could spot them, so that Tammy naively avoids his marked-off sections of swampland altogether, as if the old man restrains himself to trapping only marked-off sections, as if he would be so foolish.


Then, after finally setting the area around a pond on fire only to find the frogs who live there just happened to have abandoned it already, the old man faces his reflection in the water and the terrible fear that he may have lost his mind already. Except, just like that, an explanation occurs to him… that these frogs somehow exist outside of time, that they transcend the fourth dimension. With mad enthusiasm he hurries to Tammy’s tent, unzipping it without warning or permission. She scrambles away, hiding something beneath her coat.


On a piece of paper he shows her a crude maze scribbled in pencil around a little figure marked TAMMY in the centre, and urges her to solve the puzzle, handing her the pencil to do it. But, she says, there’s no way out. The wall around the maze is unbroken.


Precisely! You see, picture this drawing as vector flat, limited to only two dimensions. Your likeness on the page can’t escape these halls, she’s stuck as you have observed but she doesn’t know that without exploring. She can’t see beyond the walls I’ve indicated. But we can, can’t we? We can move over them from above, from the third dimension, we can see the entire maze laid out around her. We can see the turns ahead and those she’s left behind! This is our advantage, and that’s how these frogs see us! 


He stops, he can see in her face that she’s not paying attention, that she’s hiding something from him. He yanks her away and to his horror a frog is simply sitting there. It hops once, twice, then out of the tent and away.


“I”m sorry,” she mutters.


“Your tent was closed when I came… wasn’t it?”


“Yes, I should have called you. It wasn’t that hard to catch, though. I’ll yell for you next time.”


“No you won’t.”


“I will.”


“Then there is no next time. Don’t you understand? The frog saw the way in and the way out all at once. Make no mistake, it doesn’t gamble with its life.”


“But I was able to close the tent and trap—”


“You closed nothing. What were you doing with it?”


“I… licked it,” she said. “It’s quite wonderful, the effect. Just as the tribe says. This strange calm, and clarity. I know it hasn’t solved my life’s problems but they do seem to diminish, like little obstacles to step around. It sort of puts things in perspec—”


“You’re rambling on and on,” he said, and left her tent.


And over the next few months he quickly loses his mind, not to dementia but out of sheer frustration. He resorts deliberately forgetting the traps he lays out, preparing them absently in case the frogs do access his mind that his mind won’t know how to avoid the traps it set. Until one day he finally runs short of funding and (looking upon his most costly and inconspicuous machine whose active trap area of lush swampland could be measured by the sharp line of contented frogs incomprehensibly avoiding it) decides to quit. 


So it was that on the day he began to pack his bags to leave, that one of the precious frogs sprung at him from a ledge, giving him such a shock that he fell backward springing a trap which sprung another trap which sprung yet a third trap but in the end to his astonishment he held the frog in his hand. Other frogs just watched as his hand trembled not to let it go, yet not to crush it, finding it terribly difficult to balance between the two imperatives.


Getting up he gingerly navigates between other possible traps, sweating profusely and abandoning his bags for the rented jeep. The old man catches the first flight back to the city with his precious colourful frog impossibly trapped inside a simple tupperware container. So impossible that he risks everything to peek in on the creature to be sure this is really happening. On the ground at great length he convinces the organizers of an annual science conference to allow him a lecture to prove to the world the existence of frogs from the fourth dimension and his lecture is approved and so titled on the condition that if he fails to prove his claim he will be prepared to follow up with a candid Q&amp;A about dementia, its symptoms, and how it may or may not have affected his recent work in the rainforest.


He thanks the woman on the phone and hangs up as a sudden pang of guilt is followed by the striking thought that perhaps the frog had meant to save his life. Staring fretfully into the glass of the frog’s aquatic prison, the roof of which now bound with tape and rope and braced by a cinderblock, the old man picks up the phone and calls Tammy. Then before he can start she explains how the frogs on the island are behaving in very peculiar ways, how even those among the indigenous people rumoured to be pure of heart and intentions were no longer able to cradle or lick the them. How the people seemed to specifically blame him and even her and the traps and junk left all over and—


The old man hangs up and finds the frog watching him, “what are they doing? are they trying lure me back to the island? Do they think I’m meant to go? You shouldn’t be so sure. I’m determined to stay here, to do the lecture, with you. Make no mistake, this is going to happen.”


And so, over the remaining weeks before the event, the old man becomes increasingly creative with his behaviour, deciding to become unpredictable even to himself, even hundreds of miles from the island, even safe in his own home, his own city — totally erratic and bizarre in every passing decision or micro decision, that if his future isn’t fixed, if the map they see is in any kind of flux, this was the least he could do to scramble their predictions, that he would do precisely what he wouldn’t ever do, but without a visible pattern of precisely things he wouldn’t do, even often asking himself, “what wouldn’t I do?” and “what would I do?” and “whatever lies between that I might do instead?”


He gets off one bus at random only to get on another bus at also random, he removes one of his mismatched slippers (since wearing them on the wrong feet seems not sufficiently unlike wearing them on the right feet, since they belong on feet either way). It makes no difference where he goes, he thinks, only that it takes up time to go there, time between now and the TED talk, time that he knows doesn’t affect them…


Who? somebody asks. Whatever are you doing down there?  They say, let go of me! Put that down! Get out! What is wrong with you? They ask, why are you here? Why have you come? Why are you calling me? 


Well, he tells them, I’m trying to confuse the 4th dimension frogs because I don’t want anything to get in the way of my Ted talk. It isn’t difficult, I just have to remain in the city. I’m not going back to the island, do you understand? Do you understand me?


But nobody’s there, so he calls Tammy again. Was there any sedative in the traps that might harm him? That an allergy might make poisonous? Could it not be that the frog saved my life? Is that what happened? Please, it could have been so simple, maybe just a fall. What did that frog see? Do I owe it my life? What did it prevent? I must know.


The day of the lecture he puts his debt to the frog out of mind and reaches the conference sharply paranoid of his own brain and whatever the frog might know that it doesn’t. On the stage he unveils the animal on a table where it regards him with, he supposes, what you might expect the wisdom of the fourth dimension to look like on the face of a frog, mixed, perhaps, with a bit of disappointment in him specifically. And he invites the audience to look upon the legendary psychedelic super frog that has never been caught or consumed before a naturally occurring death until now.


He invites a woman from the crowd and presents her with a terrible mallet, ordering her to strike down upon the harmless creature so she might obliterate it. She laughs, I couldn’t possibly! It’s such a sweet little thing!


Ah yes, but I assure you, Pam from Chicago, that this frog is not restrained to this world, not this universe, not even this dimension. It is not afraid of you, it’s met you before, it’s dodged your mallet strike already! This frogs movements and decisions aren’t made in a linear sequence, it exists tomorrow just as it does yesterday and it does it all right now! What I mean is, you’ve already swung the mallet and missed.


So as the confused woman raises the mallet above her head a series of thoughts occur to the old man. The first, that the frog saved his life knowing that he would betray it and expose it as supernatural. That a media frenzy would result in some agency destroying the island to examine the species, a species that lived so contentedly, so harmoniously, even controlling its own population density and now, thanks to the old man, none of its kind would be safe from scrutiny again. And how the frog must have known all this when it surrendered.


Thinking this, the old man still doesn’t intervene. He lets the woman swing to save his career and his reputation before dementia can claim his mind, certain that otherwise all his journals and surveillance recordings to date would resemble the Sasquatch footage of a madman or, at best, a composite digitally compromised to make frog behaviour look unusual, frogs that appear in the coloured pixels only as deft at escaping predators at the very last minute as a pigeon, perhaps when you try to hit one with your bicycle.
 

However, the woman with the mallet deliberately strikes off the mark on the table by several inches, unable to commit to bludgeon such an innocent little frog and the old man watches in mounting horror as the frog compensates with the smallest jump into the mallet’s trajectory, a super-calculated little hop to be perfectly blasted into a smear of beautiful rainbow-coloured frog innards. The woman gasps and drops the mallet and shakes glowing entrails off her skirt that shot out of the amphibian’s ruptured body. 


The old man staggers and drops. He looks into the bewildered audience in a whirling daze, “I’m not insane, it chose this, it just killed itself. I’m not insane!” 


Stifled, confused laughter in the crowd before a second speaker appears to introduce an unexpected question period and set up a queue. 


On the stage the woman whispers, “what have I done? I killed a frog.” 


A young man from the audience leans into the microphone, “uh hi, I’m just wondering why you thought the frog couldn’t be hurt, or uh… why the frog would want to hurt itself? Could you explain more?”


Behind the old man’s glasses his big eyes plead against the faceless crowd, “to make me look foolish. To discredit my work. You see?”


And so the old man’s reputation as a thinking, capable man of science officially ends, and rumours of a frog that cannot be caught or killed are debunked by a popular TED talk depicting a captive frog’s exploding death and the subsequent comedic remixes on internet forums juxtaposing the old man’s boldest claims with too-close photography of the supposed all-knowing frog’s vibrant guts disclosed onto a frightened woman’s skirt - gaining sufficient internet exposure that supernatural claims are widely disregarded. 


With his shoes on properly the old man returns to the island of the frogs to find them gathered as if to greet him, their skin luminescent in evening twilight. And he kneels, frowning, and says he’s sorry, that the frog had to die to save the island, he’s sorry.


He sits and they hop around him. Hop into his lap. He picks one up, knowing how it knows he wouldn’t hurt it. But not knowing it himself, grimacing as his hand squeezes gently, teasing the idea that he might. Couldn’t he? Just now? Couldn’t he crush it in his hand? Is it so against his nature to do so? Is the future the frog can see so totally certain that he wouldn’t close his fist on its little body even to just to prove it isn’t? That he can’t be predicted? That he can do as he wants and squeeze its dumb, careless eyes out of its little head? To teach it to fear? That there are things to fear. Does it not concern the frog how closely he is to doing it? Why not? Because he won’t? He can’t? Why can’t he?


But as the frog has predicted, the old man lets it go… and weeps.


Then something strange happens. A sensation of something creeping closer, something looking in on him from above. Not above, but outside. It grips him with fright, whatever it is. Dementia? Is it happening? Has he lost his mind? Is this what that feels like? 


But no, it’s a wolf. Ripping through the shadows to snatch two frogs whole in its jaws and crush their glowing guts between its teeth. Another frog caught beneath its paw just as easily as that. The old man yelps. His heart broken. Terrified, not of the wolf, but that the all-seeing frogs didn’t see it coming. How they’d been so easy to catch, like ordinary frogs. No, worse.


Until he sees its eyes… smoking pitted eyes that smoulder with what could only be the wisdom of a fifth dimension timber wolf. A wolf that dips into the fourth dimension to satisfy its taste for the thin illuminating skin of rainbow-gutted frogs. This immortal being, grey and spectral in the dark, could only be visible to human eyes in the third dimension while reaching into the fourth snatch up unwitting frogs that now scramble and leap and flee frantically from the forest clearing. Terrified and clumsy in a way the old man has never known them to behave, no matter how loudly he stomped in their direction, no matter how he screamed and stomped and meant to scare them.


The old man sits alone as the wolf pulls and snaps at strips of the frog beneath its paw and then, satisfied, folds backward, seemingly out of existence - to wherever fifth dimension timberwolves go.


Or so the old man explains in his last recording, including in his documents some looping nighttime footage of him drunkenly pushing over scaffolding in frustration. I enhanced the footage with my computer, and sure enough, flipping between frames, you can see how the frogs in range of the tipped scaffold stir and shuffle at their leisure before he even enters the clearing to tip it. Those the scaffolding would have crushed rest just out of harm's way, and though it lands inches from them all around, they don't even flinch.

4fc0qa,5,2016-04-18,[Spoilers] Who Sent the Email?,Kush_Daz,thegfexperience,https://www.reddit.com/r/thegfexperience/comments/4fc0qa/spoilers_who_sent_the_email/,"After watching this series one thing that I really found to be very intriguing was the mysteries that were left for the viewers to figure out. One being whether or not Christine sent an email of herself having sex(/escorting) to her co-workers and family. I think it is one of the most beautifully written mysteries ever to be shown on TV. I feel like episodes 1-8 were just a set up for and INTENSE Episode 9, and it is phenomenal.

So who sent the email? It could be one of 4 people. The show gives each of these 4 characters motive to have sent the email. 

#Major Spoilers Incoming for people who haven't finished the series as yet: 

**The Private Investigator** - So one of Christine's client died and left her $500,000 in her will. Long story short the man's family didn't want her to have the money, so they hire a private investigator to investigate Christine and find evidence that she is indeed a prostitute. Well the evidence was found and the Investigator threaten to out her if she ever tries to claim the money. Even though he seems like he is capable of hacking email accounts he is the least likely to have done it since Christine didn't try to claim the money.

**Jacqueline** - Christine started working for Jacqueline's escorting company at first before she started going off on her own. We have already seen how Jacqueline reacts to disloyalty through her relationship with Avery. Most likely she didn't though since she would've need to have access to the hotel room to place a camera and video tape Christine and Jack having sex. But I just have this feeling you can't leave her out of the scenario. 

**Jack** - He was the one having sex with Christine in the video. He is one of Christine's client that became very obsessed with her to the point where he thought she was his girlfriend. Christine broke it off, and of course he pretty much became a stalker. He indeed could have sent it out of jealousy, the guy is a prick.

**Christine** - Imo this is the most likely scenario, even if she didn't send it I think it was too amazing how she quickly made the best out of a bad situation and used the video as a way to make money. She was a intern at the law firm, she learned that her boss at the law firm was involved in a scam, she proceeded to sleep with her boss and record them having sex as leverage, I thought her main goal was to acquire a position at the law firm and I guess she was going to blackmail her boss into getting that. But the sex tape got released and I thought it was definitely not her, but then I saw her recording all her co-workers reactions, which would be great evidence if she ever filed a lawsuit which she did. So the sex tape would be a perfect set up for that. Plus there is also the fact that she likes being watched, but it's kinda fucked up she would send the video to her family too right? 

I am definitely going to give this series a re-watch, it is so brilliantly done. "

Red streaks of electricity covered the woman's hands, shifting, twisting and circling each other as they slithered over her brown skin. They flowed down her arms and caused sparks to jump off her fingers, leaving a faint smell of ozone behind.

The woman was older than me, but still in her late twenties. Her green dress had dark patches where the electricity had burnt the cloth, but she had learnt to control it quite fast, all things considered, and the streaks now danced harmless over the dress.

She was laughing. It was a merry, carefree laugh, the kind that reminded me of Christmas mornings, of being a kid and staring at a mountain of wrapped presents, full of possibilities.

And why not laugh? She had just won the Talents Lottery. Big time.

I glanced around, at our little group of humans. Most of them were looking at the woman with frustrated, jealous expressions. As I watched, a couple turned and left the group, walking back the way we had come. Back to the portal. Back to Earth.

I felt a pang of sympathy for them. A trip off-world was expensive, even now, and some of these people would have been saving for years for this. Just to get here, to the Arrivals terminal on Sanctuary Nova. Just to play this Lottery once, for that elusive one in five chance of becoming something else, something greater. Of gaining a brand new life.

Our group was in a corner of the Arrivals terminal, cordoned off from the rest of the traffic by a rope barrier. It would be completely ineffective against any talented human, of course, but it did seem to give a false sense of security to the alien crowd that walked by the other side, glancing at us and the powered woman with curiosity.

I had never seen so many different species mixed together: Sulcis, Vhriss, Zortans, Altajans... green scales mixed with silvery skins, heads covered in fur, large decorative red feathers... I could have spent hours just watching the crowd walk past, staring at the creatures in it. And by the stares I got, the sentiment seemed reciprocal. Most of them would have never seen a human in the flesh, let alone *six* of them, with a flashy display of electricity thrown in for good measure.

I repositioned the backpack over my right shoulder, feeling the weight move inside it. I couldn't stop and stare. Not here. This was a transit area. You were supposed to either walk back to the portal -like the couple who had just left-, or walk forward up to the customs kiosks. I exhaled sharply, gathering my courage. With my right hand, I reached for my trolley case, and started walking forward.

I was only half way to the nearest kiosk when a door to my right opened. Another human stepped out of it, this one covered head to toe in a blue and black armor suit that only left the lower part of his shaved face visible. He was a Paragon, of course. I didn't even need to look at the patch on his shoulder to know that.

He walked by my side, giving me a quick once over, and ignoring me in favor of the electrical woman. I didn't recognize the hero, which wasn't that surprising, given that I was entering the most populous city in civilized space. Even if humans didn't even rank as a minority in Sanctuary Nova, there were still far more talented heroes and villains in this city than anyone could ever dream of memorizing.

In any case, I had learnt at least who the top guns were. And this wasn't one of them. I watched him walk up to the woman and put a hand on her shoulder. Gentle, amiable. He pointed towards a door at the end of the terminal, and they both started walking in that direction.

I knew what would come next. They would sit in a bare room, just two chairs and a table. He would offer her a drink, then a job. A lifetime position in the Paragon Guild. She would accept, of course, that was why she had played the Lottery in the first place. She would join the training program, then choose a destination among any of the alien worlds. Or perhaps she would stay here in this very city. She would fight villains, save people from disasters... become a hero.

She could always refuse, of course. But that meant walking back through the portal, back to old boring Earth, where she wouldn't have access to her newfound power, her talent. Under the Human Quarantine Act, no talented humans were allowed to leave Earth without a permission from the Paragon Guild. Doing so, trying to infiltrate an alien world if you were a talented human... well, that's the kind of thing that puts you squarely into the ""villain"" category.

It wasn't lost on me that this was precisely was I was trying to do.

I reached the kiosk, where the male customs officer looked surprised to see me. He was an artajan, with a broad humanoid shape and a gray, almost silvery smooth skin. His white uniform was ruffled and had dry yellow stains. I wondered for a second whether being assigned to the human area was some kind of punishment for his unkemptness, or if it was the other way around, and being around humans was the reason for his lack of care.

He pronounced a word, guttural. My smartband picked it up and translated it on the fly, replacing the sound in my ears with a far more understandable one.

""Name?""

""Maika Hadden,"" I replied.

He paused for a moment, looking at his screen. My heart was beating fast, but I tried to keep a neutral face. I didn't know how much he could read of human expression, but some tells were universal. Fidgeting hands, eyes darting around... He wasn't shouting, at least, and no one was running to arrest me, which meant my fake records *had* been successfully planted into the database, after all. A good start.

He looked at me, eyes narrowing. ""Any talents?""

""No,"" I lied.

He nodded, going back to the screen. ""Purpose of travel?""

""Work. I have an internship at Azcatech for the next six months.""

He frowned, or did what passed for a frown in his species, the eyes moving slightly downwards. I knew he was suspicious. It wasn't common for a company to hire ""just"" a normal, untalented human. But it wasn't unheard of, either.

""Did they give you an ID card?""

""Sure,"" I put a fake smile on my face. ""Want to see it?""

""Yes.""

The moment of truth.

I reached with my right hand into my jacket's pocket, and grabbed the piece of cardboard. It was just a blank, white piece of cardboard, with nothing written on it. But as the tip of my fingers touched its surface, I activated my talent.

I pictured the ID card. Its dimensions, its surface, its weight. The background a faint blue. Thin black lines framed by the trimmed corners. The stylized gears from the Azcatech logo. My name in print letters, both in Mutual and English. My position in the company: ""Intern / A33"". My ID code: ""RTI-2-47816"". I visualized the picture of my face on the upper left corner. A 19 years old human girl, smiling at the camera. Fair complexion, straight eyebrows, brown eyes. Dark short hair. No, better to have long hair. Yes, throw in a big difference, something to hide the small mistakes, how my eyes weren't as close together in real life, how the proportions were slightly off.

I composed the picture in my mind, and then willed it into the cardboard. I *nudged* the object, forcing it to become what I had pictured. I felt it shift in my hand as it grew wider and shorter, felt its surface become smoother. By the time I removed the piece from my pocket and placed it on the kiosk's counter, it *was* an ID card. A complete reproduction. An almost perfect forgery. An illusion, yes. But one so detailed, so complete, that the universe itself would take it for real.

That was how my sister had called it once. *Lying to the universe.* Make the lie detailed enough, compelling enough, and the universe itself would buy it.

For a time, that is. It wouldn't last, not if I wasn't touching it, keeping the lie alive. It would dispel in just a few moments. But it should be enough.

The artajan officer took the card -the forgery- and examined it, his eyes switching from the plastic piece to my face, then back to the piece. He then focused on his screen for several endless seconds, while his hands touched the input board, tapping icons I couldn't see. At last, he placed the forgery on the counter and slid it back to me.

I grabbed the ID card, making sure my movement wasn't rushed. As if I had all the time in the world. As if it wouldn't turn back into a blank piece of cardboard any second now. Slowly, I put it back in my pocket, and let the illusion vanish once it was out of sight.

The officer looked back at me.

""Are you aware of the terms and conditions of the Human Quarantine Act of 2027?""

""Yes, I am.""

""In the event of developing an extra-natural talent,"" he said, reading off the screen, ""you will immediately contact the relevant authorities, or the closest representative of the Human Paragon Guild, and put yourself in their custody until you can be safely transferred to your world of origin. You will not engage in unsupervised use of any extra-natural talents, at any time or place, under penalty of imprisonment. Is that clear?""

""Yes, it is.""

He nodded, and pointed the way forward. ""Welcome to Sanctuary Nova.""

I grabbed the handle of my trolley case again and walked past the kiosk. My motions were jerky, and my body felt ready to bolt, to jump, to run. Full of adrenaline. This had been too easy. I felt it had to be a ruse. My heart was beating faster now than during the brief interrogation.

As I walked pasted the corner, I almost expected to run straight into two or three Paragon heroes, waiting in ambush to arrest me.

But there was no one. I kept walking, and felt my heart calm again. I smiled. A natural, true smile this time. I got a few curious glances as I joined the crowd of aliens who waited to exit the building. The busy traffic of a Gateway Network Terminal building in a large city. My translator tried to keep pace with the myriad conversations and alien words that surrounded me, but it gave up fast, letting me hear the chirps, whistles, clicks and gurgles in their original forms.

I walked through the tall entrance of the building and out into the city itself. Ground vehicles were parked in front of the terminal, people getting in and out of them. A large skyshuttle waited nearby, its four engines rumbling, ready to engage and jump into the air. I gazed at the buildings across the wide avenue in front of the terminal. Tall buildings whose walls mixed sleek glass and steel panes and more traditional materials such as concrete and bricks. A strange blend. My eyes moved upwards, following the narrowing shape of the buildings.

And then I froze.

I had read about it, of course. ""Sanctuary Shock"". The irrational, almost religious burst of panic some newcomers experienced when arriving to the city. I had thought myself immune. I had lived in London and Shanghai, after all. I was no provincial girl. How different could this be?

I couldn't have been more wrong.

Saying Sanctuary Nova was just a city was like saying a planet was just a ball of dirt. Completely true, and yet utterly wrong. No, Sanctuary wasn't just a city. It was a tridimensional urban sprawl wrapped unto itself. A megalopolis of impossible angles. An aberration. Rows upon rows of buildings and skyscrapers filled my view, forming canyons of concrete, steel and glass, through which dozens of drones and skyshuttles zipped by at worrying speeds... Noisy, harsh, alien, bustling, moving, breathing...

Far in the distance, the ground curved upwards, the city itself rising and becoming vertical, then wrapping all the way up over my head. I was inside an immense cylinder, of monstrous proportions, set to rotate around its long axis to create a semblance of gravity. And the city filled every square inch of its inner surface.

I made the mistake of looking straight up, and a sense of vertigo invaded me. Where the sky should have been I could only see a square grid of distant city blocks, as if I was a bird flying over New York City, and had just looked down. I felt a distinct fear, one that I remembered from when I was a kid, laying on the ground and looking at the blue sky. The thought that I was just *clinging* to the ground and that, should I let go, I would plummet upwards and crash into that distant city.

I wrapped my arms around my body and closed my eyes. All I wanted was to grab the ground, crawl, make sure I wouldn't fall. Instead, I took a deep breath, and opened my eyes again, making sure not to look up.

People were gazing at me as they walked past. I couldn't blame them, I must have looked like the stereotypical tourist from a farming world. Wide eyes and open mouth, about to have a bad case of Sanctuary Shock.

Except they weren't looking at me with pity, amusement, or even annoyance. No, their gazes were furtive and cautious. And they were giving me a wide berth.

They were scared of me.

Them. The ones whose species had engineered this very place. Who had built the Gateway Network, linking hundreds of worlds. The ones who had conquered nature, space and relativity. Them. They were afraid of the short human girl.

I couldn't help it. It was so absurd I had to laugh.

My outburst gained me more stares and a wider berth. Now I wasn't just a dangerous human girl, I was a potentially deranged one too. I laughed harder.

Then, a second revelation hit me. They weren't really scared of *me*. No. It was the potential, the talents. They were scared of what I could potentially do. Of what humans could do. And with that, I remembered something I had read once, sometime ago. Something that sobered me up.

The leading cause of death among talented humans was... other talented humans.

I took a deep breath, clearing my head, focusing on the moment, the here and now. What my next steps were. I started walking again, carrying my trolley case and my backpack, and putting the hood of my jacket up. It wasn't a perfect concealment, sure, but my hair was the telltale sign that I was a human. At least this way I wouldn't stand out that much in the crowd.

I kept walking, getting deeper into the city.

So the gf and I have been together for little over 1/2 years (19 months now) 

I think it's fair to address a couple core issues first before getting to the DB part.

My s/o is bisexual and bipolar, she takes seroquel for it and afaik it lowers one's libido, however, this hasn't actually hindered our sex life before, so even though I think it should be mentioned, I do not think this is where the issue stems from.

Whenever we would go out clubbing, with mates or just the two of us, there would always be a 50/50 chance after getting some alcohol in her, she would get extremely abusive for no reason, she would always try to hit on women in a club, and I didn't have a problem with this, she knew it turned me on, and I was okay with it, but it got to a point where she would give random women more intimate attention than she had given me since the first couple of months we were dating.

It would be 4AM we'd have to go, or she would just stay somewhere lurking instead of being with the people we came with, she'd say give me 5 minutes, 30 minutes later she'd still neglect us and make up reasons, throw a tantrum outside that would end up in throwing whatever ammunition she had against me at me, embarrassing in front of my friends, my neighbours, etc.

I would do everything for her, I wake her up for college when she stays over at my place, *always* make breakfast in bed for her, take her out for dinner every 13th of the month, listen to her, and I mean actually listen, help her as best as I can with whatever is bothering her in her life.

Now, six months ago we got into a big fight, that resulted in ""the talk"" the day after, I didn't want to hurt her, leave her, but I was on a breaking point, so, after having really talked everything through that all went well, felt like we started over...

Now, to the DB part, the past two months or so, whatever I do, however I try to start foreplay, she would reject me, when we would get back home from something she'd say ""I'm sorry but I don't want to have sex tonight"" and for me, that hurts, because, as many of you probably feel too, it's not just about the sex, sex with a person that quite clearly isn't enjoying it is no fun, it's about being **INTIMATE** with one another.

I told her this, and I told her I was hurting, but she took it this time as if I was some sort of pervert, that the tension to have sex has gotten too big, like she was guilted into having sex with me, and in her words ""set the bar too high to actually comfortably have sex"" just because I mentioned after the sixth time she'd rejected me it was hurting me, I didn't feel wanted, I genuinely felt I did something wrong, and in her words, just bringing it up was the issue. So I hadn't brought it up in 2 weeks, she came over this weekend, friday to today, did not talk about it, did not try to woo her, but every single night, and every single morning after waking her up with breakfast in bed, I would try to caress her body and go a little lower, she'd just flat out say ""I'm tired"" and that would be the brickwall excuse to not get intimate, after taking her out for dinner, after having spend the entire day with her niece taking photographs of them (my job is photography, freelance but I make enough to pay for my living expenses, all pro bono of course because family) getting home, I'm tired, watch netflix with her, ""no; tired""...

I feel terrible, I hate myself for wanting to have more intimacy with her.When we goodnight kiss, little french kiss, then she does this final kiss thingy and pushes me away, because I tried to get intimate with her... I sigh, and she genuinely gets upset for making her feel bad for not wanting to get intimate, she literally gets angry and upset, expressing her feelings about me SIGHING and feeling rejected for not having any intimacy anymore, as if she is the only person to have the right to feel upset about something, I would not even have said anything, but the mere fact I would feel rejected would trigger her to get upset with me, and it'll show the next day.

So yeah, little over the place as I anticipated, and for that I apologise, and if I'm a spaz that has 0% self reflection and can't see I'm the one with the problem, please do tell me, tell me that I'm a twat for having these feelings, because it has been eating away at me, apart from all this, this weekend was pretty great, we went to a talkshow, she had an appointment with the producer for an internship, afterwards we had drinks, we talked a lot as we usually do, and we are really genuinely still very much in love, when I first saw her friday, in her beautiful formal cloths, my heart skipped a beat and I was so happy to see her again, and even though I am already anticipating the ""you're young, you're not fit for each other, abandon ship"" replies, and if they're detailed enough I might take into consideration, or rather, use it as food for thought, I don't think I can, I know with her bipolar it would absolutely crush her and because next school year will be her last year, I'm afraid she could possibly throw that in the bin if I broke up with her... 

Anyway, yeah, just writing this out has been therapeutic for me, so thanks for that, even if no one reads this / replies.

#**Calibration and Correlation** 

Throughout this post, I’ll frequently describe my wife’s actions. Applying concepts from NMMNG and WISNIFG means decoupling my judgement of myself from her judgement of me, but as is frequently stated around here, she is a reflection of me and filling the container I provide. I have consciously not adjusted my MAP in response to her actions, but observing her response to my changes and using that data as feedback has been effective when refining my tactical actions. I’m not doing anything specifically so she will fuck me, but when she does fuck, I pay attention to what I did that worked. I am mindful of her macro response because eventually it will be her response (or lack of) to my action that determines if I continue my married relationship with her. 


##**Background**

As much as I’d like to be a former drunk captain, I’m a career beta when it comes to women. I’ve always been “alpha as fuck” among my male friends (leader of activities, captain of sports teams, organizer of trips, etc.). But, with women (and girls) since early elementary school, I was the textbook Nice Guy. I had a few very hot girlfriends in Highschool, but I was too “respectful” of them (I was too much of a pussy) to do anything past third base, so nothing ever lasted long. Interestingly, I was never able to date a girl at my own school, only girls from other schools. **[RED PILL LESSON]** It’s clear now that I was initially attractive and mysterious, but once they spent some time with me and experienced my supplicating ways, it turned out that I was also unattractive and had zero game- just a beta who was pleasant to look at (facepalm). I literally ripped off the crux moves from many teen-romance, nice-guy-gets-the-hot-girl movies and tried to pull that shit with girls I liked. How’s that for some shit to own? Of course I got rejected and would “make some (other) girl really happy one day.” **[RED PILL LESSON]** looking back, it was a huge cover contract and I was enraged at the time; it’s too funny to hold any anger over.         

##**Oneitis and College**

The week after graduation, I made out with the hottest girl in my group of friends, who I’d had a crush on since freshman year, a month later we had sex (first for both of us). Then we fucked every day for the next few months. It was awesome. **[RED PILL LESSON]** I realized that during that time, I was definitely the AMOG and drove the party train among my social group all summer. I was a state-champion swimmer and working as a lifeguard so I was tall, jacked, and tan, I likely had a lot of preselection and dread going because I worked with a bunch of young hotties. But because of my definite oneitis, I didn’t realize any of that. I also remember never explicitly defining what would happen at the end of the summer when we went to different colleges. I never defined my commitment because I was scared of facing the reality of “losing” her, but she probably saw it unconsciously that I wasn’t committing and she could earn it with sex.

We went to separate colleges, me away and her in town, but continued to be exclusive and during visits home we would fuck like crazy, all ways, all places, all times. She would borrow friends’ clothes and dress slutty for our dates. **[RED PILL LESSON]** She didn’t know WTF I was up to when I was out of town and probably hamstered all sorts of things. In fact, during one of my blue-pill victim pukes while trying to negotiate some sex later in life, she said she was scared that I wouldn’t like her if we didn’t have a bunch of sex in those days.

After a year, she transferred to my college and even into my same major. Now that we were around each other ALL THE DAMN TIME, sex dropped off to once per week with all the usual excuses that old married women use. Sex became starfish nearly all the time and she didn’t like to do 80% of the moves I like any more. I LOVED eating pussy (I still do) and that suddenly felt weird to her. She suggested we move in under the promise that we could do “stuff” without the roommates hearing so of course I was in, but in reality nothing changed. I bought lingerie for her that never got worn, I planned dates that got shit on, all the usual stuff. **[RED PILL LESSON]** I now know that it’s because she saw that I was whipped and she had nothing to dread. I kept telling myself that having THIS girl locked down was better than dealing with the dating scene. At the time, it probably was better because I had no game and completely backwards training.
    
#**The Southwest** 
We graduated and got jobs at the same company then bought a house together. Seeing it as the easy path, I gladly relinquished control of our finances to her. We combined accounts and I had to start asking permission to spend my money on my hobbies. We made plenty though so it was rare that my request for funds allocation was denied. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Even though the actual resources weren’t scarce, the power she gained when I felt I had to ask permission to spend my own money was crippling, but I didn’t realize it at the time. 

Under the excuse of “professionalism”, she started dressing more androgynous, bordering on masculine, and stopped wearing makeup. She made sex promises that were instantly forgotten. I did the usual, ask-beg-wish for change, smother her in attention, did a shitload of chores, and pouted. I still had my hobbies and social group though, and they were adventurous. **[RED PILL LESSON]** I didn’t workout but my activities were physical, usually competitive, and kept me from getting fat, so that’s likely what kept any hint of attraction. 

At this point, I’m a couple years in and was crushing my young career and she was doing well but indifferent **[RED PILL LESSON]** I don’t think she actually likes our degree field but she followed me through it because aside from interacting with her, I’m a natural leader. I got some IOI from some cute little interns, but oneitis aside, I knew better than to mess with women at work.

I proposed (of course thinking sex would increase…), we got married. On our honeymoon, we had sex once per day and then not again for a couple weeks after.  This set me off more than I could self-soothe with pouting and I doubled down with the angry unattractive behavior. We had talks, lots of talks. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Actions, not words. 

#**The Rockies**
A few years into my career, I decided my current company was holding me back and to get a better job at another company in another state. She was on board and did the same. **[RED PILL LESSON]** I remember the sex picking up drastically during my job hunt, probably because I suddenly had a mission for myself and wasn’t focusing on her. I got my new job and moved first after preparing our house for sale, she stayed in town until our house sold. I secured a house to rent and set up all the utilities. I immediately made a new social group in my new state and started doing all kinds of fun shit, basically living like a bachelor except without the dating. During these couple months, our visits included lots of sex and me taking her on adventures with all my new friends. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Apparently handling your own shit like a Captain is attractive.

When the old house sold and she joined me, she “earned her keep” by cooking, cleaning, and fucking. I liked it and joked about living in the 1950’s but as soon as she got a job, we were “equals” again so all that stopped. Having no kids yet, we were still very social and she made friends with the wives of all my friends. I was still the organizer and social driving force behind nearly all of our activities. I started a band with some friends and the whole crew would come to our gigs and have a blast. But **[RED PILL LESSON]** my supplicating, pussy-whipped behavior toward my wife neutralized any of my AMOG tingles.

A year or so later, my company hired an intern that looked just like my wife looked at her hottest in college. Girl Intern (GI) and I had some instant mutual attraction, some cocky/funny natural game emerged from somewhere, and we started flirting heavily. Sex with the wife had dropped off to 3x per month, and despite knowing better, I consciously decided I was going to cheat on my wife with GI. So I engaged my plugged-in training, dropped my natural flirty game and started spraying GI with feeeeelings and whining about how pathetic my current sex life was. I was immediately friendzoned and she used the shit out of my orbiting resources. No sex was ever had. **[RED PILL LESSON self evident]**.

There I was, 30 years old, the lead engineer of an elite team known among our portion of the industry for kicking all the ass, all the time, and I owned that shit. I’m making a lot of money, intellectually stimulated, and developing at a rapid rate. I hadn’t heard the phrase “Iron sharpens Iron” until MRP, but that’s exactly what was happening at work. But I was still “following the rules” and frustrated as shit with my married sex life. My team would deploy to work on-site for projects at various places around the country, and we would go out and live it up at the local bars. I remember getting plenty of IOI from the local ladies with my natural DHV among my peers, and a couple times I engaged, coming awfully close to the line, but my commitment to honor my wedding vows kept my balls blue. I’d come home, get a trickle of starfish sex, and convince myself that this was my lot in life. Around this time, I got an iPhone, discovered online porn, and started fapping nearly any time I was alone. Feeling desperate, I suggested we start trying for a kid, knowing that one must have sex in order to become pregnant. Of course she agreed. **[REDPILL LESSON]** When women hit 30, they also want kids, especially if they’re in a situation with guaranteed resources.  She dropped the pills, we fucked a few times, she wore lingerie once, and then boom- the Dr. said we were in love. Sex tapered off again due to prego exhaustion and actual vomiting and I was sympathetic.

#**The West Coast**
About this time, a former VP of my current company started poaching my team. Some of my guys and I got (very lucrative) offers to air-drop into a struggling startup company with some obvious potential. It was another out-of-state move and exciting. I took the offer and moved within 2 weeks. Again, my wife stayed to finish up her current work commitments and assist with the sale of the house. I lived like a frat boy in a fancy, company-subsidized house with a bunch of my friends / coworkers. We repeated the cycle of work-drink-sleep for a couple months straight and it was glorious. I took a trip to visit the wife a few times (and had a bunch of sex because **[RED PILL LESSON]** she missed me), then back to pack up all our shit and drive it out when the house sold. During this time, again with no input from her, I secured a house for us to rent, set up utilities and all that. When she arrived, I had a whole crew of new friends (whom she’d never met) to get our shit out of the truck and into our new place. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Having bros who’ll happily help you move is a pretty good DHV.

We sold our old house, which was our only debt, and my job paid well. We have always both embraced living in a non-extravagant way so even with one income, we built our savings. Since she would soon be having our kid, and the plan we’d come up with was for her to not take a job, she didn’t. She spent the days lunching with the wives of my friends (AKA the “work widows”) and nesting in our new place. I was still on the intense work pace, but we had sex nearly every night for a couple months. During one of her prego checkups, the Doc advised us not to put anything in her cooter for a few weeks and gave an actual reason. Without me asking, my wife started giving hand and blow jobs nearly every night. Aside from our early dating months, I had received (and asked for) zero BJs. Shortly after she was cleared for action again and PIV sex returned. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Nesting is beta, but handling your own shit like a Captain is still attractive, especially when you have a mission.

A note on some of my habits during this period: In order to keep up the pace (or at least that’s how I rationalized it) at this job and the last, I ingested 5-7 cans of caffeinated soda per day and was constantly snacking on gummy candy. I dressed down in an attempt to identify with and close the social gap between myself and the mechanics who were executing my designs. I did no exercise and dropped nearly all my active hobbies. My coworkers and I would eat out and drink a lot of craft beer nearly every day after work. I had never heard the term “skinny-fat”, but that’s what I was. 

Kid 1 is born and I shift into Super Dad mode, deacon in the Cult of Child and my wife steps right into the Martyrdom of Motherhood. I couldn’t boost her up into the Captain’s seat fast enough. You know, because that’s what you do when you’re plugged in. I dropped all my hobbies and stopped hanging out with my friends after work. Things get a little fuzzy in my memory here, probably because of all the booze, lack of sleep, and general chaos a newborn brings to first-time parents. “Frame” wasn’t a concept for me yet and I had no vision other than “get through work, get through dinner, get through bedtime, get rejected for sex, do it again tomorrow”. I frequently lost composure and deeply regret some of the things I muttered to my infant son. **[RED PILL LESSON]** With no social outlet, hobbies, or exercise to consume my energy (which I thought I didn’t have), I became very angry. You need outlets and you need a mission. Work became my outlet and I would go there to “hide” instead of spending my time at home with the wife and kid. Since the wife was getting her dopamine and oxytocin from the kid and my “sacrifices” to provide don’t matter in Marriage 2.0, suddenly I was suddenly a shitty husband and a shitty dad. **[RED PILL LESSON]** She is a reflection of me and she was fucking right; I was a whiny-angry-man-child who happened to be very good at one facet of life, which she never saw first-hand. Obligation sex was had every couple weeks, usually preceded by an afternoon of me clinging and hinting and an hour of massage once she gave in. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Desire isn’t negotiated and doubling down on beta behavior makes things worse. 

My wife now had motivation to go out and make a bunch of mommy friends instead of hanging out with the “work widows”, so her social life skyrocketed. I tagged along and had shallow, distracted, fragments of conversation with the other dads, while quick-stepping to fetch whatever the wives ordered and pack-muleing around all the shit that outings with kids require. We were all the dopey caricatures of dads on TV, just chuckling it off when the wives rolled their eyes and plucked the fussing baby from us when we demonstrated our incompetence with whatever natural parenting magic mommies use. Mommies always think they know what’s best for everyone. In hindsight, I’m certain all those dudes were exactly as frustrated as I was, but we put on a great show. **[RED PILL LESSON]** “Happy wife = happy life” is just not the way things work.

I was at least self-aware enough to realize how dependent I had become on the sugar and caffeine from all the soda I drank, so one day I stopped it cold-turkey. That was one of the toughest self-discipline exercises I may have ever done. In the past 5 years, I’ve had less than 10 sodas. Luckily there was beer, so I ramped up my beer drinking from a pint or two per night to 4-6 each night during the week and a constant stream after noon on the weekends. I paid no attention to my weight or physique so I really can’t quantify the effect, but passing out sure made skipping sex easier. **[RED PILL LESSON]** More beer = less sex.
At the wife’s suggestion, we started camping again, which was something we hadn’t done in a few years due to busy work schedules, pregnancy, and other excuses. I wanted to enjoy the experience, but of my own accord, I spent the entire time stressing about creating perfect conditions for the wife and kid. I tried to predict and mitigate any risk that might cause us to deviate from the ideal experience. The outings were exhausting for me and boring for everyone else. **[RED PILL LESSONS]** These were huge covert contracts and perfect is boring.

This shitty, stressful, sexless, miserable, day-to-day existence wasn’t getting better, but it also wasn’t getting worse. Then one day my company was acquired by a major competitor and the startup-lotto paid off. It wasn’t the jackpot we’d all been promised when we were issued our stock options, but it was a nice windfall and we all still had jobs in the new organization. I wasn’t particularly stoked about becoming a worker bee for the new company though, so in one of the very low moments of my betadom, I asked my wife for permission to find a new job. There were no alternatives in our small town, so I started looking in one of the larger cities we had found attractive earlier in life. In a couple weeks, I had some interviews, got an offer, and put in my notice to resign. Together we took a trip to find a house to rent, bickered the whole time, and finally compromised on one she liked but I was lukewarm about. I handled all the utilities setup, but proudly presented my basic adult achievements to her for approval. In the past, we’d always self-moved with rented trucks. She made piles, I packed boxes, I loaded and unloaded the truck, and she unpacked and nested. She arranged the move this time and it was a shit show. I basically did all the labor while she occupied our son, but we ran out of boxes and the POD she hired didn’t fit everything so she had to order a second at the last minute. **[RED PILL IN-JOKE]** TRP constantly jokes about women being terrible judges of the physical size of things. It’s true, even STEM women.

#**The PNW**
I started my latest job, which I am completely satisfied with. But, being a family man now, I passed on the invitations for after-hours comraderie with the other young guys. This was a huge mistake and fixing it is a major part of my MAP. Being in a new town, new job, and engaging none of my hobbies meant my only social contact was my kid and wife.  And the cashier at the beer store; I saw her frequently. I instinctually knew having no local friends was a problem, so I grabbed a tiny bit of my balls and told my wife I was going to find a band to join, then asked “would that be OK?” I eventually did, and the twice-per-week bro-time was a godsend. It was also a new mission and I spent many hours after the wife and kid went to bed practicing and learning songs. I still felt I needed to ask permission to use my time and spend my money. I constantly thanked her for “letting” me be in a band and have a hobby. The wife again found a bunch of mommies to become friends with and I tagged along, joking with the other dads about how we don’t have any time to any of the shit we like. They were all clearly envious that I was allowed to be in a band. **[RED PILL LESSON]** You need a goddamn hobby!

Being in a new town, making new friends, all that other new stuff was stimulating and keeping the wife from being bored, so sex picked up a little bit to once per week. I was still begging for it and doing lots of choreplay and she was using all the typical excuses. 

We took a couple camping trips. We now live in the PNW so it rained. Camping in the rain with kids and dogs is excruciating when you’re trying to prevent any discomfort for the other people in your group. I proposed buying an expensive camping van and eventually talked the wife into permitting the use of funds (that I earned). Having and using this vehicle definitely made camping much more comfortable for everyone, but it turns out this particular model had a history of questionable reliability so the stress I saved by providing a warm, dry place to sleep I allocated to planning for and trying to prevent the inevitable breakdown. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Risk aversion is weaksauce pussy bullshit. I should have taken comfort in the discomfort of not knowing what would happen because I’m confident to use my skills in the moment. When that breakdown eventually happened (after unplugging, thankfully), all my preparations were used, I executed my extraction plan like a Captain, and that “adventure” became a feature of the trip for the wife and kids.

Dealing with a vehicle that needed maintenance and upgrades became my new mission, as well as planning trips for the family. Unconsciously I rarely consulted my wife on these plans, I just told her about them when I’d worked them out. I would inform her of the strategic plan, tell her how many meals to buy, then leave her to the tactical job of getting herself and our son packed and ready. I would prepare the vehicle, load everyone up, and we would go. Action-wise, this was pretty strong captaining, but I still stressed a lot about the potential for catastrophe and shared my fears with my wife, which led her to be stressed too. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Be the oak, don’t show weakness.

 I’ve always had a project vehicle in addition to my daily driver, but the project I already had was dormant since having my son. Now I had two project vehicles (and twice as much cost to fuel, license, and insure). I taught myself how to do all the mechanical maintenance on a modern diesel and executed some large jobs that would have cost thousands of dollars had I paid someone else. I shared my triumphs with my wife and got a little mad when she didn’t share my enthusiasm **[COVERT CONTRACT]**, but I actually enjoyed the self-validation of proving my new skills to myself and I felt manly working in the garage again.  **[RED PILL LESSON]** Have a hobby!

Shortly after I started planning and taking the family on trips, sex picked up to once every 3 days, but it was starfish, mechanical, and I’m certain she was consciously metering it out. Maybe there was a spark of attraction from my masculine activities that made her think we should be having sex, but I still looked like a skinny-fat slob, was almost always at least buzzed while I was at home, and showered her with complements and affection so she had to force herself to do it. She’d been working out in a stroller class for about a year and a half and looked pretty good in her workout clothes. She still dressed androgynous and sloppy otherwise though (mirroring my effort evidently). I thought thanking and praising her for the sex we were having would encourage her to step things up. We had talks and I started searching the internet for solutions to fix her libido but only found the usual blue-pill advice. I was still sexually frustrated so I jerked off a lot in secret.  Our family growth plan was to start working on another kid around this time so she stopped BC again and was pregnant in about a month. This time around, none of the awesome prego horniness happened, partially due to our 2 year old energy vampire but mostly because of my beta and omega behavior.

Son 2 was born and from his original birthday has been a strong-headed child. Neither my wife nor I had much energy for sex, but I still was angry that I wasn’t getting it. I continued to drink a lot of beer but I continued my music, camping, and vehicle hobbies. I self-imposed a lot of pressure on myself to hustle home after rehearsal or gigs because, maybe I could get a scrap of sex. I was angry with my kids for being an obstacle between me and my hobbies. I still didn’t really have any local friends. I was crushing it at work, ascended the learning curve of my new company’s processes quickly and after a year and a half, was again a technical lead and the subject matter expert for many areas. I got bonuses and raises but was bitter when the wife didn’t reward my achievements with her pussy. **[RED PILL LESSON]** I’ve come to understand this is typical and women don’t want to know how the sausage is made.

Sex was happening, but it was drip-fed at exactly twice per week, excluding shark week, and it was boring. I brought this up a few times and was met with “That’s just what happens in married sex lives. I’m OK with it.” Instinctually, I knew this was just not true but I had no idea what to do about it. I started having shower thoughts wishing for the low testosterone and damped libido that was supposed to happen as I aged. At least then I could focus on something other than the sex I wanted but couldn’t get. I felt shame for my masculine desires. My kids were a pain in my ass and they walked all over my wife and me because we essentially set no boundaries. That’s how we interpreted all the modern parenting crap we’d read. “Let them figure things out and make their own choices.” My wife is incapable of withstanding any tears, complaints of discomfort, or demands for attention. I could do this and tried to take the roll of disciplinarian, but she frequently overruled me with the phrase “You need to pick your battles”, which really meant “You need to pick the battles I would pick, which are none.” **[RED PILL LESSON]** Kids need boundaries and they need parents with a strong frame.


#**The Tipping Point and Finding MRP**

The tipping point came when we took a plane trip to our home town in the spring of 2015. As I trudged through the airport in my cargo pants and baggy work shirt, carrying the diaper backpack, my kids’ carry-on, and my wife’s breast pump in a bag that was essentially a purse, she strode ahead, holding the baby and pulling the toddler along, glaring at me to keep up. She had the whole trip planned out; who we would see and when. It was mostly going to hanging around her mom’s house. I had given no input other than my money. The first thing I did upon arrival was get to the store to fill my mother-in-law’s fridge with craft beer. Then I spent the time in the corner of the living room drinking beer and finger-fucking my phone. Wife’s parents were divorced when she was very young. Her dad was barely present in her life since then and managed to not pay child support or alimony. MIL never did anything about it and just moved on. I respect my MIL quite a bit; she cooks, sews, and cleans very well and generally handles her own shit like a boss. She worked to pay for her own college degree (after divorce) and saved enough to pay for both of her kids to go to college. She saved enough from her job to pay off her house right about the time she retired. She actually IS a strong independent woman who don’t need a man. Unfortunately, her successful independence made her quite androgynous so my wife really never had a feminine or masculine role model in her life. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Evaluate your woman’s role models when vetting her for marriage. 

But MIL is aging and naturally short, and I'm pretty handy. So every couple hours, my wife would pop her head in and order me to do some handyman task that her mom needed a tall guy to do. **[RED PILL LESSON]** This was a typical shit test; wife showing off to her mom how tight she held my leash. I’d do it then go back to drinking beer and being bitter about not getting thanked **[big ol’ COVERT CONTRACT]**. So as I’m googling around, I must have used some search phrases like “wife doesn’t respect me” or “Wife only wants my money” or “why does my wife suck at sex”. Whatever it was I’m CERTAIN I didn’t search for “How do I become a man women (possibly including my wife) want to respect and subsequently fuck?” So I stumble on MRP and read a couple posts and think “These guys all had the same situation as me but now they don’t. They all say it was their own fault? WTF? My sex drive is fine; it’s my wife who has the problem!” Still, I read the FAQ and the wiki. Some of the shit I read instantly brought flashbacks of my life and suddenly those events made sense. I spent the next few days with those thoughts festering in my mind. I wanted the problem to be my wife, but I couldn’t un-see what I had read. 

The weekend after I got back from the trip, I played a gig with my band at a well-known local venue. The house was packed and we killed it. For as sloppy as I dressed 99% of the time, I put on the Ritz for the stage; fancy embroidered western shirt, tight jeans, exotic leather boots, and a big white hat (I play country). For as beta and omega as I was around my family, I’ve always been alpha as fuck as a performer (on stage with a band or in technical presentations). I get off stage, high from the performance, and get a couple IOI’s (now that I knew what these were) from some women in the crowd; I suddenly have some thoughts of “Eye Contact, AMOG, DHV”. I straighten up my posture, throw my shoulders back, make eye contact with these chicks, and soak their panties. I offer a band sticker to one of them who happens to be holding two drinks, saying “Here, have your boyfriend hold this for you.” She responds with (giggle) “I don’t have a boyfriend!” I was in such shock that I lost my frame and awkwardly handed my sticker to her friend and scampered away like a 13 year old who accidentally saw a boob at the pool. **[RED PILL LESSON]** Be attractive; don’t be unattractive.

Monday morning, I sat down at my desk at work, pulled up MRP and read all day. I couldn’t sleep that night because my hamster was burning up the wheel. It was ALL so obvious! **It was ALL MY FAULT**!

Sent to my boyfriend of course... And my other friend. The one that I fooled around sometimes. It felt wrong to say that I was cheating on him. Cheating sounded so dirty, so wrong, so naughty. Which was nice when I was in the moment, riding my lover...

I preferred the term knowing what I want and taking it. I love my boyfriend but he really can't pleasure me like Nathan can... I grabbed my morning apple from the side, striding over to the couch and laying down, turning on the TV. The news was on.

""Something has happened, there's a virus, Quanxin Corporation have spread their nanobots, infecting anyone... Lock your doors. Supply food. They're coming... No... Please!"" The middle-aged, balding man pushed away on his office chair, and... A [stunning blonde girl](http://i.imgur.com/WeJiRRd.jpg) that must be some intern or something stumbled into shot, giggling as she planted a soft kiss on his lips, her fake-nailed hands slowly sliding down to unzip his pants...

And I watched as before my eyes his hair began to grow, his face change, watched as she pulled out his hard cock and watched it shrink into... Nothingness. ""Not again, darn it! Come on, Kandy, let's find some more cock."" The bimbo intern giggles, taking a lick of the fresh pussy that just appeared in front of my eyes before moving away from the camera, leaving the... Bimbo? What was once the news reporter there, panting, his... No, her hands rubbing furiously as she experienced her first orgasm. The camera was knocked over, the screen shattered and somebody pulled the wire out. Or tripped over it.

What the actual fuck happened. I turned off the TV, throwing my apple core into the bin as I looked out of the apartment window. My phone vibrated twice in a row. I picked it up, seeing texts from both my boyfriend and lover. Both of them were saying to get to their places as soon as possible, that they would protect me. I turned my phone off.

It was an apocalypse. I had to save myself. I grabbed one of the big kitchen knifes with the serrated edge, and grabbed a sweater to pull over my skin. How did this... Virus work? I looked out of the window again. Blonde bimbos with massive fake tits were chasing down girls and boys. I watched one of them take down a mother running with her two twelve-year old children, turning the mother into a bimbo almost instantly. I turned away before they caught the children.

As I opened the door out of my apartment, I heard a scream. At the end of the corridor I saw one of the girls I share lectures with on her knees, her mouth eagerly licking out a bimbo with... Brunette hair? I watched Cathy's hair bleach blonde, her tits balloon as if it was some sort of voodoo magic. I turned around and sprinted towards the staircase.

---

Who are you? My boyfriend who found out I was cheating? My lover who wants to hunt down my boyfriend and get two bimbo babes? Another survivor entirely? The idea is that we don't get infected instantly, so it will be a bit of a story... Of course, with all these bimbos letting off all their pheromones, you can get awfully horny...

I prefer people who actually reply to the roleplay. No limits, I have a lotta kinks."

I didn't want to create a new thread if this is something unnecessary but...

**I recently conducted an interview with Freddie Gibbs over the phone. It was intended to be published for the NPR-affiliated radio station I currently intern for.** 

I spoke with him about the Flint Water Crisis, and he even shared some opinions on Donald Trump. It was more than I could have asked for out of an interview with my favorite hip-hop artist. He was incredibly insightful about a wide range of topics. 

After typing out the interview, I thought that too much of it would be filtered for our FCC-regulated platform.

**So now I'm at a loss about where to publish the piece. The idea was to have it published during the Midwest part of his tour, as many of the questions focus on Flint. He's in Detroit on Thursday, so I'm running out of time.**

I reached out to XXL, Complex, and a few other large publications just because why not. None have responded thus far, but I know this piece belongs somewhere it will be read.

**I have a rough draft of the interview ready to be edited as a word doc, and the transcription of the interview for anybody interested.**

Any help would be extremely appreciated!"

Howdy,

So this summer I was unable to acquire an internship with my university recruiting. That means I want to invest my time over the summer break into refining my employable with something tangible I can put on my resume, whether that be through personal development or asking for new projects at work. What area should I focus on to improve my resume and increase my employable skills? I spoke with my boss and he suggested I practice understanding virtualization or database management. Would something like that be more valuable than working solely on refining my coding skills (which I will learn anyway through my school curriculum)? Let me know your thoughts.

I've just recently gotten matched to interview with a host at Google, and it's pretty much been my dream to be an intern there. However, since it took this long to get to this stage, I already have accepted an offer and this offer has gone through a lot of hoops to get me an apartment, transportation, etc. so I don't know if it would be ethical for me to jump ship so last minute.

Would it be better for me to tell the recruiter that I can't work there this summer, or should I tell them after I interview, or should I just go for it?

I want to put myself in the best possible position to work there next summer if i can't this summer, so I don't know at what stage I should withdraw--considering I haven't even met the team yet.

4fd1jg,25,2016-04-18,Wendy F-ing White (rant/advice needed),sharpe0,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4fd1jg/wendy_fing_white_rantadvice_needed/,"Wendy White is my mother, a narcissistic mess. She divorced my father, Hank, through extremely shitty means and has been all around a typical NParent to me (Jesse) and my sister (Flynn).

There's a lot more shit involved in how Wendy White treated us in the past, but in typical Narc fashion, she likes to pretend it never happened. Particularly to me, her scapegoat, and especially around holidays and birthdays. I've really grown since the ""reckoning"" and NC we had a few years ago (which made for a wonderful Christmas) and I keep her at an arm's length. I'm cordial, I'll be kind and empathetic towards her, I see her occasionally, and I do love her still....but I'm also FULL of anger and hurt at how she treated me and our family. 

Which brings me to today. It's my birthday this week and Wendy would LOOOOVEEE to see me. So about two weeks ago I got an email attempting to plan a ""party"" with my sister and my bf of one year (who she hasn't met) to celebrate....on a Saturday night...when most childless adults would probably go out to do something adult, like get drinks and dinner with friends and significant others, or go to a show, or almost anything other than stay in with their weird mom whom they kind of hate.

Oh, and apparently my ""party"" was also going to be a joint celebration with her cat? Because he was adopted from the shelter around that time and that's now his ""official"" birthday? 

The cat. Jesus fuck. She's gotta insert herself not only with her presence, but by combining my birthday with her fucking cat's....birthday? What? That's not a thing. Arghh

Through a series of passive-aggressive emails, I managed to get her away from the weekend in general and to a weekday. My sister was supposed to come and be a buffer, but she just got a new internship, so suddenly she can't go. Then Wendy sets her sights on my boyfriend...

Full disclosure, my boyfriend is fairly older than me. Which comes with some weird comments/concern-trolling. I personally don't give a fuck and see him as a person who I connect with, and IMO to suggest otherwise means that I can't manage my own life as an adult. Hank has met him. Flynn's met him. People at my office have met him. Everything's good, and we have a happy relationship.

Wendy...hasn't met him. She knows he's ""in his 40s"" and I heard the *tsk* of ""concern"" and I got an earful about how I need to ""be careful."" When that was shut down with the force of a bear trap, she dropped the subject....only to hoover and pry in an sickly-sweet way. ""Oh I'm so happy for you! What does he do again???"" She's also been champing at the bit to meet him. Every holiday this year has been winged by texts, emails, and calls about how she'd ""Love to meet him!!!! &lt;3"" 

My SO is a great guy, and he knows about her bullshit. He's in no hurry to meet her. But as things work out, he's going to be picking me up from the weekday birthday dinner/cat celebration (again, all my wuts) with Wendy. It slipped out, and now she MUST SEE HIM!!! &lt;3 Gag. 

Part of me knows it'll be over quickly, then we can move on with our lives. Another part of me hates that I'm not enough for her *on my own birthday*. And I'm not even a birthday person! I have been content just eating day old donuts at home with my bf, no fuss, no nothing. I know it's about the acknowledgement of *me* having worth in this world....and Wendy is a pro at denying that. 

So, she's gonna meet my bf. And I'm going to have an awkward dinner with her where I don't know if I'll be able to handle her shit. Any advice?

4fd244,9,2016-04-18,Preparing for GIS internship interviews,10FootClownpole,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/4fd244/preparing_for_gis_internship_interviews/,"Hello everyone, this Friday I will be interviewing for some grad school internships to accommodate my Master's of Environment Studies, with a concentration on planning and mapping. I will be receiving my GIS certificate during this time as well, but presently I do not actually have any experience using GIS software. Two of the internships I am interviewing for are directly GIS related,  while a couple of others seem to have some basic elements to it. 

I think I would benefit most from the GIS heavy internships, but I am not sure where I will stand as far as experience is concerned. 

I was wondering if anyone here can give me some tips of what I can possibly look into to learn a little more about the language. I have viewed some youtube videos and googled some general questions to get a better idea, but I would love the opinion of those who do this for a career. 

I will be purchasing a new laptop tomorrow most likely and I was planning on taking advantage of Esri's 60-day free so I can at least say I've spent time with the program. 

Thanks for any help"

I have 2 choices, should I do?",def_cats,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4fd5xf/been_working_at_my_postgraduation_as_a_part_timer/,"As the title said, I am currently working as part time software developer. I'm approaching my second month working for them, and I really don't like it,  we make and maintain software for clients, which essentially equates to me pasting existing code together to make web pages pulling data through a backend. The environment is mostly older folks and the work space is as boring as can be (closed windows, no color). All I can think of at this point is either trying to become independent here in my current city as a web developer or moving to another city and working professionally. I'm also approaching my 5th month as an intern at a web start-up(working remotely). I live in a very low cost living area, but I still feel as though I'm being underpaid (36k/yr after graduation). I'm doing it strictly for experience, but I'm beginning to feel like I don't want to wait it out. The way I see it, I can either:

1. Keep working here for 6 months to a year and leverage the experience later on when I try to get a better job in the city I want to move to. In the meantime, while continuing to work here I want to try to do freelance web development, make connections, build a strong resume, and see if it really is possible to be my own boss. However, I can't see myself doing this for a whole year, and I'm afraid if I leave before a year is up it'll be a huge red flag to potential employers.

2. Cut my losses with this company (I still haven't even graduated), never mention this job on my resume and only mention the internship, and keep applying to the city I want to move to. After getting an offer I'll quit my job and move over there. I feel like I can get a better job.

I'm young and I don't want to settle with something so dull when I feel like I have the opportunity to leave this current experience behind and do something a little more exciting. I'm very passionate about coding and tech and I feel like this job is for people who just want to settle with monotony. I want to be surrounded with people who feel like I do. My girlfriend supports any decision I decide, as well as my parents (although my parents would naturally rather me do the safer route). 

Has anyone ever had this experience? Any input would really be appreciated. I'm really struggling to figure this out. "

I'm at a point where I feel like a junior development position may be feasible but at the same time intimidating because I have no professional experience.

4fdtg6,22,2016-04-18,[Breeds] What breed is right for me?,kindkitsune,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/4fdtg6/breeds_what_breed_is_right_for_me/,"
1. **What breeds are you interested in and why?** German Shepherd, Siberian Husky, Tamaskan but breed club worries me, Czechoslovakian Vlcak but not in cards right now. Northern Breeds in general, and mixes of GSDs/Huskys/Mals are cool with me too! 

2. **What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** Companion, running buddy and hiking buddy, hopefully helping with my mental health, obedience training and agility are something that interest me but I have zero experience with.

3. **What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** Owning dogs, training dogs.... very little. Yeah, I know. I didn't name the best breeds for first time owners. I've been doing my research though. I love reading as is and have always been fascinated with dog training, behavioral psychology, and the like so so far I've read:

- Do Over Dogs by Miller

- For the Love of a Dog, and The Other End of the Leash by McConnell

- Before You Get Your Puppy and After You Get Your Puppy by Dunbar

- currently working through the huuuuuge 1st, 2nd and 3rd volumes of Applied Dog Behavior and training.

4. **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** Nope

5. **Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?** No and *hellll* no.

6. **Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** Apartment, renting. No weight restrictions, breed restrictions include mastiffs, cane corso's, rottweilers, pitts, etc. The usual bunch. GSD's surprisingly exempt, along with Malamutes. Huskys seem to be restricted a lot too.

7. **Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?** 
Me and my roommate. My roommate is really excited and hopeful that I get a dog. They won't be accountable for taking care of the dog, but I've said its okay for them to walk/run with the dog but they MUST always use a leash and never let the dog off-leash.

8. **How often do you have visitors to your home?**
Rarely. Suffice it to say I'm not a social or party person.

9. **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?** Adoption, absolutely. 

10. **Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** Not a puppy. 8 months is the lowest I could see myself going, but then I'd have to make sure I can get someone to let them out in the middle of the day. I'd prefer a Young Adult, because despite doing all the reading I've been doing and having an idea of what to expect if I get a dog with any serious issues, I'm already challenging myself with my breed choices so age choice difficulty doesn't need to be added.

11. **What size dog are you looking for?** Certainly on the larger side, anywhere in the range I mentioned (from small GSDs to bigger Mal mixes are cool with me). I don't want a HUGE dog since I am in an apartment, but I don't terribly want a small dog. I'd like to try bikejoring, and the activities I have in mind seem like a better fit for slightly larger animals. 

12. **How much barking is too much barking?** Uh, apartment means not too much if possible. Training here is surprisingly unintuitive, but I think I've got it. Vocalizations I don't mind. Somehow, our family's lab already vocalizes like she's a different breed. Its amusing, and rarely becomes a nuisance.

12. **How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**
Whatever is needed for the dogs health and well-being. I was, quite honestly, the only one to ever brush our lab and it was a pleasant experience for the both of us most of the time.

13. **How much shedding do you think you can handle?** I mentioned GSD's and Huskys, I'm prepared to set my shedding levels to ""yes"" and expect to find hair EVERYWHERE. 

14. **Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** I've trimmed nails, cleaned ears (lab got wicked ear infections, poor lass), brushed teeth regularly, and done that sort of grooming. Fancier grooming I'll absolutely find a professional. On my list of to-do's before I finally adopt is ""find a good groomer""

15. **How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?** No thanks, no thanks.


16. **How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?** I don't mind if a dog isn't super biddable. Doesn't bother me. I want a companion, even if that means some difficulties in trianing, and not a completely biddable do-whatever-I-say pet. Just not for me, and for some personal reasons a blindly obedient animal is disconcerting and uncomfortable.

17. **What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?** I've already investigated a number of potential local trainers that use positive-reinforcement based techniques, and plan to get my dog an AKC Good Canine Citizen certification (or whatever its called). Living in the city, I'd like to take it further to the Urban grade for sure and hopefully the Advanced grade. These are mostly for the sake of making getting into rentals easier, and in general I'd just like a dog that is at least intelligent enough to be trained highly even if repetition can be a bit difficult.

18. **Is there any behavior you can’t accommodate?** Nope, if these behaviors become a problem I am either failing to adequately train the dog, not catering to their energy needs, or not setting them up in an environment that won't make them easily fall into these behaviors. edit - I didn't address breed traits. When it comes to breed traits, like prey drive in huskies and aggression in GSD's, I can and will find out how to best accommodate these issues. The behaviors i had in mind were mostly things like marking, bathroom issues, chewing, and crate training.

19. **How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?** Not at all important. Makes me paranoid, I always worried our dog was going to run away. If I'm out hiking, I'd use a longer leash but that leash is going to be fastened to me securely in some manner. 


20. **How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?** I run daily in the mornings, currently for only about ~30m as I'm stupendously out of shape. I'm increasing to hit 45-60m daily, and after five years of XC in school I have a good handle on training. Instead of saying something like ""Ill get in shape for my dog"", I'm getting in shape for myself now (yay, lower anxiety and adhd symptoms!) and for the bonus benefit of a dog later. Besides long morning runs, I enjoy my evening walks and love playing with dogs in general. Lately, I've even been going on evening runs (lighter pace, however). I *really* like to run. I figure evening obedience classes will help as well, if I do those.

21. **How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?** Training and stimulation can be done constantly when I'm around, in some fashion. I'd like to start obedience training fairly quickly, even at the most basic level, so I can get an idea of how the dog takes training and what items may need work (or will have to be accommodated for). When I'm away, I plan to give the dog puzzle toys and things like Kongs to keep them occupied. I can't imagine having nothing to do for 8 hours, I'd go mental! Or nap. I will not do the same to my dog. 

22. **Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?** Alone, hopefully loose in the house. Same at night. I'd be cool with the dog sleeping on the bed, or independently in it's crate if thats what they'd prefer. I'll crate the dog if they're anxious at first, but only when I'm home so I can slowly work them up to longer and longer intervals of me being away. Do-Over Dog book had a two day technique for using the crate to quickly nip anxiety in the bud.

23. **How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?** This summer, 7-8 hours. I'm interning full-time at a spacecraft R&amp;D/fabrication company not too far from my house. When school starts again, I'll be gone for ~6hrs a most. I've done a lot of work to make sure I can successfully study at home, one of my key strategies being breaks every 2 hours or so where I try to do something active like cleaning, a short walk, or various errands. Figure I can work dog into this. During the summer, my roommate will be working way different hours - I'm typical 9-5, but they don't usually start util 12 or later. 

24. **If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?** I could, not sure for how long. I attempted to calculate how much I can budget for the dog for at least 2 years, off of what I make for this summer, and there was some wiggle room but not a tremendous amount. It'd make sense in the beginning if the dog was especially young or stressed, though.


25. **What is the general location in which you live?** Seattle area.


26. **What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?** The temp goes from rain to rain. Don't move here, it's awful (lowest I've seen is ~30f, highest was 90f last summer).


27. **On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?** Oh, boy. Here's the question I stress about. I want to say 7, or maybe even 8. I've already been getting a range of pet insurance quotes, covering up to at least 5k of vet bills with 90% reimbursement. I've made sure to set aside a $500 ""oh fuck"" fund, and have talked to my parents and sister about if they'd help if things happened (they would, for a time, while I get back on my feet).

28. **Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?** Yes, I have. I've accounted for food, treats, training, toys, initial costs of various items, and general health items required. I propagated a really simple model based on my income this summer, a couple other small bursts of money, and the expected cost of ownership per month. I added a decent safety margin too (yay, engineer stuff!) and should have enough to keep the dog for at least 2 years. I'm hoping pet insurance stops any really terrible things from happening, and that training plus exercise keep their health good. 

So, I hope that gives somewhat of a profile of who I am and what dog would suit me. I want the breeds I mentioned because of their activity level, as sometimes I sag a bit in maintaining my fitness but oh man am I easily guilt-tripped by a dogs welfare. I'd love to have a dog who wants to go hiking deep into the Cascades with me, and the importance of keeping them on-leash isn't lost on me. For exercise options, I'm probably going to buy a walky-dog attachment for my bike and have considered bikejoring (just not until dog is trained, though). It'd also be nice to have a more affectionate dog, but having read The Other End of the Leash I understand why physical affection, hugs, and cuddles aren't so commonly enjoyed or practiced by dogs. I do worry about how long I'll be away for my internship, and that is likely where I'll end up working after graduation. The good news is that I may be able to bring the dog in (NASA/DARPA clean room regs may not cooperate), and if I do work there I'll be moving north much closer to my workplace since property prices are cheaper. In general, all the aerospace companies are up north in places where one can actually get a yard in Seattle for not-murderous prices. Its unlikely I'll need to move for work, and I've moved enough goddamn times in my life so like the grumpy hermit I am I have settled in this general area and I'm not moving. Industry means this can happen.


Lastly, rescue is my favored option but a few rescue groups around here have already said they won't adopt to me due to my age and the fact that I'm in college. I'll probably end up going to the pound and saving a dog there, but finding dogs in Seattle can be a bit tougher since our rescue/shelter situation is so good. 

edit - I may have given the impression that high sociability is important to me. Its really not, the CGC thing is just a thought I had and something I thought would be achievable. That was more about having fun doing something with the dog that helped the both of us, ultimately. I am okay with one-person dogs, or dogs that aren't highly trainable. Seems I vastly underestimated just how un-biddable Huskies are.

4fdzot,0,2016-04-18,updating a list of float,lamazko,C_Programming,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/4fdzot/updating_a_list_of_float/,"Hi,

edit: finaly solved my problem this morning, at least I kinda know how to post code on reddit now...

I'm doing an internship for my master on a research team who's main focus is on optimizing algorithm to solve multi objectives problem such as flowshop.

I'm myself implementing an example of branch and bround algorithm that I found on the net so I can learn more about that, aswell as indicators (hypervolume in my case).

It's going pretty well but I found the result being pretty bad and I realised that its because of the way I update the list of non-dominated solution I keep. sometimes I keep values I shouldnt keep.

so here is my problem:
I'm using a struct to represent a solution:

    `struct solution {
      float s1;
      float s2;
     }
`

and another struct to represent the list of solution:

    struct solutions {
      struct solution s;
      struct solutions *next;
    }

we say that a solution dominate another solution if both of its float are equals or greater than the one of the other solution
ex:

(0.3,0.6) dominate (0.2,0.4), is ""neutral"" to (0.4,0.5) and is dominated by (0.8,0.9).

in my implementation, its supposed to be impossible that a list of solutions contains a solution that dominate or is dominated by another one.

Now about the function Im having trouble with, its kinda simple:
I have a list of solutions and a solution to ""add"", and I want to update my list of solutions.

so for example:

list: (0.3,0.6)-&gt;(0.2,0.8)-&gt;(0.5,0.5)
new solution to add: (0.6,0.7)

updated list: (0.2,0.8)-&gt;(0.6,0.7)

(the new solution can be at the begenning or the end it doesnt matter for now, if the solution is dominated by one of the solution in the list its not added to the list)

so now here is what I've done so far:

edit3: this function so far works almost everytime. the problem happen when the list start with something that the solution is neutral too, and after that at least 2 solution that the new solution dominate.

ex:  solution to add (0.5,0.5)
list: (0.1,0.9)-&gt; (0.2,0.4)-&gt;(0.4,0.2)-&gt;(0.9,0.1)
in this case the thing is broken and I keep solution I shouldnt, I know why (its a pointer problem), but I cant figure a good way of working around it

edit: well im just gonna put a pastebin link i cant figure out how to formate on reddit, sorry for the few comment in french on the code

4fe2fr,1,2016-04-18,F4A - Dark Journey to Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4fe2fr/f4a_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

Or it could just be an office type rp.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S I'm also looking to do different role plays such as Game Of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Witcher, Cyberpunk, A Porn Star on Campus and Mass Effect. So check my post history for those ideas if they interest you.

4fe5jf,9,2016-04-18,Should I mention in a screening that I googled the result?,yohamoha,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4fe5jf/should_i_mention_in_a_screening_that_i_googled/,"I'm applying for an internship at one of the big tech companies, and I got a task list as sort of a screening.


I should mention that the screening focuses on Java and C++ and I've coded in both but am really familiar in neither of them (but then again, it's an internship). That being said, I'm open and actually excited to learn new stuff.


Now one of the tasks involved finding a way to do a foreign function call from Java to C++. The FFI reference wasn't contained in the problem statement, but I know enough to figure I had to google ""Java C++ FFI"" and get an answer, and honestly I do that a lot and see nothing bad in it (being good, IMO, is knowing *what* to google and how to filter / assimilate that information).


My dillema is that I think it wasn't really OK to just google a way to solve the task, but then again, I'd be doing myself a disservice if I wouldn't point out that I'm good at googling stuff and finding information and generally carrying my own weight even though I'm a junior, which I consider an important skill to have.


So, should I just say that I had to google it but provide the answer (what I think is the right thing to do; just stating reality), not saying I googled it (since it's an online screening anyway; but then again, I feel that that would break fairness), or passing on the question entirely (which I don't want to do, because I know *some* of the answer in a way)?


What about if I had to google more than one thing(again, starting from stuff I know, but I feel random googling would also count, as long as it solves the problem) ? "

Let me start off by saying, I have nothing wrong with Reddit or video games. Personally I'm never on Reddit, but love video games. My issue is that his time is spent on those things only. We spend time together and he's great in that department. He's ignoring his life. He is in college, has only had one class the last 2 quarters, 3 days a week. He is going for a Computer Science degree. Programming is what he would like to do, and has stated that he needs to practice and be able to show employers that he has real world experience. But he doesn't and it's frustrating to me. He has stated the desire to make programs of his own, and makes no outward attempt. I have jumped at the chance to make one with him, I can do some things but definitely just basic level. I try to be a good girlfriend, and spend time with him doing things he likes and encourage him to follow his dreams and try for what he wants in life. However almost every day without fail, he is either on Reddit or playing a video game. He has missed out on qualifying for internships because he doesn't have any practical experience. He has good ideas about simple games, that could be put up on android, or just shown as a living resume example. 
I have talked to him about this, he didn't say or do much. He acknowledged he should do it, but nothing changes. I used to ask how things were going, and I could never think of the right thing to say when he said he hasn't been working on it. I've been chill, supportive, not caring, offering to hangout with him, asking for that to be what we do together. I don't seem to be having a positive effect either way. I know this is what he wants to do, we've talked about his career path and what he wants out of life lots. He is dead set on programming. He has beyond the intelligence level needed to understand it, but he has zero motivation to actually work. I support myself and pay my own way, his bills are covered while he's in school, but not after. It was a deal in his family, to help the kids not be drowning in debt before they could even find a job. 
So I'm needing help with perspective on this. He's a great guy, and this isn't a break-up situation for me. But it does make me worry if I'm going to have to support him when school is done in another year. I can't and he knows it. I have health problems to put it bluntly. He says he went back to school to get the chance to have the career he wants so that he can be there and take care of me. I did not ask him to do that, and have said multiple times he isn't required. He insists that is what he wants, and that is what he will do. Unless I'm missing something, I don't see how spending several hours a day on here or in Steam is helping him at all. 
He's not in any programming, job or productive subreddit (that's what it's called, right?) It's just front page, science stuff, funny or random time wasting. 

I would like some perspective, or helpful ideas or just anything really. Am I being unreasonable? If I am.. please tell me because this is driving me nuts. 

Sorry if the formatting isn't great, or typos. I'm rushed between appointments. 

TL;DR: BF only wants to spend free time on Reddit and video games and I don't make enough to support him."

4felts,0,2016-04-18,Cannot build credit?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4felts/cannot_build_credit/,"I am an international here in the U.S. I recently got my social because I had an internship offer. Currently, I don't have a full time job and most of the money I earn comes from my parents.

Recently, last week, I went to apply for a credit card with my bank. They put my income as $1,800. They even sent out a letter of consideration - pretty much saying I am a good client, and I have enough balance, etc. 

I just got a letter today saying I was rejected. Reason? Not enough accounts to determine credit or something along those lines.

I am so frustrated and discouraged right now. I really need credit because I need to buy a car when I graduate. I feel like life in the U.S. is so difficult without. I can't get credit because I don't have credit, but to get credit I need credit. 

I know I can apply for a secured credit card, but I heard you can even get rejected for those!

Am I just destined to never be able to get credit? "

 I went through the lessons on lynda.com on powershell but want to keep using powershell so that I will be adept when I use it during my internship. Can anyone lead me to some personal projects that I can complete with powershell or is it something that a student in a dorm can't utilize? Thanks so much everyone!"
4feqf1,1,2016-04-18,On the similarities of playing a musical instrument and programming,johnnydozenredroses,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4feqf1/on_the_similarities_of_playing_a_musical/,"Hi Guys,

I've been programming since age 5 and now I'm 25 years old. I know C, C++, Java, Lisp, Python, Matlab reasonably well. Yet, I'm a woeful programmer who hasn't written any worthy programs in a long time.

I've also been teaching myself how to play the piano for the last 5 years. I can quite simply say that I'm a better pianist than a programmer and recorded many pieces that I'm proud of, and are quite popular on Youtube.

There are a few things I notice about my piano playing abilities. 

To compose a piece, I have a very ""standard"" formula - break the song into sections. Lay down the backbone scales, chords and arpeggios for each section. Fine tune each section, then ""stitch"" them together and record the piece. 

So whenever I want to play a piece, I just ""apply"" this formula, and it simply works every single time. Some sections are tricky, so they take longer, but I practice with patience without getting frustrated. Sometimes, I learn the sections in the order of middle first, then beginning, and finally ending (since Chopin's pieces usually end quietly and the ending's are somewhat simple).

Try as I might, I simple don't have a working ""formula"" for programming. When I'm tasked to write a program, I suffer from huge anxiety and sometimes depression. I don't know where to begin or end. I can't concentrate hard enough, so I browse the web and waste time. I get frustrated, and I have no confidence in my programming ability. This summer, I wanted to take some time off to learn how to program systematically in much the same way as how to compose piano music systematically, but peer pressure made me apply for internships instead. 

Can someone help me get out of this miserable state ? How do I make programming enjoyable and fun ? How do I systematically approach programming in much the same way that I approach music ? I tried looking at ""Design patterns"", but they're mainly for OOP programs, whereas I want a general approach, especially one that helps me quickly prototype research software irrespective of programming language (I work in AI, and this summer, I'll work at an AI research lab).

4feu0u,1,2016-04-18,Entering into Ministry as a 2 year Job,amoxicillin875,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/4feu0u/entering_into_ministry_as_a_2_year_job/,"Hello Brothers and Sisters, 

My name is Matt Arends and I recently have been hired by a college campus ministry known as Reformed University Fellowship. The ministry was founded by the Presbyterian Church in America and is on over 130 college campuses throughout the US with a few abroad. My job as an intern is to assist an ordained campus minister in the ministry that he has built on campus. My main goal as an intern will be to reach out to Freshman and ""fringe"" students (often transfer students as well as those on campus who have not found a community to be a part of yet) 
As a Freshman RUF played a pivotal role in my spiritual growth as well as provided me with strong believers as friends. I struggled greatly throughout my college career and RUF is the reason I graduated and the reason I've found this opportunity to serve the church now. 

In order to pursue this opportunity in my life I am required to raise my salary as well as ministry expenses (coffee money for one on one meetings with students adds up) My yearly budget is $31,000 which covers, personal living expenses, ministry expenses, as well as insurance and training expenses. After the Internship is complete Many seminaries provided 2 years of school for free or heavily discounted (for those in the internship) which will allow me to then pursue a master of divinity and later pursue a career as a pastor or as a religion professor. (both of which I am heavily considering) 

I just wanted to share this with the community because I really need prayer as support raising is hard and I am a little demoralized at the moment. Please be praying for me and my ministry, that I will rely on God to provide the opportunity to ask those who are able to give. 

If you want to learn more about My ministry, how you can be praying for me more specifically over the next few years, or feel called to give, visit www.mattsministry.com I just put the sit online so any feedback would be great too. 

In Him, 

Matt Arends"
4feut7,1,2016-04-18,[rant] Absolutely hate my job and an uncertain future. Need advice.,throwtirame,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4feut7/rant_absolutely_hate_my_job_and_an_uncertain/,"I *really, really* hate my job. I hate the principle behind it (predatory pay day loans); hate the hours 9 am--7 pm Mon--Fri + 2 hrs daily bus commute; hate the fact that I have to log *all* my work times for supposed ""raise purposes"" yet have heard nothing of raises; hate that they lied about 6-month reviews for pay raises (there haven't been any yet and it's been 10 months); hate how much they overwork us; hate all the guilt-tripping (I have refused to be guilt-tripped); hate the shitty pay; I hate my lawful (read: shitty) benefits and holidays; I only like my non-asskissing coworkers.

I have money saved up, just enough to keep me going and until I begin an *extremely* competitive STEM PhD program at a top school in the UK. I already even have an internship (during my PhD) and job offer at a world-reknowned company whose products are found in universities world-wide, but due to visa requirements I need an advanced degree because I'm self-taught in that area. However, funding is an open question because my stupid government cannot make a damn website worth for shit, and I have yet to recieve a paper from my host university despite already having met all their academic requirements (physical copy of my diploma and transcript). They've been unresposive to emails so I'll call them via skype tomorrow to resolve the issue. And as far as government funding is concerned I'll visit their local offices and apply in person or ask them to help me apply right there on their own PCs so they can see how much their website sucks.

I was planning on leaving the company when I hit a year in less than two months but I'm so fucking incredibly fed up of this shit. At this point, even if funding falls through which is unlikely---but possible---seeing as how the program has only two spots, I could apply to US universities and get a better job meanwhile. I don't know what to do, it feels like I'm rotting here and I should have nothing to complain about, but damnit this sucks. Objectively I know I'm being a fool, and this is likely caused by the stress caused of my funding situation.

I need advice. "

4fewle,27,2016-04-18,Past ESA (President) Brad Cohen of SAE resigns membership from the fraternity,DeBrotie,Frat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/4fewle/past_esa_president_brad_cohen_of_sae_resigns/,"Taken from Brad's facebook page:
&gt;Many have see me as a man of steel. Most know I suffer from type 1 diabetes since I was 11. Many don't know I suffer from depression and anxiety. After some events that have taken place, And after after watching the behavior of an undergrad yesterday and one that just returned from the Levere Leadership Institute in Evanston, point fingers and blame for his and his chapter's total lack of accountability and laziness, I've resigned my membership in SAE. I'm done with the hypocrisy, the use of the word brotherhood very loosely and to be quite frank, the lack of simple decency. It's time to focus on me for once. Unfortunately, as they say...no good deed goes unpunished!

**Update**
&gt;My wife has asked me to take my post down. I need to clarify.
I joined SAE as a sophomore in 1982. A very shy 2 year immigrant in this country. I held every position in my chapter. Upon graduation, I worked for 2 years for the national fraternity. I set up colonies across the country.
When i entered the professional world in 1988, I moved to Newport Beach and continued to serve as a volunteer. As Province Archon for 10 years, chairman of the National Extension Committee and then served 10 years on the Fraternity Endowment Fund, SAE Services and Financial &amp; Housing Board of Directors. I served on the Supreme Council for 9 years and my final 2 as national president.
All through it all I have raised 3 children and been married to Kim for 25 years in October. I also served as President of JDRF, on the executive board of theJCC and the executive board of the UCI Diabetes Center, all while building a business.
I've barely had a deal in business from an SAE yet I've hired 6 and have 2-3 SAEs as interns every year. I've served on the Leadership School faculty for 30 years. Apparently I now need to submit an application in case the board doesn't know what I've done or who I am?
I have done my very best to protect this organization through some of the most trying times in our history. I did it for my deep belief in SAE. I was the only one of my board members to step forward publicly to defend our decisions when the others chose to remain silent.
The incident I witnessed yesterday with a typical snot nosed undergrad who can't take responsibility for his total pathetic leadership was the straw that broke the camels back.
I have also have a tough time watching our undergrads dollars being spent with little thought on extravagant meals, trips and unnecessary expenses.
I have a tough time when simply making our leaders aware of time bombs looking at me as the pariah. I have a tough time when I can't get an answer to simple questions I'm asked by hundreds of alumni and undergrads that still follow me.
I have never been one wanting accolades and made it very clear when I was ESA I was simply chairman of the board and not the grand poobah.
But my health is suffering and I'm not one to simply step away. Unlike most ESAs, i took a seat on the foundation board because I believe deeply in its mission and its leadership with both Ed Fuller and Gen. Will Grimsley.
I have had over 1000 truly moving emails, texts and messengers regarding my earlier announcement. My wife and kids do not want me to resign. 99.9% of you feel the same way. I appreciate the genuine concern and love I have received, especially from Greg Brandt, Mike Corelli and Mike Rogers on our Supreme Council.
Like I've so often preached, I will yield to the advice of my brothers and sleep on this for a few days.
The way I'm feeling right now, I could take my dog and go find an island to live on far away from life! But as many of you have stated and I didn't quite realize, the impact I've had on many of you and I hope you know whatever my ultimate decision is no way a negative reflection of a great Fraternity. It's a personal matter that only I can deal with in my own way. Brad

4fewuo,1,2016-04-18,[Support] I can't fix my problem with my internship or find a job and I feel trapped.,91lightning,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4fewuo/support_i_cant_fix_my_problem_with_my_internship/,"I had some trouble with my internship. A little less than a month ago, my supervisor left the company and I have been stuck in limbo ever since. I have contacted everyone involved with the issue. I contacted my supervisor, his superiors, my internship director,and internship professor. They all told me that they would take care of the issue somehow. But the company I interned for has not given me an update about how they were going to fix my problem. I'm 2/3 of the way through my hours for my internship and the deadline for my internship is at the start of May. My professor didn't blame me for what has happened, but I don't know if she will let me pass or let me finish my hours once a solution is in place. 

I'm supposed to graduate from my university in May and I can't find a job relating to my degree. I will have completed my Radio, Television, and Film degree and I still can't find a job for it. I have already applied to several places and none of them have gotten back to me on my application. 

I have been having some financial trouble lately. My lease for my apartment has expired last month and I have to pay around a $1000 for rent because of this. I can't sign another lease because I don't know when I will find another job. Once I find a job, set a budget for myself based on my wages, find another apartment behind my Nparents' back and get everything that was previously signed to my Nparents over to me, then I will go NC. It would cost me a lot of money to break lease if I were to sign another. I wouldn't have enough money left to move to my new apartment if I were to sign another lease and break it once I have a job.

I have an account on LinkedIn and I haven't found any job relating to my degree. I also looked on Indeed and google searched for video production jobs. Even if I could find a job to apply for, the companies I applied for haven't contacted me.

I feel trapped because I can't find a job, I don't know if I will be able to pass my internship class or not, and because I can't find a job, I'm stuck with to my Nparents' abuse and their attempts to control me. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. I feel like all the choices I could make to escape my Nfamily are being exhausted:"

4ffa5b,0,2016-04-18,Help choosing Engineering major!,Spaced-Cat,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ffa5b/help_choosing_engineering_major/,"Hey fellow engineer students, I'm finishing my sophomore year of my mech E pre-major, and I don't know what I want to do still.

 I love mechanics and physics of how things work in general. I always was fascinated by aircraft as a kid, and the physics of flight and motion. But math is kicking my tail. I don't naturally get along with it. Its a combo of just not ""getting it"" and being lazy in my studies when it comes to algebra due to the lack of motivation and difficulty.

how do I know that this is right for me? My schools engineering counselor says I should give up engineering if i'm not a natural at algebra! fuck that guy?? or is this true?

and how have you guys chosen your paths? I always say I want to be an aerospace Engineer and specialize in propulsion!, but I am put off by the math involved in a engineering degree. 

Something I am however a natural at, is computers. I'm working on getting my comp TIA A+ and Security+ so I can earn good money while finishing school. I get the feeling that I should shift my focus into computer engineering instead. but I have no idea what that involves and if I would even like it. 

you all know the ""do what you love and you will never work a day"" saying. I feel like aviation is my calling, and computers are a backup, but I have no internship or work experience with either, so I don't know what is the better fit for me, or where I can find resources to differentiate the different engineering fields.

Can any of you A.E.'s, C.E.'s or M.E.'s pitch in?
were any of you math-tards, that turned out ok?
where can i find an in depth overview or video of the different disciplines?"
4ffj40,2,2016-04-18,Working at a Startup...Do I have a Future?,polishpiwko,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4ffj40/working_at_a_startupdo_i_have_a_future/,"Graduated (Bachelors) in '15 from a good university majored in Marketing, love the digital/ecommerce side of it and knew it was something I'd want to pursue. Interned senior year of college at big company as a digital marketing/product content intern, got exposed to the corporate world. I did not learn as much as I have at my current start up job. After college, I had a tough time looking for a position (as most of them want experience of 2+ years plus). So, I just decided to take a leap of faith and just work at this small marketing company specializing in taking over clients Amazon presence. 

I am wondering will this help with future career paths? I'm worried that this position can limit my opportunities because I surely want to get a higher salary and benefits. What I do on a daily basis is:
 
*Work with shipping inventory from clients warehouse to Amazon

*Create attractive listings, constantly update clients listings

*Communicate with clients and Amazon customers by phone and in person meetings (for clients)

*Email marketing targeted towards Amazon customers (post purchases) to get reviews

*Keyword and Promotional Campaigns

*Consistently work on search terms on Amazon listings

*Weekly conference calls with clients

*Salesforce usage on a daily basis

*Export data and create useful pivot tables to provide to clients of sales, conversion rates, etc.. 


The company is rapidly growing, gaining lot of attention from large firms. I learn a ton, ton more than if I took a corporate job and being limited to the exposure of the business as a whole. Communicating with clients is not something I'd expect right out of college, but its great experience and I am getting more comfortable talking with older businessmen. Also, I get so many responsibilities and multi-tasking and jumping from one to-do to the next definitely is good as well. Im just wondering if I am on the right path in terms of the digital marketing landscape/industry. Im an Account Manager at this place and want to know if I have a future in digital/ecommerce marketing. 

Thanks for the help. "
4ffkck,51,2016-04-18,[ZLNG][REKAP]DIE NACHT DER LANGEN MESSER. /r/de hat unseren guten Freund /u/Dtxer eiskalt abserviert.[AUSDERSCHLEIFE],GuantanaMo,kreiswichs,https://www.reddit.com/r/kreiswichs/comments/4ffkck/zlngrekapdie_nacht_der_langen_messer_rde_hat/,"*Zuallererst möchte ich zugeben, dass ich den Solidaritäts-Köpfer schon wieder durch etwas ohne Hakenkreuz ersetzt habe, um meine Kreiswichs-Brausierungserfahrung auf der Arbeit nicht zu kompromittieren. Ich sehe leider keinen Weg, eine Solidaritätsnachricht an Dtxer ohne Hakenkreuz zu formulieren.*

**Dieser Text soll der Erinnerung an unseren Freund /u/dtxer dienen, und Neubienen neutral und objektiv über seine Taten informieren.**

##**Was bisher geschah...**

Alles begann damit, dass der türkische President, Rezept Transit Erdumlaufban, vom deutschen Spaßmacher und Jecken Jens Bömmelmann mittels eines Gedichtes verunglimpft wurde.

Der alte Orientale hat dann natürlich hart durchgegriffen und Mutti instruiert, den Dichter bei Wasser und Brot einzukerkern.

Zeitgleich haben unsere Freunde auf /r/de die politische Macht des Weltnetzproletariats erkannt und dem Angelsachsen Donald Trumpf[ derbe zugesetzt](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4evtd1/rde_zerst%C3%B6rt_rthe_donald/).

Sturmbannführer dtxer scheint aber die neu gewonnene militärische Macht zu Kopf gestiegen zu sein. Ohne Wissen des Führers (Obraka) hat er dann die Initiative ergriffen und eine Operation gegen den türkischen Islamistenführer und Präsidenten, Respekt Ali Ehrenmordogan eingeleitet.

Klandestin hat der wackere dtxer seine Mitstreiter in /r/OperationStreisand versammelt. Er hat auch unsere Wenigkeit, die Kreiswichsleiter, um Unterstützung ersucht, und [wir haben 
den Jungspund noch gewarnt](http://b.bildgur.de/EOB4vHi.jpg), implizierend, dass ihm bald von der Heimatfront ein ordentlicher Dolchstoß erwarten würde.

Dtxer's ""Operation Streusand"" trug bald erste Früchte und verunsicherte die Bosporusbewohner. [Ein braver Deutscher hat Bericht erstattet](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4f17ln/lage_in_rturkey_ist_dramatisch/), aber vergessen die Tür zuzumachen, und prompt haben die Türken /r/de mit ihrer ständigen Jammerei angesteckt. Rasch wurde Dtxer zum Schuldigen für die diplomatische Verstimmung  gemacht. [Dafür entschuldigte sich der brave Deutsche.](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4f29a5/entschuldigung_an_udtxer/) Es sollte die letzte Entschuldigung sein, die jemals an Dtxer gerichtet wurde.

##**ESKALATION^ON^^ON^ON**  

Jemand, dessen Nutzername verdächtigerweise mit ""Adi"" beginnt, sollte die entscheidende Rolle in diesem Drama spielen. Adi [denunzierte den braven Dtxer](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4f37ru/unser_aller_mod_wann_ist_da_die_grenze/), der an der Front mit allen Mitteln gegen den gekränkten Mann am Bosporus vorging. 

Wie wir heute wissen, geriet hier der Stein ins Rollen. Ein /r/de-Blockwart, der lieber anonym bleiben möchte, erhob [öffentlich \(intern\) Anklage gegen unseren Helden.](http://b.bildgur.de/bqotdXw.jpg)

Dtxer hielt[ eine flammende Verteidigungsrede](http://b.bildgur.de/NtByuwC.jpg), in der er unter anderem seine Absicht unterstrich, /r/de wieder DEUTSCH zu machen. Er erinnerte die Moderatoren an den herrschenden Kriegszustand, an die Grabenkämpfe. Spaß haben sei nicht genug, sagte er, denn das bringe niemanden um.

Doch es  war zu spät. Dtxer's Kriegserklärung gegen Deutschlands Feinde, die in ehrlicher Absicht getätigt wurde, wurde durch die /r/de-Führung zurückgenommen. Die Moderatoren, sogar /u/sdfghs, hatten sich schon gegen unseren Helden verschworen.

In den  ~~Iden des März~~ Mitten des Aprils war es soweit, Dtxer spürte den metaphorischen Dolch zwischen den Rippen. Seine letzten Worte den anderen Moderatoren gegenüber waren Berichten zufolge relativ langweilig.

Seine öffentlichen Pfosten hat er mit ins Grab genommen, vermutlich waren sie zu inspirierend, um sie ohne Waffenschein zu pfostieren. Paradoxerweise sind uns also nur die Geheimbesprechungen der Moderatorenriege erhalten.

Wird Lases ohne Dtxer jemals wieder das selbe sein? Vielleicht. Wird es sogar besser sein? Ohne Zweifel. Danke für deinen Dienst, Dtxer, und ein herzliches ""reeeeeeeeeeeeee""."

4ffvn0,6,2016-04-19,[Hiring] [Summer position] Over 60 positions available in San Mateo County - Inspiring Summers Lead Learning Facilitator $20-$24 hourly,maker-learner,SFBayJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayJobs/comments/4ffvn0/hiring_summer_position_over_60_positions/,"I work for San Mateo County Library [smcl.org](www.smcl.org). We are hiring for a 6.5 week paid internship in Library Learning Camps. Interviews are being held 4/19 and 4/23.


Applicants should be 18 or over, enthusiastic about working with youth, and enjoy hands-on learning activities.


**Inspiring Summers Lead Learning Facilitator**


**Salary:** $20-$24 hourly


**Location:** Inspiring Summers Lead Learning Facilitators will be assigned to work at one of ten library learning camps with children who will be entering kindergarten or first grade in the fall. The camps are located in South San Francisco, Daly City, Half Moon Bay, La Honda, East Palo Alto, Atherton, Fair Oaks and Menlo Park.


**Position:** The camps serve children reading below grade level in areas where the majority of youth qualify for free or reduced lunch. Half day camps build 21st century skills through hands-on learning experiences.

These summer learning experiences are a critical part of our County’s strategy of dramatically reducing the number of youth who cannot read on grade level in 3rd grade. If you can’t read proficiently in 3rd grade, you are at significant risk for a number of troubling outcomes, outcomes that disproportionately affect youth of color and socioeconomically disadvantaged youth. Help us change the world by inspiring youth with your love of learning, warmth, and by igniting problems-solving. You can help us change how children of think of themselves--let’s end the summer together with confident youth who will have had the benefit of high quality, cutting-edge learning experiences with caring and passionate adults.

Lead Learning Facilitators will be responsible for leading implementation of our cutting-edge curriculum developed with the Center for Childhood Creativity and for providing direction to your paired Assistant teacher. Lead Learning Facilitators will be responsible for establishing and maintaining an environment that embraces the growth mindset, actively facilitates open-ended, child directed projects with children, and looks for every opportunity to embrace and incorporate youth creativity.


**Schedule:** This 6.5 week internship begins with a weeklong required training either during the week of May 23-May 27 or the week of June 6-10, and will then continue with a 5 week assignment in one of our learning camps. There may be an option to extend the internship to support additional summer learning activities for those who are seeking a longer term of employment. The 5 week camp assignment will be for 30 hours per week: 5.5 hours Monday-Thursday; 8 hours every Friday.


**Desired Skills and Abilities:**

* Enthusiastic about working with youth

* Experience or aptitude with group management

* Joyful attitude

* Comfortable with or experience acting as a role model

* Able to share a love of learning and sense of curiosity

* Show leadership

* Show initiative

* Able to easily switch tasks when needed

* Familiarity with conflict resolution strategies

* Positive approach

* Enthusiasm in helping to facilitate hands-on learning activities and physical activities

* Knowledge of camp culture

* Enjoys singing and dancing

* Enjoys meeting new people and fostering relationships with youth

* Eager to try new things


**Education or experience:** Enrollment in college is a requirement of this position. Experience coaching, tutoring, demonstrated interest in working with youth. Experience in theater, arts, music, youth development, early childhood, social justice, science preferred. Bilingual in Spanish preferred.

Interested applicants are required to apply in person and be available for a brief interview at one of the following employment fairs. Hurry! Spots fill up quickly. Be sure to arrive early to ensure a chance at one of these exciting positions! If you are unable to make either of these sessions but are interested in applying, please contact Stephanie Saba (sabas@smcl.org).

4ffyoe,0,2016-04-19,"Me [17 F] with my boyfriend [17 M] of 10m, are in a long distance relationship that is deteriorating and need help to fix it!!",throwaway1938484848,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ffyoe/me_17_f_with_my_boyfriend_17_m_of_10m_are_in_a/,"I'm using a throwaway account because people from my school and my boyfriend reddit and I don't want them to see this. 

I'll try to make this as short as possible, and I hope that what I write is comprehensible, but I am a little out of sorts right now so I don't know if any of that will be possible.

I met my current boyfriend last summer (almost 10m ago) at a study abroad program in Europe. We were immediately drawn to each other, and ended up being inseparable the entire three weeks. 

At first, we both agreed that it would be best to only be together for those three weeks, as we live a couple of hours drive apart (two states apart in the US), and neither of us can drive. Moreover, we were both going into our junior year in high school, the worst year in high school as the pressure to get into college becomes extremely intense. Coming from similar backgrounds and having similar work ethics, both my set of parents and his expected us to work our asses off in order to be viable contenders for the most competitive schools. 

So basically, we decided that the distance and the pressure from both of our parents would make each of us more stressed throughout the year, we would barely get to see each other, and the relationship would constantly suffer.

Unfortunately, two weeks into the study abroad program, we mutually decided that we should try the relationship out and see what will happen. 

Fast forward 10 months give or take to Saturday night. He came to my house for the first time in 3 weeks -- 3 terrible weeks in which we actually decided (after months of fighting solely based on distance-related problems) to break up/take a break until the next time we could see each other. 

Sat-Sun was the last opportunity to see each other for a couple of months (the longest we will ever have been apart for), because he has testing in May and his father is emotionally abusive/extremely strict and blamed him for a lot of different things to use as an excuse not to let him visit me (long story that I will not get into for the sake of brevity). 

My parents are more understanding, and give me the freedom that I need so long as I still maintain a 4.0 in school and don't do super stupid things (like trying Meth or something I'm assuming). They are happy to send me to his house whenever he is available, and are happy for him to come to mine. They even invite him on our family vacations (he came with us for a week last summer). It is his family that is more controlling, and rarely ever lets us spend time together, even though he performs better than me in school and does 243893 extra curriculars.

We will barely even get time in this summer, as his father is going to force him into a long internship for college's sake, and he is going on two different trips. I had originally thought we had the summer to spend together, and that was one of the reasons we had broken up. 

Sat night, as we were cuddling and watching TV in my bed, I had a breaking point and just started crying uncontrollably. I didn't stop for a good hour or so and he ended up crying too. I know that we need to break up because it is impossible to maintain a relationship where we can never see each other and at times, barely even talk to each other, but I can't break up with him. 

I don't remember my life without him Reddit, I don't know when we are ever going to be together for an extended period of time, our lives aren't even going in the same paths, but I can't live without him. I know it sounds stupid and I'm so young and blah blah blah, but I really do love him and he is all I think about and care about in the world, and I know he feels the same. Our only problem is the distance that separates us, his crazy strict parents, and the stress of school. Otherwise, we are a near-perfect couple and we just click together. 

I don't know what to do. Is there a way to make this work that I am just completely unaware of? Is there some way to get through this without breaking up?

tldr; My boyfriend and I are stuck in a shitty LDR, we both love each other and can't live without each other, but it becomes harder and harder to be in this relationship each day."
4ffysh,2,2016-04-19,"Advice on getting consistent effects from medication, adding medications for anxiety/depression without messing with ADHD symptoms, and general advice too (post is kinda long)",crashbandicool,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4ffysh/advice_on_getting_consistent_effects_from/,"Hey guys. Long story short, I managed my way into one of the best engineering schools in the country by staying up every day in high school until 5am through some mixture of willpower and extreme anxiety. I thought those days would be over after graduating, but unfortunately not. I realized I had a problem after not being able to study for any classes, sleeping 15 hours a day, having no friends, and gaining 40 pounds. So I went to the doctor, etc... and decided to take time off to see what I could do so that I'd have a triumphant return. Spent these past few months trying out ADHD medications and seeing what worked and have been using Vyvanse (70mg split up throughout the day) and sometimes it works perfectly, other times average, and other times barely. As school and internship stuff approaches, my anxiety in general shoots through the roof and on top of that I need a consistently working medication. 

I've tried all the amphetamine drugs and my doctor usually is not too prescription happy, so I haven't really asked to try any of the methylphenidate drugs. I feel like the same cycle will occur anyway, that they'll work amazing at first, then just weaken in strength. I can focus fine with the medication, but mental clarity/removing brain fog is what I really need help with. The clarity I get on the first few weeks of Vyvanse or Dexedrine while studying is great and I feel helpless without the clarity of thought. I am already two years into the intense program and I won't be able to graduate if some days I can understand things and the next day my notes don't make sense and that occurs for a few days until the medication randomly starts working. 

I have a job coming up in a month in a different state so I won't have access to the doctor for like 3 months. And school begins again in August. I have no idea if I should even go to the internship. The testing periods for these medications are so long for me and I'd rather miss out on this internship than go back to school without a working medication. But the internship is something I worked hard for and it's a seemingly good opportunity. Right now I have no actual deadlines and my anxiety and depression have gotten much better, but it's getting worse as I know it's crunch time and I need to make tough decisions that will play a huge part in deciding my success as a student. 

I went to the doctor about getting an anti anxiety drug or anti depressant and he suggested SSRIs, but I have taken one before and know from others that they make you feel more sluggish and like a zombie. I can't have anything making me even more slow and foggy so I know the alternatives would be wellbutrin and intuniv. I asked my doctor about wellbutrin and he said it's mainly for depression and that it may worsen my anxiety so he dismissed that. I told him that my symptoms aren't so bad right now but that I know it'll get worse as school approaches and he didn't think that was reason enough to think about any additional medications. I didn't ask about intuniv since I don't know enough about it and that is my 'last shot' at getting something that can help my anxiety and not worsen my ADHD symptoms. 

This is all long winded and rambling, but my main questions are does anyone know what's up with the inconsistent medication and any advice on addressing this? Adding in something else for mental clarity would be perfect since the vyvanse works well for focus but there's literally nothing online that is convincing about sluggish cognitive tempo or anything of the sort (like the front page post about brain fog clearly depicts). I have no idea whether going to the internship is the right decision, because missing out on it would suck, but going back to school without a working medication would be even worse. I’d have 4 more months to try stuff out instead of just one month, if I don’t go to the internship. Going back to school is going to suck in general because I have no friends and no one to relate to. I somehow slipped into this amazing school where everyone else is really smart, went to private school, etc.. and literally none of the kids I talked to while at school noticed I left. I need to go back and try to make the best of it, but the medication is frustrating and I know I’m going to be anxious and depressed again if I don’t have all these mental health issues under wraps. If anyone has any advice on this stuff that’d be great to hear. The only option I can think of is it to get the intuniv which would help anxiety without messing with the ADHD symptoms too much, since I’d rather be anxious and focused, than calm and failing out of school. Sorry this is so long, but I have no one else to tell. Thanks again guys.


Tl;dr: Somehow got into a good school, realized my anxiety, ADHD, and depression were too big of an obstacle to overcome while also trying to tackle coursework, took a year off, tried multiple medications, none of which work consistently, but so far Vyvanse has been the best. Vyvanse helps me focus pretty consistently, but is on and off for mental clarity. I really to have a clear mind while at school and especially with my anxiety and depression which is worsening as school approaches, I need to have this all figured out by August. I am thinking of adding intuniv to the vyvanse to help with mental clarity and anxiety, but my doctor isn’t really all for adding medications for symptoms that aren’t super intense yet. I also have an internship coming up (far far from home) but have no idea if I should go or stay home and figure out the medication stuff. Everything seems to be a struggle for me and I am almost at wit’s end. Pls advise.

4ffyu2,5,2016-04-19,My mom keeps taking money from me. I never see it again. Idk what to do to make it stop.,swaylyn,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4ffyu2/my_mom_keeps_taking_money_from_me_i_never_see_it/,"I'm not even sure if this is the right subreddit to use. 

I'm 23, just graduated graduate school, looking for a full time. 

I have saved my internship money in the bank. My mother has been obsessed with how much money I have and how she can use that for her own bills and shit since she discovered I had a paid summer internship. Mind you, that in itself was a new side of my mother. I never anticipated that. But I was also never in a position of having a ""full time"" job. Other jobs I've had during college I never mentioned, simply because I saw no need.

When I returned home from my internship I had to lie to her about how much money I had, because instead of asking ""how was your summer away/did you like your internship/etc"" her first question was ""how much money did you make? what bank are you using? (because we have a joint account that I don't contribute too so she knew I must have a separate one). So I thought that was WEIRD AS HELL and deflected as best I could. Then she asked me for  4k to pay the mortgage.  I gave her 2k.

The thing is. She comes to me saying how she really needs to pay some bill and yada yada has this whole exaggeration about it. And I'm a serious person and I would believe her, I still do, I just understand now that she uses me as a resources, not a last ditch effort. But a convienet plan A. 

Both her and my grandma try to hit me up for money. I don't give my grandma money though, she acts like she's joking but I know she's serious. Meanwhile my mom goes on about how she really needs the money RIGHT NOW for xyz reason.

And tbh she is not good with managing her money. Sometimes her account goes into overdraft, which is why I always made sure to have a way to cover expenses while I was in college because I couldn't depend on her. 
I don't mind being independent. But I do mind being responsible for her. It's not right that she hits me up for money because I have no job currently and I had $700 saved in cash which of course, surprise surprise, she ended up taking. She needed to pay off some home bill asap (bc she waits til the last minute on ALL BILLS) and she asked me for $900 i said i only had 700, she said that wasn't enough. So I figured the matter was done. But then she came back and took the money anyway (decided she could use it for spending money while she is on vaca the following week) I was SO MAD when she said ""wait this is $100 short"" are you kidding me, I know how to count and you shouldn't even have that money. Then she says ""never it's all here""

So anyway, she paid for my wisdom tooth extraction, we had a refund tho for some of the money ($500) so I took that to put towards the 700 she owes me. Because we didnt expect to get that money back I knew it would be fine to take and she had no plans for it. Now she just took $200 from me to pay the phone bill bc they are going to shut it off at any moment. So I guess I just have 300 saved in cash right now...

Honestly, I'm just glad they stopped talking about my money in the bank, I told them I only have 3k in there, she actually demanded to see my bank statement!! I said no and walked off.

But yes I know why give her money blah blah, honestly, she has bills...and if I say no, that's just a lot of verbal abuse for me (about how I'm a horrible, selfish person blah blah) and I don't need that I've had 2 decades of that. 

She is ALWAYS so happy when she takes money from me. SO HAPPY. And I'm left annoyed and taken advantage of. But the only thing I know to do is to LEAVE. I subletted a place (I'm heading to another state where I want to work) and I'm going to leave in about 3 weeks if everything works well. 

tl;dr: My mom keeps taking money from me. I never see it again. Idk what to do to make it stop."

I am a current student at a larger state school in their IT program; the degree has multiple tracks and I am on the software development track. I am about 36 credit hours away from graduation, including 3 internship semesters. 

I believe I am doing fairly well for my age; I have 5+ years experience in programming (Mostly web dev and embedded systems) and business experience because of a startup I helped co-found. 

I think I am doing everything right, however I have doubts with my degree. 

* I want to work at a larger tech company, how can I get my foot in the door without a degree in computer science? 

* What level position should I look for and how do I move up? I have never worked at a tech company, however I started one. Does this make me look overqualified on a resume?

* Where should I look into internships? Both physically and online, my city has a high concentration of .NET developers (Yuck) and I am beginning to think relocation is required to work on the forefront. 
 
Thanks for your time hopefully it wasn't too long.

tldr; I don't have any work experience, I start masters in finance in Sept from a top ten business school in EU. I need a course of action because getting a job in EU or the US but it seems virtually impossible.

Here's my story-

I graduated from one of the top business schools in India in 2014 with specialization in finance. I didn't take up employment after college because I wanted to travel. And since then I've been on a ""break"" travelling around the country. 

I took up a small three month course on IB Ops (given the large sector of IB Ops in India) in early 2015 but that didn't interest me. I want to be in the front office. I didn't do any internship during my college because I was a dumb kid and ""internships are worth nothing"". 

I decided to further my education and registered myself to Masters in Finance course from one of the top business schools in EU (Spain specifically). I'll have to look for employment during my course as Spain does not allow visa extension for job search.  I don't have my hopes high, though, because getting a job in EU is very difficult given the language, visa and unemployment issues. North America is also out of reach because why would an American company hire an Indian guy from an EU university. I can't stay in India because I want to travel the world and see as much as I can.

I can't see myself doing anything but finance. I learned quite a lot about finance in my college and I'm good at it. And sincerely, it is the only field I have interest in.


On top of that my parents are very happy that I'm going to EU to study. I've told them part reality. But I on a personal level feel pretty fucked up inside about the decisions I have made.

I feel like I have made all the wrong decisions, and I won't reach anywhere I want. I feel like even after spending all that money and time in such a good college, I'll be exactly where I am now, that is nowhere. 

I want advice on how I can make this work. All feedback is appreciated.

Thanks.

4fgioa,2,2016-04-19,Should I drop out of college in my senior year?,SSW1108,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4fgioa/should_i_drop_out_of_college_in_my_senior_year/,"So I am in my second semester senior in Film school, and I've been spending my last semester abroad in Los Angeles. I was planning to permanently move here this summer after I graduated, and start my career, but... well... turns out I'm not going to graduate. 

This semester has been a little bit of a shitshow for me and I've been missing assignments left and right. Somehow I've managed to make it through doing ok in all of my classes except one. I reached out to my teacher about this and she gave me until today to make up my missing work. As you can probably guess, I did not make this deadline. My grade in this class would be so low that it's not even worth it for me to do the final project, so I am just giving up on that and turning my attention to my other finals (due at the end of this week!)

But failing this class means I won't be able to graduate in May. And now I'm faced with two choices: 
A). Finish the rest of my classes, enroll in a summer program at my school and finish over the summer (I still might get to walk at graduation in May) Then move to LA in the late summer. 
B). Say ""fuck it"" and just give up on school, and carry on with my plan to move out here, and start the rest of my life. 

Now I realize option A seems the most prudent, but let me make my case for B:
I hate school. I've hated school since I was in the second grade. In high school I really started to burn out, so when I graduated I took a year off (this was also so that I could save money for college). 
My first year in college was really successful, I made a lot of friends, I more or less liked my classes, and I got good grades. Sophomore year started out amazing (first semester was one of the best of my life), but things changed and by second semester I was depressed. From there it's all been downhill. Even though I liked a lot of my classes, I struggled to bring in homework assignments on time (even creative ones) and generally my academic performance plummeted. That being said I managed to make through junior year with pretty good grades (I even made dean's list, don't ask me how), and so I decided I was going to stick it out till senior year. Senior year was even more of a mess. while my mental health was generally better than last year, and I was happier and doing more interesting stuff, I was struggling even more with my coursework. I only completed two of my four classed last semester. One class I dropped, and the other I still have unfinished work I need to get in before the end of the semester. I've ended every semester since sophomore year feeling like I barely escaped with my life (and to be honest with certain semesters, I think I did) and It's just getting to a point where I'm so exhausted that I just don't care anymore. I'm so used to showing up to class not having finished last week's assignment that it doesn't even faze me anymore. I've had so many earnest ""I'm just having a really bad semester"" conversations with teachers, that I feel like I'm speaking from a telepromter when I meet with them. And now I've finally *officially* failed my first class. 

And I don't know where to go from here. I don't even feel that upset, I just kind of feel relieved. That's a whole bunch of work I don't have to worry about right? 

So this brings me back to my choice: to take summer classes, or to drop out? 

I honestly feel like I've gotten everything I need from this school. I've learned lots of stuff, I've made friends and networked, I've gotten internships and used the school's (and my own) resources to make a decent short film. And I just don't know what more I can gain from getting my diploma? I feel like it's not worth the extra time (not to mention the extra thousands of dollars I don't have). The film industry is way less focused on your education credentials than it is on who you know and what you've done, and I feel that I have all I'm going to get in those two categories. 

Any advice is really appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I went to the gym every morning before work and i felt great. Not only did i train and made small progress, but i also had this great mindset. When i came into the office, while everyone was tired and somewhat grumpy, i came in and already had a workout, had a shower and just felt great.

I had integrated training as a part of my everyday life. 

4 weeks ago i got ill. Was home for a week and didn't train. 
I didn't train the following week as well, because i hadn't felt good.

Since then i did train like 2 times because i just lost my motivation. Every morning i can't make it out of the bed and go train because i feel like ""what's the point"". And this pissed me off. I felt so great physically and mentaly. 

It may be because i don't have this much of a social-life right now and i don't see the point to get in shape.

Airbnb to the rescue. I found a place near my internship, pictures and reviews looked fantastic, so I booked the place for a month after a couple messages with the host.

I cook quite a bit (never eat out, competitive road cyclist so I eat a ton), and use of a kitchen and fridge/pantry space is important to me. I communicated this to the host and she assured me everything would be okay. However, when I got to the place, there were some issues with the kitchen area. HUGE pile of dishes in the sink, kitchen smells bad, hardly any space on counters. Half a shelf in the fridge and half a small pantry shelf was made available to me. It's been a couple days and this hasn't been resolved. So obviously this isn't going to work at all. First, I looked into canceling the reservation, but since I reserved for a month, I am on the hook for the whole month according to the policy. Fair enough, I should have read the policy before booking.

I plan to talk with the host politely and try to make this as bearable as possible for the next 3.5 or so weeks until I move into a new place, but I was wondering if anyone has any feedback on some other options. Obviously she's not obligated to refund me the money, but do you folks think I may be able to convince her to refund me for 2 weeks so that I can leave early? Is this even a reasonable thing to ask? I'm trying to see things from her point of view, and I understand she's busy, but I'm paying quite a bit of money and I think it's reasonable to expect more fridge/pantry space and a clean kitchen."

I sound ungrateful. Disgusting. I know that. But, somehow, despite all of those advantages, I can't get over this. And at this point, I figure I'll succumb.

I'm a law student. I'm just finishing up my first year. I have an entire summer ahead of reading and writing hundreds of pages of crap. Another two years of this, and finally, I'll be free to work more doing something I hate. My family wants me to do this and strongly discourages me dropping out. I've sunken so much money into it...what else can I do? The idea of dying right now, skipping out on my finals and my internships and my summer classes and, eventually, the rest of my life, seems very attractive. I've been watching TV and doing shit-all instead of studying, and I am extremely behind my classmates.

When I drive, I see people on their bikes and walking. I see people working in coffee shops and construction sites and hospitals. I wonder what their lives are like, if they're happy. If they get up in the morning and they're happy. If they see their friends, if they have parties and cookouts, if they have spouses and babies and many people who love them very much. Some of them must. I can't understand it. I want so much to be them, but I don't think I can.

Other people manage to live without law degrees, with just college degrees. Of course, my English degree is useless. I have a dream where I just get up, pack my things, and move. I have an apartment. Maybe it's near water. I have big windows and I have tomato plants and a cat and a bunch of friends who love me and want to spend time with me. Maybe we make meals together. I go to work, maybe something small but that wouldn't matter, I don't go to school. But I don't have that. I don't think I can ever have that. My life is big and complicated. I alienate everyone I meet and I will never have friends. 

I just want to escape. Every day is just one more day of this, every year is just one more year of this. I have a plan to kill myself on May 21st, when my finals are over, though I'm thinking of pushing it forward. Why even try to finish my finals? Why try to avoid Mother's day, birthdays, holidays? I'm tired. I'm so tired and I want to rest. I think, with my disorder, death is really the only way to do that. "

I only really need a login page + 2 or 3 subpages: dashboard showing general information about game progress, a way to manage users' accounts and a settings console. It needs to communicate with the rest api, populate the pages with jsons and look at least halfway decent.

Time to go for certs, even while attending college?",CWA_IT,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4fizld/landed_a_great_it_intern_position_with_little/," I am currently a sophomore in college (20 y/o) majoring in Computer Information Systems.I have not taken any major classes yet, but this upcoming semester I will be (think about also specializing in Programming classes). I am fairly new to the IT field and am very interested and eager to learn more, but do not have anything specific I want to go in to yet. I've done some very basic Beta Testing and Desktop Hardware Support.

 
 I recently landed an awesome IT Intern opportunity at a nice office because their other intern left to pursue other interests. I am basically the ""main IT guy"" here at the office now and it's a bit overwhelming but I am using this experience to learn a lot and grow in the field. They told me they wanted to hire someone to learn and grow with the company rather than hiring a more experienced person. The company is also serviced by a good IT company that overlooks all our servers/switches and what not, so all the pressure is not on me all the time and I can always ask them questions over the phone and they can remote in and show me. This opportunity is an excellent way to expose me to a variety of things because I am the only IT person at the office (such as admin, servers, general troubleshooting, server management, switches, hardware, etc.) It is basically like a Help Desk job, I do a lot of general troubleshooting but whe nit comes down to the technical stuff I can always call my support team and they can walk me through it.

 
 This experience so far has really driven me to start preparing for my career in the future and sort of ""jump start"" things. Although I don't know exactly what I want to do, or what specific field I want to go in to, I still want to strive for the best and get my degree is CIS. My question is, do you think it would be worth it to start studying for a certification in my free time, like the CompTia A+﻿? Or maybe another certification? In the future I have absolute no desire to fix computer hardware and do like your basic ""geek Squad"" job I guess you can say (no offense). Will this be beneficial for me going forward? I plan on staying with this company for awhile because it's a rapidly growing firm, the people are great, and I see so much potential as I grow with them. I really want to hear some opinions from people with more experience than me and what they would honestly do in my position. I am so new to this field and sort of ""lost in the dark"" and some tips, recommendations, help would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks!"
4fj1nb,538,2016-04-19,UPDATE: Found an email from my (30F) BF (27M) to his ex that harassed me and I feel so betrayed and lost-- it's a doozy!,betrayedandlost12345,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fj1nb/update_found_an_email_from_my_30f_bf_27m_to_his/,"Some of you may have seen yesterday’s post on my EX-boyfriend and the email I found him sending his ex-girlfriend. I updated within the text post to mention that he had actually cheated on me but I’m just reeling from the details of it and thought I’d share here. 

Here's a link to that post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fcrm1/found_an_email_from_my_30f_bf_27m_to_his_ex_that/


So amongst the messages I dug up was an old Google hangout from August of 2015 (the month he moved in me after coming back from a summer internship btw) which said, among other things: “She is not better than me. I did not deserve you to cut our time short. Nor you to replace me by the first broom with legs. And hell you are not over me! Because you will still f* me. And that says a lot. Because i am fat, and wasnt dressed nicely or anything. It was just me. As simple as i could be. And you still found me beautiful and sexy. But you dont fucking thing i am good enough to be in a relationship with? Why would i let a man that treats me like you do be happy with someone el se? I need to put me as a priority not you. And i need to fucking stop sleeping with you. And that only ends when i tell her. Or you do!.”


More digging revealed a plane ticket that she had purchased for him in April of 2015 for dates when he was supposedly at a conference and having a job interview. Turns out that she flew him out to her town because she was moving to our town and taking over the sublet on his apartment so he could move in with me and also go to his summer internship. When he got back from that trip he had dumped me the next day. 


At the time he said it was because I wasn’t going to handle our separation well and that he was worried he would abandon his PhD and take a corporate job because he loved me too much. When he dumped me I immediately threw him out and guess where I found out he stayed? In his old apartment, with her! Of course he came back to me saying he’d made a huge mistake and I forgave him because I loved him and thought it was understandable that all the big changes would stress him out. 


While he claims he only slept with her the one time, and it’s irrelevant whether that’s true or not, it is true that despite his promises otherwise he has been talking to her all along. He still is. Even about mundane stuff.


I feel so dumb. I was in therapy for my trust issues because I felt bad for being so worked up about her and it turned out I was right. I had asked him direct questions and he would always deny things and I felt bad. I decided to trust him because I loved him. And he was freaking gas lighting me so that I thought I was the one with the problem.


And you know what’s the stupidest thing? I hate myself because I still love him and I wish anything that this was a nightmare and it would all work out somehow. He said he’d “do anything” to make it right but I guess he can’t turn back time and not be a lying piece of a garbage. I’m so heartbroken. I loved him and he hurt me and I know it’s clear cut but I just want to be OK and nothing feels OK.

   
**tl;dr**: My Ex-boyfriend's cheating and deception was even more epic than I thought it was and I am so, so, so unbelievably sad. "

I'm a new developer who was lucky enough to get a summer job doing software development. I am mostly self taught so I've been continually asking for and completing projects before the internship starts to feel comfortable from day one. My boss tasked me with creating a Tetris game, and so far it's went great, I've followed this tutorial (linked below) and have made my own changes to make the game my own. The issue I am having is that the game is made to run in a 640x320 px canvas. for whatever reason on my screen this is bigger than you can fit in one window, so parts of the canvas element get cut off. I tried resizing everything to half size (background picture block picture etc) and changing the draw variables when I use ctx to draw blocks to my canvas but it doesn't work the way you would expect and ends up looking terrible and does not make the game playable. Just changing the canvas element does not work either. I am looking for a way to basically render out the canvas in 640x320 and then scale it.

My canvas draw elements are equivalent to those in the index.html file in this folder, the game logic is located in a script under the canvas (I actually want to change that but want to get everything right before I move it to a different file to clean up my html).

Thanks for the help!

http://www.rhuno.com/Downloads/RhunoTetrisComplete.zip


EDIT: I am able to shrink the height of the canvas but any time I try to change the width things get wonky. It is okay the way it is now but I feel like this is a problem I should be able to fix regardless."
4fj5ro,2,2016-04-19,"Me [21 M], my [21 F] girlfriend is very close with her [37 M] coworker. While I don't think she will cheat, I'm very uncomfortable",throwaway7655438,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fj5ro/me_21_m_my_21_f_girlfriend_is_very_close_with_her/,"My girlfriend had a 6-month internship working with environmental health&amp;safety at a manufacturing plant for a big company last year. After this semester ends in a few weeks, she will be returning to the same position for another 6 months.
While working there, she befriended a lot of coworkers. Mostly older, 30-40yo, and a few interns around her age. They were in a running group together, and would meet up for lunch or dinner once a week.

One in particular, we'll call him Steve, she became really close to. She would text most of her coworkers occasionally, to coordinate the running group or setup times for lunches, or just have a quick chat. But with Steve, as soon as she would get home, she'd be chatting with him over text/phone until she fell asleep, every single day. I feel a bit guilty about this, but after a month of this I snooped her phone briefly and skimmed through a few days of conversations. There was nothing particularly alarming, it's mostly casual conversation, although they talk as though they are best friends and he seems borderline flirty.

Steve is a well-payed engineer, has a wife and two kids. I am **99.9% certain that nothing physical has happened between Steve and my girlfriend**. I honestly trust that she would tell me. However, I can't stop being uncomfortable about this 37 year old man texting my girlfriend for hours every day. Even after her internship ended 6 months ago, she has texted him nearly every day and met with him for lunch 5-10-ish times.
here's the really weird part, another girl who interned at the same place, we'll call her Sarah, befriended Steve and his close friend that we'll call Mike. 

Mike is 40-something, has a wife and kids, but became similarly close to Sarah. It actually reached a point where my girlfriend told me that Sarah was a bit creeped out by how flirty and clingy Mike could get. My girlfriend jokingly asked Mike if he would make Sarah his girlfriend and he responded with ""If I weren't married, I honestly would."" Now, my girlfriend thinks that Mike's behavior is weird and creepy. But she also thinks it's ""cute"" and encourages Sarah to keep talking to him. Steve is aware of all of this, and it concerns me that he sees my girlfriend accepting Mike's behavior

Yesterday, I was standing behind my girlfriend (sort of hugging her, she knew I was there), watching a public event, and she was texting Sarah. I couldn't resist looking down and reading some of their conversation. They were ( jokingly) talking about their ""boyfriends"" Mike and Steve, and it went something like

&gt;GF: they're married, why do they even like us?

&gt;S:of course they like us! We're 20 year old cuties!

&gt;GF: I guess the bigger question is why do we like them??

&gt;S: cuz they're old and mature and rich

&gt;GF: hahaha yeah i guess so


I didn't see any more after that. **Again I want to make it clear that I'm almost 100% positive that nothing romantic/sexual has ever occurred between Steve and my girlfriend**. But I also think that they have this strange fantasy relationship where Steve would absolutely fuck her brains out if he wasn't married. My girlfriend is extremely loyal and would absolutely never cheat on me. I trust her with this 100%. However, I only have my girlfriend's word that Steve is a trustworthy guy. I've met him once and he was perfectly friendly. But I'm constantly worried and jealous of how extremely close they are and the fact that she talks to him almost more than she talks to me.


I have tried talking to her about the issue, but it is difficult to approach. She doesn't like when I criticize her friendship with Steve. She is open to talking about him, and will frequently bring him up and tell me about conversations they've had. But he is an important friend to her, and I can't just tell her to stop being friends with him. I can't just be like ""Hey, you know that friend you have that you're super close with? Can you stop being his friend just because he makes me uncomfortable despite never having done anything?"" She thinks I'm being jealous and paranoid when I say that I think Steve is weird.


and to note: my girlfriend is awesome, but she's kind of an attention-whore when it comes to guys. The vast majority of her friends are guys, and at least half of the guys that she has befriended over the past few years have openly admitted to having feelings for her, or have been so obvious about it that my girlfriend would tell me she's upset at how clingy and attached they are. While I hate using the term, my girlfriend is a huge friend-zoner. I don't think she realizes it, but she talks to/hangs out with individual male friends *constantly* and is borderline flirty and loves all the attention she gets from them, but it's always just a matter of time before they take  it too far and she gets uncomfortable and their friendship dies off.

to close, my girlfriend has still been a great girlfriend all of this time. Aside from being a little too absorbed in her texting sometimes, she always gives me plenty of attention and we have tons of fun hanging out. We've been dating for 3 years and really love each other. But I'm concerned about Steve. Not that I think they'll actually have sex or anything, but that I'll unwillingly end up in some bizarre love-triangle with a 40 year old man. I don't want my girlfriend to have 1.5 boyfriends.

**TL;DR:** Relationship is fine, but girlfriend is extremely close to 37 year old male coworker. I **don't** think that she will ever cheat on me, but it's making me very uncomfortable how intimate and flirty their conversations are, the fact that she texts him for hours every single day, and the fact that they spend so much time together at work. However; I can't just tell my girlfriend to stop talking to one of her best friends just because he makes me uncomfortable. Am I right for being concerned? Should I do something, or just suck it up and stop worrying?"

[ Andy, did you have any difficulty trying to trademark Shit Happens given it's such a common phase?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d2941ol?context=5)|Great question! As a matter of fact, until recently, the trademark office said ALL obscenities were off-limits.  But just a year ago, there was a case which loosened the boundaries a bit.  It's still pending, but I'm told I have a good chance and I'm hopeful.  Damn, I'd LOVE to trademark that phrase!  Speaking of Shit Happens, have you checked us out on Kickstarter yet?  We're kicking ass!
[Hello. When you spend so many years in the same field (since most of your work seem to be comedy\), do you find it hard not to ""recycle"" old jokes / situations and keep yourself from circling back to the same style? Thanks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294kz4?context=5)|You're right-- that's the challenge-- not to fall back on field-tested formulas-- but when you come up with something that you KNOW has never been done, there's no feeling like it.  I had that feeling when I first played Shit Happens, which is LIVE on Kickstarter now! What?  You wish there was a link?
 |[Link to www.kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/uncleandytoys/shit-happens-might-as-well-make-a-game-out-of-it?)
[Your company seems to create a lot of games. Have you been a fan of games since you were a kid? What games were influential to you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d2944xi?context=5)|Yeah-  Games were a big part of my life, especially on vacations.  It's where I learned the joys of cheating. These days, creating and launching a new game is as satisfying for me as writing a film or TV episode.  I'd say ""Shit Happens""-- which is currently LIVE on Kickstarter- is my best game yet.
[Love the show, cannot believe that I got through. First time poster, long time listener. When are you and Ken ever going to get back out in the field for a live or taped show? Some of your best work was when you went out and stalked someone or played chess in the park or attended the 99% protest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d293u05?context=5)|Man I agree!  Those shows are my favorites, too.  The problem lately is Ken is so busy, he can't spare an afternoon to do it.  We have to wait for his current project to fail, so be patient, it won't take long--
 |By the way, the BEST remote we ever did was at a nursing home in Jersey City, but there was a glitch and the recording was unusable!  The show is like our legendary, long-lost ""Smile"" album!

Unless he hated it, in which case we'll be chatting about anything else!
[Hi Andy - You keep mentioning this Kickstarter but I can't find it for the life of me? What, pray tell, is the URL for this Kickstarter? (By the way, ""URL"" means ""web address"" and the ""web"" in ""web address"" refers to the WORLD Wide Web. Which is the best web there is. \)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294tuq?context=5)|I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post the link-- but here it is--

 |As a side note, all the cool kids are backing my campaign.  The losers are backing it too.  Shit Happens seems to be bringing everyone together.  It's a beautiful thing. 
[What was your favorite SNL sketch?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294176?context=5)|The one where Eddie Murphy goes around in white face is the best known.. but the one I'm proudest of might be Japanese Game Show with Chris Farley.  Do you remember that one?  The degree of difficulty was very high, but it really came together.
[Favorite piece written/co-wrote?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d2956d7?context=5)|Thanks for asking.  I'm probably proudest of the pilot for Monk, because we HAD to get it exactly right, and we did.
 |I'm also proud of the game rules for Shit Happens.  Speaking of SHit Happens, it's LIVE on Kickstarter NOW!
[Do you think Dave Hill went too far in the bear costume, or not far enough?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d295960?context=5)|I'm going to answer this seriously. Ken and I DID get carried away, and regretted the tome of that show (especially since we were asking for $)-- And it made me re-think, and re-write- a couple of the more outrageous cards in Shit Happens. 
[Where did the idea for Rat Race come from ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294hso?context=5)|To be honest, Paramount wanted to do a big ensemble Mad Mad World style comedy.  A lot of writers pitched to them  I goyt the jpob by pitching three ideas for sequences-- NONE OF WHICH MADE IT INTO THE MOVIE!
[How did you break into comedy writing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294wx7?context=5)|I had to keep trying, and not give up.. because I have no other skill set whatsoever!

That was me.  I got the idea while watching other ""audience testimonial"" commercials.  If you look carefully, you can Lawrence O'donnell (now of MSNBC) as one of the extras!
[Did you have to take a different writing approach while working on a dramedy like *Monk*?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294981?context=5)|Yes.  It was a refreshing change of pace after 20 years writing straight-up comedy.  My favorite part of the process was ""breaking the stories"" with the other writers, figuring out the mystery/puzzles.
[If I contribute to your kickstarter, may I come to your sedar?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294lmk?context=5)|Hi Cousin Shana!  Miss you!  Because everyone is in Michigan (to be with Rachel), we're keeping the sedar small this year.  But don't let that stop you!  You'll love Shit Happens!
[Any shenanigans you've pulled on SSD (or elsewhere\) that you particularly regret?  That you're especially proud of?

[Hi Andy. Love the show, can't believe I got through.  What are the chances of you &amp; Ken spending a year living together in an Odd Couple-style arrangement, filmed for a reality tv show?  Same question re: Don McLean.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d293ljq?context=5)|Do you mean, like, locked in an apartment, where we can't leave?  The ratings would be HUGE on Week 6, because that's when I would kill him. It would be funny to do it for a weekend, though, and record the highlights for 7SD.
[Does the Feed a Puppy app actually feed a puppy, or is it all video trickery?  And was Letterman-era Chris Elliott more like the Harvard guys or more like the cool guys?

[Long-time listener, first-time caller, can't believe i got through, love the show. the hitler car scene in rat race kind of reminded me of a scene that could have happened in the simpsons. like if nathan lane was Homer and his wife was marge. are you a simpsons fan?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4fikyu/iama_man_who_spent_30_years_in_the_comedywriting/d294e0l?context=5)|In our house, the Simpsons are like a religion.

I've also been selected for a research assistant position at my school where I'd be doing research for the head of the department which would eventually lead into developing the application I'm researching. I don't plan on going to grad school unless my job pays for it. But I'm wondering as of right now, as a sophomore, what would look better for my internship search next year, IT internship or CS research. Also I'm being considered for web applications development for the school. So I'm a little conflicted on which I should choose. The research is part time and has a chance of continuing through the school year and probably the rest of my time in school. And because it's part time I would be doing this along with my current job as desktop support over the summer. I was thinking maybe research + web development. The IT internships are all strict 40 hours a week. "

I took a at home drug test and passed it easily.  After that, I took 3 hits off a one hitter last Wednesday since I thought the internship I was hoping to get took forever to respond to me, so I thought I didn't get it. They called the next day saying I got it, but now I need to take my drug test (urine) this thursday. That gives me a week to detox from the one hitter session.

Do you think I'll be okay?  I'm fit and skinney with a high metabolism so that would help a bit too."

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

Or it could just be an office type rp.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S I'm also looking to do different role plays such as Game Of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Witcher, Cyberpunk, A Porn Star on Campus and Mass Effect. So check my post history for those ideas if they interest you.

I didn't feel the passion in my career path and had the opportunity to return home. I wanted to figure out what it was I wanted to do in life before it was too late and I was pigeon holed into something I didn't want to do.

I have always had a knack for computers. I loved everything about computers, but I didn't pursue a computer science degree for various reasons.. all of which were excuses. I started learning more about software development and researched what options I had to advance my knowledge base. 

Formal schooling, code school, or self taught. The big three. Formal schooling was out of the question for me personally because I felt that I was already behind having gone to school and I didn't want to waste any more time (~2 years of formal school). 

Code school. I have interviewed at two of the code schools in my area (San Diego). I was not impressed at all by one and the other seemed worthwhile. However a 11-12k dollar price tag is nothing to sneeze at. This door isn't entirely closed for me.

Self taught. I recently bought a white board and started planning out my days. I paid for codecademy pro because I figured why not, especially if i'm facing a possible 11 thousand dollar commitment. I also discovered a site called bento which is information curated by developers. I have been watching and learning from the CS50 harvard course. I have a github and I know how important it is, but i'm still learning the basics.

I'm just not sure what to do. Should I attend a code school or should I learn on my own. Take in a few more factors that would be entered into the equation. I am unemployed, my job is to learn. The code school is 3 months of instruction and a 1 month internship, high job placement, the standard things advertised in most code schools. 

If I continue to be self taught, I want to mirror that timeline as best as possible by grinding out 8 hour days. Not sit around and maybe code an hour here or there. I have the time to put in that work and I'm ready for the commitment because this is truly something I am passionate about."
4fkd6d,3,2016-04-19,I’ve accepted an offer for a state of FL park ranger position a week before an interview with another FL park which is in a location I have always dreamed about living in. I really NEED ranger advice on how to approach this situation.,Mydawgg,ParkRangers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkRangers/comments/4fkd6d/ive_accepted_an_offer_for_a_state_of_fl_park/,"Hey Reddit, first time OP here so if this post isn’t as succinct and as clean as possible that’s my excuse. I am a 24 year old Floridian who lives in Palm Beach County. I graduated from the University of South Florida about a year ago with a BA in geography and history. I’ve done two internships that were directly involved with park/resource management, biology, wildlife surveys, invasive plant control, interpretation and the like. I’ve always loved nature and spending time in local parks so I figured that being a park ranger would be a great place to start since I’m still not sure what I want to do with the rest of my life. I started applying for park ranger positions on USAjobs about 6 months ago to no avail. About 2 months ago my mom wisely suggested that I start applying to state park ranger positions through the state of Florida’s official site, peoplefirst.myflorida.com. I started applying and heard back from one of the first parks I applied for about 3 or 4 weeks later. I interviewed at the first park and felt that I did very well, especially considering it was my first professional interview. I was told by a couple of the rangers in my first interview that I should not be discouraged if I don’t end up getting an offer because one of them had interviewed 13 times before he got his first offer and the other interviewed 7 times before he got his. I didn’t end up getting the first job, in particular because they were looking for someone who, among other things, had prescribed burning experience of which I had none. I was discouraged but of course I kept applying to ranger vacancies and heard back from another park in Southwest FL that wanted to interview me. I went to my second interview about 4 weeks ago and I think I did even better in this one because I ended up getting an offer for the job a few days ago. I was told by this park that I was the ideal candidate because of my skills and experience in invasive plant control and interpretation. I was also told that they would have restarted the hiring process if I had turned down the offer because I was the only candidate whose qualifications satisfied them. Several days before I received the job offer I was sent an automated message from peoplefirst.myflorida.com telling me that I did not receive the job. This message looked identical to the message I received after I was told that I wasn’t chosen by the first park I interviewed with so I thought I’d have to keep looking. It ended up being a clerical error that I was sent the second automated message but this fact was unbeknownst to me at the time. A day before I received my job offer I got a call from a park in the Keys that wants to interview near the end of this month. As an avid spearfisherman and free diver I would relish an opportunity to live in the Keys. It is my favorite place in the world. The park in Southwest FL is beautiful but it is also in an area in which I know virtually nobody. The cost of living anywhere near the park is exorbitantly expensive and even and hour or so away, the areas where I was told to look for a place to live, are quite pricey and I will only be making about 26,500 a year before taxes. I know that living in the Keys is also ridiculously expensive but I have at least one best friend that would move with me if I were to end up getting the Keys job so the financial burden would likely be equal or lesser than that of the alternative, depending on what kind of place we lived in. For those of you that don’t know it is very difficult to find a professional job in the Keys outside of the fishing industry. I am a man of my word and I won’t go back on my commitment to the park on the west coast but I booked a motel in the Keys a few days before I got my offer (remember I was sent the automated message telling me I was not selected) so I am going to interview at the Keys park regardless. As I’ve said I am 24 years old and it’s high time that I moved out of my pops place and started down the path of professional development so I really can’t afford to turn down a good job when another is not guaranteed. Although, I would hate to disqualify myself from potentially landing a dream job and I want to at least see if I will even be offered the position. I’ve also been unemployed for almost 6 months which most of you know is not a good look. I don’t know if I got very lucky by landing a ranger job at my age on my second interview because I had the particular skills they happened to be looking for but I believe that I have at least a decent shot of landing the Keys job. How should I approach this interview? Should I come out and tell them that I’ve accepted another offer but that their park is my ideal job? Should I only give them this information if they specifically ask about any offers I may have received from other parks? Should I tell them that if they want to hire me I need to hear back from them ASAP because of the situation I’m in? I know that they have to run paperwork through the capital and that Tallahassee makes the ultimate decision on who is hired so I don’t know if asking for a speedy response will even make a difference. Is there any chance I could eventually transfer from one park to another if I do end up getting the offer for the Keys job? I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place and I am honestly stumped as to how I should approach this situation. I don’t want to be unprofessional or hurt my future prospects for landing a ranger position in the Keys. Any insight or advice from a ranger would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR

I’ve accepted an offer for a state of Florida park ranger position from a good park, a week before an interview with a FL dream park. My start date is the first week of May and my interview for the dream position is the last week of this month. I know I won’t hear back from the dream park in time to accept without going back on my commitment but I don’t want to disqualify myself from at least seeing if I will be offered the dream job. How should I approach this situation? What are my options? Can I eventually transfer from one park to another?

I have an internship at JPL in the summer and 1 class in the Fall and I'm done. 

I am interested in going to grad school for AI/ML/Robotics,
but for one reason or another, I haven't been able to get on a research team as an undergrad. 

I do have a 3.82 and I think I can do well on the GREs, but I don't think this places me a competitive applicant for any decent schools. I am trying to come up with a plan until the 2018 (or perhaps 2019) Fall applications are due. 

I can hope to get a job at JPL, which has amazing benefits if you want to continue into higher education (you can even take classes at Caltech as an employee).

Otherwise though, I don't seem to have much options. Paying 60k for a MS seems unwise (maybe the 8k online Georgia tech program? But that doesn't help with getting involved in research and meeting professors).

I can try and do some kind of project on my own, but without any guidance that might not go anywhere. Moreover, it doesn't help me get letters of rec. I have been thinking about sending an email to my ML professor with some research ideas I had in mind though.

Just looking for any kind of advice. Thank you.

I'm in a co-op program which means I alternate learning things at school and taking internships in the workplace.  I met my boyfriend of just over a year at school, but he's older and has graduated and moved to California.  After 4 months of long distance I got an internship in California as well at a really well respected company.  My family wasn't so happy about it because they want me to stay much closer to them.  I haven't always had a great relationship with my family so I was pretty happy to get away, but also sad that it made things worse.  Now I'm going back to school for 4 months but I need to decide if I'm coming back for another internship at this company.
On one hand, its right by my boyfriend, and a great job for learning and for the resume.  There's the possibility of changing groups too so I'd get some new experiences.  On the other hand, it might make things harder with my family, but if I get my next internship in Canada it means I won't be with my boyfriend for any real period of time for at least a year.  There's also the issue of where I take internships really effects where I'll end up after graduation.  Most people accept full time offers from somewhere they interned so the more jobs I take in California the more likely I'll stay here permanently.  I know its kinda silly of me, but I just always imagined living in Canada eh?

Any advice?"
4fkzcz,1,2016-04-19,Trying to get my life together,ad54me,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4fkzcz/trying_to_get_my_life_together/,"Hello, I considered writing this on a throwaway, but I figured it'd be best to do it on my main account so in case others I know find this in the future, they might understand more about me.

To a majority of people, I might be seen as the ideal college student: actively involved in several student organizations on campus, taking a full course load every semester and making all A/A+, and generally seeming like I have my shit together.

I'm in an accelerated direct admission program to medical school (BS/MD), and I only have one year left of my undergrad years before med school hits. But I can't help feeling that my time is running out. I will be graduating next spring (2017), and I have this queasy feeling that this next near will fly by before I'm able to come to terms. I don't think I'm mature enough for med school, hell, I want to take a gap year or at least another year in college to help me make the transition better. I've generally been successful in my life, but I have an tremendous fear of doing poorly in med school or even failing out. Most of my peers are in the same position that I am in academically, so I have a little ease in knowing that we'd fail together. However, they all seem like they have their lives sorted out.

A lot of these fears of finishing college before I'm ready have kept me up late at night, to the point where I'm getting minimal sleep and only leaving my bed because I have to go to class or I have something scheduled. Otherwise, I'll spend my entire day in bed, browsing reddit or watching youtube videos. I remember when I first entered college I would have so much motivation to do everything I could. Nowadays, I just waste away during the weekends and catch up studying during the week. I guess it's a good thing that there are only several weeks left of this semester, so I'll have the summer to focus on my internship and try and get my insecurities sorted out.

In the same vein of running out of time, I have been trying to pursue girls to get a girlfriend, but I have been unsuccessful. This is completely different, as in high school, there were only brief spans of time when I wasn't with anyone. I've been told that I'm generally attractive/cute, but I've largely been unsuccessful. I don't really care much for going out, so I guess what I've been looking for is mainly companionship that is a bit deeper than what my current friends have been able to offer me. I know there are plenty of girls out there, but what's holding me back is the fact that I only have one year left. Most of the girls I would be pursuing would have another year or two of college after I graduate, and I think it would be difficult for med students, generally, to have significant others that are not med students themselves. This especially sucks for me, because there's this one girl who's amazing and nice to everyone she meets, but she unwittingly leads guys on, including me. We talked about this, and she said she would try not to lead me on, but every time we spend time together, I feel like all my emotions and feelings I have for her just resurface, no matter how hard I've tried to make them go away.

All these thoughts have been weighing deeply on me and I can't help thinking about them in the free time I have. I used to game a lot, which would take away my stress, but since I've had these thoughts, I haven't been able to get into playing games. I can't but feel that these thoughts are taking over my life and changing me from the person I thought I used to be.

I've had slumps like this before, but not one this terrible. In the past, I have simply just lost the motivation to do something, but then a deadline for a test/project/social event/etc would come up and I would use that to motivate myself. Nowadays, however, it's hard to motivate myself like that. I have never skipped a class I could have attended, and I skipped classes the second half of last week. It's hard for me to get out of bed and leave my room. I've lost around ten pounds because I've just been lazing around and only eating enough to keep myself alive. I just feel so nihilistic about everything. I used to dream of being a doctor, but now that it's within my reach, I don't see what the point is in trying anymore. I can just coast and graduate med school and become a mediocre doctor.

I have never been clinically diagnosed as depressed, but a few years ago at the end of middle school/beginning of high school, I talked to a counselor who helped me to get things sorted out for a while. I'm thinking about contacting my college's mental health services tomorrow or the day after to try and see if they can help me.

Sorry for the long post; there's just so much on my chest that I wanted to get off, but this is only just the beginning of it. I'd like to thank you if you read this far. I just wanted to have some place where I would speak my mind and get this off my chest.

**TL;DR: I've lost motivation and don't really see any reason to do anything anymore. I'll probably try to talk to a counselor/therapist about it soon.**"

**Intended major(s):** Computer Science/Biomedical Engineering/Computer Engineering

**Academics:** Okay I think this the perfect spot to explain my situation. In 8th grade, I was given the opportunity to take 3 high school classes for credit (Algebra 1, Spanish 1, Living Environment) but I did terrible grade wise because I underwent a pretty major surgery that made me wheelchair bound for half a year. I was in constant pain and missed a lot of school; I couldn't focus and I honestly was not intrinsically motivated at all during that year. Thinking back, I probably would have quit school if I had the chance. These grades are being factored into my cumulative gpa, but they're not good grades... However, my grades are a huge upward trend.

**ACT: (composite; optional: by section)** Expecting a 32 on the June ACT

**SAT: (Total out of 2400; optional: by section)** Not taking

**SAT II: if available** Going to be taking the Biology and Math II subject test soon.

**Class rank: if available** 8/120~, going to be higher once I finish junior year

**UW/W GPA:** By the end of my junior year it'll be 3.75/4. If you do not count my 8th grade grades, it's 3.99/4. I'm going to try to retake Spanish 1 online to fix my grades, effectively changing my cumulative to a 3.8ish.

**Coursework:--APs taken and scores (or IB); any other relevant classes. Give an idea if you're mostly taking APs, honors, none, etc.** My school only offers one AP: APUSH. I'm expecting a 4 or 5 on it. However, I'm taking the most rigorous courses possible and I am going to be dual-enrolling at the local community college for my senior year. I'm going to be taking Calc (only me and another student were eligible to take this based on the Accuplacer test), some random computer science class that I don't remember the name of, Physics (they don't offer it at my school and I can only take it second semester), English. My school will be possibly offering AP CS next year, which I will be taking. I'm also going to be taking a college Spanish class at my high school next. I'm a year ahead of my entire class, so I'm taking classes that a senior would normally take at my school. I'm currently taking a college PreCalc class and Spanish 4.

**Awards:** Nothing major. 

1st at a local bridge building competition (11th, placed like 7th overall in 10th)

2nd Regional Mousetrap Car Competition (10th)

1st Regional Mousetrap Car Competition (11th), I'm going to be going to compete nationally and I'm expecting to win 1st or 2nd.

A lot of local chess competition awards (my school basically wins 1st overall in like all the competitions locally hosted, I usually get 3rd place in the individual awards though)

Maybe a Questbridge Prep Scholar?

Student of the Month (obsolete though, haha)

**Extracurriculars:
List club, community service, job, etc. Include leadership position if applicable. Also include summer activities here, if applicable.**

-Cofounder of the eSports club.

-Pres of the Chess Club

-Envirothon Team, we don't win anything but it's worth mentioning.

-Citizen U member, which is a cooperative extension program of Cornell.

-Founder and Pres of the Programming Club, we're going to be competing at a local hackathon-esque event soon, probably not gonna win lol.

-Cofounder and Pres of the STEM Club

-Competitor at a local model steamboat competition, didn't win again but it's worth mentioning lol (this is a recurring thing lol).

-Competitor at the Highschool Star League eSports competition.

-Cofounder and builder/documenter in our VEX Robotics Team

-Attending the Cornell Summer College program for 3-weeks in the Business World program this summer! Super ecstatic and I got a full scholarship to go there!

-Volunteer at my local church and at a homeless center.

-Helped raise $600 for Nepal's relief efforts last year with my teacher.

-I'm working on getting an internship at a local business in their IT department.

-Starting a website soon, it's going to be engineering related. I have everything planned out. I'm also going to be starting a youtube channel that will coincide with this website. The website + channel will probably also have like a dual purpose as a personal blog of my experience in the admissions process.

-Competiting in the Intel ISEF competition next year.

**Schools: Indicate if ED/EA/RD**

Cornell (probably ED)

Stanford (if I don't ED Cornell, I'm going to SCEA here)

MIT

CalTech

NYU

Yale

Uni of Rochester 

Georgia Tech

Uni of Michigan

Princeton

Columbia

I know it seems as though I'm only looking for prestige, but I'm just naming my reaches.

**Questions: If you have any specific questions aside from general chances (if you want school suggestions, etc.)**

Will my 8th grade grades be weighed heavily in admissions? I'm super worried about them x_x

And should the topic of my essay be about my surgery? It was a pretty major pivotal point in my life, so I think I should talk about it."
4fl09p,0,2016-04-19,Asking for a raise/gaining leverage to ask for a raise?,WishfulOstrich,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4fl09p/asking_for_a_raisegaining_leverage_to_ask_for_a/,"I'm currently in the midst of my second internship.  I spent about 19 months at my last internship (a national laboratory) over the course of 3 years or so, and I currently work at a fairly small (~150 employees) tech company in Knoxville, TN.  At my first internship I made $12.50 an hour untaxed (paid as a ""scholarship"" stipend), and I'm currently making $14/hour before taxes, and I can't help but feel like I'm getting underpaid.

Looking on Glassdoor and talking to my friends who work elsewhere, it sounds like the average is somewhere around $18-$20/hour.  What's the best way to go about asking for a raise?  I imagine the best way would be to apply to other jobs to try and leverage those potential offers against my current job, but my GPA is absolute garbage (~2.1, got my current job because of work experience and connections) so I doubt I'd even get an interview from most places. 


What should I do here?"

The thing is I have to work two days minimum to stay employed there so I would probably work like a 4 or 6 hour shift saturday and sunday. 

I'm just not sure how I feel about working every single day in the summer. But I mean I don't have any friends anyway and all I do is cook, go to the gym, and work on my car all of which can be done after the internship or before/after shifts on the weekends. I would love to make a ton of money this summer for car parts and to have a little left over for extra expenses when I cut back hours when next year of college starts 

Also I mean I go to college every day and work part time so I never have full days off so it can't be much worse?

4flrkh,3,2016-04-20,Pre-employment drug screening Vyvanse,Thrwawyadhd,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4flrkh/preemployment_drug_screening_vyvanse/,"So I've tried to do as much research as possible as I can only imagine this is an extremely routine concern, but I still have a few questions.

I took the screening ~10 days ago, and I'm 100% sure that I tested positive for amphetamines due to Vyvanse and negative for everything else but I was really expecting a call or some form of notification about the results by now. Does anyone have any advice about how to make this go as smoothly as possible? I'm aware that this can't legally prevent my internship from happening, I would just like to avoid headache in a few weeks upon learning that I mishandled the situation.

I tried to inform the screening agency of my prescriptions through the collection agency but  they just told me that it was the actual testing agency that would ""reach out to me with any questions."" 

---

So really my questions are:

- Should I reach out to the HR person at the company this testing is for? I have absolutely no problems discussing my medications or condition but I for some reason am getting the feeling that it would be inappropriate to discuss it with said HR person (it's nothing that shes done, it feels inappropriate to discuss it with any HR person, just due to legal constraints)
    + Would it be inappropriate to email an HR rep out of the blue about not receiving drug test results?
- I informed my MD about the test, he said he would be happy to send proof of the prescription if required. 
   + Could the agency reached out to him directly after the initial Amphetamine-positive results and this has already been fixed?
- Finally, I understand that secondary testing will absolutely make this take longer than the typical ""3 to 5 business days"". How long should that period of time be?

Sorry for the long post, I appreciate any answers/advice/internet articles you can offer!

I have always turned to reddit for life's big questions and it has always brought me so much clarity, so I'm taking control and trying to figure out who I am and what I am destined for.

I am a 25 year old male living in Melbourne, Australia.

I used to want to be an actor but gave up the dream. I find pleasure in entertaining others and have a knack for impressions. I mention this because it is a very core part of who I am and who I would like to be.

I have been working in retail for almost 8 years now and I'm starting to get sick of the same thing over and over.
What I have managed to do is stick to retail roles that put me at the forefront of a product I love and the customers who buy them.

I have worked for Apple, Nike and various other smaller brands. I haver worked with Outerwear, I have worked bicycles and I have worked with red dot design-trinket-lifestyle products. I have picked up some keen insight into what makes a good customer experience and more importantly, what makes a good product.

Throughout all these roles, there is one apparent similarity. I have a huge passion for design.

I feel quite daunted by the idea of coming up with my own designs, but I have always admired excellent design and craftsmanship and have been particularly enamoured by products that streamline our lives and simplify what it means to be a 21st Century human.

With that in mind, my most recent obsession has been 'techwear' - clothing that has everyday performance with graceful aesthetic. I adore brands like Arc'teryx Veilance, Y-3, Outlier, Rapha and White Mountaineering.
I want to be able to understand what career will allow me to connect with people like my customers or 'audience' while allowing me to start really steering the creative direction of a product. Of course I could make something up and just chuck it on Kickstarter, but I want to future proof myself slightly and find out what skills I need to acquire to really have an impact. 

So far, people have told me marketing, product/industrial design, fashion (technical textiles) or to just move in to wholesale. I've also been looking at internships with the various companies I mentioned, but obviously need to be in a classroom first.

TL;DR I love sleek things and now I want to make sleek things

Thanks for reading!"

He didn't like that. I can't just not try again because it's making the guy sho recommended me look bad which in turn adds much mote stress than having to find an internship for my major for the summer next month. I don't want to make this guy look bad, I also do some side business with him. He does know I'm trans but would recommend from me mentioning it to the interviewer. 

I'm about all out of options and really don't want to have to play the trans card, but maybe he'll understand and show it, or he'll ""not discriminate"" but actually discriminate which kinda gets me off the hook as.

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
_________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!

4fndos,2,2016-04-20,Tips for a High Schooler entering College and Data Science,TheMooMooMan,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/4fndos/tips_for_a_high_schooler_entering_college_and/,"Hey Everyone!,

I'm a high school senior who is very interested in the field of Data Science. I have already started taking classes in this concentration at my college. I will get straight to the point.

I plan to graduate from the Univeristy of Michigan with a Double Major in Data Science/ Computer Science and Minors in Business Analytics and Writing.

My dream is to work my way up to a consultant in my mid 20's to 30's  and then settle down in a management role at a large company after. Again my dream is also to earn a hefty salary, enough to support myself and family in any endeavor I take.

I have read almost every post on this subreddit and talked to many data scientists personally and I know this dream is farfetched. However I am determined.

So the question is, can any of you experienced Data Scientists give me specific advice that I can put towards making my dream a reality? It can be anything from what college classes to take to what internships and jobs to pursue. 

Thank you all so much! And I want to let u guys know that this subreddit is awesome! :)

*Please don't write responses such as "" don't commit to a path"" or "" ur plans may change"". I know that and I welcome those changes with open arms, but I'm looking for objective advice atm. :)"
4fni9z,67,2016-04-20,"The brief story of my life: fat shy unpopular kid, to popular great career adult.",dattokyo,motivation,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/4fni9z/the_brief_story_of_my_life_fat_shy_unpopular_kid/,"I’ve long considered writing this up, but wasn’t sure where. I thought this might be a fitting place. This is, by and large, the short version of my life. I’m sorry if it’s a bit incoherent, I’m trying to say a lot of things, and cover a lot of areas, in an amount of text that wouldn’t fill a book.

TL/DR: I was a shy, awkward, fat kid for the first half of my life. I’m now confident, have a very good job, popular with women, and happy.

I was a pretty chubby kid back in elementary school (which lasts 10 years here), and socially a bit weird. I was quite shy, didn’t say a lot, and I would get a red face when I got angry. In first grade, I particularly had one other good friend – a real fat kid, but I remember him being nice. He left after the first year, due to the bullying, which was then passed on to me.

The first 8 years of elementary school was very hard on me. I had very few friends, and I was bullied daily. The bullying was both verbal, as well as painfully physical. At one point, I was literally chased off school grounds by my entire class of 30 people, into a swamp nearby. At the high point, every recess every hour, of every day, I would get hit, have my arms twisted around, something from me stolen, things like that – that went on for years. It lasted until well into 9th grade, where I started smoking, which got me a bit in league with some of the “cool kids”, and it settled down a little.

I didn’t learn to read until around 5th grade (so 11’ish years old), when my mother taught me. I couldn’t even do the entire alphabet. Same goes for math, which my father ended up teaching me. I’ve never done well academically, and have almost always gotten by with some of the lowest grades possible to pass.

High school was slightly less painful, as a childhood friend of mine was quite popular, so I could hang out with him (but no more so, than once I had dyed my hair black, a classmate randomly told me “you look like a fucking idiot with your eyebrows still brown”). I had also lost a lot of weight, but I still had a “beer tummy” left over – so now, instead of chubby, I was super skinny with a beer belly, not the most flattering look in the world. I don’t remember it from being younger, so it was probably around that time I also started shaking a bit, particularly my hands, so I always seemed nervous or like I was high on drugs.

Fashion was something that was still largely dictated by what my mother bought, or what my best friend thought was cool.

When I was around 15, I was diagnosed with mild depression, a sickness that will continue to hunt me throughout my life.

But I was still super shy, and would say some awkward shit at times. I didn’t have my first kiss, until I was 17 on vacation. The first time I had sex, was when I was 18, on vacation, with a prostitute, which was one of the nastiest and uncomfortable experiences of my life to this day.

I played computer games all the time. Mostly World of Warcraft, which I think I logged over an actual year of in-game time in. Naturally, my first actual girlfriend was also from WoW, a woman 11 years older than me, and not the prettiest.

I was socially uncomfortable to the point, where if I was on vacation with my father, all the way up into my early 20’s, speaking to a cab driver was a genuine fear. Speaking to women in a bar, was something I built up the courage to do, over hours of sitting and drinking alone at a table. I was probably being awkward and looking at them too, through the whole thing.

But I knew these things, so I started making a conscious effort to change who I was from around the end of high school (where, I should add, I redid the third year again and was almost kicked out, because I’m a fucking idiot). If I was on a vacation, I made sure to go out at night drinking, even by myself, and once out, I made a rule that each day I had to approach at least 1 stranger (male or female, didn’t matter) and start a conversation. The more the better, but minimum of 1 was my rule. My strategy was largely to sit at a bar, and hope someone sat next to me that wasn’t already engaged in a conversation – and then after an hour or two, have the courage to say “cheers” or something.

And over time, speaking to strangers became ever so slightly less frightening. From practically never initiating a new conversation with anyone all the way up to around 20, to meeting several new people every night just a few years later.

I started consciously thinking much more about fashion, posture, how I presented myself. I would speak aloud to myself, or to a mirror, to hear how I sounded and see how I looked while talking. I should add, that a great way of doing this, is recording video of yourself – it’ll be uncomfortable at first, but it’ll help a TON in understand how others view you, and how to actually be the person you want to be.

To help more with women, I started reading up a lot on old school (Mystery) PUA stuff. Since the original stuff is very “process” focused with specific stages, I found it a fantastic starting point. That again, helped more with both my confidence, as well as my interaction with women.

My parents have throughout my life been afraid “what would happen to me”, so to speak, regarding work. I slacked off throughout my entire education, never dealt well with authority. My father has several times had “serious talks” with me about my career future, as he was very worried I would never really “get off the ground”. 

I now have a very decent job (good salary, low hours, good atmosphere, high-class clients as well as colleagues), with colleagues talking about me as “very confident”. We’re a large agency of around 250 people, and I’m in a group 15 “talents” that get a special work education – at one about public speaking, the speaker outright said I could “almost appear too confident”, and “very knowledgeable” (of a topic I knew very little about).

 (Ironically, literally as I was writing this, I got a text message / photo from work: a vase of flowers, with the message “A thousand thanks for your push regarding our targeting. When shit hit the fan, you stepped up, and built insights for large parts of our final targeting flow. That’s fantastic work! Well done!” – I’m home sick today, but as you probably guessed I now work in marketing, and I’m guessing we just closed a client that’s worth the company around 10 million USD a year.)

I’m often complimented on my fashion. I’ve been with 22 women (give or take, depending on how you define stuff). I’ve been the one calling off almost all relationships, I’ve almost never gotten dumped. I’ve gotten one-night stands off Tinder, from very attractive women.

I’m working on my own company, that’s based on a relatively unique set of skills I built up by being the awkward nerd I was when I was younger, and it’s looking very promising.

So what’s my point here? That if you don’t like who you are, you can change who you are. 

I often see posts (here, YouTube, wherever) by people lamenting that “they’re too ugly” for people to date them. But that’s just not true. Practically no one is so ugly, that if they simply make sure they are in basic shape, clean up, think about posture, and take fashion seriously, wouldn’t be considered at the very least “just above average”. 

If you’re shy, if you’re awkward, you can work your way out of that, as long as you’re willing to make a conscious effort to change who you are. Who you are isn’t something that’s written in stone – it’s something that, if you’re willing, can be whatever you want it to be.

Or how about work? “I don’t have a good education”? My work has absolutely nothing to do with what I studied, nor is it relevant to any of my intern experience before that. It’s based solely on what I taught myself over years of internetting, of thinking critically about my interests and hobbies and what could be done with them. Same goes for my own company. Knowledge isn’t a University degree (though it can be), knowledge is something that is more freely available to you now than any other time in human history. You can learn practically anything online, for free, these days. Coding, design, math, business, you name it. It’s about you being willing to acquire that information, that knowledge, and spend the required amount of time on it. Listen to audiobooks on your commute back and forth to work. Develop a natural curiosity to independently research topics you encounter.

That’s not saying it’s going to be easy. Life has a tendency to punch you in the stomach if things go smoothly. When I was around 24, I met a very beautiful and wonderful girl. We fell deeply in love. She was suffering from heavy depression, and an abusive family. I largely neglected Uni to help her, spending around 5 hours a day caring for her in various ways. After 8 months, she jumped from a building, killing herself, while I was considering how to propose to her, the very morning before I was going to see her. That, of course, made me sincerely suicidal for about 4 months, and I got a heavy drinking problem. It’s my personal “before and after” moment in my life. Practically everyone in the world, encounters gruelling circumstances at some point in their life. That is the harsh reality of the human existence.

But you can power through that. It’s possible for everyone. You have that power within you. You can be whoever you want to be. The world has never been more open to opportunities than it is right now. Accept that responsibility for your life is in your own hands. I remember a quote from “The Power of Habit: Why we do what we do”, if memory serves, regarding a meeting for Alcoholics Anonymous: “No one is coming to help.” – “But you’re here, you’re helping” – “No, I’m just here to tell you, no one is coming to help”.

TL/DR: I was a shy, awkward, fat kid for the first half of my life. I’m now confident, have a very good job, popular with women, and happy."
4fnicj,5,2016-04-20,I'm lost,heroeromantico,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4fnicj/im_lost/,"As the title says, i'm lost and thats the way i have felt for the past seven years. This is my history and im writting here because after the past few days i had several hard mental breakdowns:

I'm a born mexican but my father and his family are syrians, i lived most of my life in Mexico in one of the most dangerous cities in the world(at least it was from 2012 to 2015) and the other part of my life i lived in Hama, Syria. I have an Arabic name but only that, i can say i'm 100% Mexican.

When i was 16 i felt into a severe depression, i lost 20 kg in weight in only 3 months, i had major sleeping problems where i couldnt sleep in the night at all, some times days without sleeping until my body collapsed many many times. I had a lot of problems socializing in Syria because my mother(Mexican) and my fathers family had some issues getting a long because of all the cultural differences but after a few months living there(second time trying to start a life over there) i was unable to live there and i was dying, not because of the people or my family, because of me.

Basically i did a lot of stupid shit to make my family fight and i manipulated my fathers family so i could go back to my home town in mexico(before the extreme violence came) and finish my highschool because my arabic sucks!

In short words i betrayed my sisters(which i love) and my mother, i left alone my father(which suffers from a weird mental illness where sometimes he doesnt know the difference between reality and his reality. I went back to Mexico as planned to meet with a girl i was in love that i met online which she cheated on my after my first two weeks there but thats not the problem, i left alone my sisters and my mother and they were struggling aswell because as you can imagine and in my experience with my fathers family, they would never accept that my father needed help or anything like that because they used to feel that any kind of illness is a shame for the family(i know right? not all the syrian people are like this ofc only some family members used to be like this).

So my mother had a horrible time because his husband was having huge problems controlling his illness and he would disapear for weeks and go to his fabric to work and drink. we were alone for months after i did all the stupid shit i did back then so after i left my mother and my sisters couldnt take it anymore because i was kind of the guy they used to take care and get distracted from our issues over there.

i remember taking the flight from Damascus to Madrid, i remember it was delayed four hours and my mother and sisters were waiting with me the whole time expecting maybe that i would change my mind and try to have a life over there but i was literally dying every single day and i couldn't take it anymore so i waited and when it was time to go i just said goodbye to my actual family(mother and sisters) and left Damascus. I remember those yellow(kind of) chairs where you could wait for your flight outside the actual departure, i remember watching my sisters sleeping super sad because i was leaving them but at that point i just wanted to leave Syria, not because it was a bad place nonono, because i couldnt make friends because of my arabic, i couldnt study and i couldnt play metal music with my guitar or date a girl(because of the arabic ofc).

After i left i lost my flight three times, one in madrid, one in paris and one in mexico city, my entire mothers family was super worried about me and my mother had a nervous breakdown about that but at that point i couldn't care more because i was a shitty selfish teenager.

i used to have no money to live, my aunt which have a looooooot of money took all my money because i was being punished by my family and even if i didnt had money to eat they would offer me food from time to time, but my grandma started to have health issues so she couldnt take care of me so what i did was that i had music production knowledge and shitty equipment, i used to have ok quality songs so i recorded a few bands to have money to eat and go to school but fkn mexicans they always want everything for free(cant complain im just like that) so i would spend maybe days without eating until a friend found out about this and he started coming over my place and bring soup or tuna for me.

after a month and a few weeks like that i ignored most of my mother calls and i stopped hearing from them but not because i was ignoring them i thought they were better but no, they were leaving Syria without permission of my father and let me explain this: my mother could leave syria anytime she wanted without a problem, she could just take the next flight to Mexico and thats it but for my sisters its a different story and even though there were cities like Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, Raqqa, Palmyra where people were open minded, Hama was a super close-minded sick city(beautiful city anyway) so they wanted my sisters to wear a burca/fular i dont know the name anymore and they wanted them to just stay at home and maybe do the cleaning you know? so they were having a hard time with this so they wanted to leave as well.

well, for two weeks i didnt knew from my mother until my father called me super worried saying that the police was looking for them, at this point i had a nervous breakdown, i was with some friends recording music but when my aunt called me to take my fathers call and then he told me what i just said i started crying outside, i ran and ran and ran because i was a horrible person, i punched a guy in the street just because i was super angry and started beating the shit out of myself until one of my friend found me and stopped me. without mentioning my past in elementary school at syria or mexico this was the strongest and saddest day of my life, i cant still sit on yellow chair because they trigger the hell for me...

ok so far i dont want to write anymore about that past but now after almost 8 years, i havent seen my father again, just started to talk with him this year via phone and i cannot take it anymore, i've seen horrible things that have happened in syria and mexico, i have experienced murder in front of my eyes in mexico and still most of the people i know consider me a nice and normal guy... right now im not in syria or mexico im in somewhere in europe doing an internship in a startup learning a lot, i have a future in mind and i'm a very romantic person but i cannot take it anymore sometimes i want to kill myself somehow but i really want to keep torturing myself this way, by living and remembering everything bad that i have done or that have happened to me in the past... i used to control my panic attacks so well that i thought i was faking them for almost seven years but recently(and i promise that i will stop writing after that) i got super drunk with my friends in a party, so drunk that i puked in a cab after i fainted, i broke a door and punched one of my friends, i was screaming in my house ""FUCK YOU BASHAR AL ASSAD"" and screaming ""where are you father!?!"" but you know the worst part? i dont remember any of these, two of my roomates and another friend saw this. Now they ask me every day if im ok or how am i doing but i cannot tell the truth.
 
I cannot talk to my mother about this, or my sisters because i feel that they hate me, i used to talk with my father since i arrived europe and i told him a lot of things but now he has not answered me in a few days and i dont know what to do, i dont want to call my uncle(his brother) because he will be worried and he may want me to quit my job and move with him to UK. i just want to have a normal life and enjoy all the things i used to enjoy like running, walking, breathing, writing music, writing silly apps to flirt with the girl i like for example but i cant, it has been a few days and im not even writting all my life here in respect of the people that may read this...

Usually i dont want to kill myself anymore but lately i just think about how it could happend or what could i do, i didnt used to drink anything or smoke weed before in my whole life, not even cigars but now im destroying myself with all this crap, i'm having so much fun but it doesnt matter because anything i have done even if i made a lot a lot a lot of good things for a lot of people wont stop this feeling that my life is sailing away from me, slowly im feeling that im not alive anymore and that im experiencing now that i'm a lot of different persons at the same time because of how much i lie to everyone and how well i do that.

anyway i feel a little bit better after writing all of this and im sorry for my writing skills i may edit everything after i feel better if someone gets annoyed by this, i cant even use my real account i had to make another one.

to finish, i have been telling some of me best friends(four to be exact) that i have been struggling with this, they adviced me to stop drinking and smoking weed that much even if it helps a lot, that i should help myself in other ways but you know what?

i dont know if i can help myself anymore...

The Neighborhood Connection Project (NCP) is looking for leaders. Is that you? 

NCP is the French bricolage underpass mural located in Chicago's Edgebrook neighborhood and the largest public outdoor mural of its type in the entire area, city and suburbs alike (More about NCP is below). And, it's also the mural that is looking for a few citizen-leaders to join us as we move forward for what comes next for this fantastic civic project that has involved over 400 citizens. Being an NCP leader is a great way for citizens to give to their community, get others involved and leave something lasting for future generations.

Interested? Come to the NCP Future Leaders Meeting on Wednesday, May 25 from 6:30-7:45 PM at the Edgebrook Library. As room space is limited, please RSVP to Jac Charlier at jac.charlier@gmail.com. Come and learn more...all citizens welcome!

For more information about the Neighborhood Connection Project read below. You can contact Jac Charlier at jac.charlier@gmail.com or Gina Metelica at gina.metelica@gmail.com. You can also check us out on Facebook and stay tuned to Nextdoor.com, EveryBlock and Reddit.

Started in Spring of 2010, the Neighborhood Connection Project (NCP) is a citizen-led initiative to build community by repairing and beautifying the Metra railroad underpass located at Kinzua, Hiawatha and Lehigh.  Completed in August 2015, NCP is the largest outdoor public art bricolage mural on Chicago's Northwest side.  Thanks to community funds raised and the tremendous financial support of After School Matters (ASM), NCP also provided summer internships for 90 local teen apprentices.  

After securing the input and support of a diverse (and still growing!) cross section of over 400 citizens, four civics, 23 businesses and many other community institutions, NCP was joined by our partners, Green Star Movement (GSM) and ASM. GSM worked with ASM's teen apprentices, our local artists and community volunteers to produce the mural on the East side of the underpass, which was completed as part of Phase I in Summer 2013. Phase II was completed in August 2014 when the West wall work was finished.

Phase III, the middle section, was completed in August 2015. This involved joining the two bricolage murals together in the center.  The joining of the East and West sides of the mosaic was done in the same way our American railroads were completed...by meeting in the middle with a golden stake.  In the case of NCP, we created a gold spike located in the center of the mural.  

The themes of the mural were decided by the community and the actual art reflects both our neighborhood's history, as well as the greenery and vegetation of the area. Special homage is paid to our Native American predecessors and the famous Hiawatha train that ran on these very tracks."

4foqfh,364,2016-04-20,We're sitting on the media scandal of the fucking century,KaineDamo,KotakuInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4foqfh/were_sitting_on_the_media_scandal_of_the_fucking/,"Nevermind the thread title (much more important things in the world, the press being manipulated into creating a moral panic about the gaming community is still quite a scandal)

There is proof positive that Zoe Quinn was sharing Candace's e-mail address to her cult like followers, from behind her protected account. You can see them discussing the contents of the e-mail and even one person remarking that Zoe didn't cover up the name.  Another person screenshots 'my intern' from the e-mail.

https://archive.is/6rUJY

This is smoking gun evidence that Zoe Quinn, the woman who the gaming press circled around to protect and label the gaming community harassers, who went to the UN to talk about harassment, herself directs people to harass.

Candace writes about what happened here. Describes how she only received harassment after being contacted by Zoe Quinn, and how Quinn is the only person that could have leaked her e-mail address.

http://degree180.com/8686-2/

Candace is not savvy, I was extremely skeptical, but her story holds up with the evidence.

She seems to have wandered into the discussion of cyber-harassment without knowing anything about GamerGate. It's unclear to me what Quinn's and Harper's motives are in targeting her. Was Candace's business plan competition to their own 'anti-harassment' business? Were they afraid Candace's business would uncover their bad behaviour? I'm really not sure. But the evidence is pretty substantial that Quinn leaked Candace's e-mail to her followers.

Any one that knows about Quinn and Harper would not be surprised by this. Quinn pulled the exact same shit with wizardchan, The Fine Young Capitalists, Eron's ZoePost shows exactly what kind of person she is, etc.

Quinn has manipulated not just the gaming press, but many mass media organizations and the UN.

I'm depressed by the idea that nothing will come of this. Jesse Singal ignores all negative info on Quinn and Harper and paints Candace as paranoid and as having been fooled by GamerGate.

One of the biggest media scandals of the century and no one outside of our niche community will ever know.  That's what I'm afraid of.  I used to think it didn't matter, that as long as we knew the truth and that we bled unethical press dry through lost ad revenue and building something better in its place, it wouldn't matter if the mainstream knew.  But it DOES matter.  This is a fucking enormous scandal.  Think of the organizations that are complicit.

CNN, the BBC, The Guardian, The Washington Post, The Telegraph, The New York Times, Business Insider, Bloomberg, The Verge, on and on and on.  Fucking hell.  The scale of this will never be acknowledged in mainstream media.

They should have known.  I've posted this info before but it is worth repeating.  As far as I'm concerned any extra eyes that haven't seen this stuff before, it's worth sharing it with.

Zoe began a feud with users of wizardchan (a board for depressed men) over only a couple of negative comments on the board made about her game.  She accused them of harassment without evidence.  Good timeline here -

The Zoe post reveals an emotionally abusive relationship in which Zoe constantly lied to Eron, cheated on Eron with multiple men and would use emotionally charged language to shift the blame onto Eron.  She also used the threat of suicide against Eron.

4fp57s,13,2016-04-20,Home-made BeerBug [UPDATE],OB_Surf_Junkie,Homebrewing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/4fp57s/homemade_beerbug_update/,"A while back I mentioned I would attempt making a cheaper version of The BeerBug (https://www.thebeerbug.com/). I wanted to do this right so I plan on this being a summer project so work won't interfere with development. This is just an update post for those that expressed interest. 

What I have:
A team. 
-My boss (Ph.D Analytical Chemistry) is going to help me develop the densometer.
-Me (Useless coordinator, B.Sc. in Biochemistry).
-Prior Intern of mine (B.Sc. Computer Science) is doing the hard coding and testing.
-Buddy (B.Sc. Computer Science) will be doing app development. 

What I need:
-Time. Spring quarter is busy season on campus, that's why I intend this to be a summer project. 
-Beta testers. I'm hoping to have 5 to 10 working prototypes I can mail in late September to experienced homebrewers for feedback. 

Really the beast of this project is going to make a cheap, precise densometer. I have a few ideas that I'll test over the next few weeks involving ultrasonics, and if it works it'll make this project significantly easier. I'm also thinking of adding a few things that the BeerBug doesn't have but not sure how to tackle those problems just yet (sensors like dissolved O2, pH, etc.). Anyway, just wanted to let those who were interested know that I'm still on this project, but waiting out the busy season. Cheers!"
4fp71z,1,2016-04-20,SharePoint Alternatives - Looking for Content/Document Management Solution,aleatoric,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4fp71z/sharepoint_alternatives_looking_for/,"I've been searching around for a tool that might help me and my company better organize our documents archive which also acts as a body of knowledge. However I'm not sure what I'm looking for is a Document Management solution per se because ideally the documents are supplemented with additional data (both narrative text and numerical values) describing the documents contained therein to help understand and explore all of the documents available. This makes me think of the term ""Knowledge Management"" but when I search for Knowledge Management tools, it's mainly IT Service Management tools for tracking trouble ticket histories and that's not what I'm looking for at all, although there are definitely some similarities. Perhaps what I'm looking for then is a Content Management product, but we're not managing a ton of assets (like graphics, videos, sounds, etc) so I'm not sure if that is overkill.

SharePoint is the tool we've pegged as the solution because it has the bottom of the line essential features. However, I really don't like SharePoint. I find its usability to be terrible. It's a great tool if you know what you're looking for, but it's a bad tool if you want to browse through a lot of information, such as a new employee learning and taking in information. 

I've stuck some background information I've written here in quotes. I thought about deleting it because it's lengthy but it might help understand the business need better:

&gt; I work for a small business that does Government contracting. Basically we're a teeny tiny version of something like Lockheed Martin or SAIC that specializes in biomedical research and professional services (staffing). 
&gt; 
&gt;  I work in the proposals department. We write proposals to win new business. It's a small team, but we each have our own niche. Mine is past performance: knowing what we've done in the past, and establishing it as proof to new prospective customers that we are capable of performing their requirements. 
&gt; 
&gt; This makes a historical knowledge of what our company has done in the past critically important. The only problem is that  a lot of the contextual knowledge that helps me make specific connections either resides in my brain, or in something we've written in the past. So right now, if I want to know if we have a specific kind of experience, if I don't know off the top of my head I usually do a search in Windows Explorer (I know, dreadful) of all the documents with those terms. If they're specific terms, it can be easy, but broad terms can require me to dig through hundreds of documents to find what I'm looking for, even after running a search. 
&gt; 
&gt; Others in my department have similar issues with their respective duties. As I previously mentioned, the current solution we are moving toward is SharePoint. It makes the most sense based on the products I know that are out there. Firstly, we already have the tool, so we don't have to purchase a new solution. We just have to set some server space aside for it and spend some time customizing the portal. I know SharePoint can generally do what we want it to do: create an archive of documents, tag them appropriately (army, clinical, etc) and boom, and then pull them up. Searching also works better in SharePoint than Explorer. It's certainly faster, although I don't find the interface to be that great nor the search mechanism to be as effective as something like Google's search algorithms (if we go with SharePoint I might recommend embedding a Google Search box if that is still a thing). 

In theory I think SharePoint can work OK. The main issue is that I (and a few others in my department) hate SharePoint. I think its usability is total garbage. It's not a very good tool for, say, someone who's new to the company. Perhaps they want to explore what our company has done in the past and understand it better. Think about something like Wikipedia: you can set up pages so that there is a flow of narrative and a lot of inter-linking. Instead of it being a cluttered list of documents, I'd prefer individual pages like ""Clinical Research"" which would describe what clinical research is, give a brief history of our work in clinical research, and then show what some of our past proposals (documents) are. Similarly you could navigate to a page for the U.S. Army, which could display some of our individual customers within the Army, some of our biggest contracts (and the important documents related), and the type of work we've done for them. 

The problem with a Wiki solution is that it's a bit more difficult to maintain. SharePoint you can just drop a file in there, tag it, and go on your way. When it comes to contract documents in particular, they can be modded at any time, and if we are going to have someone use this archive/portal/whatever it should be easy for them to go in and update this document. 

This is my impasse: I want something that's easy to maintain like SharePoint in terms of its document tagging, organizing, and searching. But I want to be able to have an interface that works as a friendlier interface for navigating and understanding this knowledge and its relationships. I don't mind some front-end effort establishing that interface as I imagine it will be a decent workload (I might hire an intern to help with this part). 

**TL;DR-**

* I'm looking for recommendations for a tool that combines document management (SharePoint) and web content management (like a Wiki). 

* Web-based is ideal but Windows apps might work as well.

* Free is ""nice to have"" but a paid tool is OK, especially if the product has a scalable pricing models because our need would not be as large as a big business.

* Should be easy to use and maintain for non-tech-savvy users. 

Any recommendations would be welcome. Thanks in advance!"

This paired with the NAS etc should be ample hardware to get going even if I have to upgrade the RAM. (keep in mind this is in €)

I also commute and am pretty shy so I don't have many friends that I can ask. Sorry in advance :(

So I'm a freshman currently taking 143 and I've been doing well so far. One thing I've been curious about for a while is how much you have to learn to actually be considered competent or qualified for a job / internship? Last week I overheard some classmates say things like the stuff you learn in 142/143 (writing for loops and traversing through arrays step by step) is actually really bad / slow in real-world situations. Those same guys also claimed that 373 is when you're barely qualified (if you're a nonmajor) to start interviewing for internships and stuff.

Anyways, I tried asking my TA what he thought but he said he wasn't really sure himself -- that I should ask the CSE students what their experiences were. Unfortunately, I'm kind of a loser so I don't know a lot of CS majors... I know there are a few CSE students on here so I guess I just wanted to ask what their experiences were. Do you guys think finishing the core classes (311/312+331/332+351) is when you're competent, or even later? Only when you have a degree? Just very curious and eager for some replies. Thank you so much to anyone who replies!"

In Botswana contact is made with pro-Apartheid parties but their political influence is so limited that forming a pro-South Africa government is written off by many as a pipe dream. There is however a large leftist movement in the nation and funding more right wing parties could be seen as a way to curb Soviet influence in Africa. In Poortugal a handful of extremely far-right organizations are contacted. They are arguably Fascistic hold overs from before WWII, but they are pro-Apartheid and willing to receive funding from South Africa. Within South Africa itself however, the people have become more and more disturbed by the governments policies. The Communist party of South Africa and the ANC have worked together to form Umkhonto we Sizwe. Spear of The Nation. They are a militant group armed with weapons floating around the Bantustan, as well as weapons given to them by defecting police or military. Their expressed goal isn't to kill people, but to carry out economic bombings or ""armed propaganda"" against the Apartheid government. The Pan African Congress also isn't sitting on it's hands and has formed it's own para-military wing. Based on Mao's ""Peoples Liberation Army"" they are far more radical than MK. They don't care about economic bombings or armed propaganda, but instead fighting back against Apartheid in a proper war. Their first attack was a raid on a police station in Paarl, where 200 fighters armed with axes and machetes stormed a police station killing several police officers as well as white civilians that tried to stop them.


**Spain**


Following the election that led to the Falange falling as ruling party several member of the military met in Seville. Officially they were on vacation and they never even ran into each other. However the truth is far different. In reality they met to talk about the failing of democracy and how General Franco has bent to the will of Communist nation half a world away. Notable appearances were by Ramón Serrano Suñer, General Agustín Muñoz Grandes, and Admiral Agustín Muñoz Grandes among others. They have decided the only way to remedy this ailment of the Spanish state is to purge it. They have decided to remove Fransico Franco from power and install a new Falange.


The coup in Spain began when President Francisco Franco awoke to find his manor surrounded by Spanish troops no longer loyal to him. That morning Agustín Muñoz Grandes marched a company of Spanish troops into the Parliament in Madrid and declared it to be an illegal organization operating for the sole reason of destabilizing Spain and strengthening the Communists. Coup forces quickly seized control of radio stations and government buildings and declared that Communist forces had attempted to kill President Franco, and that they had attacked him in the night, he has been placed under the protection of the military in his home. After this they began rounding up PPP supporters which caused a panic as rumors of them also arresting ANE supporters quickly circulated. These were proven partially true after General Grandes declared the creation of the ""National State Council"" declaring both the old Falange and the ANE illegal. Instead creating the ""Nueva Falange republicana"" or ""New republican falange"", incorporating authoritarian, and religious elements of the Falange and the economic liberalism of the ANE. General Grandes is currently the intern president. 

**Vietnam**


The Vietnamese state was created to the elation of thousands of Vietnamese that packed into the Haiphong to see the return of Ho Chi Mihn, who would lead the nation into a new dawn. In the south however, the VNLA were not at all happy with the outcome of the negotiations, and refused to disarm and surrender their weapons, or recognize the Hanoi government. After an attack on the VNLA base camp in Qui Nhơn that captued the city, the VNLA declared the Hanoi government an illegal puppet state of western imperialism. They have restarted operations in the Southeast and Mekong delta regions. Pushing through the relatively light resistance of the Viet Minh forces in the region, but their first offensive was halted by Viet Minh reinforcements that entered into the region. Both sides are unsure they can win this war and have practically begged their respective sides for support."

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.


--------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

Or it could just be an office type rp.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S I'm also looking to do different role plays such as Game Of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Witcher, Cyberpunk, A Porn Star on Campus, a High School/College rp and Mass Effect. So check my post history for those ideas if they interest you.

His internship will be from mid-June through August. Could anyone point me in the right direction? Or if someone could refer me to a facebook page for subleases in the area that would be great too.

4fq054,32,2016-04-20,I [27F] am not sure how to address some issues with the parents [late 30sF and mid40sM] of the little girl I babysit [4F].,jessbakescakes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fq054/i_27f_am_not_sure_how_to_address_some_issues_with/,"Last fall, I was completing an internship to get licensed in my field of employment. (I'm going to be vague about the details of the work juuuust in case someone sees this.) State regulations required me to be supervised for a certain amount of hours by a licensed professional in order to get my license. That's how I met ""Kate"". Kate supervised me and helped me get my license for the career I'm in now. Kate and her husband ""Elliot"" have a little girl, ""Chloe"", who is 4. One day, when I was at my internship site, Kate approached me and asked me if I was willing to babysit, since their babysitter cancelled last minute. I needed the extra money, and I liked Kate a lot, so I said yes. Ever since then, I've been Kate and Elliot's go-to babysitter because apparently Chloe likes me better than her other babysitter. I really like Chloe most of the time and she's a super sweet and fun kid.

I graduated with my master's degree in December, and Kate was no longer my supervisor once I became licensed. I now have a full time job doing the same thing Kate does, but at a different location. This means I'm less available to babysit. Kate and Elliot ask me to babysit on short notice more often than not. It's usually less than 24 hours in advance. I usually say yes, because I don't have a lot of plans besides being a homebody and hanging out with my boyfriend and our pets. I also appreciate the extra cash now and again. But, there are times when I can't babysit. Or just don't want to. But Kate and Elliot really like to go out and eat as grown ups, so they ask me quite frequently. They've never reacted badly to my turning it down, but sometimes it seems like they're disappointed or frustrated. (I could be taking that personally, though, because I have a history of creating an issue in my head where there isn't one!) 

There was one week where I babysat 3 out of 4 days in a row. With my full time job, this is getting to be a little exhausting. Since Kate does the same thing I do, I'm kind of thinking ""Yo, Kate, you're tired, I'm tired, I get it. But you're her mom, so... yeah."" So I've been kind but firm about saying that during the busier times at work I won't be able to babysit. So far, this has worked out okay for the most part. Kate and Elliot still ask me pretty frequently, but they've backed off a little until summer, when things should be much easier for me at work.

Here's where I get into the part where the advice is needed. Kate is a great professional contact of mine. I like Kate and Elliot a lot, and Chloe is an awesome kid. I genuinely like babysitting for them. But, Kate and Elliot are absolutely shitty about paying me on time. When Kate first asked me to babysit, the conversation was ""We pay our babysitters $10 an hour, is that okay?"" I hadn't babysat since I was a tween, so I was like ""Ummmm sure, yeah."" I've been told a bunch of times that I'm getting ripped off, etc, but I don't care so much, since it's fun to hang out with Chloe and I'm not Mary Poppins or anything. I'm just someone who likes babysitting, has experience with kids, and happened to be available. All that to say, for the first few months, they were paying me in cash that night after they got home and asked how Chloe was, etc. (I'm pretty sure that's customary, but then again I'm stuck in my tweenage days where you either wrote the babysitter a check or forked over the cash.) One night, Elliot asked me if I had a PayPal account. I said I did, and he asked if I would be willing to accept payment in PayPal. I assumed this was for them to keep a more accurate record of what they're paying me, and that saves me from having to deposit the cash or check into my account anyway, so I agreed. (I would just use the cash, but I'm horrible about spending it more easily than I would if I saw my bank balance go down with every transaction.) For the next couple of gigs, I was getting the paypal money regularly, on time, etc. Once, Kate and Elliot forgot to pay me, or didn't pay me. I believe this was on a Monday. Kate asked me if I could babysit again that Friday night, addressed that she hadn't yet paid me, and said she would pay me for both Monday and Friday after they got home on Friday. I said yes. 

Elliot even told Kate to tack on a $5 late fee. But for the past few times, I haven't been paid on time at all. The first time, I was like ""No worries, things happen"" and Kate and Elliot agreed to take care of it before I even had to ask. Elliot is also really cool about being generous with my hourly wage. If Chloe has an accident or a temper tantrum, he throws in a few extra bucks. He tipped me $20extra when I graduated with my master's degree, since he knew what was going on with me and Kate at work. Elliot is awesome in that regard. Kate sticks to the strict $10 an hour, and I could have cleaned up all manner of messes and/or bodily fluids and still receive the same rate. But anyway, that was taken care of. Elliot gave me the extra money for being late, they paid me, and all was well.

The next time, I marked it on my calendar to remind them three days later. Kate texted me on Day 2 and said ""We haven't paid you yet... four hours, right?"" She paid me later that night. This past time I assumed Elliot would be paying me with his account like usual, so I put my three day reminder in my planner. On day 3, Kate texted me first and said that she was making her own PayPal account, so she would have to wait until they approved her bank account to pay me. She said Elliot was out of town and she had asked him to pay me but he kept forgetting. With her account, she could pay me in a timely manner. I was cool with waiting a few more days, since she seemed like she was trying to fix what was getting to be a frustrating situation. I got that money a week later. 

Now, the late payments are becoming a habit. Perhaps I shouldn't have accepted the excuses beforehand, but I didn't want to ruin the professional relationship or seem like an insensitive jerk. I understand things come up and I understand life gets busy and people forget. But the more this happens, the more I realize that I'm setting a precedent. I haven't been paid since the last time I babysat last Friday night. I usually make a note to check in, but I've never had to actually follow through. Now, I'm wondering how to bring it up without sounding like an ass. Because of the reaction I get sometimes when I tell them I can't babysit, I'm afraid that being like, ""Hey, I didn't get paid for last Friday"" over and over again is going to ruin the professional relationship we have. I've thought of not babysitting for them at all anymore, but I really like Chloe and she's a sweetheart. I would miss Chloe a lot. And since I'm her ""favorite babysitter"", and I'm ""the coolest girl in the world"", I know I would crush her if I stopped showing up. How do I handle this?


   
**tl;dr**: Former supervisor and her husband ask me to babysit for their four year old a lot. They used to pay me on time but since they changed payment methods they don't pay me in a timely manner. What do I say?"

I've done two internships at agencies and they told me that they actually spend a lot more time on the computer- whether it's pitching, writing, researching, etc. Then again I recently went for an interview at a different firm in which they said that they pitch reporters by phone from 8AM-1PM each day. Which is the more common practice at an agency? Honestly, cold-calling is probably one of my least favorite parts about this industry and it just seems to come naturally to most, which worries me sometimes."

4fqirg,9,2016-04-20,Computer science major- having some trouble with technical interviews for internships,gek0srf,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4fqirg/computer_science_major_having_some_trouble_with/,"It's really easy for me to get past the initial stages of an interview as I love talking and all that wonderful ADHD stuff and my soft skills are usually pretty great, until after the technical portion of the interview that I know I've failed. 

When given a coding problem to solve in front of the interviewers, I just can't do it. I know how to solve the problem and a lot of the time I've actually seen the problem beforehand while doing my own practice sessions. I've even tried talking out loud while I'm practicing and I've gotten kind of better at it. 

But when I'm actually there in the interview, I completely freeze up. I'll start trying every single approach to a problem trying to trigger my memory and I have to voice this process out loud as I'm doing it because they want to hear your problem solving process. And then I get nervous that the interviewers must think I'm some sort of lunatic because my thoughts, naturally, are so jumbled and they tend to jump back and forth. I'm used to hiding my ADHD from others in a professional setting, so having to voice my thoughts feels like I'm ripping off my ADHD mask and showing just how weird my brain is. So the end result is that it comes off as me not knowing what I'm doing and that I can't code, so I don't get hired. 

I've even had to do a technical interview in a room on campus with thin walls where I could hear every word from another interview going on at the same time, so that was quite distracting and fun. But my experiences in quieter rooms have been just as bad and the only person distracting me was myself. 

I know I have test performance anxieties and I'm slower to process things, which isn't good for a career where they expect you to solve a coding problem as fast as possible. So I don't know what to do. 

I've talked to my disability advisor through my university and she said that there may be some sort of way to get interview accommodations. But then I'm also worried that seeking those would negatively impact me in actually getting a job. 

As a result of all of this, I haven't been able to land a summer internship at all, despite trying really hard and going on lots of interviews. And I'm graduating in December, so I won't have any internship experiences in software engineering before trying to find a full time job. So I'm then at a bigger disadvantage. 

The failure of this is really hard to come to terms with, but I'm just wondering if someone else has been in this situation before. And I'm wondering what those of you who have software engineering jobs have done to mitigate your ADHD during the technical portion of your job interviews. 

**TL;DR** I'm basically looking for any sort of advice that fellow ADHD computer scientists have for technical interviews. "

Recently, though, I heard back from another offer, which was a hands-on internship in my field of interest. Needless to say, the opportunity is something that I just can't afford to pass up, but with the summer drawing nearer, I don't want to leave the other offer 'hanging' as well.

I showed up at Golfsmith at the appropriate time, and I didn't see anyone at the fitting bays. So I asked some employees... none of them was aware of anybody from Wilson coming to do demos/fittings that day. They suggested I was probably at the wrong store.

I looked at my confirmation email, and it said I was in the right store, on the right date, at the right time. The email had a phone number on it, so I called. I got a Wilson intern on the phone, and she said she'd make some calls, and that I should get a call back shortly from their regional rep, Dave. 

Dave calls me and is very apologetic that his fitter was running late that day and wouldn't be able to do my fitting, and he asks some questions about what I had come to try out. He apologizes repeatedly, and he asks if I can text him my address so he can set me up with some stuff.

Well, I got a package from Dave today...

I've gotten the impression the town itself isn't that interesting but there are a lot of different places to drive to in the nearby area. However, I just had a few questions I figured you guys might be able to help with. 

* Is the town pretty dead in the summer or are there some people who stick around?  

* Following up on the first question, is there any summer groups to get involved in to meet some people so my time there this summer is more enjoyable?

* What's the best way to look for short leases or subleasing someones place for June - Mid August? Is there any facebook pages within the school or anything for this?

* In general, any recommendations for me on what to expect or things that I should definitely do or try out?

4frnpo,26,2016-04-21,Job hunting experience of an incompetent fresh graduate.,hopelessjobhunter,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4frnpo/job_hunting_experience_of_an_incompetent_fresh/,"Hi guys! This is a very long ""Taglish"" post. I am still not that confident with my English writing skills and I am not a very good story teller as well. So I decided to stick on what I know.

Anyway, I really just want to put this story here partly to get advises but mainly just to remove it out of my chest. I hope it would okay to post something like this during these times since I believed you guys are enjoying the ""Election 2016"" topics.

Ako nga pala si /u/hopelessjobhunter, grumaduate noong taong 2015 sa kursong BSIT. Noong High School, hindi ako yung tipo ng estudyante na seryoso at pala-aral. Hindi ko rin naisip kung saang unibersidad ako mag-aaral. Habang busy ang mga kaklase ko sa mga review centers at entrance exams, nandoon ako, sa computer shop, may sariling mundo.

Mahilig na talaga ako sa computer simula bata pa lang ako. Gigising ng maaga kapag bakasyon, lalabas ng bahay at makikipaglaro sa aking pinsan o kapitbahay ng ""Monster Hunter"", isang tanyag na laro sa Play Station Portable (PSP) noon. Parang nalilimutan ko ang oras kapag nasa harap ako ng screen ng computer, mapa-DOTA (1/2), CS, Diablo, Torchlight, MMORPG's o kahit anong genre pa ng laro yan, nae-enjoy ko.

Noong magkaroon ako ng una kong smartphone, doon ko nadiskubre yung tinatawag nilang applications (Apps). Na-realized ko na ito yung gusto ko maging career at kunin sa kolehiyo. Kung papaano gumawa ng mga ganitong bagay. Kung papaano mag-solve ng real world problems gamit ang Software/Applications at makatulong sa iba. Medyo lumayo ako sa mga games at nagsimulang magseryoso sa side ng ""Programming"". 

Fast forward ng isang taon, eto ako ngayon, hindi pa din makahanap ng trabaho sa industriyang pinili ko. Hindi ko ba alam kung malas lang talaga ako o kulang pa din talaga yung mga efforts at hindi pa sapat ang mga kaalaman ko para makahanap ng trabaho sa industriyang ito.

Hindi naman ako naging ""bummer"" ng buong taon simula grumaduate ako. Pagkatapos ng kolehiyo, pinilit ko talagang makahanap ng entry-level position na pasok yung qualifications ko. Nag-take ako ng exams na hindi ko na mabilang at pumunta sa pagkarami-raming interviews, pero after 6 months. Wala pa din naging bunga yung efforts ko. 

Dahil ako yung breadwinner ng pamilya, mataas yung expectation ng mga magulang ko sa akin na makatulong sa pangaraw-araw na gastos at mataas din ang expectation ko sa sarili ko kasi alam ko deep inside na kaya ko naman. Dahil sa sobrang pressure at awa sa kalagayan namin ng taong yun, napagdesisyunan ko na pumasok sa Call Center industry. 

Inisip ko nalang na pansamantala lang ito habang hindi pa ako makahanap ng trabaho sa industriyang gusto ko talaga pasukan. Pero ang hirap! Ang hirap pumasok sa trabaho gabi-gabi kung yung puso mo wala naman sa ginagawa mo. Tiniis ko! Wala akong choice, kailangan ko kumayod kung hindi magugutom ang pamilya ko, mapapatigil sa pag-aaral ang mga kapatid ko, at mapapalayas kami sa inuupahan naming apartment. 

Habang kumakayod sa gabi, pinagtibay ko ang aking mga kaalaman sa programming tuwing umaga. Nagre-reserved ako ng 4-6 hours a day para makapag-self study at matuto pa para sa susunod na sasabak nanaman ako sa job hunting, hindi ako mahihirapan. I barely sleeps 7 hours a day kasi morning person ako at dahil gabi nga yung trabaho ko, medyo nasira yung sleep pattern ko. Pero okay lang! I can handle it. 

Fast forward, March 2016. Dahil hiring season, napagdesisyunan ko na mag-resign sa trabaho ko bilang Call Center agent at magbakasakali ulit sa industriyang gusto ko mapasok. Inihanda ko lahat ng kailangan ko na ihanda. Pinaganda at pinasimple ko yung resume ko, nag-ready ako ng list ng mga companies na pwedeng applyan, nireview ko ulit yung mga pinag-aralan ko netong nakaraang taon at inilagay ko sa resume ko.

Windows, Linux, OOP, Android Development, Java, C#, Black-box testing, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Python, SQL. Medyo impressive kung ikukumpara mo sa mga fresh graduates na hindi pa masyadong diverse yung technical skills. Tinarget ko na makapasok sa isang posisyon bilang Front-End/Full-Stack Web Developer or Android Developer, pwede na din siguro yung Software Testing since medyo may experience naman ako dun during my internship.

Eto na, inimbitahan ako ng isang kumpanya na gustong-gusto ko pasukan para mag-exam sa kanila. Day of exam medyo kabado ako kasi eto na nga, puno ako ng confidence pero parang andiyan pa rin yung kaba na baka hindi pa sapat yung mga inaral ko.

Pero nagulat ako, kasi sobrang dali lang nung exam. 2 parts siya, logic reasoning at actual coding. Pero minani ko lang pareho. Yung mga exam na alam ko na hindi ko masasagutan noong grumaduate ako medyo madali na lang para sa akin ngayon. Nakausap ko yung mga ibang applicants tungkol sa reaction nila sa exam habang pababa ng building. Ang hirap daw lalo na yung programming part, hindi naman daw naituro noong college. Doon ko napagtanto na nag-improved na ako. Na kaya ko makapasok sa company na ito.

As expected, may nag-email sa akin na nakapasa ako at ini-invite ako for final technical interview. Confident akong kaya ko, kasi alam ko na nag-ready talaga ako. I researched the company, check the interview section of their Glassdoor, even read the entire thread of their company on PinoyExchange. I readied for almost two weeks. 

Sobrang saya ko sa loob-loob ko during the interview kasi what I reviewed, yun lang din yung mga actual na tinatanong. Sa tingin ko nga mas ready pa ako sa interviewer ko kasi medyo nauutal-utal siya magsalita at hindi niya masyado ma-express yung gusto niyang sabihin. Dumating sa point na pinipilit ko nalang intindihin yung gusto niyang iparating. 

Everything was well until marinig ko yung words na alam kong kahit anong gawin ko dito sa interview na 'to, hindi ako makukuha. ""I'll be honest, it would be a gamble for us to hire you since you didn't came from one of the top 3 universities."" Baka halfway of training sumuko ka na at mag-AWOL, nangyari na kasi sa amin yang ganyan last year eh. 

That was it! I know the results already pero hindi ako nagpahalata. I bombarded him questions that I readied since it's my time to ask. I just continued even though I know It wouldn't help. That's when  I realized that it isn't really about what you know. It just saddens me na a company as big as Oracle will not hire a person because of the university he/she went into.

Siguro ito na yung balik na mga kapabayaan ko noon? Kung naisip ko lang sana ng mas maaga kung pano nagwo-work yung kalakalan sa industry o pwede nating sabihing sa pinas, siguro hindi ako nahihirapan ngayon. Hindi ko alam kung pano ako magco-continue after this. Parang biglang naubos lahat ng confidence ko sa katawan. Parang naging useless yung efforts ko nitong nakaraang taon. 

**EDIT:** Thank you for all the kind words everyone and for those that took their time to shoot me a PM as well! You don't how much I appreciate it! Hindi ko alam kung ano mangyayari ngayon since hindi ko pa din nakwe-kwento sa family ko yung results. They have high hopes din kasi na makakapasa ako. You know, the thing is, I just don't have the resources to freely apply to every job postings I would see out there. And I don't have too much time as well to be idle since I will need to help my parents (they don't force me to help) send my siblings to school this June. 

I am thinking of freelancing, pero medyo takot ako sumubok kasi I have no real world or actual experience creating a live project. So I think I would follow /u/AgentCooderX's advise while working at night. I am not giving up on this.

Once again, thank you everyone! 

For people asking what I used to study by myself, please check this link - http://www.theodinproject.com/. I am very noob at programming and really have no idea how it works at first. But this helped me a lot.

Let me cut to the chase; a 2.9 physics BS from a small liberal arts school wants to go to grad school for particle physics. Being from the Chicago area, the sleeping giant UChicago is always looming in the background like Gatsby's green light... Calling my name... Because I didn't want to step directly into the grad school world and rather focused on my studies and extracurricular physics goodies, I have a nice long time to prepare but want to know if it's going to be worth all of my efforts. I'm currently doing my second internship with a national lab, this time in offline data production with grid computing. My first one was with experimental particle physics at a test beam facility. My STEM grades aren't quite good, and are what mostly brought down my GPA over the years, however, being new to this whole grad school prospect, I'm not sure if it matters that I'm super well rounded (my school specializes in building renaissance men). If I took the GRE and got a good letter from my sponsor for this internship, do you think I would have a chance or should I take more time off and keep steeping the teabag of experience?

Going to compress an incredibly long story into a merely long one to save room/melodrama, going to include things about how well I did in school—simply because it may relate to something I can put on my resume, apologies if it comes across as arrogant. 

==

-Got a psych degree from a good school, graduated with a 3.8 average. This took about five years due to a change in major early on. No job during this time because my parents suggested I focus solely on school and then take the summers off ( absolutely not blaming them—it was super sweet of them and completely my decision to go along with their suggestion, just pointing out why I was able to do this).

-Got sick—one year in a coma, one year recovering.

-Went to law school, finished first year in top 20%, got into Law review via the write on. Interned with a pair of judges at both the federal and state level over the summer (two internships is the norm). Got super sick again (same issue) and spent another two years sick in bed—no coma this time but still couldn’t do much. Had to drop out of law school. Never went back because 1.) My scholarship, understandably, got pulled and I couldn’t afford to go back and 2.) Came to the conclusion I wouldn’t enjoy being a lawyer very much. 

-My health issues weren’t as severe, so I went to a community college for an associates in an IT field while recovering. During this time, I also started a small resale business with just me as the sole proprietor where I flip stuff online since I had to be fairly sedentary; made enough to cover for school. I also took a trimester off to undertake a very risky surgery that worked out and, wallah!, just like that, health problems are resolved—only thing I have to worry about are yearly check-ups from now on and taking a ton of meds every morning. 

-Finishing my associates (Straight A’s except for one B) and getting my certs in about three months’ time. 

==

During this whole time I, like an idiot, focused on school instead of actual resume building. The result? Twenty seven, turning twenty-eight in a few weeks, and practically nil to put down when I’m about to enter the work force (excluding a few easy internships in an unrelated field) for the first time. 

What do I do in such a bizarre situation? Even if resolved, I don’t feel comfortable mentioning a serious illness and the gaps are massive. Functional resumes have fallen out of style. My small business is honestly pretty meager profit wise, so the instant I have to turn over any receipts / tax returns to prove I’m not making it up it will still look small time. Only bright side is my family ages extraordinary slowly (youngest person to die in my grandparent’s generation was 95. He was out riding his bike and got hit by a car—that’s how freakishly slow we age); so I look twentyish instead of twenty-seven; most peopled will assume I’m fresh out of college (which I am, but you know what I mean). But the dates on my resume will give away that I’m much older. 

If I can’t get a job, I’ll just start volunteering like mad to build up my resume. I don’t have to worry about rent atm since my parents are incredibly supportive and awesome, but this can’t go on forever either. I’m worried that I’m only getting older and the instant my age pops up I’ll be screwed… 

Any advice?  Is this as cataclysmic as I think it is? Should I plan to submit resumes across the whole country (US) and get ready for a move?

This may not be the best subreddit to post but both /r/gwt , /r/sencha and the sencha forum aren't active enough.

So, my problem is just as the title says, I'm trying to add a button to a cell (basically a remove button to delete the row). I've been stuck on this since yesterday, I've succesfully added a button by changing the cell renderer who then changes the inner html but then I have no way of adding an event to it (Or I haven't found one).

Here are the classes I use :
I've followed this example since I'm only trying a few things to get used to sencha (as well as gwt) http://examples.sencha.com/gxt/4.0.0/#ExamplePlace:basicsimplegrid%28uibinder%29 so I'm using ColumnModel, ColumnConfig and a custom button class which extends TextButton. 
I'm also doing AsyncCalls to a database to retrieve the data I want to print in the grid, which are succesful but that may be good to know.

I feel like the example I used isn't made for that, I should maybe find a more efficient way to make that grid.

So if you guys have any idea on how to do this with what I'm using or something totally different that'd a great help !
Feel free to ask code samples, though I have an ugly spaghettis code.

(For the context, I'm currently an intern in an IT company and I'm supposed to use GWT and I've been introduced to sencha, so I'm trying a few things to experiment and learn how it works)"

I'm here in Arusha, Tanzania on a internship with International Aboriginal Youth Internship based in Canada for 5 months. I'm currently on my second month and I've already done so much, but I want to do more. I'm currently holding a gofundme page for a orphanage in Arusha, and the list of what needs to be done, I've also included pictures of the current state of the orphanage right now.

From gofundme... . ""Hi there, I'm part of a internship called International Aboriginal Youth Internship(IAYI), and I was given to opportunity to come to Tanzania on a 5 month journey to help families and individuals dealing with HIV and AIDS and help a developing country working on issues such as equality between men and women, the environment, health, education, small business development, and agriculture.

My first leg of my internship lead me to a orphanage in Arusha. As I seen the kitchen for the first time, I was shocked to see how food is handled and prepared, and for especially for the future of Tanzania, I knew right away I wanted to help and get their kitchen cleaned and updated, especially how food is prepared, handled, and stored. Another project I wanted to focus on is also incorporating healthier foods and give a larger array of alternatives to a healthier lifestyle by introducing a garden.

100% of the donations will be going towards the orphanages kitchen and garden , any extra will be going towards health/nutrition within the orphanage. What I've seen is that kitchen needs to be done is… *Clean and cleaning supplies *Add storage, off from the ground *Counter space with Kitchen sink *Purchase plates, cups, utensils *Purchase pots and pans *Add Food storage containers *Pest control (cockroachs, blackflies, mice) *Create an safe area where the children can eat

I would also like to add that every item will be made and purchased from local merchants here in Arusha to help develop economic growth. Make sure to come back and see the updates I'll be posting on the progress of the kitchen

Everything is for corporate video, we don't do any narrative work.  

I currently work full time salary at a small production company that's becoming an agency. We've discovered that our clients don't know how to strategize or implement their videos, and thus are moving towards more of an agency model where we have discovery sessions, see what the client needs, less order taking. I've been with the company for three years next month, and in that time we've grown from 2 to 5 full-time staff. Small, but growing well for the area. My boss and I had a discussion last fall/winter about me transitioning to a creative director role, and since then I've had two large (for us) projects ($85,000 between the two) that I've overseen that have gone very well with very happy clients. The 3-year check-in/payraise meeting looks promising. The culture is excellent, I love my coworkers and boss, if there was anything that isn't as good, it's the pay. While I am making over twice what I started 6 years ago at a previous similar company, it's barely enough to cover bills without my wife working. And I don't receive benefits, but that is ""supposed"" to be changing.  

Now, I am being somewhat courted by a client of ours who is potentially looking to start their own production division. They're about a 200-300 person company that deal with corporate real estate purchases, etc., and it would entail a lot of travel across the globe. Travel is very important to my wife and I, and from what I've been told, they are family-friendly in that she could come with and we'd basically only need to pay for her ticket and anything she does on her own. I could probably convince her to PA occasionally for me, too. Downside is we have a 1-year-old so for a few years, it wouldn't be ideal. Chances are high that they could pay up to 50% more than what I make now, which would be more than she makes on her stay-at-home job. I have a meeting with the president of this company, the VP of Sales and VP of Custom Content on the first week of May. The President and I are passing (Facebook) friends, I helped do a huge favor for him and his wife, was invited to his wife's surprise birthday party, and I've been on two trips with them through my current company.  

Career-wise, on one hand it makes sense to stick with my current job as a CD and advance that way. But I don't know how much it can pay long-term. It might require a jump-ship at some point in the next 3 years as we look to have at least another child, maybe move closer to the city, etc. If I went to company B, it would mean doing the ""in-house production team"" thing which I've always kind of scoffed at, but it would likely be enough ""different things"" that I wouldn't get bored at all. Also might be able to still have a ""CD"" title so that in 5 years my resume isn't just ""video producer"" for 11 years. I have joked with my boss about how I wish I could intern at a larger agency and see how they do things - I've only ever worked with 5-people-and-under companies. Company B might be a way to get that experience without going backwards on the corporate ladder.

Culture-wise, both companies are great. Like I said, I love where I am now. Best boss I've ever had, great coworkers. Really no complaints on the culture aspect. Company B I've done enough work with and have met enough of the people to know that I would enjoy the culture there as well. I'm sure in such a large company that there would be people I couldn't stand, but enough that I would enjoy to balance it out.

I know I should hear out the client company on what they have to say, and heck, if they can't pay much more than what I make now, that's an easy decision. I really just needed to get this off my chest and see if anyone had thoughts/personal stories/recommendations. Or if anyone knows of a better subreddit to post this at, please suggest."

So here are a few;

Let's start on the federal side

1. Mitacs -- Mitacs is for academic-industrial RnD. They have a few programs under them. One is the elevate program which provides funnding of 57K/year to hire someone to conduct some aspect of RnD. There is also the Accelerate Internship. This program is for hiring a Master's or PhD grad and matches funding at $7500 I believe. Further information at http://www.mitacs.ca/en

2. NRC (National Research Council) has a boatload of programs including; IRAP - Business covers 25% they cover 75% - This is for new tech. MAS - This provides you with a Management person to assess your business. Youth Employment Program - Up to 30K to hire a grad.

3. CICP (I think it is BICP now) - Funding for pre-commercial to get a product commercial. Funding on this varies all the way up to 1MM I believe depending on what sector you are in.

4. Global Innovation Program - Between 5K-75K to find international partners.

There are more on the federal level. This is a short list.

Provincial Programs;

1. Alberta Innovates has a bunch of programs too including; Product demonstration - 100-300K to showcase your product. RnD Associates Salary - Covers up to 60K salary for someone in RnD. Commercialization - Covers up to 100K of salary. These programs have certain criteria you have to meet. They also have some other programs for other sectors, energy being one of them.

2. Tradeshow Attendance - up to 20K to go to take your company to a tradeshow.

3. Alberta Womens -- Programs and financing for women (provided you own more than 51% of your company).

4. Research and Innovation - Provides money for market analysis and prototyping. Not sure of the amount.

There are a whole bunch more I could talk about but these are the primary ones. The long and short, if you are an Alberta business in almost any stage there is funding available for everything from development, prototyping, market research, global expansion, staffing, HR and on and on. 

I do not work for the government or any of these programs, but being a business owner in the tech space for over 6 years I have been exposed to most of them. If you have questions let me know, I may not have the answers but I can certainly connect you with the people that do."

4fttkj,3,2016-04-21,Small to large firm?,accounting119,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4fttkj/small_to_large_firm/,"Full disclosure, I'm reposting this. Original posted this early morning on the 18th and was wondering why I didn't get much feedback. Obviously, cus half the accounting world had the day off :p

I'm about two years deep into my audits staff position at a firm of about 80 people. The audit department I work in has 11 people: an intern, two audit staff (including myself), two seniors, one supervising senior, two managers and three partners.

Basically, I feel like I'm given a lot of freedom in my work. I'm basically conducting an audit myself right now and while that seems cool, it's been extremely stressful. I need to know everything about the client, keep the audit moving, while still hopping back and forth between other jobs.

This is extremely annoying and as bad as it might sound, I just want to be told what do, or at the very least have some niche I can progress at.

Right now, I'm all over the place. One day I'm working on a not for profit client audit, the next I'm doing an accrual to cash conversion work paper for a C corp.

I appreciate the diverse work I get to do, but I feel this ""jack of all trades"" career style is really limiting my progress. Right when I have a feel for a client, I'm on a different job and feel like I barely got to capitalize on what I had just learned.

Also, I feel the work life balance thing small firms sell is bs. As a single guy with no kids, I know I'm being looked at as lazy when people with kids are working about the same hours as me. I'm not lazy; I chose a small firm partly so I wouldn't have to work as much but if I need to put it the stupid hours, may as well do it at a larger, more prestigious firm, right?

Can those of you who've moved from a small firm to a big one share your experiences? I'm worried my issue isn't necessarily with my firm, but maybe with my career path in general.

Thanks!!"
4fu3xp,1,2016-04-21,What else can I do? (Internship Offer),Mordoc0881,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4fu3xp/what_else_can_i_do_internship_offer/,"Long story short I was offered an internship at a small company in a major city last week. I have previous engineering project experience and had a good internship last summer where I was paid $16/hr, which was about what I had expected (though I don't want to work there again for other reasons). 

However, this new company is offering me just $15/hr. Not bad, but much less than I expected. I sent the engineering manager an email asking for a small increase before I start this summer but he shut it down because they are a small company and he said they can't offer anything more. I made sure to make a strong case that I was more experienced and that I would work as hard as I needed to earn than higher rate.

I do believe I deserve closer to $18/hr because that's what friends with similar experience make nearby, because that's the average for the area, and it's a small boost over last summer. But to take this offer would be a pay CUT!

What else can I do? I do want to work for the company, but I almost feel insulted at the rate. I don't have any other options since it's so close to the summer already and I feel lucky that they offered anything at all, but I feel like this might be a red flag.

I lost all the company match because I was not vested according to the company policy (I knew this when leaving).

My entire plan consists entirely of Publix stock, which has performed extremely well in the past, and with my limited knowledge of corporate strategy, I suspect it to do even better in the coming years.

I now HAVE to move the money out of the plan because I do not have $1000 in there. I have three options.

1.  Take a lump-sum payment (get taxed on income &amp; tax penalty)

2. Roll over to an IRA

3. Take stock-in-kind distribution (receive lump sum in the value of Publix stock)(Taxable income &amp; tax penalty)

I am leaning towards number 3 but I wanted to know what PF thinks.

Im going to try to keeps this as short as I can.


This all started around November last year, my bf who I've been in a LDR for 10 months, was playing on my game account and one of my friends, going to caller her Sophie, she didnt like at all, I was on my intership at the time he used to play on my acct, no big deal, he knew I wasnt home and I told him he could play whenever he wanted. Sophie was home playing also the same game and saw that I, in fact my bf, was online started talking, then she finds out it was him and they had this huge argument I didnt even knew about it, then she came to talk to me about and got all pissed at me because of that argument they had like it was my fault. So the next day I went to my classes (I had 3 days internship and 2 days of classes) and she was really pissed at me and the other girl, lets call her Ann, Ann didnt talk to me the whole day just because Sophie was mad at me, I just completed ignore, went to my classes talked to my other friends like I do everytime.


We go on like this for about a week, then I decided to go talk to Sophie and try to know why she isnt talking to me, she says I didnt apologise to her and that it was my fault, I told her it wasnt my fault I had nothing to do with their arguments but I apologise the way he treated her (he was very polite to her but she still got mad) then we go as ""friends"" again.


We had our Christmas break and since January everytime they go out never ask if I want to go which they did everytime, they dont talk to me like they used to, my mother had a cancer scare and needed my friends and couldn't count on their support, my bf on the other hand was always supporting me.


About 3 weeks ago I overheard them trash talking me and bf, saying that he doesnt like me since we dont have on our facebooks that we are on a relationship, that we only see ourselfes once every month, which is true but we have about 400 miles distance, so that makes it kinda hard. But that he puts up with the trip whenever we get a chance to be together says something imo. 


They talk about me a lot, cuz everytime they just both of them they are talking and then I show up they just shut up and dont tell me anything. Sometimes I hear them saying my name and talking something I can't hear, I asked them what they are talking about they just say its nothing and that I they werent talking about me, when I heard my name. 


Today we were all leaving and and Sophie's brother was trash talking my bf right in front of me like he knew him for a long time, he just saw him once for a couple of minutes. He said childish things like ""He can be higher rank but my dick is bigger"" and hitting on me and then started to make fun of me because I was ignoring his moves.


This kind of things have been going for about 4 months and Im really sick of all this stuff, I just want this all to stop and dont know what to do, if I confront them they'll just deny everything so ye, I dont know what to do ...


TL:DR - My friends are trash talking me and my boyfriend over an argument my bf had with one of my friends, if I confront them they'll deny, need help..

-Currently splitting rent/bills with my boyfriend who supports whatever my decision is 100%

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. 

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

Or it could just be an office type rp.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

I am currently finishing my sophomore year of college. After this semester I expect my cumulative GPA to be around a 3.2-3.3, I know that this is not ideal but I had a tough time adjusting to college in the second semester of my freshman year where I got a 2.7 GPA for that semester. I am majoring in Actuarial Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science. 

My question is what do I have to do to boost my chances of getting an internship for next summer, i.e 2017. I am sitting for FM in June and feel pretty comfortable that I will pass, then I will be sitting for MFE in November. I currently have programming knowledge in Java, and I am taking a VBA course over the summer. I do not have any big projects in programming other than the programs we did for class.

I know that I need to boost my GPA through the last two years, and I feel as if I could realistically bring my GPA up to a 3.5 before graduation. 

I'm just wondering what I should try to do too boost my chances of landing an internship. I'm going to write my resume over the summer as well so if you have any advice that would be relevant to that, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I am currently a junior in a computer science program, and am in the interview process for a Web dev internship with a startup company in Boston. They threw me off by asking about compensation. I have absolutely no idea how much to ask for. I looked up average pay for Web Development interns, and it seems to be anywhere between $25-40/hour, but I don't know if that is realistic for a startup. Any advice on how to proceed would be great!"

Very lost,pandasa123,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/4fvfe7/northeastern_vs_uiuc_vs_umichigan_for_computer/,"Hey guys, I wanted to hear your opinions on which college I should go to. I want to major in Computer Engineering and definitely partake in some entrepreneurship opportunities while I am on campus

I got into NEU Honors and am living in MA so I figured that I wouldn't have to deal with too much of a cultural shift. The Co-op program seems very interesting and would help me gain lots of work experience. Plus, the cost would be around 36k per year with the grant money

UIUC is out in the midwest and I'm not sure how well I'd adapt but it's a top uni for CE. Along with that, the campus is a bit detached from everything else. I figured that if I go to UIUC or UMichigan, I would like to come back to the east coast during the summers but I don't know how that would fare in terms of the internship opportunities. The cost amounts to 51k per year

UMichigan is a similar argument to UIUC. Top uni but it has some city life. It costs about 53k per year but I could do a Ross BBA alongside my engineering degree. I don't know how much more I'd be worth though (as silly as that may sound) in terms of entry salary in case entrepreneurship doesn't work. The issue I have with the bigger schools is that I feel like I might get lost in the crowd of the other talented engineers (a bit irrational, but a concern I have nevertheless). I also am battling the idea of reputation vs the co-op work experience. Maybe I'm overthinking it or approaching it in the wrong way and would like some insight

My parents have been pushing me to go to the bigger schools and have been sending so many people to talk me into it and they have all been giving rather confusing opinions so I wanted to come here and get a sense of what you guys think"

I'm really sorry because this probably won't be written that coherent, but my mind is far from coherent right now. 

So basicly when we started we both knew she was going away to studytrip for a month and a half, 2 months after our summer thing started. She wanted to be exclusive, I told her I wish that too, but you're young, pretty, and you can't really know for sure. And basicly one night she pretty much fucked some other guy who she had a crush on before she met me, but he had a gf. 

I know, in my head I've beaten myself up a lot, since I was the one not demanding or really agreeing to be exclusive (I told her that from my side I don't see a chance of meeting someone else, and that I to am gonna work that we stay together).

When she told me the next day we kind just pushed it to the side like we're gonna deal with it when she comes home. I hate myself for even letting this go on, but I really did like her and believed we can work through this. 

She came back, we somehow managed (in my opinion I did a lot of swalling, and she didn't really help me chew; thats basicly how I'm feeling).

And right now I'm on exchange for 5 months. I'm closer though, so she visitis me every second weekend. But my mind keeps creeping over me. She didn't tell me she was attracted to that guy untill after she allready almost fucked him (basicly was naked in his bed doing everything else, but didn't want to fuck).

The more we don't see eachother the more these kind of thoughts keep coming. Is she attracted to someone on work right now? She's very beautiful and ambitious but is very self conscius, so even if someone was flirting with her, I keep having these thoughts, she would just dismiss it (because why would someone really flirt with her) and wouldn't realise until she's half way down that road. 

To make things worse, the worse my mentality is getting about us the more I notice other girls (after one of huge fights where she kept attacking me, I don't really find her that attractive anymore subjectively, although I know objectively that I'm very attracted to her (before and her body type).

Now after that fight, I haven't really felt that passion about her anymore. My mind keeps noticing other girls. My mind keeps having these excrutiating thoughts what might happen and what could happen. She's also trying to get another internship on the other continet for 6 months and she just might get it. I can't deal with that, if I'm suffering so much now, I don't want to even try that. Plus she kind of cheated on me on one of those things. 
I don't believe we can make it if she goes. And she's trying really hard to go.

I'm scared I might even cheat on her. I feel so pathetic for what I've become. You couldn't tell if you met me, I have a lot of things ""going on"" for me, but I just feel like a fuck up. I never ended a relationship. I think that maybe I can make these thoughts go away by ending the worries once and for all. And go to regret mode? 
Basicly I started with her 2 months after we ended it with my ex gf of 4 years, so I haven't really been single or really by myself since I was 18, 19? 

I need some advice reddit, maybe some tough love. I feel like a spoiled brat that has someone who likes him but he is still a little man, scared by his own thoughts of her infidelity (the second time would hurt much much more)
and that I might even cheat on her. 

Ps: this sentence is what scares me: the best predictor of future behavior is past behaviour. 

How to cope with my thoughts and the situation? If someone has been in a similair situation, please, talk to me.

tl;dr my gf ""kind"" of cheated on our very beggining, now that I went to a student exchange for 5 months, 2 months in and I'm starting to have trouble coping with the past and what might happen again. "

I called my friend who worked at the record company in LA (intern unpaid) and is now a power broker and multimillionaire unlike me. I told him which girl, by far the hottest in the dorm back when we were there a few years earlier, and he knew he had to do right by me and get me tickets. I made a fake request from the college paper and got a press comp pair. 

Off we went. I guess the show was good but I kind of was excited about this girl and how much time my hands were spending fairly deep in her pants and under her shirt. If people saw me do all that, I didn't notice. 

He didn't do an encore - and I was glad. It was Devils night and I thought getting out of Detroit before midnight was a good idea. Plus, I had other business to attend to. 

Wasn't sure we'd make it back to 2a without getting busy on the car but that didn't seem as much fun as a bed so I eased up a bit and we got to her place. Everything was moving along as planned when she stopped. I can't do this, she said. Wow, I thought, you seemed like you could do this a minute ago. She said, I can't do this.... Here. I followed her eyes to a black and white 8x10 of her and her out of town boyfriend. I could see the issue. I took the picture off the hook and laid it down in the kitchen. 

Some 20+ years later that same picture popped up in Facebook feed. I had friended tons of people as I got started with the new network without paying that much attention to who they were. And her last name changed. Her friends were commenting about how they remember the couple back then, so young. I thought, she married that guy and had a bunch of kids with him. She still looked great. I don't suppose she mentioned the prince concert? 

Tonight she posted about a different concert she went to. Lots of friends wrote in about prince too. I just said Detroit and she liked it 15 seconds later.

I just had a meeting with the president of our company in regards to being hired from my full-time intern position, to an employee (I've been with the company for 6 months). I work for a record label doing video production. There are only 3 of us in the department. We all contribute in a lot of different areas- filming, editing, graphics, etc.  I've been making $10/hr, 40 hr a week. 

I was offered to come on full time, with a salary bump from $10 to $12 an hour (about $80 more a week). I graduated from college last year, and am financially independent at this point. I feel like I've put in a lot of time/effort into getting this job offer, and am disappointed the salary bump didn't go up to $15/hr. 

When he brought up $12 an hour, I was honest with him what I was hoping for. He told me that this is the way the video department within the company has been run for a few years now, that the same people who went from interns got the same pay bump, and overall didn't seem too open to negotiations. 

I told him I would get back to him tomorrow.

I was thinking about saying something along the lines of ""I was really hoping for $15/hr based off how much work I do and how you've liked/used my work. Would you be able to come up to $13.50 (or whatever you want to say)? I really want to stay here but $12 is will make it tough""


I'm really in a bind, because I do love my job and the company is great- I just don't know if I can afford to feel undervalued.


Any advice or recommendations are welcome.

I'll be meeting with him again tomorrow.

So I am graduating in December. I send well over 250 applications for a summer internship, and I got an unpaid 6 week internship (not a scam, just a cheap start up) which I accepted as a back up, but still applied and searched every where else. 

So here is my dilemma. I have to take 5 courses in my final semester and meet the unit cap, so I can't take an elective I really really really want (FPGA design using VHDL. Probably my main career choice). However, I can take a summer class if I drop this internship, which will open my schedule up to take the FPGA course. However, I really want the experience for future job applications after graduation.

Should I drop it and take summer classes, and do a project over summer?

Should I take the unpaid 6 week internship (might be able to take a class second half of summer anyway)?

If I get offered a paid 10-12 week summer internship, should I 100% take it and sacrafice my FPGA elective? 

The professor already agreed to allow me to audit the lecture and lab.

How do we address them without losing our friends?,RussetWolf,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4fwupb/issues_with_my_gaming_group_how_do_we_address/,"My gaming group started the college town I attended. I met about half of them online and half through mutual friends. We played board games or D&amp;D-style games every weekend, my fiancée and I hosted. This went on for about a year (we played before for another year, but players came and went before this group solidified) with one incident - basically one of the guys' politics did not fit with those of the group and that led to a personal clash. We all met and talked it out, to hash out why everyone felt the way they did. Despite the awkwardness and general difficulty of the situation, we had promised to bring things up in the future if they bothered us, instead of letting the resentment build. In the end that wasn't enough for him and ultimately he left. 

(This post isn't about him, but it is important as about half of the new group came from that one.)

The group continued after that, but most of us finished school a few months later and we had to move away. My fiance and I ended up in the same town as one of those people, Alice, so we invited her and a new friend over for gaming on a regular basis. My fiancée invited an old friend who was now in the city, and Alice invited Beth - someone she had met through a friend and worked in the same building as, so they went out to lunch together daily. Connor, one of the guys from the old group, moved back to the college town and started commuting the hour once a month to join the games too. He had met Beth previously as well. So our group was a good size again.

It was very clear that Alice and Beth (and Connor when he was here) shared a friend group that the others didn't know. They often talked about what their friends were up to around the rest of us, in a way we couldn't participate in the conversation. Often these conversations took over the table and would prevent us from gaming. Alice, specifically, has a habit of interrupting everyone and anyone to share either a random video she found on her phone or a story that most of us don't know the people in. This got very annoying very quickly for the rest of us, as we were Sat, twiddling our thumbs or trying ineffectively to get their focus back in the game. Additionally, these meetings would go on for hours longer than planned, as Beth can't seem to take the hint that it's time to leave. 

We decided to take a break from gaming as the month of April was a busy one and we all could use the time elsewhere. My fiancée and I felt burned out at spending time with Alice and Beth, and I personally have felt a lot of relief in the few weeks without. At the same time, I still like gaming (not that we usually got much done).

In that month, a lot changed. The two other players both moved away. Beth moved back to the college town (she was here on an internship and is starting school again in the summer). Alice's pet died. Most complicatedly, Connor and Beth have started dating. 

So, we really like Connor. My fiancée and I really want to keep him as a friend. He used to stay overnight at our place when he came to visit, since it was convenient and he got to hang out with Alice and Beth more outside of gaming time. I like Alice a lot too, despite her interrupting and half-interest in the games. She's a lot better without Beth around. I never noticed this behaviour in the year or two she played with us and Connor in the college town. My fiancée feels neutral about her overall.

Beth is a different story. She exhibits a lot of traits that flip my fiancée's red flag sensors from previous friends and relationships. A lot of her behaviours are clear ways to get attention - I can't say if she does it consciously though. She has anxiety and PTSD from an abusive childhood. My fiancée has an anxiety disorder as well, and I've dated another person who had one too, and neither of them express their anxieties the same way Beth does. While I understand these things are different for everyone, her reactions are very much geared toward people noticing.

Earlier in April, she texted me and asked if we had time for 'a friend in crisis'. We were out grocery shopping, so I said we could meet the next morning. She said she couldn't wait that long, so I offered to meet her in a few hours after we shopped. She didn't respond until the next day with an apology for disappearing and saying she was fine now. I can only guess she found someone else to talk to, but the whole thing felt rather fishy. 

She seems like a wonderful person on paper, but something just doesn't sit right with us. I feel neutral on the side of somewhat sketchy, while my fiancée is explicitly not interested in maintain a friendship with Beth. We don't hate her, and we recognize we may be completely misjudging her just because we don't know her well. We wouldn't really mind if she kept coming to gaming events (though we'd prefer if she didn't).

The biggest trouble now though is that if Connor wants to come to town he'll want to do so with her, and they will both want to spend the night at our place. We have the space, but don't feel at all comfortable with her spending the night here. Mostly because just thinking about it is emotionally draining. 

So now that our month off is coming to a close, we want to address these issues with the group:

* General structure and frequency, given that many people moved - do we want to continue? 
* Keeping conversation inclusive and not interrupting others. 
* Staying focused on the game at hand. Some chatting is okay, but we want to game together, not be a social club.
* We don't want Beth staying with us overnight (but we also would like to avoid being mean/rude and want to keep Connor as a friend).

Does anyone have suggestions on how to broach these topics? We've considered bringing the first set of points either online in our group chat or in our first  meeting. We're worried people will clam up though in person (Alice basically melted at the last group confrontation we had). 

The Beth issue is a bigger one and we're not sure how to even approach it. Do we talk to Connor or Alice (but that puts them in a shit situation)? Do we talk directly to Beth (what do we even say)? Do we just state we won't have anyone stay over any more (they'll be curious about why)?

Any insight is appreciated!

**tl;dr:** Our gaming group includes a bunch of people who share a friend group and talk about it to the exclusion of other people present. Alice interrupts a lot. Beth has sketchy behavior that makes us not really like her. Connor is now dating Beth and we don't know how to keep him in our lives without her. How do we talk to everyone about these issues without being mean/rude?"
4fwxkv,17,2016-04-22,"Should we formally stop referring to individuals as ""Creatures"" as a fan-base?",ShadrakC,TheCreatures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/4fwxkv/should_we_formally_stop_referring_to_individuals/,"I want to preface this with I don't want to start any sort of drama or poke the embers and that I love the creatures as a whole whatever form they may take. For a long time now, maybe a year or two, long time fans have been noticing a change within the creatures but its a change that's never been formally addressed 100%. I think this stems from the fact that most people knew ""The Creatures"" from before they were a formal business and each maintained an individual channel. This allowed you to follow a single person or the group depending on what your preferred type of content was and, more importantly, it also allowed you to gradually get to know the sense of humor of each member. In this sense I think we're spoiled as a fan-base. I love Funhaus, I have since they were Inside Gaming, and I enjoy AH content from time to time and I've realized that their fan-bases never really got to just focus on one member of the group. Sure Gavin has Slo Mo guys and some FH guys are making independent channels but they all started as a company before they were individual content creators. 

This brings me to the main point of my question. With the introduction of the interns, specifically Joe and Spencer, they were just thrown on camera in a sense, there was no build up. At any other group gaming channel this wouldn't be a problem. On the Funhaus channel they introduced Elyse almost out of the blue and most people took to her pretty fast as just another member of the group. I think that the original term ""creature"" when pertaining to an individual doesn't really fit the group anymore. The original use of the term was to refer to a group of crazy guys who were just having fun with their videos but the term has been kind of twisted to refer to the original individuals who had successful independent channels or that worked on machinimas with the group back in the day. This creates sort of an ""othering"" effect with the interns and they're seen as foreign to the group rather than just an interesting new member. The group itself can call themselves whatever they want but i think that, at least for the fans, dividing ""The Creatures"" up into creatures and interns is a toxic way to look at it when they all just want to have fun and make great content together. The pressure put on them by the fan-base certainly doesn't help in that respect. I love ""The Creatures"" but i personally feel like we should either call everyone in the group a creature or call no one in the group a creature since it creates a toxic divide, at least in my opinion. 

Hopefully we can all keep this civil because I'd love to hear everyone else's opinions

tl;dr - Making the title of creature such an exclusive honor creates a potentially problematic divide when viewed from the perspective of fans "

I've never thought that I was ""above"" the system, but now it feels like I'm learning nothing useful. This is interesting because I have industry experience, so I know what it's all being taught for.

I'm upset because I want to leave the opportunity for grad school open (with my GPA my school will just let me do grad school as an extra year, no GRE or application) but I don't know if this (lack of drive in academics) is a temporary thing or not. A lot of engineers have told me it means that it's my time to get out of school and jump into industry. 

At the same time, I'm working on proof of concept for a personal software project (not a mobile app..lol) that is looking to be very promising...so much so that I've thought about dropping a couple of my classes to work on it since I don't want to wholly drop out of school. I actually think that my partners and I can turn this into a lucrative product. However, it's my first venture and I've never taken a risk like this. So my thoughts are oscillating between concentrating on enjoying school and some activities on the side, or doing OK in school, very few activities, and going all in for my startup. I've been trying to do everything but I realize for my venture to succeed I need to put in more quality work, which naturally means more time. I understand that probability of failure is extremely high so I'm prepared for that.

All I want to do is read books that sound interesting to me, go explore new places in nature, and travel. I'm just really bored with the school routine. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? What should I do about my startup? 

I'm thinking that if I'm sick of school as a 3rd year, grad school is probably a dumb idea...but then in my head I tell myself ""it's only one more year..""

Any input appreciated!"

Specs -
i5-6200u
8gb ram
256gb ssd
FHD Screen 
Win 7 /Win 10 Pro 

I'm asking here because before my friend also did but his was on a Yoga, but I decided to go for a Carbon since it was the only model my Computer store had (Literally bought it on a whim) so now I'm debating if I should keep it. Reasoning is I was wishy washy between this one and the T460s ~_~ 

My usage would be mainly - College and my internship at the campus library. 

College as in taking notes, writing papers, the occasional PS edit, watching videos, playing Gameboy advance games, and skyping. 

I haven't really researched much but my only problem is I'm worried the i6200u isn't future proof since it was the lowest in the configuration but I also heard an i7 is a battery killer so I'm torn. 

Sorry not sure how the format is here and instead of my jumble text what I want to know 
Half of me feels like this is perfect while the other half feels like its lacking in power to last long. 

The only gaming I'll do in this would be VBA / NDA emulators 
Graphics would be just simple PS 
No video editing or legit gaming. 

Is this x1 carbon going to last me 3 years? 
Will the battery life be better then my old laptop (old ideapad from 2010 that had like 8 hrs battery life)
Is it durable like the heavier thinkpads (I mean is it clumsy proof since I consider myself clumsy)
Should I buy Lenovo Warranty? If yes which one?
Is FHD screen good enough? I heard Lenovo always give poor screens so I was wondering if it did for the carbon as well. 

Lastly how does it compared to a T460s ? 

I think that's it I mean its almost 12 am and I'm just here staring at this unopened laptop  ~_~ dying to replace my old one AND I just want to be sure this is the one :D

EDIT: I went and scoured the thinkpad / Lenovo reddit and found all the information in regards in comparing this laptop to the T460S, thanks guys and yeah I wanted this or the T460s for the build quality, the lightness, the battery life as well. (Was lugging a 6 lb wonder for the longest time).

My mic does not work in Windows 10 Pro. My computer recognises the mic, and even states that there is nothing wrong with it, and it should work. However, when I start talking in teampseak for example, it only produces a cracking sound. I have tried multiple headsets, ears with mics, and with differents jacks and usb connectors. It seems to be some sort of driver/software issue.

I have tried a lot of stuff already. I already tried possibly all the top issue/forum posts results in google/youtube.

I have updated my drivers from Realtek HD and High definition audio in Device Manager. I have disabled one of the two and vice versa. I basically played around those two, with no success.

I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice.  I am doing an internship at a company in their IT department.  I have been tasked with fixing bugs in an online dashboard that they have developed for one of their clients. I have tried several different things and feel very confused at the moment. Anyhoo, here are the details:

It is a dashboard that is suppose to run 24/7 displaying progress reports for shifts,  on the dashboard there is a dropdownbox, where it displays the current shift and options for previous shifts that the user can choose from,  input is not required from the user (but is an option), the dashboard ""plays"" through different departments with appropriate reports.  One of the requirements is that this dropdownlist and accompanying data must switch over to the next shift, x amount of minutes before the next shift starts (depending on the department).  

I have looked through the code and tried to figure out as much as possible, and noticed that it generates a schedule from a webservice, however, this schedule only includes the latest shift and previous shifts, I am thinking that it needs to also supply details of the next shift, so there is something to compare the current time to in order to ""tell"" the site to switch over to the next shift.  Can anyone tell me if this sounds correct and if so, does anyone have an idea of how to implement this?

Thanks in advance!"

4fymua,158,2016-04-22,From hopeless to happy: my journey of 6 years (long),Hurtmemaster,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4fymua/from_hopeless_to_happy_my_journey_of_6_years_long/,"This story, like many similar stories, begins at the lowest point of my life. I was 26 years old, jobless and living in my mom’s basement, where I played World of Warcraft all night long and slept all day. I didn’t really care for myself, I was depressed, I didn’t know what to do with my life and most of the time, I was too scared to even think about my future.

Back then, I didn’t even realize that I had hit rock bottom. I guess it’s hard to understand how low you are when you have never even seen the world up there. I also did not believe that my failure to attract women had anything to do with my current situation. I was your typical nice guy. I thought the whole world was really superficial. And guys who go to the gym or dress nice are douchebags who just do so because they want to impress other people. I thought I deserved a beautiful girlfriend just because I had some manners and a sense of humor, and that girls want to be put on a pedestal and treated like princesses, and I was the one who would give them exactly that.

I also grew up in the genuine believe that I was unattractive. I’m only 5’6 and some people in school nicknamed me “the rat” because I had crooked, yellow teeth, a dark fuzz above my upper lip and acne to the point where it would leave little round scars on my face. During my time of self-improvement, I eventually got around to fix most of those things. But even about 3 years ago, I was still so full of doubt that I posted a picture of myself to r/amiugly. And even though I got mostly positive feedback, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that every rejection and every failure in my life was still connected to my shitty physical appearance.

When I accepted an internship in Zurich and consequently moved to Switzerland, I came to a point where I realized how bad I was with other people. I would constantly fight with my roommates, lose arguments at work and ruin my chances with any girl I ran into. I became so frustrated that I started to look into PUA and eventually found this subreddit.

Then I read “Models” by Mark Manson, as recommended by you guys. I think I read it three times in total. I started following his advice about fixing your life, working out, dressing better, establishing personal boundaries, and of course talking to girls. What followed was a really miserable time full of trying and failing, errors, rejection and rethinking – or, as Mark calls it, the pain period. It took me months and years of hard work to see an improvement. Lots of times I thought that none of this works at all, that its all bullshit and that I’m beyond hope. There was one night in a club where I got rejected about 30 times in a row. I did the last few approaches with tears in my eyes. I cringe so hard thinking about it, but it was an important lesson. Because the next day, I was still there. It showed me that even if girls are mean to me and my ego is crushed, nothing really happens. You get a fresh chance every day. That was not the end of it of course, as I was suffering a lot during this time. I built my whole confidence on the amount of success I had. One in a hundred times I would score and feel like the king of the world, just to fall off my throne and be miserable the next night when one girl did not smile back at me.

I cannot remember the exact moment when it started to get better. I don’t think there ever was one. The important thing was trying. Over time, I did a lot of self-reflecting  and I learned two really important things: confidence does not come from being perfect, but from accepting your flaws. I’m still a nerd at heart, and I always will be. I will still get a red face when I get embarrassed sometimes, and that’s ok. Because I’m doing what I can to improve, and some things I simply cannot change.

The other big discovery was the concept of social skills. It took me way too long to realize that this was a thing. I always believed that there are just some people who are born to be awkward, and that I was one of them, that I had to use tricks invented by the pua-community to appear normal. It never occurred to me that being social around adults was something that could be learned. I’m still amazed how I did not see the simplicity of it for all those years. The more you do something, the better you become at it. I knew it was true for videogames. But somehow I thought talking to girls was an exception.

If I ever had such a thing as a breakthrough, it was when I discovered how much I loved electronic music and dancing. I think this is my biggest strength nowadays. I’m not even cold-approaching anymore, because most of the time, I just don’t have to. I went out so much, I’m not even really thinking about the approach itself anymore, because it all comes naturally. For example when I’m asking someone for a lighter, I may get into a conversation. But the point is, I really needed a lighter, it was not some kind of trick to get someone’s attention. My best experiences come from nights where I’m actively ignoring girls. I really try to focus on enjoying the music, my friends and smiling. What happens is that some girls will eventually try to get my attention. Last weekend for example I went clubbing in Berlin, and this girl would make such intense eye contact with me to the point that she would eventually wave me over. I strongly believe this happens because girls can see how much fun I’m having at that I’m really not on the hunt at all. The conversations that follow run smoothly most of the time. I’m not a high-energy guy while talking, but I can keep it up and I have some experience from earlier days when I actively went sarging.

There were two more things that helped me improve. Firstly, I took all my savings and made a trip around the world. Having to organize such a trip by myself was huge, and I would have to talk to a lot of strangers. I developed a shitload of social skills during that time and it turned out to be the best year of my life with a lot of crazy experiences, like getting a handjob from a Columbian girl with underdeveloped fingers in a park in Medellin, or searching for toilet paper at night with a Swedish flight attendant in one of the worst neighborhoods in panama city. But those are different storys. The second thing that helped me improve were drugs.

When I was in Mexico, I met a wealthy Asian guy who let me stay in his apartment right next to all the hip clubs. This dude ordered drugs like pizza. He had guy from one of the cartels who would just come by and drop bags on the table. I never paid a cent for anything. But I tried everything. Of course a lot of people will say that coke is not the way to gain confidence, because its not real and it can fuck up your life for good. Those people are totally right and I do not recommend trying it, especially if you don’t have your life in check. But what it did for me was the following: it showed me what confidence can achieve and what things are possible when you have it. For example, my whole life I was never able to touch anyone during conversations, not even a tap on the shoulder after telling a joke or something. But on mdma or ecstasy, I was hugging strangers because we both enjoyed the music so much. And after I got down, I realized touching other people is not that hard. So I started doing it when I was sober. And I feel like it helped me immensely. Same when I was high on cocaine and feeling like I was a boss and telling a stupid story about my dungeons and dragons group to a girl at a club – and she was actually listening and laughing. All just because I was really confident while telling it. It showed me what confidence can achieve, so I started to talk about things just because I found them interesting, and not because I thought that’s what the other person wants to hear. At the end of my time in Mexico, after that guy had left (I literally had to carry him to his taxi), I gave away drugs worth hundreds of dollars for free because I couldn’t take them with me on the plane. 

I’m not trying to come off as a badass or master or that I have it all figured out now, because that’s definitely not true. But I’m 32 now, probably heading into a relationship and at a point where I’m okay with myself and proud of the transformation that I have made. Thank you guys for that. Even though I don’t agree 100% with the stuff that’s taught here, it helped a lot. Maybe I can even motivate some people who are at the start of their journey to keep going. No matter how lost you think you are, there is hope.

I was going to take a class but after reading more about it, summer classes are terrible, so that didn't seem like a good idea, since this class would already be pretty terrible normally.


So I have nothing to do. I'm majoring in CS so I'm probably gonna try to learn some iOS development and python and stuff. But even that feels like...fuck, why does everything have to have strings attached. If I don't spend my summers *coding*, my degree doesn't mean shit, eh?


And of course my parents want me to cure cancer and help the elderly and study abroad and have a 4.0 so this'll be a good time. Last summer I got a job delivering pizza, and I loved it, and I thought my parents would be satisfied with that, since they'd been wanting me to get a job for a while. But, no, fucking suddenly that's not enough. God forbid doing something easy and getting money, no you have to do research with one of your professors or something.

4fzjyd,1469,2016-04-22,"In 4 years, I've gone from super liberal to conservative. When Trump first announced his run, I mocked him. Now I support him. And I finally worked out why. (Sorry long post)",Feddw_Cymro,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4fzjyd/in_4_years_ive_gone_from_super_liberal_to/,"I'm 26. Super liberal in high school and college, now after doing time in the military and spending years working, and currently holding a job where my annual take home is $42k, I've become fairly conservative. I haven't gotten any wealth that I feel the need to protect.

Why have I moved right? Because I experienced life, and I observed the lives of people I know who are still liberals. While I was working my ass off in college and in the NG, my peers were partying and ""protesting"" whatever current cause was going around campus, be it KONY2012, gay whatever, or other shit like that. I went to college with career orientated goals in mind. I studied Criminal Justice and Political Science with a Pre-Law focus. My peers studied shit like Communications, Women's Studies, Art, or just general Liberal Arts, because they were easy and it let them skip class and party.

I networked the fuck out of myself and lined up a job before I graduated college. It was a shitty consulting job that paid barely above minimum wage, but it was a job. My peers graduated, partied, then moved home and bummed off their parents for 12+ months while applying to only a select few jobs and bitching about how hard it is to get a job on Facebook.

After working a shit job for 16 months, and applying to dozens of positions, I finally got a position as a law enforcement officer for the state. It required me to move across the state within 8 days on my own dime. But it was better pay, and great benefits, so I did it. I ate ramen for a few weeks afterwards, but I had a good job. In that job, I put myself out there, I regularly volunteered for overtime and shitty jobs like hospital watches and paperwork, I networked everyone I met. I did that for 7 months, and was offered a position on the other side of the state with a federal task force. Pay was 20% more, and I have the opportunity to work alongside federal agents and potentially get a federal job in the future.

While I did that, my peers that I went to school with continued bumming off their parents and working jobs at fast food places, Starbucks, or running Tumblr blogs complaining about how its so hard for them to get a good job. They said ""I have a college degree why will no one hire me"". They applied for their dream jobs and nothing else, expecting it to be handed to them. In the past year they've come out strong for Bernie, because they demand a higher wage, healthcare, etc, without actually working or putting anything in towards it. They're so entitled they refuse to put down their Macs their daddy bought them that they use to blog on to recognize that maybe they should come up with a plan to succeed and meet their goals.

It has nothing to do with conservatives being wealthy people wanting to protect their wealth, like the left says. Like what I used to believe. It's conservatives actually understanding, and appreciating, the value of hard work. How good it feels to work your ass off and finally get what you've been working towards. I've met some of my major career goals. It required me moving across the state 3 times, working 60-70 weeks for weeks on end, all while dealing with a divorce, but I did it and I feel great for it.

I was having a drink the other night with an old friend from high school and college. He barely scrapped by with a political science degree with something like a 2.3 GPA because all he did was skip class and smoke weed. He still does. He works as a cashier at a Co-Op and goes on and on about $15/hr minimum wage and Bernie. He wants to be environmental policy analyst. He's 25 and lives with his parents. I asked why he doesn't apply for some office assistant jobs, or go intern with policy groups or the government. I even offered to put him in touch with some people. The response was ""well I shouldn't have to, I have a degree"", and then launched in to a lecture about how the corporations are greedy and oppressing people. He and I came from similar backgrounds, went to the same high school, the same college, and came out with similar degrees. Yet he makes half what I do, doesn't have any benefits, and spends most of his money buying weed. He has no interest in working towards what he wants, he just wants it to be handed to him.

Instead of sharing ""Feel the Bern"" memes on Facebook, I'm going in to work saying ""what can I do to improve my work today"", and ""what can I do that will make me look desirable in the future"". That's why I've got a stable job with decent pay and great benefits, and why I'll be buying my own house in a few months. Because instead of spending my years bumming around waiting for someone to hand me opportunities, and reached out and grabbed them.

That's why I've become more conservative, and why I'm voting for Trump. Because the entitlement shown by my generation disgusts me, and unless they've given a hard wake up call this country is fucked."

Low gpa with interesting research!,brianpark33,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4fzrjf/suggestions_of_what_path_to_go_low_gpa_with/,"Hey guys! Its my first time posting but a long time lurker! I hope you guys read this and give me any advice, or opinion about my situation! I am getting ready to finish my sophomore this year (ChemE Maj). I have done great freshmen year (gpa=3.57)! But with summer and first semester of sophomore year, I fell into a lazyness slump. Ended up getting around 1.5 the first semester which made my overall gpa 2.77. I have been trying to work harder second semester but thermo, fluid flow, and calc3 are not easy classes to get As.. I am definitely clawing my eyes and brains out for this mistake. But I am hopeful in other areas. I have been working on a research with a prof who has not gotten a tenure contract yet (he will be evaluated in two years when i graduate with bachelors!). I have not published any papers yet but i have a project that I am now going to work on and this project is contracted with an army. My prof said that this work will be so good since army is showing interest in it that i will be able to publish multiple papers and get into phd and finish it in two years if I work hard. My prof is really good at motivating students and I do not know if this work will really bring me that dream. I am hoping that he will get a tenure and he will pick me to work with him for my phd and have my life planned out but with my current gpa and situation, i don't know if this is good idea to have myself go to this path. I have thought about getting an internship in summer of junior year if this project doesn't bring much hope (i know it will be hard due to my gpa). Or just go travel and try start up business lol. I know I still have some time to bring my gpa up but i doubt that i can bring it up really high since ChemE major with Bio concentration is not easy.. Any advices or opinions about this proj with an army or prof or anything?? Thanks!!! "
4fzzmr,0,2016-04-22,Underpaid Millennial -- Need Lots of Financial Advice,springgtimee,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4fzzmr/underpaid_millennial_need_lots_of_financial_advice/,"Right now my fiance and I are moving from my parent's house to a master bedroom in a shared home with some people our age (mid-20s) for $500 a month split between us per month -- a serious steal for being within public transport distance to NYC.

We just graduated college in May and are settling into our new jobs that we got in January.

I have two part-time jobs doing video production &amp; social media management that pay about $500-$600 a week. I work 40-50 hours per week. My fiance does similar work and does manual labor on his days off. His income isn't as steady, but he pulls in $300-$500 per week.

Combined, we're probably making about $40,000 a year (I think? I'm terrible at math and I haven't sat down and really looked at the  numbers yet -- planning on it this week)

We work every weekday and most Saturdays, so we're busting ass all the time. The problem is that people don't want to pay us what we're worth because we're young, it seems. I did 6 unpaid internships in school, one of them at a major film production studio in LA so I have tons of professional experience.

I signed on to one of my jobs for $11 an hour as a social media assistant with a few job duties-- turns out, this woman is incompetent and I'm literally running her business for no extra pay! I guess it's good experience, but I don't know how on earth I'm ever supposed to start a life working this hard and earning so little money -- I'm making a fast-food salary running an advertising business... 

Once she realized how much I was capable of, she dumped all of her responsibilities on me. I plan on leaving when my 4-month contract is up in May. I might start making less money then, because I want to teach yoga 3 days a week -- which I have a certification for on top of my college degree, because it's something that I'm passionate about.

When I think about all the things I want in the next ten years -- a small wedding, a starter home, a child -- it makes NO financial sense with the wages that my fiancé and I make doing jobs that require very special skills, like advanced editing software and everything we learned in college at top programs.

I totaled my car a few months ago and I was lucky that my parents had an extra (my sister is away at college) but when she gets back next year, she needs the car back. I have to buy a car this year and my dad is seriously pushing for me to buy an $18,000-$25,000 certified pre-owned or a new car when I just want to buy a $5,000 used car in cash and not have to worry about making car payments (though he offered to cosign which is cool). I'm still trying to decide what to do about that situation.

I don't live any kind of lavish lifestyle. I get drinks with friends once a week ($15 total), travel once a month on a camping roadtrip for a weekend ($50-80), and eat out at a diner with my fiance once or twice a week ($20-40), buy a handle of vodka twice a month to keep in the house ($30 each time), and we buy weed once a week ($20).

Otherwise, my day to day looks like this:

I go to work, spend $5-9 on lunch, come home, go for a run or do yoga in my room (can't afford/don't want a gym membership), smoke a hit of pot, make dinner (simple, cheap meal -- usually stir fry, a salad with tuna, or an omelet), then my boyfriend and I watch Netflix and have 1 or 2 vodka-seltzer drinks then pass out. 

Rinse and repeat.

On weekends sometimes we'll treat ourselves. We spend anywhere from $40-200 regularly on weekends. This weekend we got new tattoos (obviously not necessary, but it's a treat) and spent $160 including the tip.

I don't get haircuts and I cut his hair. I stopped wearing makeup so I didn't have to pay for it, I even stopped shampooing everyday to save on that.

I know the first piece of advice will be ""stop spending money on drugs and alcohol"" but it's only $200 a month, which isn't a tremendous amount."

So I offered to let them move about an hour away with us and move to a bigger place this summer when the lease is up. This was a HUGE mistake.

I have never borrowed money from her, BUT she has borrowed about $300 from me in 3 months. She makes more money than my fiance and I every month on SS.

It's been bad, but today is the worst. I'm shaking and crying as i trpe. I can hear her talking to my grandmother on the phone about how horrible I am (she's the reason her side of the family wants nothing to do with me, wont even come to my wedding) and she was talking about OD'ing on meds b/c ' i wouldnt  care and maybe i'd feel guilty for it.' Im scared and dont know what to do anymore. She burned all her bridges and has no where to move to but us. What can I do? I love m brother to death but I cant do this.

Let me start off and apoligize if i sound arrogant or spoiled. Anyways how is it possible that I live in the silicon valley, and I am completely unable to get an internship. Not to sound conceited, but I go to a decent school, and am the top in nearly all my classes. I applied to over 150, got a few( like barely any) interviews and then all those turned into nothing. Ive been to so many career fairs, and those are barely any better than online applications now, because half of them just give you information on how to apply online. 

I understand that it can be my fault for a lot of it, and I have been working on improvement, but so many companies are looking for like experts for an intern. One of my interviews was entirely about Java when it wasn't even listed on my resume.

I'm fed up with the process, and how a basic internship requires expertise in areas.

Anyways, enough said, if anyone made it this far down, is there anything I can do at this point to still get an internship? "

4g18sj,2,2016-04-22,My farewell to weed.,StiffWaffle,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4g18sj/my_farewell_to_weed/,"Hey guys, so I've known that I have had a problem with my smoking habits for a long time now and I'm sick of trying to coax myself into quitting and making up excuses or saying that I'm just going to ""cut down"" on smoking. The truth is, there's no such thing as ""cutting down"" you're either currently using, or you aren't and that's it. Internally I've been trying to rationalize not quitting entirely but it's come to the time where I now believe and know that if I'm going to quit then I have to do it all the way, no more excuses. So, I've called my friend to come and pick up all of my paraphernalia and I want to make my first true effort into quitting smoking by subbing here and sharing my experiences with weed.


I can vividly remember my first day smoking weed for the first time the summer of 8th grade out of a powerade bottle with some tinfoil and a straw in my friends poolside bathroom and that was almost 6-7 years ago now since I'm currently a 2nd year in college. I'll never forget the laughs, the mishaps, the adventures, the friendships, the seshes, the calm, the high, or the smell but I know in the end that this will be worthwhile because while weed had it's fun times it caused way more situations in which it led me astray in my life or placed me in unfavorable situations.


Here's some examples of some shitty situations that weed has gotten me into for your guys' enjoyment and for me to see what weed has gotten me into in text:

1st. I had to go through therapy after my father passed away my sophomore year of high school, I decided that it'd be a good idea to smoke with my friends a few hours before my therapy session, this was a horrible idea and I immediately became full of anxiety knowing how disappointed my counselor would have been with my decision, the hour that I spent in her office was passing by at a snails pace and I could no longer hold in my anxiety eventually causing me to tell her that I was high. She was definitely disappointed and I felt like total shit.


2nd. Before I turned 18 some kids in my neighborhood and I thought that it would be a good idea to break into one of the abandoned houses IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I LIVED in. Long story short, the cops came with they guns pointed at us, most of the kids I went with were crying but I was so high that all I could do in the police car as my hands were cuffed was laugh thinking that my parents wouldn't mind because it's not like I was going to actually get charged. That was a pretty defining moment in my life where my entire family had to find out that I was still smoking weed when they explicitly told me to stop eventually causing my sister to start to drug test me weekly. I would then continue to smoke once a week the day after I'd get tested because I knew I'd be clear by the next time I got tested.

3rd and most recently, I had just picked up bud from one of my friends and it was like some pretty top-notch stuff so I thought it'd be a good idea to share a picture of it with the rest of my friends on groupme, but this was right after I had taken a few hits from my bong so I ended up accidentally posting it in the groupme for the internship that I am going to be part of in the Fall. This was probably one of the biggest fuck ups this whole semester and I went into panic mode expecting the worst to happen, luckily the person in charge understood my situation having had his own experiences when he was in college he ended up facetiming me a few days later and telling me that I should just quit smoking because he's been in the same spot I was before and understands that once it becomes a problem it's a bad one.

Along with these situations I know for a fact that weed has just been making me an all around more paranoid and anxious person if I'm not in the right mindset when I'm high. I'm also pretty sure that weed was making me hallucinate occasionally feeling as though I'm being watched by something/things that aren't there so that definitely isn't something that's a positive either.

Hopefully now that I've gotten all of this out in writing I can have something to look back at and see exactly why I want to quit and strengthen my resolve.

Recently I've been trying to work on practicing mindfulness and meditation which have been helping me tremendously with my self-consciousnesses and anxiety. I hope to continue using these tools to become more aware of my thought patterns, cravings, and body eventually hoping to become the person that I know that I can be.

I know from this post I probably seem like a pretty stupid kid, but realistically I feel as though I'm a pretty smart kid, especially for being able to get to where I am today while also smoking pretty often, we all have our vices this just happens to be mine.

Thank you for reading this if you did, and good bye Mary Jane it's been real. "

4g1iib,5,2016-04-22,Depressed Wife?,BlackShabbos,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4g1iib/depressed_wife/,"Hello all. This is a means of asking for perspective, advice, and venting my feelings. If this is the wrong place to do so, I sincerely apologize. 

I've known my wife for almost four years, while we've been married for almost three. I met her a few months after she ended an abusive relationship of six years. We met by coincidence between a mutual friend and hit it off immediately. I could go into the practically movie-like romance that blossomed, but I'll hold off on that for now.

My wife has a history with psychiatric services. After she moved in with her abusive ex, she developed anxiety problems and some symptoms of depression. She saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed Xanax. The Xanax worked, but life circumstances prevented her from keeping up with her doctor. This was shortly after we met. She hasn't been medicated since then (mid-2012).

Throughout our relationship there have been times where she feels a strong sense of emptiness and numbness. She becomes distant affectionately and emotionally. These spells seemed unprompted and tended to last for one to three days.

A new spell started last week and hasn't let up for the longest period thus far. She feels numb, empty, rarely laughs, and doesn't want the ""feeling"" of being in a romantic relationship. She says she still loves me as a friend, but the romantic love she felt before is now gone. For the record, she doesn't want romance or sexual attraction with anyone or towards anyone at all. She just wants to be alone.

I'm devastated. The center of my universe has vanished. The person who I could spend hours cuddling with in bed can now barely hug me for a few moments. Just two weeks ago we were in what seemed like the best period of our relationship so far. She was eager to see me, her sex drive was higher than usual, and she was happy to finally have a job. Now, it's gone. She prefers to sleep in a separate bed, is indifferent towards seeing me, and cautiously optimistic about her job. We did try to make love at her insistence, but afterwards she said she ""felt nothing"" and, while usually very easy to bring to climax, was unable to reach climax at all. 

There are a few elements I should mention:

First, although my wife feels emotionally numb, she hasn't really changed in mood otherwise. She's not mean or outwardly sad. There's a slight somberness to her demeanor and she does get sad when she sees how this is impacting me. Her friends have noticed her somber demeanor, but she hasn't opened up to them about what's going on. Otherwise, for all intents and purposes she's 100% functional and about 80% normal mood-wise. No mood swings, lashing out, thoughts of self-harm, lack of motivation, hopelessness, etc etc. (As a side note, the latter characteristics seem to come around about occasionally when she had these spells in the past).

Second, my wife recently started working. She graduated from university last winter but struggled to find work. She finally got an unpaid internship at the beginning of March. She would be at the internship for about 30 hours a week. Just this week they hired her as an employee with pay. She's now working 40 hours a week. Her responsibilities have increased, sleep schedule has been altered, and is now investing more effort into her job. She does seem a little overwhelmed by it, which is unusual compared to how well she suffered the living hell that classes at university put her through.

Third, my wife ended her period early this week. She is on birth control. For the first time, she decided to continue taking the birth control pills while menstruating (usually she would switch to the placebos until her bleeding stopped). I don't know if that would cause mood changes? I'll try and find out the name of her birth control and look up side effects.

Fourth, it does seem like there is a family history of mental problems. My wife has remarked that her mother has some mental instability, but I'm unclear on the specifics. My wife did grow up under rather difficult circumstances. She had a ""traditional Chinese"" upbringing, with a father who was emotionally distant and heavy with physical punishment. Her parents have been loveless for many years, and they're only married in the legal sense. She's forgiven her father and has a better relationship with him now, but the past may have left emotional scars.

Fifth, my wife hasn't been single for more than a few months at a time since she was a teenager. It could be said that she still needs to ""find herself"" (her words as well), and she may still have unresolved baggage from her six-year relationship with her abusive ex. The plus-side is that she has experienced some degree of healing and improvement with me, and she swears up and down that I'm perfect in every imaginable way (I respectfully disagree, of course).

Sixth, my wife IS seeking professional help, but it's difficult to come across. She's tried infrequently in the past to get an appointment with a psychiatrist who can prescribe her medication. She tried seeking help from the walk-in doctor's office, but they've given her the run-around with social workers who can't prescribe anything (and of course she only finds this out too late). She DOES want medication to take so she can get rid of the feeling of emptiness she's currently experiencing. However, psychiatrists in our area aren't taking new patients, and currently the only appointment she could find is six weeks from now (not unusual, but difficult since I would obviously prefer it much sooner). She's not optimistic that medication would restore her feelings of romance for me.

Seventh, there are two instances where I believe I gravely failed my wife. The first instance was when she was negotiating her hourly wage at the job she's now working at. She was initially offered a paying position at another company. Her boss at her unpaid internship found out that he might lose her and scrambled to offer her a paying position. She initially requested a specific wage from him. I was disappointed with her low offer when she told me, as she was in a strategically powerful position and could've asked for more. I strongly, but civilly (with no swearing and taking extra care not to insult or degrade her), expressed my disappointment and urged her to ask a higher wage. She did and he accepted it, but my pressure really saddened her in spite of my best efforts.

The next instance was last week. She had to leave the office early to go to an appointment. She thought she was running late and couldn't endure a lengthy public transport trip, but a co-worker kindly offered to give her a lift. Unfortunately, the both of them forgot to notify their boss. Their boss ended up calling both of their cell phones to ask what where they went, and was noticeably agitated. Then, it turned out that my wife was an hour early for the appointment. When I found out, I was both annoyed and worried that she may have jeopardized her reputation with her boss (as this was her last week as an unpaid intern with the assurance that she would be paid from the next week, onward). Again, I expressed my disappointment, anxiety, and some frustration in the most civil way I could (no swearing, insults, degradation, etc). Unfortunately, the weight of my words still crushed her instead of cautioned her. That, I believe, was the beginning of the current spell of depression that she's going through. While she would still be open to physical affection for a few days after this, there was a noticeable change in her demeanor towards me.

This message is quite along already, so I'll try to wrap things up. I'm trying my very best to accommodate her trial and be as supportive as possible. At first, I was hurt, confused, and bitter, which I know only made things worse. I think if I functioned in a friendly manner and treated her normally then she wouldn't have experienced further alienation. For now, I'm trying to get her to focus on filling that emptiness she's experiencing with no strings attached to our relationship.

I wanted to ask you all if these characteristics are common for depression (or any other mental ailment), and if I can have a shred of optimism that our romance can survive this trial.

Thank you for your time."

4g1mjw,0,2016-04-22,[Discussion] Microsoft should spend some time taking a look at legacy code.,ProdoxGT,Windows10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4g1mjw/discussion_microsoft_should_spend_some_time/,"This isn't the most practical thing to do, but I think it has its benefits of at least discussing and considering the matter.

I feel that one of the primary reasons migrating the control panel to settings is taking so long is due to the mess of legacy code from everything being slapped on over the years. So going back and rewriting everything would probably help a lot with efficiency of both the OS and adding new features.

I am aware how big an undertaking this is (and how I'm glossing over some (a monstrous amount) of technicalities preventing something like this so much so its not too realistic) but just taking a separate team and having them fix it, and not new interns mind you, but people with a real good understanding with this from working on it for a while.

It provides an opportunity to clean up Windows, making new features easier, deprecating stuff that might be behind the hood but with no meaningful way to interact with anymore, and if you rewrite code...

you could always make Windows UNIX based (that's a joke, considering all the stuff everywhere that runs on Windows NT and OneCore, that's a pipe dream, maybe when hell freezes over (again))"
4g1prs,31,2016-04-22,Motorhead,mikeking29,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4g1prs/motorhead/,"I was a senior in college and just about to graduate. My apartment was nice, but a little too spacious for me. My roommate was away for a couple months on an internship, so I was left with a two bedroom, two bath, two balcony apartment with a full kitchen, huge living room, and large dining area. 

It doesn't sound extremely extravagant, but when you're a college student eating baked beans and stale bread for 60% of your meals, it's a freaking palace. 

So I was alone in this place. I lost some bad habits, like binge drinking, which my neighbors gleefuly picked up, leaving me neighborless most nights as they would travel to the bars a mile away, to my delight. But I also picked up some bad ones of my own, like chain smoking cigarettes with the windows closed and chasing it down with a pot of morning blend coffee and amphetamines. The formula for figuring out what to do post-college.

I had stayed up for an unimpressive two days before I actually even tried to sleep. I don't remember what time it was, but it was dark. I woke up at 3:33am to my phone ringing. The caller i.d. says ""unknown."" I don't pick it up, turn the ringer to silent and go back to sleep, because nobody calls at that time unless they're playing a stupid prank.

The next morning, I see that I have 4 missed calls from ""unknown"" and one voicemail. So I check my inbox and all there is is a 20 second voicemail of static. Again, I assume it was a stupid prank or somebody trying to scare me.

The rest of that day was spent nursing the inevitable dopamine and serotonin hangover from the past couple of days. Every time I walked in my room that day, however, I got a really uneasy feeling like something bad was going to happen. Since my roommate left, I started sleeping wherever I felt like was a good spot. So that night I decided to sleep in the living room. 

My mood seemed better in that room anyways, and after a good hearty meal, I sat down on my couch, smoked a cigarette, then fell asleep.

Again, 3:33am my phone rings. I grab it from the end table and see that the unknown caller is dialing me again. Again, I silence it. But then I see that I have 8 missed calls. I check the log, and between when I fell asleep (around 11) and then, it was that same unknown number that called me. This time no messages.

Now I'm annoyed. Now I think that it's one of my stupid friends. How juvenile. How unoriginal. 
I decided to wait up this time and answer the phone so I could chew out the jerk off on the other end.
I really wish I hadn't picked up the phone, because when I did, my heart sank to the ground.
The static that I thought I'd heard on the voicemail was actually a man's voice, or something emanating from his throat. You know how if you scream into a receiver, it comes out distorted like a speaker being pushed too hard? That's what I heard and it was defeaning. It was louder than my phone can go, even on speaker. I couldn't understand what was being said, but I know that it was full of hate and anger. 

Now I thought it must be some creep with the wrong number trying to scare his ex girlfriend or some lame crap. So I hang up, startled, but mentally together. A minute later, it calls back and I pick up, defiantly yelling at it that it could either identify or severely screw itself. The person on the other end continued on over me. I said I was going to call the police. It stopped for a second, then it came back even angrier and louder than before. The best description of the voice is hysterically wrathful.
In all of my life, nobody has ever scared me over the phone, but at that moment, I was pale as a ghost. As it got impossibly louder, I firmly told it how immature it was acting, even though I was literally shaking. It was then that whatever it was began to enunciate a little more clearly and I could hear that he was saying the same thing over and over again, or some kind of variation. It wasn't intelligible, but purely belligerent cursing. There was a moment where all I heard was ""f*** you"" being yelled through clenched teeth, like when a dog barks with its jaw closed but its lips curled up. I didn't have to see it. I could feel it. 

I turned my phone off, lit a cigarette with my shaking hands, and waited desperately for the sun to rise.

4g29dx,2,2016-04-23,Discussion: Rose and Pearl; Sam and Frodo,BigNikiStyle,stevenuniverse,https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/4g29dx/discussion_rose_and_pearl_sam_and_frodo/,"**Some big spoilers ahead, so if you're still experiencing the show for the first time, please turn back now.**


Hey everyone,

Pretty new here, so apologies if I'm stepping on toes or going over ground that's been gone over *ad nauseam* already, but I wanted to talk about Rose and Pearl. 

**Intro**

In the comments of many threads I've gone through, most recently the 'SU: In Too Deep' trailer thread, I see a lot of 'the crystal gems are super gay' and various iterations of that theme. 

To be clear, the fact that Sapphire and Ruby are clearly both female and in a very strong physical and emotional lesbian relationship shouldn't bother anybody. You wouldn't be fans of this show, I wouldn't be a fan of this show, if that was a problem.

However, when it comes to Pearl and Rose Quartz, I just don't feel that this is entirely accurate.

Now, if there is a canon answer of 'is Pearl in an unrequited lesbian relationship with Rose' then I'll just shut my yapper, but it struck me that the sort of relationship that Rose and Pearl had was a lot like Frodo and Sam's from *The Lord of the Rings.*

**What Pearls Are**

We learn from Peridot that Pearls are essentially servants. The type of gem that you are seems to be a genetic caste system and Peridot's comments strongly suggest that Pearls are the secretaries, butlers, maids, go-fers, unpaid interns, etc. of the Gem Homeworld caste system. 

I'm almost surprised Peridot didn't have something akin to the N-word to denigrate Pearl further (then again, maybe that's what a clod is? Holy shit, a clod is just a lump of dirt, just earth, no crystal composition at all... Maybe that *is* an actual Homeworld epithet and not just a funny thing to say... Sorry, I'm getting off track here). 

She doesn't even consider Pearl as a self-realized being but as more of a tool or object. Peridot scoffs at the very idea of Pearl having any sort of expertise or technical knowledge and begrudgingly admits so after finding herself in basically a tie in the mecha-making contest. 

When we finally meet Yellow Diamond, who answers her communication device but her Pearl. Being Yellow Diamond's Pearl might carry some prestige, but something tells me that YD doesn't make eye contact with her Pearl much, or treat her nicely, you know what I mean?

**Our Pearl**

My point here is that Pearls are on a very low rung in Gem society. I feel pretty safe in that assumption (Peridot's comments weren't *just* being mean, that was the straight dope from a character that's been a part of Gem Homeworld society for the last few thousand year. 

Well, so was another character in literature: Samwise Gamgee, Frodo Baggins' gardener, manservant, and best friend. 

Jokes abound about the nature of Sam and Frodo's [relationship](https://youtu.be/GorLBm35ZkE) (NB: link is NSFW) but the fact is that their relationship is one that doesn't really exist in modern society anymore. 

Frodo was Sam's employer as well as his friend. Sam worked for Frodo much Sam's father, Hamfast Gamgee, served Frodo's uncle, Bilbo. 

Make no mistake: Sam loved Frodo. But it was, I think, a filial love, rather than erotic love.

All Sam was in his life in the Shire was a gardener. Though there was no Peridot-equivalent to call Sam a clod, and although Hobbits seem to be a more laid-back bunch than Crystal Gems, I think it's fair to say that he was at or near the bottom of Hobbit society (though again, maybe being the gardener of Bag End had a pride of place that being a gardener elsewhere didn't). 

However, because of his relationship with Frodo, Sam gets caught up in an incredible adventure and discovers within himself a heroism that is hard to match in all of literature. He accomplished more than any gardener, especially a Hobbit gardener, ever should have. He is a hero for the commoner, the groundlings, the little people. The actions of a Hobbit gardener, truly the meekest of the meek, saved the world. In fact, J.R.R. Tolkien himself considered Sam the chief hero of *The Lord of the Rings.*

**So What Am I Getting At With All This Talk of Hobbits?**

Well, I feel that this pretty much perfectly encapsulates Pearl's relationship with Rose.

As I talked about earlier, Pearl most likely spent most of her existence as a nobody, getting and doing things for others.

That is, until Rose Quartz came along and gave the lowly Pearl a new purpose in life. Instead of bearing a cursed ring, our Pearl became a general in a bloody (shard-y? Splintery?) resistance against the brutal occupation and exploitation of Earth by Homeworld. 

In all of Gem history, I would doubt that a Pearl had done any deed worthy of note or record for posterity. 

*Our* Pearl stood at the right hand of Rose Quartz, leader of the rebellion, whom even noted asshat Jasper respected, and it seems for at least a while, was her only companion, considering Garnet and Amethyst's origin stories. Not only that, but she is a god damn elegant ninja badass. 

Like Sam, she rose above her station to perform great deeds of heroism, courage, and badassery. Like Sam, Pearl goes through the most character development of her peers (with the exception of Steven). And yes, I think, like Sam, she loved Rose as Sam loved Frodo, not erotically, but in the way that someone *would* love the person who broke their society's chains from their feet. 

**Of course, I could be wrong**

To date, we've encountered no male Crystal Gem, or just one if you count Steven, but I'm not sure Steven quite counts in this regard. *All* relationships between Crystal Gems could, by definition, be lesbian relationships.

But Garnet and Sapphire's is the only Crystal Gem relationship we see that appears to be emotional in nature, with Garnet, of course, being the physical incarnation of that love. 

When we see how Sapphire and Ruby met, fusion was a practical deed to make two gems more powerful. The three Rubys only consider fusion as an enhanced means of accomplishing a specific purpose, to better overcome their enemy. 

When Sapphire and Ruby fuse, it is clearly taboo. Different gems are obviously not supposed to fuse with one another and seeing it happen turned Blue Diamond's court into an outraged mob. 

**But what about Rainbow Quartz**

Now, I just re-watched the [Rainbow Quartz scene](http://youtu.be/5dtGvucmFBc), where Rose and Pearl fuse. In the lead-up to that fusion, Pearl is certainly acting like a very jealous girlfriend in the wake of Greg Universe's obvious feelings for Rose. 

But I think wrapped up in that jealousy was a lot of condescension towards humans, their short life-spans, and inability to fuse with one another. I just think that Pearl doesn't want to compete for Rose's attention and perhaps that getting involved with a human would only lead to pain (Pearl is somewhat vindicated in her feelings, since Rose's death or disappearance is directly the result of her relationship with Greg and giving birth to Steven). 

You know what this jealousy dynamic reminds me a lot of? Sam's suspicion of Gollum/Smeagol's relationship with Frodo. Just throwing that out there. 

Anyway, Pearl seems to think that a human isn't capable of a true bond with another Crystal gem because they can't fuse in the physical sense to become one being. Seems like Crystal Gems don't really have a decent perspective on human coupling and mating rituals and I think that fusion is the reason. Our way is just way less efficient by comparison. 

**I don't know, dude, Rose and Pearl looked pretty lovey-dovey when they were fusing...**

Yeah, they sure did. And this made me pause in the writing of this post for a moment. 

That is, until I remembered about Jasper and Lapis Lazuli's [fusion.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9_3ctBhty7g) That got pretty physical too, didn't it? And they didn't even like each other (actually, I think my next post is going to be about the rape imagery of this particular fusion). 

Seems like that's just how fusions get done. It's like the gem equivalent of flirting, dating, romancing, sex, and long-term cohabitation all in one act. 

**That's probably enough**

Thanks very much for reading! This is my first post here, so I tried to get my research right!  

Apologies again for any fat-thumbedness or silly typos, I did this all on my phone for some reason. 

**TL;DR- I'm not convinced that Pearl was in a lesbian relationship or had unrequited lesbian feelings for Rose. Pearl definitely *loved* Rose, but not erotically.**

Those are my thoughts and I could be wrong. Either way, I'm looking forward to any discussion this post generates.

It's nice to see such an active university subreddit. I'll be interning at IBM over the summer and I noticed that the J. J. Pickle Research Campus is very close to where I'll be working.

I know at UC Berkeley we have a couple of housing Facebook groups that are just flooded with people trying to sublet their apartments over summer break. Is that a thing in Austin?

If you could link me to some useful groups, or better yet invite me to stay in your apartment, that'd be amazing!

1) How do you feel the ratio as a girl, especially in CS?

2) Is CSM really that far away from everything?

I have been in the Leeds area for about two months now for an internship and I brought my car with me.

As soon as I drove off the ferry I noticed the inferior quality of the asphalt on the motorways when the chassis of my car had to suffer due to potholes in the MERGING lane... Can't drive slow on merging lanes.... I thought to myself that the roads in the city must be better as this was in the countryside, but nothing was further from the truth. The roads are absolutely horrendous everywhere I drive. I have been all over Yorkshire and Manchester. The roads in Sheffield though.... They're much worse than Leeds, so Leeds wins that one.

Let me tell you that I have lived in the third world for 10 years and the roads here are no different from the ones over there.

Needless to say I am now taking uber taxi's everywhere because my car's chassis has gone down the drain and I do not wish to inflict further damage to my car until I get back to the Netherlands for repairs.

Leeds (and Yorkshire) definitely has beautiful areas and sights but I just think bad roads are unacceptable in a first world nation.

I'm 20 and currently two years into a major in Information Systems and will be transferring to a different college back in my hometown with a degree in Management Information Systems which I intend to finish there. They're largely the same class wise and I'm moving back with my parents for financial and personal reasons. When I move back I'd like to find a job that is actually IT or computer related rather than food service like I've been doing since age 16. I've been steadily employed since I was 16 and also have a groundwork of self taught basic troubleshooting and repair skills. Namely having built 10-15 computers for various people and just basic troubleshooting experience over 5ish years. I also dabbled in some programming but it wasn't my strong suit. 


I have an unpaid internship under an IT director at a hospital already arranged. It is pretty relaxed it seems and as much as anything free labor for him and some experience for me. He said he would be happy to recommend me once my internship is up though and the amount of time involved seems largely up to me. The details aren't finalized yet but I at the very least have a start in something in the field. 


The problem is that I need money too, and want to find something that is preferably beneficial experience as well as paid. What should I be looking for? Help desk, computer repair shop, something else? I don't yet know what I want to do specifically in IT but I'm leaning more towards the technical hardware side with maybe something like networking. Part of me wanting to get experience is getting exposure to more than just fixing my friends computers for free. :)

4g3kzs,18,2016-04-23,"My boss [50s/60s F] has been lecturing me [22 M] about remembering to take breaks lately. It took me a while to really understand why this is important, but I'd been doing better...until Tuesday, when I worked 12.5 hours straight because I was the only one there to serve the guests.",PelliMoon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4g3kzs/my_boss_50s60s_f_has_been_lecturing_me_22_m_about/,"So I work at an event space. It's my first job post-college, and I'm grateful to have it, but I definitely wasn't hired for my expertise. I was an intern last summer, and in the fall they offered to pay me to come in for weekend parties, and after I finished school in December, they started giving me more hours. It's not 40/week every week like I'd like, but it's as close as they can give me depending on how many events they have.

Anyway, because I'm never sure if I'm going to get 40 hours one week or 25 the next, I try to maximize the time that I'm there. I don't slack off on the clock, but I'm always looking for things to do and try to eat before and after my shifts so I don't have to take breaks. This started getting on my boss's nerves, and at first I thought she was just concerned about my health (during the busy Christmas season, I had an episode where I worked a really long shift without eating and my blood sugar dropped low enough where it affected my vision. I was fine, but I scared everyone for a bit). Because I thought it was a personal issue, I decided to address it by just making sure I ate without taking breaks--eating big meals before and after shifts, eating leftovers from events while still working, etc.--but then she made a comment that the breaks weren't just to help me, but to help the company, so I realized I needed to take them regardless. Friends and family that I've spoken to about this have also assured me that time cards that show long shifts without breaks can also pose legal issues for my boss.

So I started taking breaks! With mixed success. Sometimes she'd remark that I'd waited too long to go on break, but at least she knows that I'm trying and making improvements. That is, until this past Tuesday. 

When I get my schedules for the week, I'm rarely, if ever, told when my shift is going to end. Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays I can figure it out if I start at normal time because those days are routine, but Tues-Fri I have to guess. When she asked me to come in on Tuesday at 7, I assumed I'd be going home at about 3, because she normally tells me when I have to work a double. That was very, very wrong lol

Tuesday we had two all day corporate meetings to tend to. My coworker [22/23 F] and I both were assigned to one each, but we still helped each other out on both, especially because she had more experience with these kinds of things and I am still learning from her. My boss (and her husband, my other boss) were in a different room, doing other work. They told us to contact them if needed. 

Anyway, the only time I felt I could take a break on Tuesday was around 10 AM, when things were slow, but I didn't because I'd only been there three hours. After that, things didn't get hectic, per se, but they were steadily busy enough where both my coworker and I had a steady stream of things to do.

Now, my coworker worked out her schedule with my boss so that she always knows when she comes and when she leaves: 7-2. On Tuesday, however, we were busy enough where my coworker didn't leave 'til 3. After she left, I was the only one left on site besides my two bosses and a few coworkers who have no experience dealing with guests. Between 3 pm and 6 pm, again, it wasn't hectic, but there was a steady stream of things to do, and I still felt that I needed to be available to both groups in case either of them needed anything. I did not feel comfortable taking a break at this time, though I was able to eat lunch while I worked on other things (putting dishes in the dishwasher), and do some tasks while sitting down (sorting silverware).

At 6, one of my bosses came upstairs to work. Things got a little busier at this time because one of the retreats was ending, so I had to valet some cars and clean up. Again, I didn't feel like the important work would get done if I took a mandatory break. At around 7, I meekly asked if I could leave, but boss asked me to clean the kitchen, and I ended up leaving at 7:30.

Now, as far as I can see, my mistakes were: not immediately texting my boss and telling them how long I'd gone without a break and that nobody else was there to help guests, not firmly telling them at 6 or 7 how long I'd been working (honestly, I'm a timid guy and I didn't want them to get angry with me right then and there if I had told them how long I'd been without a break). Ultimately, I feel as if my boss put me in this position by only calling in the staff members she did at the times that she did. But maybe that's because our new online scheduling system is wonky. Or maybe I'm just making a case against myself. Idk.

Anyway, reddit, what should I do? I kind of want to deal with this problem in writing, ie sending them an e-mail letting them know I worked 12.5 hours instead of waiting for them to look at my time card at the end of the week (tonight). I like my boss and I like my job and I don't want to get her in trouble or be a liability, but I know that my time card is going to cause problems. What can I do?

TL;DR: I worked a 12.5 hour shift with no breaks (though I made sure to eat and sit down and felt fine the whole time!) because if I had taken a break, the guests that we serve would've been abandoned. I know that this is a legal issue and my boss is going to be hella pissed, so how do I get in front of this problem before she checks my time card at the end of the week (tonight)?

I don't plan to start going into my master's immediately, but perhaps in Spring 2017 or even as late as Fall 2017.

I didn't have an amazing GPA (3.4) but mostly because I was involved in so many other things. I've had two internships at very well known companies (one of which occurred during the school year), I've done research with two professors, I was the president of my ACM student chapter, etc.

4g4dk2,1,2016-04-23,A sad story,Sadstory123,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/4g4dk2/a_sad_story/,"I was in a wonderful relationship for 2 and half years with a woman. She had 3 children all in their teens. I myself have no children. I met her as she was just finishing a divorce. We dated two weeks after her divorce. She had been in a horrible marriage for 17 years. She was in school getting her masters degree, raising kids, had a job and an internship accompanying all of that.

Anywho, the specifics of our relationship aren't relevant. I just know that we were happy, very loving and her children let me know they wished I was their father.

A year and a half into the relationship she caught me flirting with another girl on Facebook. We were on our way back from new york and it was the longest trip ever. I had made a TERRIBLE mistake. After we got home she wanted answers. I gave her everything. I told her the truth. I owned up to all of it. She didn't leave me. I worked painstakingly hard to regain the trust I lost and I made sure to never stop. After a while she was back again. Very happy, talking about how we were perfect for each other and we belonged together. She wrote me wonderful cards and notes months after my mistake that I still read to remind myself that I am a good person and was wonderful to her. 

I'm not a church guy but she wanted to go back, so I gave her that and took off work on Sundays to attend church with her. I loved her very very much.

Eventually, she decided to breakup. As we were breaking up, she stated she didn't love herself and she can't love anyone else because of it. She said that she might be making a mistake letting go of a wonderful man such as me but she had to do it. She said she didn't know who she was as a person. She said no man would ever measure up to me. I asked her if me making the mistake I did caused this and she said no, that this would have happened eventually. 

Within the next month post breakup, we did our texting back and forth telling each other how hard this was and how much we missed each other. But she stayed firm to her decision no matter what. She would say that the talk of marriage scared her. She would say that the new york incident still bothered her. She would say that she ruined the relationship by not being able to forgive. But most importantly, she kept citing she didn't know who she was and that she had a very negative opinion about relationships. 

A month of no contact went by and I text her. I told her I still thought she was gorgeous and asked her if that was okay to say that. She thanked me but told me that it made her uncomfortable. She didn't want to hurt me anymore or be harsh but that she didn't want to get back together. She had said she was confused and cleared her head. She stated that she felt we were from two different worlds.

Being in the relationship I completely disagreed with that statement. 

She simply said that my world was video games and she had no interest in that.

I proceeded to explain why that was false but she wasn't answering back. I have figured this to be something she would say to push me away and help me move on. 

Finally the next day I said if she didn't love me anymore, I would let her go. She said she didn't love me anymore. 

It's been 10 months since the breakup. 5 months since we last spoke. That only happened to inform her of my cat getting hit by a car that her daughters were very fond of. That's been the last contact. 

I still very much love this woman. I'm 33 and she's now 38. I have been trying to move on but have been stuck in limbo ever since. I think about her and her children often. I still blame myself for this breakup but I'm beginning to understand she had a lot of underlying issues and the timing of our relationship was off.

The only question I contend with daily is if I'll ever hear from her again?"

1. How should I continue correspondence? Should I just reply via text saying that I'm interested?

2. What should I be wary of?

* The only characters to beat Season 1 characters this week are also Season 1 characters.
* Urek defeats his third consecutive member of a great family.
* Members of the great families actually have a bad week and lose three to Urek, Evan, and Rak!
* Our lovely original team of Baam, Koon, and Rak have all made it to the semis!
* Of the first main characters to be introduced (Baam, Rachel, Headon, Yuri, Evan, Koon, and Rak) all made it to the quarters and the only ones to not make it to the semis lost to other members of this exclusive group.
* Crocodiles have a 100% win ratio for the third straight week!


Ha Jinsun vs Beta

Winner: Ha Jinsung (82%)

Beta is a weird character for sure and I think has left a bit of a bad taste in everyone's mouth. He was seen as a very strong opponent but had a really terrible motive and, frankly, still does. His power has also not really been explained all too well, which is a shame considering how unique it is in the ToG universe. I love his introduction, how he was always seen with that smiley hat at such an angle that you could thing the smiley was his head. I also actually enjoy his personality, which is also pretty unique in the ToG universe as everyone is always so darn cool and composed. Beta is refreshing.

That being said, Ha Jinsung is also very unique. Along with Yuri and Evan, he's probably one of the few high rankers we get to see ""often."" He's a member of one of the great families but he's a member of FUG, so there's definitely an interesting story there. He also seems to care about Baam, and seeing as we all care about Baam we can relate and appreciate him. He also trained a slayer of FUG, Karaka, and he still has no fear in his presence. He's a character shrouded in mystery and badassery and I think I can speak for most people when I say I can't wait for more of his story to be revealed.

The contest between the two was clear and decisive.


Headon vs Twenty-Fifth Baam

Winner: Twenty-Fifth Baam (83%)

Frankly I'm shocked by how much of a differential there was in this matchup. Headon is, undoubtedly, one of the most mysterious and interesting aspects of the Tower. He chooses the Regulars and meets the Irregulars and can teleport to any floor. Aside from his job/role, he also seems to have his own motives, as we see with his willingness to help Rachel. What request did she have to fulfill? Let's also not forget the mysterious nature of Headon's floor. SIU has said that some characteristics of the story can be seen on the walls. In addition, where exactly is this floor?? Yuri is able to get to it quite easily through either the roof or a portal (I'm not sure) and when she has to get her Black March back she ends up having to gather a team and go through obstacles to get to...the next floor? WTH?

But Baam is Baam and has always been thought to be a leading candidate in this contest. I'm not sure I really have to go into a discussion about Baam here, since it feels like beating a dead horse. He's awesome. We all get it.


Rachel vs Koon Aguero Agnis

Winner: Koon Aguero Agnis (86%)

Rachel is gone! We've all been waiting for this day, and how fitting it is for Koon to be the one to take her down, right? We all knew Rachel never stood a chance at winning, but it does seem right that she make it to the quarters. To you 29 people who voted for Rachel over Koon, what the hell is wrong with you?!

Koon was also one of the favorites going into this competition and it's no secret why. Koon may be difficult to write (sorry, SIU) but he's worth it! While he is cool and composed like the stereotypical ToG character, he's also one of the few sadists we've seen, though it's certainly been a while since that side of his has come out. He is also one of the few characters that we've seen real development in. He started as someone who would've failed Yu Han Sung's door test and who did not seem like the type to make friends. We have seen him evolve into a beautiful character even in Season 1 when he intentionally lost Hide-and-Seek for his team to give Baam a better chance at climbing. Rachel's got nothing on him.


Hatsu vs Lero-Ro

Winner: Lero-Ro (57%)

Wow! This was definitely the closest and most shocking result of the quarters.

Though the competition was fierce, Hatsu was definitely one of my favorites in Season 1. Hatsu is refreshing for the simple age-old problem of battle anime/manga/manhwas and that's Powerful vs Skilled.

Powerful vs Skilled RANT: I loved Dragonball so much because strategy always seemed to decide the good fights. For instance, Jackie Chun beats Goku in the finals by abusing Goku's short stature. When we got to the end of Dragonball with Piccolo versus Goku the fights devolved into power vs power and continued that way through the rest of the franchise. Similar things can be said for most stories, like Naruto and Bleach. One of my favorite Naruto fights is the first battle with Zabuza, which was filled with tactics! One of my favorite fights in Bleach was Ichigo vs Renji where he tries to abuse the fact that Renji's sword can only stretch three times before coming back together. STRATEGY AND TACTICS MAKE FIGHTS INTERESTING AND COOL.

Hatsu doesn't seem to be powerful, but skilled. He outsmarts Quaint in the Hide-and-Seek game and would have won the game for his team had the Spearberer Revolution not been a farce, which makes him the only character to do so other than Koon and Androssi (and Androssi's win was pretty cheap, let's be honest). So Hatsu, to me, represents one of the few awesome ""skill"" based characters, which probably makes him difficult to write. I hope we seem him again soon.

As for Lero-Ro, he's an interesting character with history with Yuri as they were the only two of their Floor of Tests class to become rankers. He also is one of the few lightning users and has passed a special test to gain those black pikachu circles on his cheeks. He fought with Koon Hachuling and he probably lost but whatever he did was impressive enough to earn him an ""internship"" with Wolhaiksong. We've seen some very awesome things from him and was kind of like Season 1's version of Ha Jinsung in my mind; The teacher who cares for his students enough to potentially bend the rules.


Yeon Yihwa vs Urek Mazino

Winner: Urek Mazino (71%)

I might take some heat for this (wordplay intended) but I find Yeon boring. She was pretty interesting when she was introduced and I enjoy seeing her attempt to master her massive power, but there's not much else going on. She hated Viole when he was FUG, especially being a member of a great family, and now she doesn't because she knows he's not FUG. She may like Baam (though to be fair who doesn't?) and beyond that...I don't know. She needs some of her own defining features. To me, she's just a boring substitute for Anak and Androssi and perhaps even Yuri. I'm surprised as many as 60 people voted for her over Urek Mazino, but that's just my opinion. Again, it's not that I don't like her, I just find her lacking in interesting qualities and plot.

Meanwhile, Urek Mazino takes down his third consecutive member of a great family. I think Urek was also a favorite in this competition, but considering how well Yihwa did against him I don't think he's going to win. Still, he definitely deserves to have made it this far, I think.


Hoaqin vs Evan Edrok

Winner: Evan Edrok (68%)

Being a Slayer does NOT make you a god! Though I suppose we already knew that when Karaka lost to Laure. Still, I can't help but be happy to see Hoaqin lose. He is definitely the most interesting and fun villain we've seen so far and I love just how big of an asshole this guy is, having sacrificed billions of people to increase his power. I also love his motive. Yes, he's a Slayer of FUG, but really he just wants to beat his dad. He is a character who is reminiscent of Season 1, as he has a silly/basic reason for climbing/gaining power and is willing to go to any lengths to succeed. I'm glad he's only down and not dead and hope to see more of him in the future. But it's always going to be satisfying watching this guy lose.

Evan makes it to the semis! As much as the community likes Evan I can't say I thought he was a favorite or that he'd even make it this far. Hoaqin is one thing, but will he be able to stand tall (can't get enough of this wordplay) against Urek Mazino?


Koon Ran vs Rak Wraithraiser

Winner: Rak Wraithraiser (83%)

Wow! I did think Rak would win but I thought it was going to be way closer than this. I, personally, am not a huge Ran fan in the same way I'm not a huge fan of Hitsugaya from Bleach. They're both small but powerful with inherited elemental abilities and a calm demeanor that contrasts their mature personalities with theirs immature appearances. He also has no personality other than being ""that powerful dude.""

Rak, on the other hand, is our loving Wraithraiser who can't help but be cute and scary all at the same time, a lone wolf who can't help but love the friends he's made, someone who wants to protect those close to him so that he can beat them himself. He's full of wonderful contradictions that all seem to make sense. Also, I can't wait to find out his reason for climbing!


Ha Yuri Zahard vs Hwa Ryun

Winner: Ha Yuri Zahard (75%)

Yuri wins again and no longer has the best win percentage of the week after two consecutive weeks. We knew this was going to be closer but I still thought it would've been even closer than it was, certainly a closer matchup in my mind than Urek vs Yeon. I guess people really love their Yuri!

Hwa Ryun had a strong showing and we love her, but I suppose she was never really a favorite to win it all. Perhaps I'd put her on similar standing as Hatsu and Laure.


**NEXT WEEK**


These are all going to be interesting matchups but with the rounds getting so much smaller I'm not going to try and make predictions so much, however opinionated I am. Instead, I'm going to take a more fun look at the potential matchups based on next week's winners.

Baam vs Koon

If both win this week then we have a matchup that may have even had the potential to be the finals. Best friends pit against each other? How would we be able to choose???


Ha Jinsung vs Lero-Ro

If both win this week then we have a case of Season 1 mentor vs Season 2 mentor, which is pretty awesome.


Evan Edrok vs Ha Yuri Zahard

Similar to the Baam vs Koon matchup, best friends (are they best friends?) being pit against each other.


Urek Mazino vs Ha Yuri Zahard

We know they know each other, so no matter who wins between Evan and Urek, if Yuri beats Rak then the matchup would be pretty fun.


The competition only has three weeks left! It's definitely going to start getting intense. Go vote!"
4g4vko,7,2016-04-23,"Four years of college, but no degree. Is mentioning my college record deceptive?",kira2120,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4g4vko/four_years_of_college_but_no_degree_is_mentioning/,"During my senior year of college pursuing a computer science degree, I ran out of money and decided to get an internship to enter the workforce. I applied to this position as a part time role, but after a few weeks, they demanded I work 45+ hours per week, meaning I had to drop out of school to focus on work.
    
  
  After that internship ended, I had a little money saved up, but not enough for college, so I got a great job doing full stack software engineering. I made sure that this company knew I was a dropout, but during their interviews I solved a few problems that stumped people with actual degrees, so they were completely fine with taking me on.
    
  
  That was 2 years ago. Now I just got a better job offer with a startup company, and I'm really excited about this position, because it's geared more towards solving computer science problems than it is just building web apps. But, my education years are listed on my resume, which may have implied that I finished school. Just yesterday, one of the employees asked where I went to school, and I immediately answered and then changed the conversation.
    
  
  Is this considered deceptive? My resume only lists the years I was at college, it doesn't mention a degree, and the ""education"" section of my resume is mostly geared toward education I took outside of school ( like agile courses, a web dev bootcamp, etc). I did answer quite a few difficult problems during the interview, and even optimized my answers, so skill is not an issue here. Did I deceive this company, and if so, what steps should I take to make it right?


  
EDIT: Thank you to the few commenters who actually answered the question. I understand many of you would rather encourage me to finish my diploma, but please note that I'm doing better salary wise than my all friends who did graduate (except for two who have rich parents). To any new viewers, please keep in mind this is a question of ethics, not ideas on how to finish my education."

4g5shq,10,2016-04-23,"So lost, and much more complicated than it appears: Should I go to the University of Chicago or UC Berkeley (L&amp;S, out of state) for undergrad?",SoLostCollege,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/4g5shq/so_lost_and_much_more_complicated_than_it_appears/,"I'd deeply appreciate any response to this. I have been grappling with this for weeks and I will say as much as I can here without revealing identifying information. This choice is extremely difficult for me and that many of the people closest to me disagree on what path I should take. I have gone back and forth probably dozens of times over the past few weeks. I'll just dump all of the important facts/opinions here:

**Majors:**

* I am uncertain as to what I want to pursue in college.
* I want something that will allow a comfortable living.
* I think my interests are diverse, and I don't have a set direction in mind yet
* I understand I technically don't have to choose now, but Berkeley and Chicago have vastly different strengths so it has to play into my decision and ultimately will likely need to be the path I have to take not to regret my choice. 

1: CS dual major at Berkeley, four year MS

* At Berkeley, I'd likely choose to do computer science and something else (Probably among Physics, Economics, Math, Linguistics, Business/Finance, Legal Studies). 
* CS at Berkeley is among the very best CS programs in the country.
* Close people in CS argue degree source has little employment impact and the high (100k) starting salary for Berkeley CS students is location-based and canceled out by living cost.
* Others argue a CS degree is very versatile and a good stepping stone for many professions.
* I have sufficient college courses and AP credit to start with junior standing at Berkeley, and three courses satisfy half the non-elective requirements for the applied math major. 
* Berkeley has a one-year masters (MS) program for its undergrad CS students, so given it should be pretty easy to finish the CS bachelors in three years, I could graduate with an MS in four. 
* I don't think it would be difficult to get research opportunities early on at Berkeley.
* Some have argued that CS ""isn't me"" and that it's not well-rounded enough. I don't know what to say to that, but I do have a fair amount of programming experience and used it often working as a mech. engineer intern for the past two summers.
* Berkeley CS has L&amp;S and the EECS forms. I didn't know about EECS when I applied to Berkeley but I may try transferring into it, which wouldn't be as hard as it could be as I have a fairly extensive programming and engineering background. The two have similar incomes post-graduation and I don't think I'd have trouble meeting the GPA requirement for L&amp;S CS. Still, it's something worth noting. 

2: Econ dual major at Chicago:

* If I go to Chicago, I would probably want to go into economics for finance (Specifically, quantitative analysis) as well as one of the others listed above as a dual major. 
* Chicago's economics is among the few best in the world, although it leans conservative with its economics and as a result is a little less modern (A ""freshwater"" school).
* They don't technically have a finance program for undergrad, but it would be an easy stepping stone to graduate school. 
* I have played with the money I've earned and designed algorithms to work with it in the past. Without much background, my savings have grown steadily from this experimentation.
* Many people close to me have said that this path wouldn't make me happy, although I don't know that I agree. Still, I've always wanted to do or create something to have a positive impact on the world. 

**UChicago vs Berkeley as schools:**

* Berkeley's constant budget cuts worry me, and their increasing hostility to out-of-state students.
* The broadness and the freedom that comes with UChicago's Core is very appealing.
* The size of Berkeley's subjects means there's more support for interdisciplinary topics which I'm interested in.
* I thought UChicago is beautiful architecturally, although I like the sprawling campus of Berkeley.
* The students at Berkeley seemed more open and out there when I interacted with them.
* Having attended four different classes at both in different fields, Berkeley classes seem more relaxed but UChicago seems to emphasize discussion. I don't know which I prefer.
* Rankingwise, UChicago is the 4th best college nationally by USNews, which has some impact on prestige. Berkeley is 20th. Still, going purely by USNews' reputation is higher, not to mention globally Berkeley is ranked 3rd. However, rankings play a small part in this decision. 

**Chicago vs San Francisco:**

* I love the culture and art of Chicago, although the life of San Francisco is incredible
* San Francisco is pretty in its own way too, as a city, and is really diverse and there's a lot to do.
* I was only in San Francisco for less than a week, but one nights that I was there I was walking through the city alone at night thinking and happened to run into a ""decentralized dance party"" in the streets that I joined and danced through the city and interacted with people for the next four hours in what was a fascinating and deeply memorable experience. 
* I don't smoke and SF smells
* Chicago went from hail to strong sunshine to rain to snow in a period of a few hours while I was here. 

**Love:** 

* I understand that this is something that would be advised against considering
* This is not going to be the single element making my choice
* Nonetheless, this is not something I think I'm capable of neglecting
* My girlfriend of about three years is going to Stanford and I think what we have is unique and I think this could impact much of our lives beyond college.
* I don't think long distance would work well, especially with our transition to college. 
* If I go to Chicago and it doesn't work out, I will deeply regret that and I think the thought of what I lost would haunt me for a very long time.
* If I go to Berkeley and it doesn't work out, I will regret whatever I sacrificed in choice, in terms of paths I could have taken.

**My finances:**

* I have one sibling, who would be entering college in my junior year (Or, if I were to take a gap year, my sophomore year).
* Berkeley does not offer financial aid out of state.
* I have been offered a fairly substantial merit scholarship from UChicago, as well as a financial aid equal to about half that scholarship. 
* As a result, for the first two years Berkeley 
* When my sibling enters college, adjusting for the rate at which Berkeley's prices have increased over the past years, I would expect to pay 28k more at Berkeley for the third year (64k at UCB vs 36k at Chicago), and 29k more for a fourth year if I couldn't graduate in three. 
* Both my parents work, one diagnosed with an illness this year and going through chemo. Although it has a higher mortality rate in general, given age/stage about 70% of people survive, and given everything has gone well it's probably higher than that.
* In the unlikely case (10% or so? I'd estimate) something happened to my parent, it could have a long term impact on my finances if I went to Berkeley. 
* I have agreed that I will take on any difference in cost between the two schools. I have more than enough money to pay much of the difference of the first two years already, and I don't think I would have a problem earning enough money with either of the schools to pay for the remaining difference.
* There is also technically the option of choosing a university, applying and looking for work in SF for a year with my current work experience and background, and if I get a good enough offer taking a gap year and [moving to California and becoming ""self-supporting.""](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=edc&amp;group=68001-69000&amp;file=68070-68085). See 68071. I think I would like living in California after graduation anyway, so I don't feel like this is manipulative or unethical. The worst case is a bit more work experience and some new connections to leverage when I graduate, as well as more money to pay for college. 

I understand that this is a really big MMC, but I am more lost than I've ever been and I have no idea what to choose. There are no words to describe how grateful I would be for advice right now. "

I have been with my current company since my senior year of high school. I won't go into specifics, but this company has slowly shifted from a friendly European company to a very capitalist and corporate atmosphere. In my location we do solely government work. We are contracted to be their on-site IT; networking, application support, server support, etc.

I have enjoyed working here, they brought me on as an intern and things took off from there. But, I am also a naïve teenager. I realized my value to my company recently. We host an annual event and I put in a lot of work towards it, but pretty much all I got was a thanks, and very little credit in the eyes of upper management. Anything that was prepared wrong happened to fall on my lap usually as something I ""overlooked"". There are also several individuals leaving and that have left, as the government contract is going to be renewed shortly, and their jobs could be cut-off or outsourced elsewhere to save money. 

In the past few months I've spoken with some individuals and talked to them about who I was, my age, my experience, etc. and it turned out they were recruiters and headhunters. I've gotten a few business cards and a lot of interest shown in me because of my youth and passion for the field, and their business card exchange is often followed by ""keep in contact with me"". I haven't really contacted any of them because I thought I had my college + several years after that figured out, but I'm starting to feel a bit worried if more people leave. The other issue that arises is paying for my school. I have a  decent salary for a 19 year old, but the company also offers paying back tuition expenses. I looked further into the fine print and they only offer a set amount per year, not semester. It would not cover a full year of school. On top of that I have to continue to work for them for 3 years after the payment is reimbursed, so if something happens to our contract and our company is forced out, I would be the one SOL and probably would be forced to relocate or reimburse them for the amount that was reimbursed to me. 

I guess I'm not sure what I should do. I'm at a crossroads and spoke to my parents about this, but they don't understand a degree is not 100% necessary in this field and that experience can get you a long way, with a degree being a compliment. I've thought so much about this, but am I wrong to reconsider my company position and moving elsewhere? We had a corporate guy come in a few months ago and he straight up said ""You should always be looking for better opportunity, we are a competitive company, but you need to do what is best for you"". But given my age I have no experience or no idea what I should when it comes to corporate politics.

4g6bc8,2,2016-04-23,"I'm a 21 year old college student graduating soon and the ""real world"" scares the mess out of me.",LaLechuga94,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4g6bc8/im_a_21_year_old_college_student_graduating_soon/,"Hey, r/advice,

Wall of text inbound, feel free to use the tl;dr.

So as the title mentions, I'm a 21 year old college student graduating in about 9 months and the whole ""real world"" talk and getting a job keeps me up at night.

As a preface, I'm a Junior at my state uni studying Economics with a minor in Computer Science. I'll be done with economics next semester so from here on out, it'll be Computer Science courses and electives.

I've very much enjoyed my time in college and think it's prepared me, but people always say ""Oh man, with that major and minor you'll have no problem getting a job!""....and I'd love to believe that.

I simply don't know what I would really do. I do computer science because I've built computers for a while and do some programming here and there, and for my Comp. Sci. electives. Also, I do economics because I took a keen interest in high school for it and do pretty well in my major. I just don't know what I would apply for, how to make a solid resume, how to make myself work-force presentable, etc.

My drive-home aspects on my resume would be that I took and passed Introduction to Econometrics with flying colors, which basically takes statistics, economics and calculus and uses it to run regressions and models with data. We used a software program called ""STATA"" which runs the regressions and whatnot, but that class was all about creating presentations and papers that brought the data down to an understandable level.

Along with STATA, I'm fluent in Microsoft Office, but isn't everyone? I feel like everyone and their mothers put that on their resume expecting companies to marvel at the fact.

My university allows us to count an internship as college credits if it's during our last semester before graduation, which I plan on doing with a consulting firm during my last semester. 

I guess I'm just worried about being financially stable, getting a job in such a hectic economy and applying the skills I've learned to a corporation who pays me to do so (given I'm hired by anyone).

Any advice from former econ majors or computer science majors, or people in any of the mentioned fields? Everyone always tells me that I'm going to make a ton of money and as much as I'd like to, I just don't know where to even start. I can supply any other info you might need. Thanks in advance!

**TL;DR Economics and Computer Science student worried about how to go about applying for and looking for relevant jobs upon graduation.**"
4g6gyp,1,2016-04-23,Been depressed and felt trapped for over 8 years now. Any guidance welcomed.,DF6G544E8,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4g6gyp/been_depressed_and_felt_trapped_for_over_8_years/,"(Whoo... Now that's a title.)

I followed myself down the hypothetical if I killed myself and decided that I wanted to get my shit together. I don't want my close friends and family to kill themselves or have to mourn.

I don't mean to come off as ignorant or caught up in myself, but I really just need a place to finally talk about my unstable life publicly. I'll bullet note the interesting and/or significant parts first then edit this post to include a long ass narrative on each subject if I am motivated later (it’s getting late).

#About me
---
* 16 yr Male
* **Objectively stellar life**: Outstanding grades; almost Eagle Scout; commended by family, teachers, peers, coaches, etc; acquainted and offered internships from several big shots.
* **Motivated** and have hobbies and interests
* Have more **friends** than I think (in my head I have 1 or 2 close friends who I personally consider friends)

---
# My shit
---
* I talk to myself. Mirrors make me go crazy. At first I noticed an ego- now it just **seems like I'm going insane**.
* I love **(am gay for) my best friend**. I thought it was infatuation at first, but I've concluded that I really love him - just... by default I doubt whether or not he loves me or I should profess my love.
* Extremely **reserved**. When I'm not trying to be funny or play a character I am silent.
* At times I am apathetic and do not feel feelings.
* I remember being **suicidal** since 2nd grade. Haven’t made any attempts since I found a friend (heartthrob) whom I don’t want to cripple with suicide. I’ve only made a scene out of it once or twice so my family and friends really have no idea how many times I’ve been seconds from death.
* In 5th grade I went to **family counseling**. My parents paid for 6 sessions. I did even murmur a syllable until the last time because I didn’t want to waste my parents money. The counselor had never seen anything like it and the last session was just yes or no questions.
* I’ve built up a **double life**. I got hardcore into the internet when I was 6 and met some friends (still talk to them daily) that were up to 10 years older than me. I keep internet and real life separate af. I purposely caused an ankle injury to quit 8th grade football when my coach put personal info on an athletic website that my online friends may have been able to find.
* (Self-diagnosed) **Body dysmorphia**. Family and close friends know I over-analyze my situation. Nobody else notices, but some days I only intake ¼-½ of the daily calorie needs. I know starvation is TERRIBLE but sometimes I forget. I am focused on getting skinny and losing the little bit of man boob I have, and I run.
* **Sleep deprivation** 6th-8th grade only saw 2-4hrs of sleep per day. Pretty sure I stunted my growth. Oh well - good thing I stopped that. Sometimes I go to my bed to snuggle with a body pillow that I pretend is my best friend and end up falling asleep. I know it only ends up contributing to depression and my obsession for my friend.
* **I lie**. A lot. It’s bad. I’ve made a conscious effort to not lie recently and it’s going well.
* **Craving for alcohol and marijuana** (with friends). I don’t consider myself an addict, but I did it one time with my friends and I want to do it again (for the social experience). That night was interesting. I did some pretty creepy shit and now they are hesitant to invite me for more.
* **Socially inept**: I know how to do the socials. Just I don’t do them in small settings. I haven’t invited anyone to do anything besides birthday parties when I was little. I never learned how to just ask a friend or two to hang out because I drift from friend group to friend group and am always playing some character that isn’t really me.
* ...(there’s other shit but I need to wrap this up so I can get some sleep)

This is r/Depression. I did not type this out to brag about any accomplishments or to cry about how shitty my (not so shitty) life is. I consider myself depressed, and I don’t want to admit it or be diagnosed with it in real life; so I am running to reddit on a throwaway to at least confess it and move forward. I wear gray but act normal and everyone who knows me says that I am a happy optimist. I don’t really know what to expect of this, but I know suicide is not right for me.

I’m a smart kiddo. If Kim Kardashian can manage this life thing, I can too. I just want to be told that I can do it. I’m inexperienced when it comes to this whole normal thing so any pointers, tips, or suggestions would be great. I get that I should be some unique shining star and live out my weirdness and accept who I am, but I need to be comfortable expressing myself in a healthy way. If nobody responds to this, np. I know what living is. I just gotta do the nike thing. JUST DO IT. I’ll probably stumble a bit and cry (especially if I profess my love for this kid and shit hits the fan) but honestly… fuck it.

Tl;dr: Am depressed. Am smart. Just need to do. Ur job: Maybe comment.

I was wondering how I should email him asking about opportunities, but not directly asking him for a job at *his* bank.  

Right now I have:  

""Dear Mr. xxxxxx,

The reason I am emailing you is because I am looking for an internship this summer and would like to know if you were aware of any opportunities.  Right now I am in the (Name of finance program) at the University of xxxxxxx.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

4g6z8s,0,2016-04-24,Gay Past,royalthrone,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4g6z8s/gay_past/,"**PREFACE**

I am a grown, mature, young, black man at the age of 23. I have a prior gay past that has been exposed to few friends and family. Of significance to my story below, I told my father, but not my twin sister, yet some of her friends are knowledgeable as well. I have grown out of my gay phase. I consider it a phase as I no longer have any interest in dating men. As for sexual desires for men, I estimate they have decreased about 90%. I am now experiencing serious attraction to women, rooted through my personal determination and will to come to the reality of my true sexual desires.

**DISCLAIMER**

This lifestyle change was of my doing and was not influenced by anyone else. Although my current social circle includes no homosexual friends, I do not believe this to be of a more significant factor than my personal determination and will to change my lifestyle. Please note that my gay past started from my late 17s and ended in my early 23s.

**BACKGROUND**

My birth mother died when I was three, having birthed me and my sister (me being the oldest). My father kept us and married another woman when I was five. He remained married to this woman until the end of my 8th grade year of school. I went into my 9th grade year of school with just me, my twin sister, and my dad, in a new house he had built while he was divorcing his soon-to-be ex-wife. Once the divorce finalized, he remarried to another woman, whom he had prior relations with in his young adulthood. She moved in our newly built house when I had finished my 10th grade year of school. 

The divorce and remarriage affected the relationships with both my dad and my twin sister. With my twin sister being a daddy's girl, I felt like the black sheep in this newly built house (I say house as it never felt like a home) with a new woman around that I knew I was going to have to learn to adjust to. From the age of 14, my upbringing began to take a toll on me, psychologically. I turned from this cheerful, outgoing teen to a passive-aggressive, shy guy. I suddenly went from loving and cherishing my life to hating it and always feeling alone. So, I took it upon myself to look for ways out of the house. I did not want to be heard or seen. I felt if I was not heard or seen that no one would even notice. And sadly, I was right. 

I soon discovered a way to escape my house. One day, I went on Craigslist looking for cheap, used cars for sale in my area and stumbled across the dating section of the website. I first looked for women to talk to, but sadly where I am from, little to no women listed themselves for dates. I looked further and found that many men, to my surprise, were looking to discreetly date other men. I did not know much about gay relationships at the time, but I was willing to give it a try as an escape from my house. I also liked the discretion part. I felt that I did not care if anyone found out, as I would confess, but I am a private person, so I did not want anyone knowing what I was up to, especially given the circumstances and risks I was putting myself under at such a young age. (Yes, to me and possibly much of my peers, 17 is an early age to have sex, but now, it is no longer.) I found myself finding many men to meet up with on this site. All of these men believed me to be 18 years of age, as I would say to them in ads I responded to. At the time, many men questioned me, due to my baby face, but none asked me to prove my age. They admired my cute, twink look, and although I was brown-skinned, many accepted me. Things escalated when I quickly found out these men were expecting sex. I was soon introduced into the terminology of ""top"" and ""bottom"", later coming to terms with the word, ""vers"". I started out only responding to ads with no pictures, simply messaging these men and only exchanging face and body pictures. However, I soon was led to posting ads where I would seek other men to be interested in me. 

Quickly, I was turned out into the gay lifestyle, and not to my liking, kept on with it for many years. I had adapted to this lifestyle. However, I never liked the culture. I was noticing, over time, that many gay relationships were built on insecurities stemming from personal issues and formed through deceptive and manipulative communication, and this lack of honesty would lead one or both parties into severe distrust and/or infidelity. However, this is my opinion and analysis, yet is true to me, even more evident in homosexual rather than heterosexual relationships. I believe this to be true as rooted from the stigma in the LGBT community that there is a lack of homosexual and transsexual acceptance in society. 

Lastly, race, age, and weight seem to be large issues in the community that need to be addressed. Most gay men prefer young, white, and slim men, otherwise known as twinks. People can mistake me for stereotyping, but in my defense, my 5-year experience has proven this to be fact to me, from using dating sites and apps and being an experienced ex-member of the LGBT community. Ever more so when I first seriously started dating men, my first for a few months, whom I had met through Craigslist, now fast-forwarding to my start of college in my early 17s. (However, I began this relationship during the beginning of the summer of 2010, the year I graduated from high school, and it continued into college three months later.) The relationship ended at the beginning of 2011. We lost touch and I later met (through Craigslist again) someone else who I talked to seriously, at the very end of 2013. That relationship lasted until the fall of 2014. 

I was devastated by the end of both relationships, causing me severe anxiety, depression, and social reclusion, that no one knew of, ultimately negatively affecting my academic performance and social life throughout my entire college experience. (I will not go into detail as to what happened to cause the end of both relationships. I will save that for another story to be written at a later time.) However, I can say that I still managed to work hard in college, having landed 3 different internships, earning a 3.0 GPA, and traveling to two European cities. 

I landed a job directly after college ended, having graduated from college earlier than expected. I wanted out of my miserable college experience and made plans (that I followed-through with) to graduate a semester early. I was determined to continue succeeding up until the end of the summer of 2015. I had lost all focus and I knew I could no longer function normally in my negative state of mind. On top of this, I was dealing with a stressful job and my close coworker had quit and moved on to a new job immediately after. 

I, too, then quit my job about 3 weeks after my close coworker. I was already into the process of rekindling old relationships with my next-door neighbors, whom I had grown up with from the age of 14 when I moved into my newly built house. Fast forward to today and I am more happier, confident, (and straighter) than ever, yet still unemployed (pray for me). I am constantly surrounded by strong, aggressive, confident, and straight men (which describes my neighbors), and they have shown me the way back to my old childhood when I used to be a ladies man. I knew this break was well-needed to make a positive change in improving my life through finding and loving myself.

**CLOSING**

Thank you for reading my story. Share your thoughts and feelings as I would appreciate this. Address what is on your mind and I will respond accordingly.

Also, try to tackle these three questions I have: 

* What do you think happened to me? 
* Do you believe I simply found myself again? 
* Do you believe I will go back to my old ways of dating men again?"

Plenty of cons, but enough pros to where I would seriously consider this as a place to work after school. I'm currently almost guaranteed a full-time offer once I finish school.

However, I've made the decision to take a summer internship with another local company (company B), which means I will have to quit / give my two-weeks notice to company A before summer starts. I've spent a lot of time considering the two options, and feel that company B may be a better fit for me / more aligned with my interests. On top of that, the pay and benefits package for full time employees appears to be much better.

I'm on very good terms with company A and would hate for this situation of me ""trying out another company"" to ruin the relationship.  If for some reason I dislike company B / they don't give me an offer once I graduate, I really would like company A to still be an option. 

With that said, what's the best way to approach this situation? I will be graduating next March."

I had a few questions about the software industry. Firstly, I have heard two conflicting things: in order to be successful in the job hunt, it is necessary to have a B.S. and complete all the theory and intense classes (i.e. Operating Systems, Automata Theory, Compiler Design) but I also have heard a firm understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms is all that is necessary to be a successful software developer.

To the first point, many of my peers say that there is no point in getting a B.A., only the thorough B.S. Is worth it. However, isn't the most important thing in this field experience? If I were to obtain an internship and my peers who take on a heavy course load don't, wouldn't I be much better off? Especially if I get published twice, and they don't do anything except schoolwork. 

Would missing classes like Automata Theory, Compiler Design, and Operating Systems really hamper my success as a software developer that much?"

I'm a student in university right now (studying computer science), and it just seems like everyone I know is doing better than me in basically all aspects of life.  I try to convince myself that my perception is just skewed, but looking at the facts it's hard to believe that.  This may sound like a vast generalization, but almost all of my friends/acquaintances have better internships lined up for the summer, they are taking more difficult classes (and doing well in them), they have leadership positions in clubs/organizations on campus, and they have better social lives.

Meanwhile, I'm not involved in any organizations on campus (I got rejected from the ones I applied for), I'm barely getting by in the classes I'm taking, and I feel like I don't have many friends or people to hang out with.

By myself, I'm moderately happy with how I'm doing, but being surrounded by all these smart and successful people makes me feel really unaccomplished.  I often find myself wishing I could be like some of these other people I know.  Any advice on how to handle this?"

I don't wish to continue in academia, so the glorious modern corporate world is awaiting me. I am really scared of being forced to work in a cubicle, and possibly being under the whims of a female boss or coworkers (luckily less likely given my field). I'm dreading job interviews where HR reps will likely be female and looking at me with disdain like they have done in my internships.

Thing is that I have been building a side-income through online business during my studies, to the point where I'm more or less reliabily making $1000 a month. So it's a viable alternative for me to just finish my degree and head over to a sunny beach town in Mexico. But naturally that comes with other doubts, such as what to do if online income dries up, or I get a health emergency or whatever. Having some corporate experience after uni I think is essential; nobody's gonna hire a dude who decided to live on the beach after graduation.

So yeah, that's the pickle I'm in. Subscribe to become the corporate drone or go to the beach and hope to still be employable if the need arises.

At 23 years old, I started a non-profit through Legal Zoom. I have paid all the legal costs, but I do have a few questions.

In brief, my non-profit is educational. We help people get jobs in this new generation filled with technology. Getting a job is more complexed, compared to the past- and we help people, build a resume, fix cover letters, prep for interviews, and ultimately land a job. No matter what situation a person is in, we want them to be self reliant, ultimately assisting the economy and greater good.

I do have a few questions though (to be honest, I am young and didn't know what I got myself into, but I will not falter)

1) Many of these expenses are coming straight from my own pocket- as a 501(c)3 organization, will I be able to use donations to assist in legal paperwork dues, professional email dues, and other organizational dues?

2) Can I donate to my own charity? I will have other donors as well and I will not be donating a lot, but will I be able to get a tax deduction if I do, if so how beneficial is it?

3) Can I hire interns (volunteers) and give them guidance and make them work with me?

4) I am completely doing this out of my own good heart- I have never been denied a job and I want to use my knowledge and keen skills to enhance other people's lives. 

5) Any other recommendations? 

6) Should I get a business credit card?

7) Can I hire employees or do they have to strictly work as a volunteer?

8) Ultimately, I need all the advice that I can get.

And at Hudson there is one frat that reins supreme, where the brothers are smarter, stronger and more privileged then any of their rivals. And boy do they know it.

The line stretches down the block as students wait to enter Alpha Sigma's first party of the semester. I stand on the doorstep of the opulent fraternity mansion, arms folded in a way that shows off my bulging biceps and rippled chest. The collar on my Abercrombie polo is up, obviously, and I scan the line for any lithe young pickings that I could have fun with. I dumped my Theta slampiece over the summer - I said I had to focus more on my Goldman Sachs internship, but the real reason was I was just... bored of her. Who knows what I'll find tonight? Maybe a girl truly worth showing off to the high society I had been born into...
_________________________________________________

Hey, thanks for reading! So the premise of this roleplay is pretty simple. I want to play a douchey, All-American frat bro who gets to corrupt and use a naive young first year. You could be a spoiled, stuck-up legacy blonde, a small-town busty brunette or even an ebony/latina girl who'd never dream she'd abandon her people to suck on the cock of a rich white guy. So long as you're creative and imaginative, I'm game!

This can be played short-term, but what I'd really like to do is create a little world of opulence and privilege. I want to seduce your character with promises of the high-life, taking you to all sorts of exclusive events and country clubs, all the while making you into a more and more depraved slut. By the end of it I want you to be my bimbo, a good, obedient little girl who smiles and sticks her chest out while the men discuss business.

Detail, creativity and good grammar are key. I'm pretty open to most kinks and this scene can go from plain vanilla to extremely dark.

Hope to hear from you!"

I feel stuck. I feel so alone I guess? I really thought this would pass. Like it usually does, That it would be a mild hit but its not. I just feel lost. I sleep more, I wake up so late that its the middle of the afternoon! I keep shutting out my family that are trying their best to keep in touch with me. 

I knew moving to a new place all alone would be hard, but I didn't think it would be this hard. I've already met few cool people, we have bowling nights or poker or pool nights. It's cool once in a while to try and get out of this funk I am in. It just feels they are so few and far in between because once it's over I am alone again. I feel depressed again. That sudden positive upsurge, that small part of you that feels like it could change things? It's gone so very fast. It's so short lived. 

Alcohol doesn't even have the same affect to me anymore so it's not like I can drown my sorrows away. Everything feels worthless. Everything I do really, I see no point in doing even the simplest task. My clothes are littered around, the dishes are still dirty, laundry isnt done and I haven't done any vacuum. Few weeks ago my place wasn't even a fucking dump! What the hell happened? I was taking care of myself so well! I was proud of it dammit. 

Now I'm struggling to find a reason to go on. I have major tests and assignments coming up in a few days worth 20% and I have barely touched my notes. It just sucks. I am just caught in a vicious circle of self loathing and misery. I just feel like a failure. I see friends on my social feed, going out having parties. I have friends going out living their dream of travelling to exotic places or friends accepting internship at some big firm or prestigious research Laboratory. 


All these guys are out there making a name of themselves! They are all going to get so far in life by the time we have our reunion. What the fuck do I have to show for myself? I got good grades yeah but I also have some bad ones too. What is it about depressed people and their mixed bag results? Why can't i just find a purpose and work towards it? 

Why can't I just pursue that path to success like everyone else I see? Why is it so hard to find these cool opportunities? 

It just doesn't help when my parents keep asking if I will do something for the weekend, or why I keep sleeping so much whenever I miss their call. It doesn't help when one of my asshole friend keep making jabs at the third-tier university I am stuck at while he goes to a first-tier prestigious one, that he keeps rubbing it in on how all the parties he keeps going to or how all the friends he has now. It doesn't help that the new circle of mates I made always have frequent get together right next door and only bother to invite me half the time. 

I feel alone. I feel worthless. I feel like a complete and utter failure. I am trying to fight against these thoughts but its getting so hard. How can you fight them when your first solution to fixing this is to end your life?

I'm currently a speech therapy grad student. I'll graduate this July and I'm currently looking for work for when that happens.  However, before I graduate I have to complete one more full time internship. 

I've been to this internship placement before for about 8 weeks for a part time placement. I absolutely LOVE the work they do, and my eventual goal is to get a job with them once I get my license (~a year after I graduate). 

My concern is I'm not sure how to handle the pregnancy thing with them. I'm still in the process of finishing up my paperwork to get on board with them. I'll stay probably sometime in May. I'm currently ~11wks (I'm guessing, haven't been to Dr yet) so I'm not showing yet, but I definitely will be by the end of my internship (I'll be ~6mos along when I finish). I don't see anywhere that interns have the same 'pregnancy protections' as employees, and I don't know what to do to stay in good standing with the company.

If I tell them now, before the initial paperwork is set up, they may choose to deny me as a student because of increased liability from me being pregnant. If they deny me as a student intern,  I may not be able to graduate on time because I'll be missing an internship requirement for my grad program. 

If I wait to tell them, they may think I was being sneaky and it might give them bad blood and destroy any chance I have of working here in the future. 

At this point, my plan was basically to get the paperwork in and get my internship started, and maybe 3-4 weeks into the internship tell them that I **just** found out I was pregnant and felt that they should be aware. 

Any advice? "
4g8vej,1,2016-04-24,Need help at this stage of my life,hazard222,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4g8vej/need_help_at_this_stage_of_my_life/,"Hey guys,

this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I need help in my life and especially life advice from people who are more mature than i am. 

Little background: i am 21, from germany and currently studying hospitality management which i found pretty exciting at the beginning (first problem).

part of this course is that we have internships and study in at least one foreign country (the netherlands in my place). So I don't really have the chance to build up a social community and friends in a place that I am staying because I am only there for about 6 months before I move on to the next internship or university.

This has honestly become a huge problem for me in my life.. I feel pretty alone.. I am in a new place again for internship since last Sunday in a new city 600km away from my hometown. I have 6 or 7 really GOOD friends from my school days that come and visit me often even though i am like 600 km away from where they study and I really appreciate them and do not take their efforts for granted.

However I just feel lonely sitting here in yet another new big city with noone to talk to and no idea on what to do.. I do not like my studies anymore and realized that the service industry is just not my thing.. I do not want to smile at people when I do not feel like it and I do not want to spend my entire life working 12+ hours a day on new years eve and so on but I also do not want to quit my studies since I am only one year off of graduation and thought to myself that it was better to stick through it the last year and then have a bachelor's degree insted of having a ""gap"" in my CV which might lead a new boss to thinking i give up pretty fast. 

Now talking about my parents I have to say that I have the BEST parents I could imagine.. even though my dad is working an awful lot due to his position in upper management of a large german company, he always finds time for me and calls me every second day to check on me and ask how I am doing. He does all he can to fulfill my dreams, he makes high 6 figures per month and spends most of it to make my life enjoyable which i could not be more grateful for. He even cancelled his business trip last weekend to come and surprise me after I moved in because he thought I might feel lonely and I might need him to build up furniture etc. (he drove 600km from the south of germany up to the north just to see me for one day and cancelled all his business trips he would have had just to check on me).

Because my dad and also my mom are so lovely to me it is hard for me to tell them that I do not want to continue this course anymore because I am soooo afraid of disappointing them and because I wanted to show them that I am a strong person and that I pull through and graduate this course. I do not want to make my dad or mom question themselves and their decisions because they did the best they ever could. 

Now my dilemma on where I need advice is... should I finish my degree? (I highly think so because it is only one year left and then I have a bachelors degree)

Do you think I should pursue a career in hospitality even though I do not want to work in this field solely because I do not want these 3 years of study to go completely to waste?

After all I just realized that I am a person that absolutely needs social contacts which is just impossible in this field of hospitality industry where I have to move every year or even every 6 months. 

My biggest fear however is that my parents might feel disappointed in me because its a privat university which charges ~1k€ per month which results in ~36k€ in fees only for the university, living food etc excluded. Even though I know that money is no issue for my parents I kinda feel obligated to them to continue in this field and tell them that everything is alright because I want them to be proud of me sooo badly and am afraid of disappointing them by starting a new course after having finished this one. Even though I am pretty sure that they would never be disappointed in me because of how loving and caring they are and wanting me to suceed it is just such an inner fear and kinda pressure to make them proud of me and give back to them by sticking with career path I took, the hospitality industry which I personally dislike more and more each day.

I hope my English wasn't too bad and my sentences at least made a little bit of sense to you guys since it is not my first language.

I appreciate you and the time you took for reading my ""story"" a whole lot and would be more than thankful for advice ! :)

Best regards and have a beautiful sunday :)"
4g969u,15,2016-04-24,I am 22 years old. How do I get that point across to my overbearing parents?,Whinnie,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/4g969u/i_am_22_years_old_how_do_i_get_that_point_across/,"For context: I'm a Chinese female who moved about an hour and a half away from home at 18, with my parents' permission, to attend university (as well as to get away from them, but they don't know that). Since then, I've done the typical away-from-home student arrangement (live around school, come back for the odd weekends and holidays). With the exception of first year, I've managed to pay for all of my rent and over half of my tuition thanks to my school's internship program (you spend every other term working full-time); the remainder of the money comes from the RESP account my dad opened up for me when I was young, because if I don't use it for school then the money ""goes to waste"" (i.e., gets taxed). So for every withdrawal I end up giving my parents the majority of the money because I know from other people's experiences that money tends to be used as leverage for control in the future, and I don't want my parents -- who are more helicopter parents than the typical tiger parents -- to have any control in my life if I can help it. In short, I'd say I'm mostly independent and have the finances to be fully independent, which is a goal I'm hoping to achieve by the time I graduate from school next spring.

Now the problem is that I think my parents are starting to realize that I'm becoming independent, and yes, I'm sure it's scary realizing that your oldest child is growing up and becoming an adult, but the extent to which they've resisted the truth is ... kind of scary in itself. Our most recent fight (which is still ongoing) was about how I'm going to visit my new employer on Monday after work (doing two back-to-back internships) and my parents just couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that I don't want them to come with me. Their justification is that since they have a car it'll be easier to get around (except it won't, it only takes 15 minutes by public transportation, and they're going to have to drive for 45 minutes in traffic first) and then they can scope the area for apartments, and they don't mind going through the trouble and stuff, but I do. I can't remember the number of times I said ""no"" during that conversation ... MOM, WHY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORD NO?!

Please don't get me wrong. I do appreciate my parents' help when I need it (and they have definitely helped out during some dire times), but it's just like one other poster said here: my parents want what's ""best"" for me but they think they know what the ""best"" is better than I do. And I hate that. MORE CONTEXT:  Especially because growing up I've never been able to have a real conversation about anything with my parents because even to this day they've never listened to me and have always interrupted me when I try to speak up. I was never able to ask questions about religion because my mom would accuse me of being possessed by the devil (yeah, she's a real diehard Catholic). Nor was I ever able to ask any questions about sex or boys or relationships because ""they're just a distraction!!!"" and to this day I'm STILL not allowed to have a boyfriend (but yeah right, as if I'm going to obey that rule when my parents themselves have such an unhealthy relationship).

It all came to a head this morning when my mom walked into my room telling me to get up so we can go to church. I told her that they can just go without me because we've discussed this before, I hate when she drags me to Mass because then I'm not going to pray or go through the motions because I don't want to be there and she's only brooding my resentment for her and religion. (Not that I have anything against Catholicism personally.) I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back, because after that she started yelling about nonsense. Some good tidbits include:

* how I'm talking like I'm 32 or 42 (uh, what?) instead of 22 years old -- implying that people are just moving out of their parents' house when they're 32 or 42;
* how her and my dad can't believe how I'm acting as if I'm ""not a part of this family anymore"";
* how I surround myself with bad people and my friends are the most negative influence on my life (not like I haven't heard this one before);
* how if I'm acting like this now, what's going to happen to how I treat them when I ""become a doctor or a lawyer"" -- this one was super hilarious because my mom knows I've NEVER wanted to become a doctor (don't even have any prereqs for it) and that I certainly don't want to become a lawyer now that I know how bad the state of the legal sector is;
* how she and my dad should never have let me move away on my own for school (although I'm pretty sure that if I'd continued to live with them I would've killed myself already).

My mom also told me the other day, ""Until you and your sister get married, you guys are still MY KIDS and I will treat you as such."" So I laughed as if THAT'S ever going to happen (since she's never even let me date before and doesn't want me to date until I'M DONE AN MBA ...) and told her about the whole ""Asian parents don't let their kids date until after they get married"" and she actually ... thought ... that was a good thing.

So yeah. Any ideas? It seems like the more I try to break away and do things on my own, the more my parents try to swoop in and ""help"", but that only makes me want to get away even more ... And the more I try to prove my independence, the more my parents are convinced that I'm going to be one of ""those kids"" who totally forgets about their parents when they make it in the real world (not that their behaviour is acting like much of a deterrent for this). And although they hope that someday I'll be the ""CEO of a company"" with my OH-SO-IMPORTANT MBA, they're still treating me like a child, so I don't know how they think that's going to work?

I have hope that I can someday have a healthy, adult relationship with my parents like some of you guys here have managed to find. But right now I am filled with so much anger and resentment and I'm convinced that my only option for now is to go nuclear. Please help.

**TL;DR: My parents have problems with me growing up. How do I make them see that it's inevitable and that, you know ... I'm growing up?**"

I'm wondering if anyone knows of a hybrid type role between being a software engineer and being an actuary- one where both skill sets are needed to perform the job. 

Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks"

4g9m70,9,2016-04-24,My oh-so-carefully planned double major and career map just fell to shit...how can I make what's left viable?,badly_behaved,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4g9m70/my_ohsocarefully_planned_double_major_and_career/,"This will be long. I apologize in advance.

Last fall, at the age of 38, I graduated with my associate's degree from my local CC. In researching schools to transfer to, I became aware of a new program at a small state university at the other end of my home state.

It was an interdisciplinary major in social science, which was exactly what I was looking for. Unlike a lot of social science programs, this one allowed you to choose 2 tracks to concentrate in among the 6 social science disciplines offered. When I got in contact with the coordinator, we also discussed the new secondary education major that the school had launched. Turned out that with the planned curriculum changes, I was going be able to double major in social science and secondary education, and graduate within 3 years with certification to teach social studies and Spanish to grades 7-12.

In the past, those in the social science major who also wanted teaching certification were required to choose history as one of their 2 tracks, but lucky me, with the changes being implemented, that would no longer be the case - I was free to choose the disciplines that most interest me (in my case, political science and sociology or geography - a toss up).

YAY!!! I was going to get to study the things I am actually interested in, and then, when I was done with the degree, I would have an actual professional skill that would be very likely to quickly translate to a stable job with decent benefits - even if the pay is shitty for the work required. This was really important to me...I have lived basically hand-to-mouth my entire adult life, and I really wanted my college degree to insulate me from that a bit, especially since it has taken me so long to get here.

That was a year ago. I have since completed nearly all of the content courses required for the social science major, and have completed 2 of the education courses. A week ago, just prior to my advising appointment for next semester, I received an email from a professor in the education department I had never met informing me that I had been assigned to her as a new advisee.

Long story short...my advisor - the one who was making changes to the secondary education program - is terminally ill and has taken an indefinite leave of absence. In his absence, no further progress is being made on getting changes finalized to the new major, which means that the old rules still apply. Which means...that since history is NOT one of my 2 tracks, I am ineligible for teaching certification unless I essentially start half my concentration over again.

Fuck that noise. I have already dropped the teaching certification option from my program, and I wil now graduate in May 2017 with a B.A. in Social Science and double minors in Spanish and Cultural Anthropolgy. So, as best I can tell, I have a few realistic options:

* federal/state government
* non-profit
* graduate school with an eye toward staying in academia

I'm OK with not using my degree to teach high school...I just want to be able to *use* it in some way. Before returning to school, I worked for state government for 8 years; I'd be happy to parlay that experience + my degree into something relevant. For example, I'd love to work in equal employment opportunity or fair practices, but no one can seem to give me any information about how to get a foot in the door with those jobs. I feel like there should be some kind of perfect internship opportunity here in my last year of school, but everyone I've talked to stares at me like a deer in headlights.

I'd also love to teach at the college level...I don't have so much ego that it needs to be a school with a recognizable name, but I don't want to be an adjunct indefinitely...because that's right back to the uncertainty and instablility that I've fought so hard to get away from. So should I go to grad school? Stop at the master's level and teach community college? Push through and get a PhD and hope against hope that I can find tenure track somewhere?

Other ideas appeal to me also...my pet issue is improving quality of life for GSM teens, so, as an off-the-top-of-my-head example, does the It Gets Better Project need a program assistant? Does that job pay enough for me to make rent? Again, I'm OK with not making a lot of money...it just needs to be enough to pay my rather modest expenses and leave a bit left over.

Any insight? Suggestions? Ideas I haven't thought of? I really appreciate any thoughts you might have to offer.

TL;DR: Was a double major in social science and secondary education. Recent events mean I can't get the teaching certification. What can I do with this degree that will make use of it and reliably keep a roof over my head?"
4g9rv6,4,2016-04-24,"I keep failing, maybe I should give up?",Mecapic,PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/4g9rv6/i_keep_failing_maybe_i_should_give_up/,"So recently I had to switch from a university to a community college after my third semester of school because I had my financial aid taken away. I really want to be a physics major, but I don't know if I'm smart enough to stay. 

In all honesty, I never really did much work. I would do my math/chemistry homework and I wouldn't really do much studying or practice after that. I would go to see tutors and all, but eventually I stopped going. I always try to do better, write better notes, study more, be more smart like the other kids in my class, but by the third week, I lose all my motivation and barely want to leave my bed. I have depression and type 1 diabetes (very uncontrolled honestly), which makes concentrating and my depression worse. 

I transferred to the community college, I took a placement test on a whim a week ago, and I scored bellow pre cal even though I took it during my first year. So I would be even further behind my major when I start.

I look at all the people in my graduating class, and they are all doing so much better than me. They all have scholarships and internships, while I had to switch to the community college down the street. I honestly don't know if I'm even cut out for college. 

I don't want to be a liberal arts major or anything like that. I know that those subjects don't interest me at all. I love science, I love nasa and space and I want to make science fiction possible. But maybe I just wasn't meant for college. 

I'm going to be 20 soon but so far I have only passed my English class, and have failed everything else. I don't even have a job to focus on while I have to stay out a whole semester (this current spring semester), and I'm not attending during the summer. I have to wait until this fall semester. Should I give up? "

I mean, after all the crap they put you through Engineering school, would you just settle for ANY job? Know a few other horror stories from people who graduated with a degree in ME and were offered positions as draftsman making 12 bucks an hour!

I know one guy who graduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering, no internships, below average GPA, he struggled a lot to find his first job(Don't know all the details) but now he works as an supervisor for a store that sells computers, similar to Best Buy.

It was one of those roll caged ""offroad"" gokarts with only the back left wheel driven and braked. It had a 5 or 6 hp Tecumseh 4 stoke on it. It was 100 dollars. Over the course of the next few years I installed a new recoil starter because it was broken off. I tuned the carb, installed a new chain and clutch, and changed the tires. For a kid who had it as his only driving experience it was an absolute blast. 

Now I am 19 and I want to get into kart racing. I live in Glen Ellyn IL but am at school at Purdue most of the year. I've been watching videos of the 125 shifters and they look freaking insane.

The idea of the intense sharp steering, pulling multiple G's through turns and bang shifting through the rev range sounds amazing. I was wondering if anyone new of any good places to go where I could rent Karts and go racing or in some way get into it. 

Any thanks is appreciated :) 

edit: Just looked at the suggestions for posts

I have a great deal of knowledge on engine working for both 2 and 4 strokes, I'm an engineer and can probably fab some stuff up as well.

My budget is not huge since I am a college student but I do have an internship this summer so I'll definitely have some money to spend.

I'm not looking to go pro but would like to be competitive, my school also has a shifter kart race between different student organizations every year and I would like to get good enough to compete in it.

She is away studying (in my field). We have always joked  about going out, but as of the last couple months the discussions started to seem more like we both want to be a couple. Trouble is over the past week those conversations seemed to have stopped, and actually we haven't spoken as often. I know she is busy with her internship, but I feel like I spent to long trying to figure out if I wanted to ask her out that I may have lost her. I am worried if I ask her out she would turn me down and it would ruin our friendship, but at the same time I truly feel that we could have a future together.

To one side of her, the city sprawled endlessly, but not endlessly enough to be met eventually by green pastures and rural farms. The other side; a cold, sarcastic and deliberately silent and unresponsive secretary, killing invisible ants on the keyboard of her Apple desktop.   
  
12:03. She crossed her legs, flicked her brunette hair over her shoulder and scanned the magazines on the mahogany desk before her. Fashion magazines, chic décor magazines, even some celebrity magazines; all glossy, and all with the targeted audience at hand. The position did say Men and boys need not apply, which seemed discordant to Alicia, but media internships were far and few between, and since graduating with a degree in English Literature nine months ago, she noticed few firms willing to hire an inexperienced Arts student.  
  
But CyraCo had hired her university friend Lucinda some three months ago, and judging from the lack of social media responses since, she was inundated with work; surely a better position than idly checking Tumblr every 3 hours, as Alicia had found herself doing for the last nine months. Not that this looked particularly enticing on a résumé…   
  
Alicia checked her watch one last time. 12:09. The secretary noticed her glance, and sardonically commented “You needn’t worry, sweetheart; what you might call tardiness from whichever university you came from is really just Mr Lucas and Miss Soveridge’s means of reminding you that their time is more important than yours,” with a sickly smile.  
  
Alicia frowned, leaning back in her chair.  
  
---  
  
Two offices other, a prospective investor stroked the girls’ plaited hair as she nuzzled her cheek against his leg.  
  
“Marvellous, isn’t it?” the CEO beamed, encouraged with the investor’s impress at their latest transformation.  
  
The girl rubbed her nose a little against the leather of his shoe, before strolling off on all fours towards her basket.  
  
“I don’t know about marvellous so much as miraculous,” the investor replied, astounded. “Do tell me again, how you managed to transform… Her?”   
  
“Ditz; her new name,” the CEO interrupted, the girl shot up from her basket instinctively upon hearing her name. “Ditz” was one of the few words she still recognised, along with “heel”, “down”, “good girl”, “bad girl”, and a few other words turned relics of her former past.  
  
“Of course, her old name was Lucinda Snowberry. But observe how she no longer reacts to those words; they, and what we currently speak, are nothing but the gibberish of her Master’s to her. She lost her intellectual capacity quicker than most during the shift period, and thus the name of her collar reads “Ditz”.  
  
And the purple leather collar was all she wore, unless the investor counted the chains around her wrists and ankles, binding her movement on all fours whilst providing a slight chinking of metal wherever she paced.  
  
“So tell me Sir,” the investor asked inquisitively, “How did you get a girl from Lucinda to Ditz in three months?”  
  
The CEO smiled in earnest. “We have a professor in our midst. Miss Rebecca Ross, though she prefers Professor Pavlov. For you see, her means of transformation is based on reward, and discipline. Upon a girl’s capture, she is stripped of her human possessions, her hair is plaited, she is collared and leashed, and of course, chained. Each subject is individual, but each individual responds to being fed grain of cereal for good behaviour, or canings, humiliation or some other means of creative discipline Professor Pavlov deems fit.”   
  
The investor had noticed the faint red marks on Ditz’ bottom earlier.
“Each puppygirl walks for miles on end, chained up as Ditz is, on a treadmill until the notion of walking is beyond her. She is gagged and denied of speech for forever more. In most cases, rubber plugs are inserted into the puppygirl’s bottom and inflated, serving both a cause of discomfort, a means of pottytraining, and a little rubber tail from which the pump dangles between her legs.”  
  
The investor nodded, impressed.   
   
“But of course, I have only observed the transition of 4 puppygirls in my valuable time here; in which we have produced an astounding 74 pets. Perhaps it would be worth observing the transition of a new girl; one…” The CEO checked his notes before adding, “Alicia Grace, I believe. This girl, as did Ditz and the puppygirls before her, think they were applying for an interview at a fictional company. Our associates, Mr Lucas and Miss Soveridge manipulate or deceive into a critical state of immovability (and, I must stress, *deceive* and not force. This is vital, and they are particularly creative) before Professor Pavlov can begin her work.  
  
The investor checked his briefing notes as they waited by a desktop relaying CCTV footage of the unsuspected Alicia idly sat in the waiting room, and Mr Lucas and Miss Soveridge entering the interview room. He noticed that due to the vast wealth of CyraCo (presumably from personal investment from the aristocratic and endlessly wealthy CEO himself), the puppygirls were not sexually exploited during the transition, and were not sold into sex slavery. Virgins were targeted by the employment process, and background checks were ran on potential purchasers before they were interviewed, and thusly, puppygirls went to good homes; owned by exotic princes, or as pets for a CEO’s office, rather than being abused by some gangster.  
   
Meanwhile, the CEO switched his vision from the impatient target on the monitor to the pink leather collar in his hands. It read “Princess” in silver lettering on the front. Miss Alicia was a personal target for himself, and had required some months and personal expense to find her at the beginning of CyraCo’s trap.
It was quite the ambitious programme, and the opportunity to see it work in action delighted the investor considerably. He took a seat in the leather chair with the CEO and rested his eyes on the brunette girl sat in the waiting room.  
  
---   
  
Alicia checked her watch one last time. 12:47. This was absurd. Her thoughts of abandoning the last remaining opportunity she had were broken by the icy cold voice of the secretary before her.
“Miss Grace, you are expected in the office before you, for Mr Lucas and Miss Soveridge now.”   
  
---  
  
Firstly, I’d like to apologise for this absurdly long prompt. If you’re read this far, congratulations, and please have a Scooby Snack™!   
  
I must urge, before you read on, that this is long term, and the complexity of the story requires a patient, articulate, eloquent and creative partner for mutual interaction. So please don’t give up on me! And please, let those brain cells of yours devise a manipulative snare for the unsuspecting Alicia (for whom I will be playing) to walk (or crawl) obliviously into, towards the point of no return, otherwise marked as “Kennel”.   
  
This is an Obedience School, and the trainers are only as creative and ingeniously sadistic as the mind creating them. Overt sexuality is discouraged (as is beastiality) and tactical humiliation is encouraged. My kinks (I’m hoping) should be fairly obvious, but if not, feel free to shoot any questions in the form of an orange envelope. My limits are few, but include sex &amp; rape among puppygirls, blood, other animals, and I think that’s it.   
  
If you hadn’t gauged from my needlessly extensive opening prompt, I like my stories long term, fleshed out and spanning several paragraphs per response. I am much more inclined to respond frantically if you like context and would like to explore Alicia’s origins before we begin the story. It could span from high school, to the interview, to her puppygirl lifestyle, should you see fit.   
  
Oh, and this prompt will be open for as long as you are able to read it, so feel free to reply night or day.   
  
Woof."

I got accepted into a summer program abroad in Capetown and I will be taking a course there for the first 4 weeks and then interning the following 4 weeks. I honestly feel like I will be able to walk away with so much if I do decide to participate. For some context, I am currently finishing up my sophomore year at uni and do not have that many experiences under my belt. I honestly think this program is worth investing in because of the course itself (web development bootcamp), the internship, the networking opportunities, and the fact that this will be my very first time abroad.

Background Situation: My family has been really stressed out by debt after moving to a house 10 years ago. Just 2 years ago, we finally reached a point where we are able to spend without feeling overcome with guilt (new laptop, clothing, driving lessons, etc). Still in debt but we are slowly paying off mortgage and stuff.

The program which includes airfare, living expenses, the course, &amp; pocket money = roughly $11,500

My dad is willing to drop $5k, maximum for this. My mom earns less money and I am honestly not willing to ask her for a contribution because she is extremely likely to say no.

Also, I have no savings in my bank account. I'm currently on the struggle bus in college...

With almost $7k that needs to be I only have 2 options: 
1. Drop this entire program. I will work at a local ice cream store as I have been doing for the past couple of summers.
2. Take out loans and ask my dad to be a co-signer. I have confidence that I can pay this off since I will be working on campus next school year. But having my dad's name tied to a loan makes me feel really irresponsible and a bit uneasy.

What do you guys think I should do? On one hand, I want to be selfish and just go. But on the other hand, I don't want to cast anxiety and stress on my parents now that we're in a pretty good spot financially."

I know how to use charts, analyze data, and edit articles on Wikipedia.
Honestly, at the beginning, I did not like the idea of quizzes, but then I realized that it is a great idea because I did extra work to get high score; I read more and watch more videos which helps me to get more knowledge.
I recommend for next group to pay attention to the passive homework, to read more, and to take advantages of each tool you teach in this class."

No school debt (thank you, wonderful parents). I work an internship that is paid but only part-time. They have offered me a salaried position when I graduate in less than a year, so I will have a salary soon enough. For now, though? Hourly and it's not that much. I have a few thousand in savings and growing. I'll be working as a full-time intern while I'm out of classes over the summer, so I plan to save a lot. 

Once I graduate, bf and I will be renting an apartment. I anticipate needing credit for this, so I guess I need a credit card. I don't really want one, but I'll need to get one and use it responsibly so that I have credit for when it's needed. I plan to use the card for small purchases that I know I can pay off (gas, modest grocery runs, etc.). 

I applied for a capital one secured card a few months ago and was denied immediately. Like... seriously right away. I waited the few days it takes to get the email that offers the denial explanation, and it said I was denied because there was no credit info available on me. Of course there wasn't! 

I talked to Capital one and they suggested that I call Equifax, etc. for help. 

Did that, they told me to call my bank.

Called my bank and they said they can't help me until I apply, but I didn't want to apply again as I had just applied and been denied with Capital One. 

My mom (who has outstanding credit) was going to add me as an authorized user to her card, but in the event of her credit company, doing this would not have any effect on my own credit. 

My mom said maybe I should try applying again once I'm making more money over the summer? I mean even then there still won't be any credit info on me. 

I'm totally open to applying with my bank (BofA), but my understanding is that they may not approve me since I don't have a ton of money with them *and* because I don't make a set large amount each month. And what if they have the same problem with me having no credit history? What do I have to do to get a credit card so that I can use it (responsibly) so that I can have a credit score?

I would love any advice I can find!! Thank you!"

4gam69,1,2016-04-24,My oh-so-carefully planned double major and career map just fell to shit...how can I make what's left viable? (x-post from /r/findapath)...big bump in the road. Do my nontraditional student counterparts have any words of wisdom for me?,badly_behaved,BackToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/BackToCollege/comments/4gam69/my_ohsocarefully_planned_double_major_and_career/,"This will be long. I apologize in advance.


Last fall, at the age of 38, I graduated with my associate's degree from my local CC. In researching schools to transfer to, I became aware of a new program at a small state university at the other end of my home state.


It was an interdisciplinary major in social science, which was exactly what I was looking for. Unlike a lot of social science programs, this one allowed you to choose 2 tracks to concentrate in among the 6 social science disciplines offered. When I got in contact with the coordinator, we also discussed the new secondary education major that the school had launched. Turned out that with the planned curriculum changes, I was going be able to double major in social science and secondary education, and graduate within 3 years with certification to teach social studies and Spanish to grades 7-12.


In the past, those in the social science major who also wanted teaching certification were required to choose history as one of their 2 tracks, but lucky me, with the changes being implemented, that would no longer be the case - I was free to choose the disciplines that most interest me (in my case, political science and sociology or geography - a toss up).


YAY!!! I was going to get to study the things I am actually interested in, and then, when I was done with the degree, I would have an actual professional skill that would be very likely to quickly translate to a stable job with decent benefits - even if the pay is shitty for the work required. This was really important to me...I have lived basically hand-to-mouth my entire adult life, and I really wanted my college degree to insulate me from that a bit, especially since it has taken me so long to get here.


That was a year ago. I have since completed nearly all of the content courses required for the social science major, and have completed 2 of the education courses. A week ago, just prior to my advising appointment for next semester, I received an email from a professor in the education department I had never met informing me that I had been assigned to her as a new advisee.


Long story short...my advisor - the one who was making changes to the secondary education program - is terminally ill and has taken an indefinite leave of absence. In his absence, no further progress is being made on getting changes finalized to the new major, which means that the old rules still apply. Which means...that since history is NOT one of my 2 tracks, I am ineligible for teaching certification unless I essentially start half my concentration over again.


Fuck that noise. I have already dropped the teaching certification option from my program, and I wil now graduate in May 2017 with a B.A. in Social Science and double minors in Spanish and Cultural Anthropolgy. So, as best I can tell, I have a few realistic options:

* federal/state government
* non-profit
* graduate school with an eye toward staying in academia


I'm OK with not using my degree to teach high school...I just want to be able to use it in some way. Before returning to school, I worked for state government for 8 years; I'd be happy to parlay that experience + my degree into something relevant. For example, I'd love to work in equal employment opportunity or fair practices, but no one can seem to give me any information about how to get a foot in the door with those jobs. I feel like there should be some kind of perfect internship opportunity here in my last year of school, but everyone I've talked to stares at me like a deer in headlights.


I'd also love to teach at the college level...I don't have so much ego that it needs to be a school with a recognizable name, but I don't want to be an adjunct indefinitely...because that's right back to the uncertainty and instablility that I've fought so hard to get away from. So should I go to grad school? Stop at the master's level and teach community college? Push through and get a PhD and hope against hope that I can find tenure track somewhere?


Other ideas appeal to me also...my pet issue is improving quality of life for GSM teens, so, as an off-the-top-of-my-head example, does the It Gets Better Project need a program assistant? Does that job pay enough for me to make rent? Again, I'm OK with not making a lot of money...it just needs to be enough to pay my rather modest expenses and leave a bit left over.


Any insight? Suggestions? Ideas I haven't thought of? I really appreciate any thoughts you might have to offer.


TL;DR: Was a double major in social science and secondary education. Recent events mean I can't get the teaching certification. What can I do with this degree that will make use of it and reliably keep a roof over my head?"

It just doesn't really excite me that much at this point and that seems like a red flag. Part of me wants to go back to school immediately and get a BSCE, but the rest of me thinks that is a huge waste of time and money, and that I should just start working a 55k/year job. I'm just afraid of hating my job and being jealous of people who get to work in industries that interest me. Is it possible to get a more computer hardware oriented job with no experience at all in that field? "
4gav6s,9,2016-04-24,Ironies Abound,b1daly,StevenAveryIsGuilty,https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/4gav6s/ironies_abound/,"Hi All,

This is my very first Reddit post! 

As a disclaimer, I watched MaM just two weeks ago, so I might not be as up to speed as you folks. I wanted to share some thoughts and observations, and also get your takes on some questions lingering in my mind.

In short, my experience with MaM to date looks like some of the perspectives I've read here:

-binge watched in three days, was profoundly outraged and shocked with what I saw, bought the narrative put forth in MaM hook, line, sinker...

-decided to poke around the interwebz to see what I could find on the subject. 

-Found main reddit thread, following it. At first I thought, ""with all these people on this, this case is going to be broken wide open any day now!""

-Became aware of this thread, assumed it was a bunch of jerks over here. 

-After a couple of days of increasing confusion over the proliferating conspiracy theories, I realized that there seemed to be no convergence on any alternative theory of crime
. 
-Decided to read over here a bit, at some point on one of those threads where the regulars here lay out the case, I had the ""scales fall from my eyes"" feeling, of course he was guilty! 

-I felt sad, it was weird, for about a day, then I realized I have no dog in this fight, and I got over that. I've followed sporadically since, waiting with interest for some breakthrough, the stories nagging at me. 

--I decide I would post here, and see what you guys thought, as the main sub is a stream of inanity, ridiculous conspiracy theories, and baseless character assassination. The irony that many posters over there are engaging in exactly the same kind of smear tactics they decry when applied to SA is lost on them, apparently. If you are regular putting forth multiple people as possible candidates, then certainly most of them, if not all, have nothing to do with the crime, which is just thoughtless and cruel. Not to mention the effect on TH family. (I don't care about the chatter about LE, that comes with the job I think.)

In the last few days, some doubts that SA is guilty have crept in to my thinking. If I had to put a percentage on it, I would guess 90% chance he's guilty, 10% chance he's innocent. I'm comfortable saying I don't know. I'm not attached to any particular truth. The main reason for thinking he's guilty is simply some variation of Occam's razor. Any theory of the crime that includes a planting/framing scenario seems wildly improbable and convoluted.

I'm gathering the consensus view here of the crime theory is along these lines:

-SA likes TH, has been using her taking photos for AT as a pre-text to engage.

-Gets her to come out on 10/31, he's using the B Janda name to keep from spooking her, same reason he calls *67 wants to find out if she's still coming without her knowing it's him.

-He tries to make ""some moves"" on TH of some kind. She resists or rebuffs him, there is a confrontation in which he crosses some line of aggression or sexual assault.

-He realizes she can get him in trouble, panics, and attacks her, maybe choking her, or hitting her in the head, or stabs her, rendering her powerless.

-Takes her to the garage, shoots her in the head, perhaps wraps in blanket to control blood splatter

-Pulls her vehicle in the garage (pushes Suzuki out)

-Puts her body in back of RAV4 with bleeding head.

-calls TH phone to find it

-In the fight, he cuts finger, bleeding, bleeds inside RAV4

-Leaves her in garage, goes out, see's others, calls Jodi etc.

-Gets a fire going and invites Brendan over to gather fuel

-It's not clear when he put's body in fire, could be before or after Brendan comes, Brendan may or may not see body parts

-Tends to fire, making sure there is sufficient fuel, keeps chopping body to speed burning.

-has Brendan help him clean up the limited blood stain area in garage (Brendan might not know what it is)

-At some point starts second fire in burn barrel to help, puts some body parts, phone etc, in there 

-At some point drives RAV4 to other side of lot to hide, probably later when everyones asleep

-Tends fire until late, when most of body has been burned up.

-Keeps key, as he will need to move RAV4 again. It's bloody, so he washes it, hence only his DNA, hides in bedroom.

-Doesn't have a chance to further clean or move RAV4 as people are around, doesn't want to draw suspicion.


That is a very straight forward scenario that fits the evidence exactly.

So, now to the ironies.

MaM directors come along, film for 10 years! The doc comes out and creates an international sensation. People ""buy in"" to the doc as spectacular expose of prosecutorial and LE malfeasance. Every thing goes backwards side up. 

In original narrative (main stream media at time of trial, prosecutors theoey) TH is victim, SA is villain, KK is hero.
After MaM  TH is still victim, SA is victim, KK is villain, and DS and JB are the heroes!

My whole perspective of reality is impacted, especially as I'm a Wisconsin resident. It's like the end of the Wizard of OZ or something! After a few days, I come across this sub, and I swing the other way!  Twice in three days! Once again, up is down, black is white. I'm amazed at how much the power of narrative can affect me (and others).

Reflecting on it some more, while indeed it seems likely that SA is guilty, and MaM is a well crafted propaganda piece, spinning a counterfactual narrative from whole cloth, there is more to it. Let's look at the things that remain that are indeed bizarre about the case, whether or not they exculpatory to SA.

The ""elephant in the room"" here is the conviction of BD as portrayed in MaM. I see no possibility that he is guilty as charged. On the contrary, the railroading of a vulnerable young person like this is totally deserving of the outrage that has followed this documentary. (For the sake of discussion, take that as a given.)

Even though he may have masterfully maneuvered a violent sociopath in to prison, as justice demands, KK still comes across as an evil douche in MaM willing to do anything for a conviction. His post trial personal scandal lines up perfectly with his portrayal as a bad actor. His fantastical press conference revealing the sordid details of his made up crime scenario does indeed profoundly pollute the jury poo, across the state, drastically diminishing SA's chance at a fair trial. In trial, he makes what I think are outrageous and non-sensical statements (""presumption of innocence is only for innocent people"",""if you think evidence is planted, you must conclude LE killed TH"").

DS and JB turn out to be very likable characters, and from what I can tell are basically straight shooters.

After Manitowoc sheriffs dept makes a show of recusing themselves from primary investigation, Lenk and Colborn ""volunteer"" for duty, and happen to be on hand for many major discoveries. (Also, discouraging Manitowoc coroner from coming to crime scene!)

Fassbender and Weigert's interviews/interrogations of BD are revolting. Whether they are technically within the bounds of law, they appear totally incompetent, and manage to contaminate both SA's and BD's trials to the point of fiasco. Weigert, is also a pitifully witless witness in court. His testimony that they took BJ and BD to the hotel for their own ""protection"" is laughably transparent in its fake sincerity.

The blood evidence in the RAV4 is no doubt very damning for SA!

But the other main evidence seems to be obtained under unlikely scenarios, especially the key and the bullet. The key, what the hell? The explanation of how they found it makes no sense, unless I'm missing something. They took everything out of the bookcase, shook it violently, and it somehow popped out of the side in the back, into plain site, then they put everything back how it was? And of course no pictures of the back at the time?

SC, working under instructions to ""place her in house or garage"", refuses defense opportunity to attend bullet testing, for fear of contamination, does test with interns present, contaminates control, then ignores protocol in this case to report result. That smells shady...

The bones! Even a moron who just watches CSI would think to take pictures of the bone site before excavating. The bone from the quarry is introduced as evidence, and does not fit with prosecutors theory at all, instead strengthens defense scenario. Why did they even bring that in?

And the biggest mind-f**k of them all. KK prosecutes BD, based on his ridiculous confessions, under a completely different story of the crime used to convict SA!

With all of this, it's no wonder so many people over on the main thread have basically gone off the deep end.

So here we have a hugely successful documentary that is simultaneously a powerful expose on the corruption, and, an example of how manipulative editing can create a counter factual narrative from whole cloth that is probably wrong, but so convincing that it causes an international uproar.

In fact, one of the underlying themes of MaM, that is, that simplistic narrative explanations of complex situations create a rush to judgement and dubious outcomes, is perfectly illustrated by by the doc itself! It's so convincing, that even hi profile legal/investigative personalities like KZ and Steven Moore are sucked in.

Stepping back, when you include the phenomena of MaM itself into the narrative of the Steven Avery story, it takes it step further in to the territory of a story so weird, you really couldn't make it up.

I'll end with a thought experiment. Assume that SA is guilty and BD is innocent. You are given magic powers, but have only two choices: free both or keep both incarcerated. What would you do?

I would free both.

4gay9g,341,2016-04-24,My (26M) bf of six years wants to break up with me (24F) because of astrology.,Rollalady,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gay9g/my_26m_bf_of_six_years_wants_to_break_up_with_me/,"So my BF (Jim) and I have been dating for almost six years. We've gone through some pretty formative years and changed as people but somehow made it out alive, in one piece, and very happy. We've been living together almost four years and are talking about buying a house together. 

Jim has always been very science-minded and logical. I appreciate that as I can be emotional and get worked up pretty easily, though it has caused some fights when I feel he isn't acknowledging my emotions. Mostly though, I enjoy his even-headedness. He has a good job working IT at a small company and I'm currently an intern at an online paper, slowly working my way up. 

Now, despite being very logical, my bf has one quirk: he loves reading horoscopes. As I'm more of the floaty hippie type, it would make more sense for me to be into them, but I mostly think they're silly. In the past I've told Jim my thoughts on horoscopes and basically all of astrology, and he has good-naturedly agreed that it's silly, but is still something he enjoys. 

This really was not an issue for me. We all have our quirks that may contradict our personalities or beliefs, so I wasn't concerned. When we first started dating, he would just read both our horoscopes each morning, and would occassionally mention if something came into play during the day. I was fine with this and it didn't concern me at all. 

Over the years, he's slowly gotten more and more involved in what I've dubbed ""astrology culture"". Before making any big decisions, he consults horoscopes and planet positions, etc. He's now concerned that we won't have a compatible relationship as I'm an Aries and he's a cancer, and I guess relationships can be difficult between those signs. This frusterated me because I feel like he's pre-judging me based on the general archetype of an Aries, instead of the individual person I am. We have an excellent relationship regardless of whatever the ""signs"" are saying. 

Our house-hunting is constantly held up because now is not the time for his sign to be buying a house. Misaligned planets? Honestly, while I tried to get into it for Jim's sake it confused and annoyed me so I kind of tune out now. 

Anytime Jim has problems with friends, families, or coworkers, he looks up their sign and scoffs ""of course a Gemini would do this"" and tries to blame everything on their horoscope. 

The biggest issue is that Jim is excusing his own issues with his horoscope. Like for instance, I went on a weekend trip with some friends, and when i came back, the house was DESTROYED. Trash everywhere, dirty dishes piled a mile high (NO idea how that many dishes were dirty in three days), and no laundry done. I was pissed because I asked him to do some laundry for me while I was gone, and he readily agreed. I was upset and asked what happened, and apparently ""his horoscope said to focus on his pleasure this weekend and not to strain himself"". So he played video games all weekend and did no chores. I'm not proud to say that I shouted quite a bit at him, being tired and angry. He apologized, but still stood by it as that's what his horoscope said. 

That's the biggest problem that Jim's astrology obsession has caused in our lives. However there's been some smaller issues that are nearly identical to what I described above, just smaller. He won't go out with me, will avoid certain chores, or won't cook. He also will not talk to me about marriage or engagement as the stars aren't right. 

Before people say ""COMMUNICATE!"" I have. I've tried to be gentle and explain that while I really don't understand astrology or his desire to belive in it so fiercely, I respect that it's import. But I also need him to go house-hunting and do chores and clean the house when appropriate. He promises he will, but the little things start building it up again. It's gotten to the point where I can't eat breakfast with him anymore as he insists on continuing to read and discuss our horoscopes even though I've asked him not to. I hesitate to talk to him because I fear he will bring up more astrology, and he often does.

Then yesterday, he said he wanted to have a serious talk. I wasn't sure what to expect, but hoped it would be that he was taking my complaints seriously. It was basically the opposite...he said that our signs were too different, and that if I had shown more effort in understanding and acting accordingly to horoscopes, he would have let it slide. But as I hadn't been indulging in something I didn't believe in,  he didn't think he could be with me. He wanted me to put more effort into following my own horoscope. I was flabbergasted. I told him that he knew my feelings about astrology and that it hadn't changed. He was quite petulant and said that he didn't know if he could be with me if I wasn't more willing to try. 

I miss my logical boyfriend! I feel like that side of him has been replaced by some nut that doesn't want to take responsibility for his own life. What do I do? We've had a great six years and I anticipated many more great years to come. Everything else about our relationship is excellent. 

Tl;dr: my bf has recently become very involved in astrology and is considering ending it with me as I don't want to have anything more to do with horoscopes."

Did I screw up the rest of my life?,HenemanRawl109,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4gay9q/im_fresh_out_of_college_without_any_internship/,"Hey there r/jobs. You probably see these posts a lot, but I was wondering if I could get some advice on what to do. I'm just really lost and scared about what to do now.

I'm 22. I graduated from a respectable public university in the US with a degree in chemistry. My entire life, I was a great student. I have great study habits, I spent hours at the library studying for tests and writing papers, and I have good grades.

My work experience is lackluster compared to my grades. Since the later half of 2014, I worked as a personal assistant to a facility manager. Even though I had this job, I didn't work very many hours and I barely did anything related to my studies. My job was primarily related to lab maintenance, rather than actually performing experiments and running tests using scientific instruments. I also have 2 years of volunteer experience at elementary schools and 3 months of retail experience. Even with all of this, I feel it's insufficient for finding a job right out of college.

I've tried to get an internship related to my degree since I was a sophomore. I've never even got an interview or a phone call. I've tried to get research experience under a professor or a grad student. No one has given me a chance.

I've been applying to jobs for the last 4 months. After submitting countless applications, I've only gotten 3 responses, all of which offered no prospects of a job. I've tried looking at internships as well, but all of the ones I've seen want me to be enrolled in school.

My lack of success has caused me to consider ditching a job related to my chemistry degree altogether. I've considered a career path in technology/IT, but I barely know anything about it. The fact that I feel demoralized by the job search and I now have no idea what I want to do with my life make me want curl up into a ball and cry. I feel like I wasted the last 4 years of my life.

What on earth am I supposed to do? I'm just so lost. How am I supposed to at the very least get by in life?"

I’ve been depressed for so long it’s hard for me to remember what it was like to not be anymore. I’m 25 now, and I can remember even as a kid in elementary school not being able to imagine being an adult. I always thought I’d end up killing myself as a teenager. I don’t know why, but that just seemed most realistic to me, and so I never really had any goals. I was a little surprised that I graduated high school, but I figured I’d probably kill myself before I finished college. It’s weird. I don’t want to die. I have no reason to be miserable. I just am. I never thought any other way until the middle of my internship out of state when I heard a suicide prevention commercial and realized I hadn’t even thought about killing myself in months, because I was so happy where I was. I dreaded coming back, because I was afraid I would lose that and I would slip right back into my old self. Self fulfilling prophecy I guess.. It’s been nearly five years since I came back from my internship and promised myself I would leave this state, and I still haven’t been able to. I don’t know if I ever will. I’ve been on so many anti-depressants in my life, and it still feels like things in my brain are just getting worse. I know my feelings aren’t rational, and I know by all accounts I’ve got things pretty great, but I can’t separate what I know from what I feel to meet. There are days where I am constantly telling myself to get out of bed, to leave to house, to read, to ride my bike, to just do anything, and I can’t. I know I don’t want to die. I don’t want to hurt my loved ones, but everyday I feel like all I want is to sleep and not wake up. I’m scared my feelings will take over my rational side someday, and I’ll lose. I know I should see my therapist. I know I should see my doctor. I will, but right now I really just want to word vomit all my thoughts to strangers on the internet."

Of course, why pay for a full series with independent creators when you could just pay some intern to say random facts they found on Wikipedia to a camera? That's now how they make money. 

I get than animation is hard and expensive. Yeah, but, that's why the channel was created! To give independent, hard working animators a platform to share their work! Not clickbait conspiracy theory bullshit facts that take less than a day to make and edit!

4gbj0l,0,2016-04-24,Conventional MS or specialized Masters for BME,goodoletom,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4gbj0l/conventional_ms_or_specialized_masters_for_bme/,"I am in a dilemma. Tomorrow, I have to choose between going to Georgia Tech for its Masters in BioID (Biomedical Innovation and Development) program, or continue at my current State School for my MS in BME. In your experience, would it be better to get my MS, or take the plunge for the specialized Masters? For reference, I am interested in manufacturing / QA / regulatory affairs as it relates to biomedical engineering (BME). 

The pros and cons I have right now are as follows:

*GTech:*

**Pros:**

* Higher ranked school

* Better networking connections / career fairs

* Program has 100% job placement (it's only been around two years, however)

* No thesis

* Industry Focus

* 1 year


**Cons:**

* Very expensive (&gt;60k total)

* Requires full relocation (expensive)

* Not a true ""Master of Science"" degree

* May not be technical enough degree

* I do not have prior industry experience

* Program is VERY new

* Programs like these known to be used as revenue generators 



*State University*:

**Pros:**

* In-state tuition (&lt;30k for whole degree)

* Close to home, no relocation

* Traditional MS, courses build on technical hard science

* Can get PhD in future if necessary (job growth)

* No need to rebuild entire new network base, just build on existing

* Familiar, friends, girlfriend is here :)

Additionally, I am nearly guaranteed (knock on wood) an internship that pays right above $20/hr during the school year if I stay and do my MS at my current state University. 

**Cons**:

* Program not as high ranked (although still above average)

* Thesis-based, need to find advisor and conduct research (I do not enjoy academia)

* 2 years

* Research may not be relevant to industry

* Job not guaranteed 



What do you guys think? Which would be better for future in industry / future stability?"
4gbmvb,3,2016-04-24,[ROLEPLAY] The Technocratic Party,TimeLord79,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/4gbmvb/roleplay_the_technocratic_party/,"Chief Government Whip James Blais looked as though one of the veins in his eyes was going to burst when he heard the news, ""THOSE FUCKERS DID *WHAT*?!""

The unfortunate messenger, an intern by the name of Lea Fortin, meekly replied, ""Ministers Bernier and Leclerc are forming their own 'Technocratic Party' for the 2027 general election.""

""Well,"" said Blais, his voice very calm and very quiet, ""In that case, please reschedule any appointments I had for today. I am going to go wipe those two sorry fucks off the face of the earth.""

With that, Xavier Lavoie's 5'5"" ""attack dog"" gracefully glided out of the office. Fortin could have sworn she heard something smash as he marched down the hall.

---

James Blais did not bother to knock before entering the office of the Minister of Transportation. Sure enough, both Bernier and Leclerc were there waiting for him.

""We were wondering how long it'd take you to show up,"" said Bernier, calmly munching on a muffin with his feet up on his desk and the general air of someone who was out of fucks to give. Blais snatched the plate it had been resting on and flung it at the wall. It shattered.

""How are the anger management classes coming?"" asked Leclerc innocently, lounging in a chair near Bernier's desk.

With a swipe of the hand Blais snatched the muffin out of Bernier's hand, ""Now listen here, you little twat. You shut your fucking mouth or I am going to take this muffin and cram it so far down your windpipe that it comes out of your ass.""

""The windpipe doesn't actually connect to the anus,"" corrected Leclerc, ""The former is part of the respritory system and the latter is part of the excretory system.""

Blais stepped towards him brandishing the muffin like a weapon. Leclerc leaped behind the chair, his face beaming with a childish glee.

""Look, James, here's the thing,"" broke in Bernier, ""Neither of us really care what you have to say to us. You won't intimidate us into back down. You have nothing to blackmail us with. You can't kick us out of the party; we're already leaving. We hold all the cards and you hold none. You're just some guy with a Napoleon complex who swears a lot, and you don't scare us one bit.""

Blais reached for a nearby shelf and began flinging random items in Bernier's direction while screaming obscenities. The minister ducked behind the desk. When he found he had run out of projectiles, Blais lurched towards the desk and in a single move pulled it forward so it fell with a loud thump.

Before Blais could eviscerate Bernier, Leclerc broke in, ""Hey, Napoleon complex. Let your boss know that we're willing to stay on until the election. We want as smooth a transition as possible between the Parti Québécois-led government and a Technocrat-led government."" Blais paused for a moment, looked at Bernier, then at Leclerc, and then back at Bernier, as though he was trying to decide who he wanted to kill first. When he seemed to have made up his mind, he spun around to face Leclerc, violently overturning his chair and then leaping over it to chase him out of the room with the muffin.

Bernier surveyed the destroyed room with a smirk. Blais could make as big a mess as he wanted, but he couldn't force Bernier or Leclerc back into the fold. However things turned out, the upcoming election was going to be interesting, and while Bernier couldn't quite yet say who would win, he had a hunch that Parti Québécois was going to lose."
4gbsup,17,2016-04-25,"Cow Chop and TheCreatureHub, From a business point of view",Khaztaroth315,TheCreatures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/4gbsup/cow_chop_and_thecreaturehub_from_a_business_point/,"I wanted to share my perspective on why business-wise, cow chop works so well and TheHub

This tough began because both channels operate on the same office space, yet they seem to have a much different production value, and mostly I think it boils down to **""Roles""** and i say **roles** as the job each member of the group has on their respective channels (cow chop on one side and TheHub on the other).

The creatures started as a group of friends that played video games and uploaded them to YouTube but that slowly changed to something that seemed way more plastic (with the ocasional drama with one of the members), and the schedule of upload became unreliable when they moved to a business model. Now to have a successful business you have to have various things, but the ones they seemingly got wrong are three:

* Schedule
* Roles
* Mission/Vision 

***Schedule***
Now this is easy to understand, the series that they uploaded were few and far between so that made people not go back to the channel because they either were watching something else that was more reliable or they just wouldn't get the video on their feed ([here is a video explaining that las point](https://youtu.be/HLJQ0gFHM8s)).
Cow Chop has had a daily upload schedule of content that is always the same quality, mostly because is recorded weeks prior and they have enough time to finish it and publish it making it more interesting to the consumer (yes i'm going to refer to the fan-base as ""consumers"" because that's the thing that can make or brake a business)

***Roles***
Easy to see from the entertainment point of view; Kootra and Dan are the ""Boring ones"", James  and Aleks are the ""Actually funny"" (I'm exaggerating a little is just an example). But from a business side of things you can look at it as the ""Job description"" witch guides a person on what is their job about, we can use the interns as an example: iJoe was hired to be in charge of social media and some video editing, Spencer was hired to mainly do video editing, but since they were friends they started co-hosting the videos as well, so that shortened the time they had to do their original job, and later on they had to fill in witch-ever rol The Hub needed them to do, making uncertain what they had to do. Now you could say ""They are friends, they can do whatever they like"" and i would respond ""Sure, they can be friends but they also have a job to do, and this just makes it harder"". Let me refer to [this snapshot](https://youtu.be/K5JlIN-Il8o) from Creature talk #76 (the snapshot is from the 2h13m mark) that explains this concept fairly well.

Cow Chop on the other hand has people doing video editing, camera work and that really cool beat-boxing at the start of the videos, all of them do their job but they don't need to be in front of the camera because the show is not about them, is about James and Aleks and they understand that. Now i'm assuming that video editing is done by someone else because i don't know, and i don't need to know, you don't really care who was the guy that was pointing the lights at Colin Mochrie as long as he didn't messed it up.

**Mission/Vision** 
To not make this any longer than what it has to be this concepts refer to what **I** as a business **am** and who do **I** want to **be**, and i don't think the creatures were sure about those, they probably knew what they wanted to **do**, witch is fine for a group of friends, but not for a business, this probably also affected what they tough were allowed to say and do leading to some other drama.
Cow Chop, on the other hand basically defined this two concepts for their channel on the [First video](https://youtu.be/LjKBagEqIrQ) they did.

Now to not be so negative about TheHub I can easily point out a good example of **schedule** 

**TreeTopia** was very good because they recorded on set days and they posted on set days, so you could always go back on the days it was scheduled to be and get a video making it more successful.

**TL;DR:** They messed up concepts of business management that led to the consumers leaving because the product was not what they expected, witch made taking decisions harder for future projects since they didn't had feedback (and the little feedback they got was dismissed or ignored)

Those are my two cents on the business related topic, hope you can give your view on the matter.

EDIT: ~~Some formatting~~ Never mind, can't make it look decent

EDIT 2: After reading some comments it might be that cow chop was though by NovaHD but it's backed and organised by the creatures, trying to do better content without being tied to what the creatures used to be ""new brand new product"" so to speak "
4gbzsb,3,2016-04-25,Its really hard to keep fighting,imtrying3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4gbzsb/its_really_hard_to_keep_fighting/,"Well this is going to be a story but here it goes... I'm going to just start at the beginning.. When I was 6 months old I was diagnosed with HIV. Couple weeks later my mom was diagnosed with AIDS. She died when I was 10 and I have absolutely never healed from that. But my childhood was actually really good. I'm an only child and my dad has always been there for me and been very supportive, and today he is literally the only person I really have. But he always taught me that I needed to keep my Virus a secret because if anyone found out everyone would find out and some people will ridicule me for it. This gave me serious trust issues from the very beginning. I grew up with the same 5 best friends since I was in 1st grade and to this day only one of them knows. So besides my mom dieing, my younger years and high school were pretty good. I always had friends, would go out every weekend, played sports and all that, and was pretty popular.

But something happend when I went to college... Freshman year was good, I lived on the campus and made a bunch of friends and had a relatively good freshman year. But at the very end right before finals I got arrested for possession of marijuana and Drug paraphernalia... I'm writing this 5 years later and I absolutely recognize this event as the beginning of my depression. The biggest thing was my financial situation. It was VERY expensive for the lawyer, and the bail, and the ticket, and to this day I have never felt ok with money.

That summer I hated myself I felt like such a shitty person, and was very broke and for whatever reason decided to transfer schools and go somewhere else. I think I just wanted to start over. This was also a huge mistake. I went to another school and it was just not good for me and this is where alot of the bad depression started for the first time in my life. I was very broke, addicted to weed (still am, Ill get to that), and ended up living alone at 19-20 after my roommate left and went to another school and I had no one else to live with. Stayed there for about a year and a half and decided to take a semester off and not go to school and go back to my dads house. This time was ok but not very fulfilling. I was working at a jimmy johns but I was alone with no friends there. 

I was VERY close to just not going back to school but decided to go back the next august to the same school I started at and roomed with a great friend of mine that I met freshman year. Again things really started to look up. I was making some friends, had a seriously good relationship with my roommate and was much happier. Then I had a little argument over something stupid with a guy from our group of friends and they totally just stopped talking to me and my roommate. This is group of friends number three that I have lost since Ive been in college.. 

Then the worst happend.. My roommate and literally everyone i knew here graduated in December and I've been living alone again since he left.. I'm horribly depressed, I hate school, I have literally no friends except this girl I'm seeing (ill get to her in a minute) and its just so extremely hard to keep going..  

Now, lets get back to the HIV. This has totally ruined my life. my numbers have always been pretty healthy but I wasn't supposed to live over 14.. About 2 years ago I ran out of insurance and could afford the crazy finances this disease entails and stopped going to the doctor and stopped taking my meds.. In January I finally saw a doctor and my number were really, really bad. Like AIDS bad. my CD4 count (your immune sytem) is supposed to be at about 1000 and mine was at 5.. and my viral load was over 100,000... Imagine how lethargic and tired you are from depression and add HIV related chronic fatigue on top of that and thats how I feel every day. 
 
The other thing my dad always taught me was to stay away from sex and how dangerous it is. I'm 23 and a tall, built, pretty good looking guy but I have only had sex a couple times and I am totally haunted by every experience. I have extreme amounts of anxiety that some day I will give this to someone and could ruin their and their families lives just like it did mine.. I had a serious GF early in high school and I lost my virginity to her and I told her afterwards. She still has yet to be tested (this was like ~10 years ago now so if I did she would have had complications by now) but I still think about her all the time. But the worst one is I had sex with a girl that I knew in high school and I didn't tell her.. I was safe as I always am but I'm absolutely haunted by the fact that I didn't tell her. I feel like a fucking monster. I could go to prison for involuntary manslaughter if she has it and I didn't tell her.. She really liked me in high school and invited me to go with her to another event and I had to just tell her that I didn't like her anymore because I knew it was just going to lead to sex. I really miss her.. 

After that I just totally stopped talking to girls, and just about everyone for that matter. I hated going to bars and parties because in college there is just such a strong hook up culture and I just absolutely can not be that guy. So I stopped going out and slowly lost every friend I had, and wasn't making an new ones. 

Now My roommate left in Dec and in January I met this girl... she was a cheerleader for the school I go to and was really into me right off the bat even after I tried to back away from her as my usual defense mechanism, and for whatever reason I just decided to tell her. We started to get sexual one night and I stopped her and told her because I knew not telling her would be even worse like it was before. To my surprise she was very supportive and didn't freak out at all and we started dating. She was willing to have sex with me with protection of course, but I started to have some sexual dysfunction.. I couldn't get hard because all I can think about is this fucking virus and how I could kill this girl that I love... Shes been awesome and kept trying and since we have been able to have sex regularly so that is great, even though I totally suck at it as you can guess.. first regular sex of my life yay!

Here's the problem though.. She is graduating in may and is moving 12 hours away back to her hometown, which is 9 hours from my hometown. I really like her but its weird sometimes I feel like she is really into me.. then I wont hear from her for 3 or 4 days and my anxiety gives me the most negative thoughts every time. I just immediately assume she doesn't like me or is cheating on me or something.. I just don't feel like we have been dating long enough to do the long distance thing (I don't think I could do that anyway) and certainly not long enough to get married or anything. Basically the only way we could be together is if I packed up my whole life after graduation and moved down with her since she has an internship and grad school already lined up there.. I really wish we could be together......

Now the other problem is that I've spent all my time with her and haven't made any other friends and when she leaves ill be completely alone again.. idk what to do I've been so alone my whole life and I'm just so tired of it.. I just want a girlfriend and to be happy but I just cant ever get a fucking break.

I hate school, I'm completely alone here living by myself, broke as fuck and some days I absolutely hate myself. I have all these dreams of owning a business and what I want to do with my life but the older I get the less and less hope I get.. I don't even know why I wrote all this I just needed something, maybe just to talk to someone. Whenever my depression flares up like this I start having the worst negative thoughts about myself... I just see myself as this diseased, piece of shit that cant do anything right.. I have HIV, my grades suck, I work a shit job and still broke all the time, I have literally ZERO friends. I've even lost touch with my best friends from childhood and everyone in my family but my dad and I'm starting to be mean to him for no reason but its just the depression talking.. I've tried coming to him with all this several times but he just doesn't know what to do other than pull me out of school and get me in therapy but I feel like that will make me feel worse. I just want to graduate and get out of this shit town and start over and be a completely different person.. sorry that was so long..  ill answer any questions, there is alot I left out for time sake..

4gc32t,7,2016-04-25,"I [M25] love my girlfriend [24f] of 5+ years, but I feel like I'm wasting my life away... Time to be selfish?",throwawaychef90,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gc32t/i_m25_love_my_girlfriend_24f_of_5_years_but_i/,"This is very difficult for me to even type. I have been with my girlfriend since I was 20 years old. Now, almost 26, I'm scared that it's time to go.

There is nothing wrong with her. We don't fight ever. We don't have any major differences. I love her, and I don't think I'm throwing that word around. She's my first serious girlfriend, and I'm her first serious boyfriend. We've talked about marriage and children. I even bought a ring quite a few months back. I always thought that she was the one, not because she necessarily ever set me alight, but because it just seemed like the right choice.

I am a chef. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I am a very very good chef. My current restaurant is ranked one of the best in the whole country. I've trained under Thomas Keller, I'm heading to Sweden shortly to train at a different Michelin starred restaurant for a while, and I don't feel like I want to come back. 

Over the last little while, I've learned that I really like being alone. I don't always want to have conversation. I don't always want to make plans with people. I enjoy my alone time, but the problem is that I work such long hours (roughly 14 a day, Tuesday-Saturday), that my only available time needs to be spent with my girlfriend. 

I'm getting bored, though. Neither of us have much interest in sex these days. I don't have a high libido, I never have, but I just feel like she's becoming a roommate. I tried to set up a nice day with her today, because I've heard the advice from many people ""never stop courting"". I felt guilty for being disconnected so I took us out for a day in the mountains and got us a reservation at one of our favourite restaurants. But there was this constant thought running through my head - ""this isn't what you want.""

I'm starting to wish I could just be by myself, go travel the world with my knives and just get better and better and better. My work is my passion. I love her but I don't think I love her as much as I love my career. And I don't think I can have both. I feel such guilt for leaving her alone every night and weekend while I plug away at my restaurant. When I told her I landed an internship at a well known Swedish restaurant for 3 months, she began to cry. I feel so terrible about putting her through this, but I have no desire to settle down at this point in my life. I'm scared that I've gone too far with her.

My concern is one major thing: I love my job and I understand I am a workaholic. But I can settle down and find something corporate and spend time with my girlfriend and (maybe) eventual wife, and likely regret the fact that I pissed away my true talent to just be a 9-to-5er who doesn't find anything fulfilling about his work. The other option is, ditch my girlfriend, cook and cook and cook, and wake up one day at whatever age and realize that I had a woman who truly loved me and calmed me down, that I threw away to keep working 15 hours a day my whole life. Is it worth it?

Goals and dreams are exciting to think about, but I can't help but feel like there's no way to win. 

This is a girl I've been through everything with. She's held me when I've broken down in tears because the pressure of work was too much. She's pushed me and told me she's proud of me. But I know she's putting her own happiness on hold for me. I burst into tears as I was typing this. I don't know what to do. She's always been there for me and I can't explain the huge amount of guilt that I have right now because I don't want to be there for her. I'm selfish and I feel like shit because of it.

I guess I just need some advice, hopefully from somebody who is career driven and has tried to balance both. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: I'm a passionate chef who wants to push myself to the limits, and the woman who has always been there is holding me back, without trying to in the slightest."

1. Only math, science, and Spanish-speaking teachers are in high demand (I speak Spanish pretty well and would try and get certified in it)
2. The job market is very poor for all subjects; you have to know somebody to get a job
3. The market is oversaturated and each position gets over 50 applications. You'll never get a job unless you apply in one of the outer districts.

So I am about to graduate from college with a BS in Actuarial Science and 2 exams passed. I am an international student and knowing how hard it is for us to find jobs here I decided to look for opportunities back home (Latin America). I ended up accepting a relatively good offer with one of the largest insurers in Latin America for a full time actuarial analyst position. However, I would be the only actuarial analyst in that office, or country for that matter. Most of the company's actuaries work in a different Latin american country, where their HQ are. I will be going to their HQ for kind of like an ""internship"" first, and then I will go back to my home country to work at their office there.

They know that I am only a student who is about to graduate, and they said that that is what they were looking for as they want someone who can grow with the company. I am really excited about this opportunity but I am worried about the fact that I will be the only actuarial analyst there and do not have any previous experience as I'm only a student.

What do you guys think?

So, a little background on their relationship, since I feel like ""fwb"" isn't exactly the right term: They met about 1 1/2 years ago and worked together at a camp, where they became friends, and eventually fwb's. From a little creeping, she seems like a really nice person, and I know that she was a good friend to him. 

Now my boyfriend (of about 9 months) isn't super open with his past relationships, and it takes a little prodding by me to get him to open up about them. One day while we were talking, I wanted to know a little more about this girl just out of simple curiosity, so I asked him if he'd met anyone at camp... After an initial lie (I made sure he knew to not lie to me again after this conversation), he finally told me about how they slept together, but neither wanted to continue a long distance relationship after the camp season was over. Okay, this was cool, I was genuinely just interested about his life and I think that past relationships form you into the person that you are today. This also kind of made me feel good, because after meeting each other at an internship last sumer, we decided to pursue an LDR. We've been happily dating ever since, for about 9 months. As far as I know, he took a cross-country trip to see her once before meeting me, but I'm not sure how much contact they keep now. 

Fast forward to this morning, where I was on Instagram scrolling through my ""Following"" feed, where you can see what your friends have recently liked. I saw that he had liked a photo, and clicked on it to see what it was. It was a picture of the girl taken by one of her friends, saying that she was extremely ill in the hospital. Obviously he knows this, since he ""liked"" the post, but he didn't mention anything while we were texting this morning (not that I expected him to). I looked her up on Facebook (I know I sound really creepy by now, but I just wanted to see if I could find out what she had), and it turns out she has a bad blood infection- some people even mentioned that she was ""fighting for her life.""

I'm not sure how upset my boyfriend is about this, but he is an extremely kind person who has a lot of compassion for his friends. I know that having a seriously sick friend is scary and hard. I want to ask him if he's okay, and I really do want to know how she's doing as well. I just don't know how to bring this up without sounding like I purposefully creeped on him/her to find this out. Should I leave it alone and just let him bring it up if he wants to? Or should I bring it up anyways? Does anyone have experience with their boyfriends having sick ex's? Not sure what to do, Reddit.

I try to support them in a sustainable way, but I wish I could have helped them avoid unnecessary debt in the first place.",Family_Finances,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4gek03/im_doing_well_financially_but_many_close_family/,"My aunt used to do recruiting for a private college. The quality of the classes is no better than a community college on a good day, but they use salespeople to convince students to sign up for massive student loan debt as an ""investment in their future"". Many of the students are first generation college students, and commonly low income and self supporting. Many of those students don't have stable support structures and didn't grow up with the benefit of adults who could explain how higher education works. They want to go to college because they've heard their whole lives that the way to a better life and good career is through a college education, but they don't feel like they're capable of getting the money together or doing well in class. Obviously there is a variety of students who attend, but the profile I just gave fits many of them at a glance.

Almost everyone attending that college would be better off at a much cheaper and equal quality community college, but they never had anyone to tell them that. They had a salesperson (aka recruiter or adviser) who inspired them and said ""you *can* go to college"", ""get a 4 year degree here, it's will look good on your resume"", ""I can help you sign up for student loans and FAFSA, let me guide you"", taking on the role of a parent or caring friend, but working as an employee of the university. This process can be very good for the student, especially when there's no one else in their life who has supported them and made them feel like they could try to achieve something greater. But the cost is much, much too high.

Analytically, my aunt isn't very bright. She can't really follow the plot of most movies; even when she's paying attention she often needs us to explain character motivations and events. The running joke in the family is that when you watch a movie with her you get to provide a personalized commentary track. She engages with math, politics, finances, and religion just enough to satisfy her needs (often with help), but never at any depth. It's hard to provide many concrete examples, but she has a simplistic understanding of things. And I say that not as an indictment, but as a description of her personality. In no way does that aspect of her personality reduce her worth in the eyes of our family. In fact, she embraces it. Her aloofness is endearing, and she has other strengths to compensate. She's highly social, and very charismatic. She makes fast friends with her silly and straightforward personality, and holds onto those friends with a true sense of empathy and caring that she offers freely. Ever since I can remember, she has applied those skills as a saleswoman at various companies, sometimes making excellent money doing so.

My aunt loved working at the college. She felt like she was doing good things for her students that she was recruiting, and I know that she worked to get them the best deals available and tried to set them up for academic success. I don't know how that worked out for the students she recruited. I'm sure she has many happy customers, but I also believe that some of them didn't feel the weight of their debt or realize how little ""brand appeal"" this school has on a resume until graduating. She believed in what she was doing, and convinced her son to get his degree there when he was still directionless after high school.

My cousin and I are less than a month apart, and we've always lived close by. My brothers, my cousin, and I are all within 1 year of each other, and we've been each other's closest friends our whole lives. We're all first generation college students and had to navigate the collegiate systems without support from anyone who had been through the process. We were all figuring things out on our own. I'm the most financially successful by far. I've had unwavering certainty about my career field since middle school. My path was easy since I knew what I liked at young age, those interests happened to be in a profitable field, and I was even lucky enough to get an excellent job straight out college (which is roll of dice no matter how well you do). My loans were modest to begin with, and my income is high enough to aggressively pay them down while still saving significantly. 

I have very few friends or family who have had similar success. One of my brothers is in and out of school with about $25k student loan debt working near minimum wage part time and still has no degree and a general lack of clarity for what he wants to do. By the time my cousin got his degree, he had $100k of debt. It didn't take him long to realize that the degree he got was a just a bit better than worthless, and many employers familiar with the college actively avoid hiring its graduates because of its reputation as a diploma mill. He merely has a degree, which is enough to apply for jobs that require a college education, but it's not specific to a profitable career field and the college it's associated with has *negative* name recognition. Sometimes I get angry at my aunt for pushing him into that school, and I know he does too. He'd have been so much better off waiting until he was ready and then going to somewhere cost effective. I think we all know better now, but I can't really blame her for trying give her son an education she never had.

I only understand all of these things in retrospect. My time in college was focused on my own personal growth, mostly socially but in my career as well. I was able to get an internship and a degree that lead to a great job, I grew into a more responsible and social person, I met my future wife, and I eventually learned how to appreciate and cultivate the important relationships in my life, especially with family. Life was often hard during the 4 years I was away at university, and my introverted personality lends itself to coping with stress via isolation and introspection. I didn't visit or call home much when I was gone, and I largely lost touch with my brothers, my cousin, and much of my family outside of Christmas and Thanksgiving. Even the summers when I was home I was focused almost entirely on myself. I think you're expected to have that kind of focus during that formative part your life, but I regret not knowing what was going in the daily lives of people that I love.

I don't know if I would have even realized the mistake my cousin was making by following his mother's good intentions into that college, but I didn't even know it was happening until much later. There's not much I can do to help my brother find direction or guide my friends or family out of massive student loan debt that some of them may be stuck under for a lifetime. But even knowing that, I can't help but wish there was something I could do. I feel like I wasn't there to help and guide them when I could have been. I found a path for myself and my life is in a great place right now, but I hate seeing so many people in my family struggle financially (including other people not mentioned here), unable to save even modest amounts, barely doing better than paycheck to paycheck and scrambling to pay for unexpected car repairs or medical costs that come up. I feel guilty for having tens of thousands in savings and investments in order to pursue a home, debt-free lifestyle, and a comfortable retirement while my mom is getting visits from her landlord for late rent and she's embarrassed about asking for help buying birthday presents for my young sisters.

I've made a decision that the best way for me to help my family is to focus on my own financial health.  I want to manage the money I have control over as well as I can so that I won't have to be a burden on my family's support network that's already strained at times. And as I get wealthier I can comfortably offer more support as a part of that network. I try to be generous without condescending. I put effort into giving gifts that will last and be functional, even if it's just by giving them something entertaining so they can a bit happier day to day. I hope I can be a role model, especially to my teenaged sisters who I hope will eventually go out on their own knowing what the path to financial health looks like and believing they are capable of building a great life for themselves. And sometimes I'll still allow myself to be angry and sad for the hardships my brother and my cousins might have avoided with a bit more thoughtful guidance if there had been someone capable of giving it. But I know that I don't need to dwell too much on that sadness, because even in the hardships I know they're all finding their own ways to be happy and offer their love to each other, and the most important thing for me is to be a part of that."

I am trying to chronicle it for myself and thought of posting here. I will update it as quick as possible, I hope it interests someone with similar experience**
-------------------------------------

**Update 3 in the comments. I will repost all in one if possible. I am on trip which brought back some memories, glad people enjoyed the read**

**I wrote some more, new post as update 4.**

  
It had been a week or two since Anika had come for her internship/ training course in the city where I lived. She had married my friend Manish couple years ago in a lavish ceremony back in our home country. This was a big opportunity for her, studying and gaining work experience in the West in such big city.  Being one of the metropolis and that too in a foreign country I had naturally offered her to stay at my place.  The rents otherwise were quite high and finding a place for one person for 4 month stay would be difficult. I lived in a studio apartment, having recently finished my Master's and into my first job. The studio could barely accommodate the one bed, a working desk and couple of chairs while leaving some space to cook in the kitchenette.  It feels worse than meager now, but having my own place was bit of luxury back then. I don't think I had given consideration to practical issues of sharing a small space with a woman.


Anika was 26, a year older to me, slender build, a beautiful smile and very friendly personality [someone like this, only the girl in picture is bit darker complexion that Anika: http://i.imgur.com/zRGrSdW.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/2EX8bIQ.jpg ]. I had not known her for too long as I had been out of my country for  2-3 years by then. She had dated my friend briefly before they had tied the knot. I had met her during their marriage which I had attended and short vacations back to home. I had communicated with her for last few weeks, guiding about the visa process and general information regarding the travel etc. My help had put her as well as my friend at ease about her stay away in a foreign land. So once Anika arrived we seemed to click like good friends, with a instant rapport. I had someone to cook and share my meal with and she had a friendly face in new town. i took her around the city during first two weeks, some sightseeing and so on.


Some of the arrangements took bit of getting used to. Like, I would step out into the hallway when she had to change, as there was only 1 room. I had offered her a place to stay but the sleeping arrangements were not thought out well. The first two nights I slept on the floor, on a old sleeping bag but that was never comfortable. In mid-july, in an uncharacteristically hot summer, the one table fan I had in the room was not sufficient for the person sleeping on the floor. 3rd night Anika offered to sleep on the floor which I declined. I did tell her I will go get another fan on the weekend or maybe even get an AC soon, although I had no intention to invest in new AC then.

""Well.. We can share the bed, it's big enough. Until you get the fan"" Anika said. 

I knew that was an option but I was not the one to suggest it. I agreed as it wasn't big deal for me. I knew my boundaries; Anika was friend’s wife, a nice friend herself. I remember grabbing my pillow and hopping in the bed. The first couple nights everything was ok, barring maybe me having to hide morning wood as I got out of the bed. It wasnt such a big deal as I left for work early and Anika used to be home till late as her training was supposed to start the next week

Bit of trouble started on saturday morning. I woke up with the same sensation between my legs; only difference was Anika was next to me waking up as well. She had her back towards me, I could still smell her hair from that morning.. She wore some casual top and the thin cotton pajamas and her curvy tush was right in front of my hard-on, only a few inches away. I tried to hide my erection, my hand going down to the front of my shorts, maybe I brushed her backside as I reached down... Anika turned around and the look on her face as her eyes moved downwards made me wish I had never taken up offer to share bed. 

I tried to hide it in vain and that amused her even more, she wasn't pissed just chuckling. I could only say sorry as i got off and went to the bathroom. It became of sort of running joke for Anika and she even said during the day ""dont worry if nature takes over Yash, it will be our little secret"". 

""I dont think my friend, your husband, will appreciate it, so please keep it a secret"" I also tried to laugh off the matter. i had apologized to her already a few times that morning and I could tell she was chill about it.. 


The day went by alright, as far I remember, we went out to a music festival in the park and then Anika video-chatted with her husband. I overheard her recounting the touristy stuff she had done the whole week in US and I was glad she left out the part of changes in sleeping arrangement. At one point my friend did ask his wife how we are doing with adjusting in the room, but Anika changed the topic rather than directly answering. She did tell him about our plans of going out to a club later in the evening; there was no reason for him to deny her local nightlife. 

 Anika wore a short dress which came to her knees. The neckline was ample, giving hints of her cleavage. I had never seen my friend’s wife like this, and I could appreciate her body in that form fitting dress. We danced the night and drank quite a bit that night. To my surprise she had good capacity as far it comes to drinking, we were both buzzed but not drunk. On the train ride back to home, I remember her sliding up close to me as she fell asleep. I put an arm around her, and for anyone watching it would have been a normal couple on a night out. I was quite tired by the time we walked home around 2 am. I ended up changing clothes in the room while Anika was around, the drinks, the buzz taking away any inhibition/ caution I had shown earlier in front of my friend’s wife. Anika didn’t seem to mind, and even asked me to unzip her dress before she headed to the bathroom to change. I was too tired to walk out of the studio and wait in the hallway like I had done the whole week. 

I got myself in the bed after positioning the fan like the way I liked. The bed was full size, so sufficient for 2 people and we would usually lay at the sides/corners leaving some space between us in the bed. Whether it was the drinks, or just the small things that happened over the day I ended up lying in middle of the bed. Anika had changed into her pjs as she came out of the bathroom. My eyes could now see the outline of her curves under the dress, her breasts firm and a small but handy ass. I felt myself stiffening just at the sight and the thought of her sleeping next to me. Anika hopped onto the bed, she had to lie very close to me, our hands and legs brushing. Those touches send my cock into attention and I was glad it was dark in the room and Anika couldn’t see my hard-on. 

I decided to move to the side of bed and was surprised when Anika slid in as well.

“Thanks, you were hogging the bed, there wasn’t any space on my side” she said casually as we laid next to each other our bodies still in contact. 

I turned on my side, facing Anika, careful to not let the throbbing erection touch my friend’s wife! I could see Anika’s chest heaving up and down as she lay there on her back, her small but firm tits just half feet away from me. How could my friend let his beautiful wife share a room with another guy? Well he trusted me, rather trusted us, for sure and to be fair he never knew we were sharing a bed.

“Did you like the place” I asked placing my hand between our bodies. I knew she did, she had to yell in my ear on the dance floor so loud was the din.  The DJ was indeed good and I remembered how close we had to be to talk on the floor. 

“I loved it, far better crowd than we see back at home. Did my presence stop you from having any lady luck?” Anika asked me with mischief in her eyes. She had seen me flirting with some girl at the bar. 

“No worries, I took the number and told her I am here with just a friend” I replied. “Although the girl didn’t believe me” I added with a smile. 

Anika just smiled back. Well we were more than friends, that much was apparent by now. 

“Ok. Good night then *friend*” she said and rolled on her side, her back towards me.

4gevoy,1,2016-04-25,What else can I be doing as an in-house new IT intern at the office?,CWA_IT,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4gevoy/what_else_can_i_be_doing_as_an_inhouse_new_it/,"So basically I am a Computer Information Systems student that got hired at a really nice SMB office at an advisory firm. I don't have much experience in the tech field (yet) but I am passionate about it hence why I am going to university and studying CIS. 

Basically at the office we have about 15 people all running Dell work stations on Windows 7 Pro (optiplex towers).. Very basic setups. We have a server room with a Windows SBS, Barracuda Backup and Archiver, ASA Firewall, and some other switches and what not. My role is pretty simple... I am the ""in house"" IT guy. Mostly I am doing very basic IT work like troubleshooting easy problems and helping people function around the office. The people here are beyond nice and don't expect much out of me, so helping people is very rewarding when I succeed. It's a great atmosphere to work in and everyone is friendly and helpful.

The thing is we use an external IT management group that oversees our server and basically ALL of our equipment/computers/switches at the office. If anything goes wrong, one email or call to them they will be able to get a technician to remote in or fix the problem. Although this is very helpful to me, it does somewhat take away from my role here. They are like my lifeline.. I learn a lot from them but at the same time they are the real ""IT guy's"" while I am kind of just the office helper, if you get what I am saying. 

I consider this intern position very help desk type, which I am absolutely fine with because it's a great place to start. Some days though, with the office being small and some people work from home, it gets a little slow and I find myself almost looking for stuff to do. In the morning I can knock a few things out but then the rest of the day I kind of just staring at my email waiting for something.

My question is... has anyone been in this same situation as me and can help me out? I want to stand out and prove to them I can make a change. The managers\assistants are super nice and basically let me control my own destiny. I can propose projects, ideas, basically anything and they will listen... they want me to adapt and grow with their company. I replaced a person who was in my position for 3 years and I am kind of just thrown into the mix. What can I be doing to stand out and really ""wow"" the people at the office.

Right now I monitor the network with Spiceworks, just installed a new RSA security System (project from former employee I finished), make sure I am as available as possible for peoples needs, can troubleshoot most of the general mishaps that happen with the computers, and overall just be as polite/nice as possible.

Can anyone suggest anything that will set me a part from the rest? Help me turn this free time in to gold! "

X knows that I am looking for a full time job and he spoke to one of the presidents (let's call him O) of a well known Hospital to help me find a programming job. X told me to tell O that ""X gave me your number and he told you about me"". X doesn't want anyone to know that he's helping me find a job. The problem is that O, X, and Y know each other. O knows Y is my supervisor.

I am currently about to graduate from college and during one of my internships on another city, during my first 2 weeks, a new employee comes in. Since we're both new we sort of began to stick together because the other circles had already been formed. We began to go out to lunch together pretty much every day, hang out some afternoons in a bar and we talked about pretty much everything.

So, during the internship which lasted 2 months we became to know each other and once it was over for me we kept in touch even though I left the city. We have been talking ever since (I've nown her since January). Nowadays I'm on another 2 month internship very far in the south and we've kept messaging, she talks to me about how she doesn't like the work environment, about her coworkers and asks me for advice on stuff sometimes, hell, we even talked about our ideal mates and some other stuff. I think that I might be the only close person/friend she's met there.

Now, due to the shift system the place I'm working in has, I get some days off every X days worked so I'm going to my hometown which is close to the city she's working, when I told her I was finally having some days off she asked me to come over to see her and even offered to let me stay at her place.
Now that might sound normal considering the situation but even back then when I offered to help her after she moved to a new place she refused.

In any case, I might be reading too much into it.

The thing is that I began developing feelings for her during the internship and I am not sure how she feels about me, we both call each other cute and silly names very often and I don't know if that's just how she expresses herself or not; I am uncertain about everything surrounding this whole matter.

I need some advice on how to deal with this, I'll see her during the whole weekend and I'll be staying with her at her place, do you have any ideas in how to subtly get a clearer understanding on all this? 


   
**tl;dr**: Met an older coworker 4 months ago, got along, developed feelings now she invited me to stay at her place during my days off. I want to use that time to try to see how to proceed."

I haven't gotten a job yet because of many personal reasons beyond my control (mostly health and legal issues), but now I'm at a point where I can start.

Problem is, it's been years since I've done anything related to data structures and algorithms. I never particularly enjoyed the subject during my first year of uni, as I could never really wrap my head around things like big O, complexity, or remembering how heaps/trees/sorting algos work or are implemented. I detested having to write proofs or analyzing recursive functions. Very little has been retained from my studies since, in my mind, I felt like I never truly liked that part of CS.

That said, I thoroughly enjoy programming and have made quite a few applications and have worked on several large-scale software apps for internships before. I can understand and use design patterns and most OO principles. I just never had to use anything beyond an array(list), (hash) map, or the occasional queue or linked list in my projects, and I definitely didn't have to analyze its efficiency.

So when it comes to technical interviews, where I'm being tested on DS and algos, I end up struggling a lot. If the solution calls for a recursive algorithm, I know I can do it... but it would take me 45 minutes instead of 15.

**TL;DR**: 

1. How do I make myself strong enough in DS/algorithms to ace interviews?
2. How do I make myself *enjoy* studying DS and algorithms?
3. Are there any resources (books, online courses) you feel is the *best* resource for brushing up on these topics?"

One is a part me job at a fast food gig, and one is an internship in the field I want to have a career in (audio engineering).

The fast food place doesn't give a shit about me despite my 7 year history there.  They make me work with people who don't do/don't care about their job making me pick up all the slack.  Yet they pay them the same amount as me.  Yeah, I could always slack just like them, but that's not who I am.  Plus, it isn't fair to the customers.  So I end up working twice as hard as everyone else yet make the same amount of money.  

My internship has been going on for almost a year.  At first I thought it was going really well and my boss might take me on as a permanent member.  But more recently he's brought on a new person to help out.  I have a very, very strong feeling that soon he's going to let me go and replace me with her.  He jokes around with her.  Gives her extra work.  Talks to her more.  I mean, she IS more experienced, but I've been busting my ass for this guy for a year.  Commuting 4 hours a day, 3 days a week just to work for him.  Driving his car.  Getting lunch/groceries for him.  Helping him with projects.  And he doesn't seem to give a shit recently.  Most of the time he tells me not to come in at all.

Despite busting my hump at both of these jobs (and feeling equally miserable at both), they both pay me barely more than minimum wage.  And even though I work a combined 60+ hours a week, that's still not enough to live on my own, meaning I'm forced to live with my parents even though I'm 23.  And since I'm working so much, I have NO social life.  I have a girlfriend that I've been with for a few years, but I'm worried that once I lose one/both of my jobs and lose a huge chunk of self confidence, she'll no longer want to be with me.  Other than that, I've got no friends.  No one texts me.  No one facebooks me.  Completely alone with work that is not rewarding at all.

I've been trying to find another job in ANY field. Any at all that would pay enough to live off of on my own.  But with the degree I have in audio and the already lack of jobs out there, it's nearly impossible.  I feel like I've got nowhere to go and no one to help.  I feel like I'm going to be living at home forever working for minimum wage until I decide to walk out into oncoming traffic.

Anyone else relate to this?  Anyone have any suggestions?  "
4gffl9,175,2016-04-25,CorporateLand: Working With Working Women In The Modern Corporate Environment,VasiliyZaitzev,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4gffl9/corporateland_working_with_working_women_in_the/,"**CorporateLand: Working With Working Women In The Modern Corporate Environment**

**Introduction:**

Working with women in the modern corporate environment.  It’s not as much fun as it used to be, for both men and women, mostly b/c of SJW thundercunts.  I had a question about this a couple of weeks ago, and I expanded it into a ""CorporateLand"" post, for the benefit of guys who will spend at least part of their careers in CorporateLand.

**Body:**

There are two types of women in the office: Pre-Wall and Post-Wall.

**For the Post-Wall/Mother Hen types**, utilize ""classic"" Western chivalry. Hold doors, offer help if they are carrying something heavy, etc. They've become (or are in the process of becoming) unused to attention from men. You aren't gaming them, at all but just being helpful &amp; nice, like your mama taught you. Like a bluepill. But you don't care about banging them, you just want them to like you, and say *""He's such a nice man""* and such.

Ex. Years ago, at a different gig, I happened to come into the office in the early evening as I sometimes do - nobody around to pester me, so you can get three hours of work done in an hour - and the HMFIC's admin was working on some huge project. So after just dropping by to alert her that I was on the floor--women working alone at night can be a bit jumpy -- and exchanging pleasantries, so I wouldn't scare the shit out of her accidentally, I went about my business.

As I was leaving, I noticed she was preparing what appeared to be a rather heavy box to be used at an off-site the next day, so without really thinking about it, I offered to carry it down to her car for her. Turns out it was a *really* heavy box, but I hoisted it on to my shoulder and off we went. Anyway, that was enough to get me onto her VIP list, and I didn't realize the extent that she had the ear of her boss, the HMFIC. Also, although I didn't know it at the time, as I was still something of a plebe at that point, she's an office politician in something of a ""Griselda Blanco"" kind of way, and good at rewarding her friends and punishing her enemies.

**For the Pre-Wall/Baby Chick types**, you want to run *light* game, but never give the impression that it's anything more than ""in fun"". Because HR doesn't have much of a sense of humor. Keep it light and fun, and stylish, not overt, and NO KINO. **A lot depends on who you are.** I had a former boss who was a total perv towards women in the office, but he would get away with it b/c he was a white-haired, grandpa type. You could see women doing the math in their heads and he always fell above the age line; i.e., a younger guy would have gotten nailed for it. I'm late 40s so I can easily camouflage myself as a ""Kindly Uncle"" {N.B. as opposed to the ""Creepy Uncle; it's important} when need be. Also, at this point I've been a ""known guy"" at work for nearly a decade.  N.B. Eventually, gramps toned it down because he didn’t want to get set adrift on an ice floe.

There are of course, exceptions. If the young chick is an SJW or otherwise psycho, maintain a perimeter, and keep interactions to a minimum.  

Oh, and a final point: the young hottie types, even the marginal ones, are going to have “young hot chick privilege” rocking.  They’re used to it, and they don’t want to give it up.  Too many young women spend their time being Too Cool For The Universe only to arrive in their 30s, wondering where all the male attention went.  

**Some Sample Interactions:**

I work with an older lady, in her 50s who you can tell was smoking hot back in the day, and who many guys in the office would happily bang now. Even one of the gay guys. Or so he told me. Anyway, she and I have a very friendly relationship as we're both natural extroverts, and I'm good at greasing her deals through. A lot of the younger women in the office look up to her as a role model, thus she provides me with a TON of social proof as she's very flirty, touch feely with me in social (like after hours) situations.

Similarly, I used to work with a woman named ""Maria"", who was well-past the Wall, had four kids and had never lost the baby weight and had packed on a bunch more besides, and likely hadn't been railed out by her hubby since the first Clinton Administration. So as it turns out, I'm a singer, and she walked into the coffee room one day while I was pouring a cup and I sang the first few bars of *""Maria""* from *""West Side Story""*. Now, clearly I was just being amusing, but it did make her whole day.

Do I do this from a Machiavellian perspective? Not really. I was happy to make Maria smile, and I enjoy the sales chick's company, in addition to the social proof she provides. Life is short and work sucks. Why not have fun? And if the fun pays dividends, so much the better.

**What To Do When You’re The FNG** 
 
When you're the FNG, keep your mouth shut until you learn the terrain. These things will be revealed over time. Some people leave obvious clues in the cubes/offices, others do not.
Listen more than you speak, and proceed from there.  Find out who is reliable and who isn’t.
Avoid having a female boss if possible. If not, an older one who gets it is ok. There is a very senior lady boss where I work who I would go to war with 7 out of 7 days of the week.  Why?  Because she totally thinks like a dude.  I’m convinced she can’t wear miniskirts because then everyone could see her balls.

The real problem is communication style. Women tend to be more obtuse and say things like *""Oh whenever you get to it""*, when they really mean *""By noon, tomorrow.""* So with a lady boss, emphasize clarity. Ask for specific milestones/deadlines/etc., and things will go more smoothly.

Oh, and it's not just us. You know who else prefers having a male boss? Women. More than we do. By a lot. Why? Because women *understand* other women, and they hate each other. And male bosses are more predictable, mood-wise, etc.

Regarding direct reports, women are going to have more problems/drama, come in later, leave earlier and take more sick days. Those are just the facts. It's part of the reason we get paid more - when we do get paid more.

From the ""hire"" side of the desk, I will hire old, ugly and skilled over young &amp; big tits, because Y&amp;BT, even if she has talent, will have *DRAMA*. **You will wind up doing, or delegating, Y&amp;BT's work.**

**Women You Will Meet At Work**

**The Lazy Ho’.**  I had a CA once who was a total pain in the ass. She'd had her last boss wrapped around her finger, and was lazy as fuck. Always agitating for more money -- she knew that the last woman who had the job before her got paid way more. Of course that woman had a shit-ton more talent. 

So this chick was also rocking the 'rocker chick slut look', and she did have a nice body, but was something of a ""butter face"", etc. If you ask me, she needed a good scrubbing—and that vag had seen more sausage than a butcher shop.

She would complain a lot and I finally told her if she put as much effort into doing her work as she did trying to get out of it, she wouldn't have any problems. So when we hired her - it was the HMFIC's call, not mine – the Hens thought I would go easy on her, but when I didn't they were happy—because women *hate* other women, and, well, the CA was a lazy ho’. And when she tried to make a move on me with the Dept Chair, the Hens locked themselves into a phalanx around me, and totally had my back. Verdict: The Rebellion was CRUSHED, mercilessly.  Another reason to cultivate the hens….

You are going to find some good citizens, though. You just have to understand who you're dealing with. If you think someone is a bit sketchy, leave the door to your office open or have a 3rd person present in the meeting, if possible. Or meet in a conference room, preferably the ""fishbowl"" kind.  

**The Nosey Parker**  Once upon a time, my department had an intern who was always nosing her way into conversations that didn’t involve her.  So I took to closing the door to my office when I had the other intern, who was a chill guy, in so we could talk about sport, politics and pussy without “Little Sister” eavesdropping on everything.  

Evidently, this counted as “intentionally excluding her”.  Or so the chick from HR said.  When she asked if I was intentionally excluding her, I said, *“If you mean am I intentionally excluding her from conversations that are none of her business but that she wants to overhear because she’s nosey?  Then yes, yes I am.”*  

So I started giving her work.  And when she was done, I gave her more work.  And more.  Maybe she even did some of it, but I didn’t care, because it was nonsense, busy work but it made her feel important and keep her out of my way.

**The Sick Girl**  Women take more sick days.  They come in later and they leave earlier.  And when they have kids, they get sicker, because, evidently, there are things called “schools” or “kindergartens” in which disease ridden children play with each other in close quarters and make sure they share all of each other’s germs.  The mums bring that shit into work with them and then infect everyone else through the miracle of HVAC.

Oh, and when they are out sick or taking some child to the doctor, they will expect you to cover for them.  Free.  And don’t every expect the favor to be returned because of Briffault’s Law and because there will be some sort of dance recital or cub scout meeting that gets in the way.

**The Girl Who Can’t Do Her Job**  I hate this cunt.  HATE HER.  I left a job over one of these.  Really, it was time for me to move on to bigger and better things, but this chick Could.Not.Do.Her.Job.  But she knew that I could.  In fact, the extra work would have been easy for me, and would only have marginally added to my workload.  She also had this fucked up idea that she could *order* me to do it, and when that failed, resorted to *screaming*.  Like I’m Rumplestiltskin and I’m supposed to stay late and spin straw into gold for her…for free.

So I bailed and found a gig with fewer issues and a substantial salary bump.  And when I left, I turned back a project she had managed to get her boss to assign to me (which he could, in fact, do), with a note to the effect that I was leaving the firm, and wasn’t going to get to it before I left.  It involved approximately 7 thousand pages of review and I made sure to hold on to it, and then return it on the Friday before a holiday weekend.  Because fuck her, that’s why. /grin

**Little Miss Selfish**  Women will often wind up wanting something because someone else has it.  Any time I hint that I’m taking a vacation week, I’ve had one co-worker consistently chime in that she was “might” take some days that week.  Even if she would have just gotten back from vacation.  It’s a reflexive response or something.  

I’m not averse to changing up, with enough notice, i.e. before tickets are bought, and I try to avoid school vacation weeks that my co-workers might need.  In one case, I flipped the week before Labor Day to the week after because school was starting or some shit, and one of my co-workers wanted to spend the last week of the summer with her kids.  It wasn’t a problem, and she *asked*, so no biggie.  But now I just take the days I take and everyone else can deal.  Seniority, muthafuckas.  RHIP.

**The Flirt**

Y’know those Attention Whores on Instagram?  Yeah, well, a lot of them have jobs and you might wind up working with one.  Don’t fall for her *“who, me?”* flirting and come-ons.  She’s just looking for validation.  It’s not worth your gig.  

And yeah, *“But lots of people bang co-workers!”*  I did, too.  I used to have a regular thing, long ago, with an admin I worked with who pretty much had the Rear of the Year.  My flat was close and she was DTF, so we’d bop over to my flat once or twice a week and have some fun, always leaving and arriving back separately.  **Important Point:** if you must bang someone at work, pick someone with more to lose than you have.  My “work plate” was engaged.  There was an understanding that the Fun Would End before her wedding, and it did.  Now she’s married and we both work at different places and AFAIK, her kids were all fathered by her husband, who is a TOTAL betbux.  He was also worried about me, big time.  She told me about it, once, after sex.  So I said, *""What does he have to worry about?  I'm only fucking you.  He can have you back when I'm done,""* and she giggled.  

Even the ""Good Girls"", fellas...even the 'good' girls...  

**The Queen Bee** - Often the admin...excuse me... *executive* admin for the HMFIC, such as the one I referenced when introducing the concept of the Mother Hen.  She might also be the Office Manager, or another senior admin.  Ex.  At the place I left because of the chick who couldn't do her work and expected me to do it for her, there were two Queen Bees, neither of whom were the CEO's admin - the CEOs admin was untouchable, but didn't participate in office politics.  She was sticking around to retire when the CEO did, so she could play golf full time instead of part-time.  How powerful was she?  She *named* the fucking company.  So she was too busy up on Mount Olympus to be bothered.  

Meanwhile down among the plebes, there was the Office Manager - she had a swankier title which I don't recall - and the admin of the 3rd or 4th ranking guy at the firm.  I'd put him at #3, but depends on how you rank the General Counsel, who was a cagey guy, but more like Templeton the Rat - a survivor, for sure, but outside of the power structure.  Anyway, she was Employee #4.  Their battles were *epic*.  I had a cordial relationship with the OM and was tight with the other Queen Bee, so never had a problem.  On the rare occasion that I got crossed up with the OM on something, I just had the other Queen Bee take care of it, because she always loved twisting the knife.  

**This Is Important**

Determine which are “good citizens” who can be counted on.  Take care of the admins – someday you are going to need a friend.  You always want to keep a positive balance in the Favor Bank.  

I used to joke that, if I ever announced that I cut off my girlfriend’s head {plate, really, but not a distinction I made at work} then Suzanne {my admin} would appear with a hatbox of the appropriate size, dispose of the evidence, and never speak of it again.  You can’t buy loyalty, you can only inspire it.

**Conclusions**

-Identify the “good citizens” and cultivate them.  Reward your friends, punish your enemies.

-The Mother Hen types often have more power than is evident on the surface.

-The Baby Chick types are susceptible to game, but keep it professional.

Currently I'm in city college working on getting an associates degree in computer science, many people I know have told me, and I feel like an associates degree with computer science would be just fine. As long as you work hard and know what you're doing. 

My goal is to get that associates degree, and then take an ORACLE course that will give me a certificate for more experience on my resume, and hopefully land an internship after, and so on. 

Do you guys think it would be totally normal to get an associates degree instead of a bachelors for computer science, there is so much information online, that I feel like going to a university for an extra 2 years would be a waste of time. 

Thank you!!"

4gfvw6,7,2016-04-25,Posted at 2 AM reposting to see if anyone will see..,imtrying3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4gfvw6/posted_at_2_am_reposting_to_see_if_anyone_will_see/,"Well this is going to be a story but here it goes... I'm going to just start at the beginning.. When I was 6 months old I was diagnosed with HIV. Couple weeks later my mom was diagnosed with AIDS. She died when I was 10 and I have absolutely never healed from that. But my childhood was actually really good. I'm an only child and my dad has always been there for me and been very supportive, and today he is literally the only person I really have. But he always taught me that I needed to keep my Virus a secret because if anyone found out everyone would find out and some people will ridicule me for it. This gave me serious trust issues from the very beginning. I grew up with the same 5 best friends since I was in 1st grade and to this day only one of them knows. So besides my mom dieing, my younger years and high school were pretty good. I always had friends, would go out every weekend, played sports and all that, and was pretty popular.
But something happend when I went to college... Freshman year was good, I lived on the campus and made a bunch of friends and had a relatively good freshman year. But at the very end right before finals I got arrested for possession of marijuana and Drug paraphernalia... I'm writing this 5 years later and I absolutely recognize this event as the beginning of my depression. The biggest thing was my financial situation. It was VERY expensive for the lawyer, and the bail, and the ticket, and to this day I have never felt ok with money.
That summer I hated myself I felt like such a shitty person, and was very broke and for whatever reason decided to transfer schools and go somewhere else. I think I just wanted to start over. This was also a huge mistake. I went to another school and it was just not good for me and this is where alot of the bad depression started for the first time in my life. I was very broke, addicted to weed (still am, Ill get to that), and ended up living alone at 19-20 after my roommate left and went to another school and I had no one else to live with. Stayed there for about a year and a half and decided to take a semester off and not go to school and go back to my dads house. This time was ok but not very fulfilling. I was working at a jimmy johns but I was alone with no friends there.
I was VERY close to just not going back to school but decided to go back the next august to the same school I started at and roomed with a great friend of mine that I met freshman year. Again things really started to look up. I was making some friends, had a seriously good relationship with my roommate and was much happier. Then I had a little argument over something stupid with a guy from our group of friends and they totally just stopped talking to me and my roommate. This is group of friends number three that I have lost since Ive been in college..
Then the worst happend.. My roommate and literally everyone i knew here graduated in December and I've been living alone again since he left.. I'm horribly depressed, I hate school, I have literally no friends except this girl I'm seeing (ill get to her in a minute) and its just so extremely hard to keep going..
Now, lets get back to the HIV. This has totally ruined my life. my numbers have always been pretty healthy but I wasn't supposed to live over 14.. About 2 years ago I ran out of insurance and could afford the crazy finances this disease entails and stopped going to the doctor and stopped taking my meds.. In January I finally saw a doctor and my number were really, really bad. Like AIDS bad. my CD4 count (your immune sytem) is supposed to be at about 1000 and mine was at 5.. and my viral load was over 100,000... Imagine how lethargic and tired you are from depression and add HIV related chronic fatigue on top of that and thats how I feel every day.
The other thing my dad always taught me was to stay away from sex and how dangerous it is. I'm 23 and a tall, built, pretty good looking guy but I have only had sex a couple times and I am totally haunted by every experience. I have extreme amounts of anxiety that some day I will give this to someone and could ruin their and their families lives just like it did mine.. I had a serious GF early in high school and I lost my virginity to her and I told her afterwards. She still has yet to be tested (this was like ~10 years ago now so if I did she would have had complications by now) but I still think about her all the time. But the worst one is I had sex with a girl that I knew in high school and I didn't tell her.. I was safe as I always am but I'm absolutely haunted by the fact that I didn't tell her. I feel like a fucking monster. I could go to prison for involuntary manslaughter if she has it and I didn't tell her.. She really liked me in high school and invited me to go with her to another event and I had to just tell her that I didn't like her anymore because I knew it was just going to lead to sex. I really miss her..
After that I just totally stopped talking to girls, and just about everyone for that matter. I hated going to bars and parties because in college there is just such a strong hook up culture and I just absolutely can not be that guy. So I stopped going out and slowly lost every friend I had, and wasn't making an new ones.
Now My roommate left in Dec and in January I met this girl... she was a cheerleader for the school I go to and was really into me right off the bat even after I tried to back away from her as my usual defense mechanism, and for whatever reason I just decided to tell her. We started to get sexual one night and I stopped her and told her because I knew not telling her would be even worse like it was before. To my surprise she was very supportive and didn't freak out at all and we started dating. She was willing to have sex with me with protection of course, but I started to have some sexual dysfunction.. I couldn't get hard because all I can think about is this fucking virus and how I could kill this girl that I love... Shes been awesome and kept trying and since we have been able to have sex regularly so that is great, even though I totally suck at it as you can guess.. first regular sex of my life yay!
Here's the problem though.. She is graduating in may and is moving 12 hours away back to her hometown, which is 9 hours from my hometown. I really like her but its weird sometimes I feel like she is really into me.. then I wont hear from her for 3 or 4 days and my anxiety gives me the most negative thoughts every time. I just immediately assume she doesn't like me or is cheating on me or something.. I just don't feel like we have been dating long enough to do the long distance thing (I don't think I could do that anyway) and certainly not long enough to get married or anything. Basically the only way we could be together is if I packed up my whole life after graduation and moved down with her since she has an internship and grad school already lined up there.. I really wish we could be together......
Now the other problem is that I've spent all my time with her and haven't made any other friends and when she leaves ill be completely alone again.. idk what to do I've been so alone my whole life and I'm just so tired of it.. I just want a girlfriend and to be happy but I just cant ever get a fucking break.
I hate school, I'm completely alone here living by myself, broke as fuck and some days I absolutely hate myself. I have all these dreams of owning a business and what I want to do with my life but the older I get the less and less hope I get.. I don't even know why I wrote all this I just needed something, maybe just to talk to someone. Whenever my depression flares up like this I start having the worst negative thoughts about myself... I just see myself as this diseased, piece of shit that cant do anything right.. I have HIV, my grades suck, I work a shit job and still broke all the time, I have literally ZERO friends. I've even lost touch with my best friends from childhood and everyone in my family but my dad and I'm starting to be mean to him for no reason but its just the depression talking.. I've tried coming to him with all this several times but he just doesn't know what to do other than pull me out of school and get me in therapy but I feel like that will make me feel worse. I just want to graduate and get out of this shit town and start over and be a completely different person.. sorry that was so long.. ill answer any questions, there is alot I left out for time sake.."

4gg4cv,2,2016-04-25,I'm so lost and don't know what to do. (School or transition),MiunaStealthAcc,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4gg4cv/im_so_lost_and_dont_know_what_to_do_school_or/,"Heya, this post is probably going to be a little messy since I'm tired and can't sleep (living in EU, 1am here). I'm sorry, this might seem a little out of topic, but I'm so lost and depressed and I could use some insight.


I'm currently a student, in 3rd year of a 5 year graduation in an IT school. I've been struggling with gender for a long time now, and questioning whether i should transition or not since I've learned about it 10 months ago.

I want to start HRT but my 4th year will bring me to South Korea and I'm afraid that won't be easy for me to find an endocrinologist there and get HRT prescriptions. On the other hand, i'm getting more and more demotivated by my school ; the first few years were nice, but it's turning to topics that i'm not so interested in, and I can't really bring myself to keep doing this. Furthermore, they require me to get a 4 month internship to pass this year, and I'm so depressed I can't function enough to get out of my bed ; I don't see how I could get up every morning to work with a bunch of strangers in something I don't like. Now i'm sure I'd like the courses of my 4th year since it's about video game development and it's what i'm passionate about, I just don't see a world where i'm not feeling miserable because of my pre-HRT state. Also I kinda don't want to start transition later, as passing is really important to me and I'd like to have the most chances.


I could also leave school now and start transitioning. Ultimately my goal would be to transition and work on indie video games, and I'm fairly confident I could do that for a living after a few months / one or two years of work. The thing is my parents won't quite support me if I choose to do this ; they think i believe i'm transgender because of childhood trauma or the likes and i'd regret it, which could be true (i don't think it is but who knows). I'm currently living off their money, with close to no income of my own, and they told me they'd stop giving me money if I left school. I guess I could find a job to try to get money, but as I mentioned above for the internship, I'm so depressed I don't think I could keep a job schedule for long.


I'm so lost. I feel like I'm at a crossroad of two impasses (if that makes sense in English, uh i'm tired) and I don't know what to do. Everyone tells me to keep going through my studies and worry afterwards about transition, but I literally can't stop thinking about it ; I'm getting more and more depressed to the point where i'm starting to have suicidal thoughts.


Also I can't take a year off, there's too much preparation for the 4th and 5th years in the 3rd year that I'd have to do it again.


Has anyone ever been stuck in that situation? Or even if not, what would you suggest?


Thank you very much."
4ggajr,252,2016-04-25,Tech Insecurities: Part I,Most_Humble,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4ggajr/tech_insecurities_part_i/,"A few people had asked for some details regarding a job I've mentioned a bit in commenting, and I finally had some downtime to try and write out my experience. As any astute redditors will find, this is a ghost account, and I've changed names that would link the two. I'm aiming to have this told in 4-6 parts, so bear with me.

**The Intro**

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT. 

Details have been altered for readability, names have been changed to protect the innocent and the guilty, and any similarities found to real events are *completely* unintentional. 

Our cast of characters:

* Myself: fresh college grad and PFY

* Susan: HR and classmate from college

* Dave: Owner of Orangered IT

* Jack: Senior support tech

* Arnold: Support tech manager, ex-Army Drill Sergeant (unconfirmed)

* Randy: Developer

* Jim: Security specialist

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part I**

I'd interned with a security group in Orangered for two weeks while I was finishing college, and got along great with the team and was quite happy when they said to apply for an opening in another team when I finished my degree. 

I was a naive, poor college graduate, finally getting out of retail and excited to get to work with something I enjoy. I put in my 2-week notice to my previous employer and had some paperwork to sign once I was on site for my first day. The phone interview went well, and I was ecstatic that I would be getting a living wage finally! I was a little worried I might not like my new team, but the wage increase and the work was too much of an improvement to my situation not to leap towards.

A frigid February Monday morning found me sitting in the HR office with the company owner (Dave) and our HR gal (Susan). I'd been referred to this company by Susan, as she had been taking some general Ed classes at the same school as me and we'd worked on a few group projects. This was the first I'd met Dave, and he came across strongly. 

We reviewed workloads, after-hour support, expected schedules and tasks. Finally, I was given the official offer letter to sign. I saw the rate, which was SIGNIFICANTLY lower than what was said over the phone interview. I inquired about it, and Dave smugly said it was the standard rate given for a 3-month period for new employees. After the first three months, I would get a raise (which would put me over the stated rate on the phone, not at). Things didn't seem to add up to me, but I'd already left my previous job, I didn't have it in writing, and if nothing else this gives me some experience in my field. I reluctantly agreed. 

&gt; Hey dummie, you didn't get *that* in writing either. 

Susan walks me over to my desk, and mentions Dave can be 'tough to the new guys'. I've still had the excitement stolen from me, literally and figuratively. Here I meet my new 'team': Jack, our senior support guy in his mid-40s whose been with the company for its entire 7ish-year life. He's munching on crackers as he tries to say 'Hello' and waves.

Susan says that, though Dave is the owner, I would be working with Jack daily and I'd report weekly to Arnold, the support manager, but he was out due to car troubles but would arrive soon. I figured, after I got into the group and showed promise things would get better.

Jack had gotten a tower setup with my domain account and an IP phone on my desk that was dark. Cracker crumbs are all over. He had a post-it not with my password on the monitor, and I logged in. 

&gt; Wait, this wasn't set to *have* to be changed at first login? And they're giving me domain admin rights on my main account instead of a separate one?

Next, I find the real issue: no Internet. I ask Jack if the network is down, and he says it's fine. I take a closer look at my new desk and find the network jack -&gt; IP phone -&gt; tower, but there is a rollover cable being used instead of a straight-through. A quick swap and I'm online. 

&gt; Is he *testing* me?

Afterwards, Jack decided he'd show me the building, have me meet the other workers: there was our support team of just us, two security teams and a single developer for an internal software tool, with a few extras for managerial positions like HR, Accounting, and a dedicated Training Coordinator. At this point, it was about lunchtime and Jack treated me to a local restaurant I'd not been to. 

As we returned, I saw a guy ride into the lot on a motorcycle. Remember, this was a freezing day in February, snow still on the ground. This guy came in, black leather jacket and bald head with no helmet, goatee. Typical pissed-off look. Due to the weather, his whole head was purple. Jack waved, ""Hey Arnold!""

Though he looked really intimidating, Arnold was really respectful and said his car had broken down on the way here. He only had his motorcycle, and there was aISP changeover happening today he had to be here for. 

&gt; Well, I'm still not confident Jack knows his stuff or is messing with me. Probably best to do it yourself.

It is clear he's the real network administrator here, and was the one who set up the organization's infrastructure. He showed me the unlocked server room, where we had a few dedicated servers and four other dedicated client servers onsite across a couple of racks. A battery backup for the client servers is connected, but laying on the floor instead of mounted in a rack with everything else, even though there's plenty of room.

&gt; This room was unlocked. THIS ROOM WAS UNLOCKED!?!?!

He tells me I'll mostly be doing remote support for Healthcare client, among a few other clients, and there's a lot of legal material to read through. I'm to spend the rest of today and tomorrow reading through that, and then I can help with the ISP changeover midweek.

*Flash forward*

I've finished reading through HIPAA, and am asked to work my first ticket. A nurse lost a file. Simple enough, I just need to know where this file was located, or a file name, and I can do a restore, right?

* Client network is on a separate network, which I do not have credentials for.

* Nurse needed it yesterday, client is in office waiting for it. 

I call, and try to get some background on it. Nurse was on her work PC, opened an excel sheet from Outlook and was working in it. She kept hitting Save, and closed it. She went back to the email when the client arrived, tried to open it and found none of her work saved. 

&gt; Thank the Dark Lord their server is offsite. 

Since I'd just been given the account and wasn't familiar with this client's network, more creative measures were needed: I found the temporary storage Outlook uses, and there was a temp file of the spreadsheet she had been working on. I was able to copy it to her network drive, renamed, and worked fine. Ticket closed, client is happy.

End of day, I receive an email from Dave: 

'This file was not backed up per our standard procedure. Investigate root cause and test backups.'

4gghd1,3,2016-04-25,I need some advice on choosing the right college.,Corsair911,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4gghd1/i_need_some_advice_on_choosing_the_right_college/,"Hey guys, I hope this is the right subreddit for this. 

I am a high school student who is about to graduate high school. I love toying with electronics so I'm fairly sure some sort of Electrical/Computer Engineering is what I want to do. As of now I've narrowed it down to two colleges: The University of Arkansas Fayetteville, and Hendrix College, but I'm unsure of which I should go to.

At Hendrix I would be playing a sport and enrolled in the 3-2 program because they don't offer engineering; I would have to choose to go between Vanderbilt, Wash U in St. Louis, or Columbia University for my last two years. From what I've heard they have had a student (from Hendrix) get accepted for internships with Google and Amazon. 

At the University of Arkansas, I wouldn't be playing a sport, however I would get my engineering degree in 4 years because they offer engineering. I'd be rooming with classmates from school who will be going into different fields.U of A hosts an annual job fair for freshman through senior that include a large variety of employers (apparently even Google as been attending from what the UofA rep said).  

I love my sport and I would put all my time and energy (when I am not studying) playing for Hendrix, but at the same time I understand that I probably wont be going any farther than college, so I can live with my senior year as my last year to play. 

I just want to be put in the best situation to succeed as an engineer, but between these two schools, I'm not sure which one would be best for me."

I know there's a problem.,Jbeegs14,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/4ggtmk/need_help_finding_myself_i_know_theres_a_problem/,"I think it started with weed... I like it way too much. I've been smoking religiously ever since 12th grade. I guess know it's catching up to me.

Everything has gotten worse. My grades, my health, relationships with others.It's been the root of so many empty commitments; letting down the ones who care and love me the most. Blatantly lying to my parents. But this problem has been chipping my life away very gradually. Although, this slope is becoming exponential as of late. My performance in one of my courses has warranted a meeting with the department chair. Right now is so FUCKED UP! I can't blame anyone but myself. It's been taking a tole of my grades the last 2 years, which is preventing me from getting an internship this summer. I have so much potential. But I truly think the weed is holding me back from a good future. I really wish I could start over but since I can't, what should I do to change things 180 degrees? Would rehab help? Or is it mental toughness? My life ultimately is worsened by this yet I still continue. My sex life, ego, social indulgence, my moods, fatigue. Do I need to hit rock bottom before I start recovering?

I was just wondering if you guys could give me some pointers on what to academically pursue during my freshman year? I know NASA is the holy grail of internships and careers, but there's got to be something they look for? If I have to choose between devoting my time to a club or to research, what should I choose? 

Also, on a broader scale, there's a very good chance I'll pursue a MS after undergrad. What should I focus on to increase my opportunities when grad school admissions come around?

Let's assume I'll be studying EE (I'm really not sure yet)"
4ggxy8,1,2016-04-25,"Waiting ~3 weeks for background check for an internship, dates/salary not finalized, what do I do?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4ggxy8/waiting_3_weeks_for_background_check_for_an/,"Hi r/Jobs! So I applied and interviewed for an internship for a large agency a while back. Three weeks ago, they emailed me saying that they'd narrowed down their selection of interns and that the background check would be the final step in the selection process, which would be conducted by HR. So, I sent the completed background check form to my main interviewer on April 6th. I thought the check would take around a week, and then we could finalize the dates and salary for the internship. Well, it's been nearly three weeks and I still have no confirmation about the background check. I did follow up last Wednesday at the 2-week mark asking about the progress, and I got a response a few minutes later that he'd check with HR (still haven't heard back about that yet).
I was just wondering what my course of action should be at this point. I'm interning in NYC starting in late May (hopefully) so I need to secure the dates so that I can finalize housing. I'd like to be able to discuss the details of the internship with my supervisor soon just so I can get my plans ironed out. And my records are clean, so I'm almost certain they won't find anything that'll elicit a rejection. Is there a way I could ask my supervisor to at least finalize dates with me? Or should I try contacting HR directly? Or just wait it out? Any advice would be be appreciated!"

My grades weren't stellar but I graduated with a 2.88. Unfortunately, I didn't get to do a co-op or internship.

Around where I live my choices are either factory, fast-food, or retail.  I've had my resume reviewed and updated numerous times but I'm still not getting call backs from places I'm applying to.  I'm also within an hour's drive of two major cities.

I'm thinking about joining the military to help pay for school and hopefully get me some job experience because it's one of the only things I can think of to do now.  The only issue is that it wouldn't be officer because I just missed the 3.0 cutoff.

Do you have any good ways to get that first job experience other than military or any other helpful advice?  "
4gh6s8,14,2016-04-26,he can keep his money - Part I,deathloser,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4gh6s8/he_can_keep_his_money_part_i/,"I've been a gynecologist for 15 years and I have never seen a case like this before.

In fact, ever since this happened, I have been reconsidering my line of profession. I know what you're all thinking; ""What fucked up vagina did she see to make her quit like that?"" As professionals, doctors don't respond to crude party jokes like that. I have no idea really why I'm telling this story, but I can't stop thinking about it. I'm hoping somehow things can be worked out in my head if I write them down.

That day, some of my interns were helping me out in the office. I had a private practice at that point, and one of my guys was filing some documents behind the counter. At this point in my career, we were extremely busy. We had patients coming in and out, and I'm guilty enough to say that might not have been the best medical technique. Anyway, Abdul hands me a folder.

""I referred a friend of mine to you. I'm not sure if that how you do it here, but she really needs your help... She heard I was working here and begged me to get her an appointment ASAP."" He blurted all this out, very sincerely. He just started working there a few weeks prior, so he must have been nervous to ask for a favor. However, Abdul was a great worker who I looked forward to working with.

The way he said ""she really needs your help"" immediately struck me... But I couldn't find a reason not to see her. To be honest, I was also just ready to satisfy my curiosity.

""Oh, really? Do you know what her concern is? Is it extremely urgent?"" I opened the folder and examined her paperwork. 

""She should just tell you herself."" Abdul shut the drawer and started towards the waiting area. 

I was in the examination room when a couple entered; a tall young man and a young woman with him. They were both extremely good-looking. Like a perfect pair. They were smiling and offering handshakes.

""I'm Rob, thanks so much for seeing us,"" the handsome man gripped my hand.

""Katie. We are so lucky to see you."" The young woman gave a tight-lipped smile. I offered them seats as I clicked my pen above my clipboard. Since the two of them came in together, I kind of expected what this would be about.

""We're trying to get pregnant,"" Katie said, becoming tearful. ""We haven't had any luck, and we've been trying..."" She started to lose her composure, so Rob took over.

""We were wondering if you could let us know of any other options."" He started to rub her back to comfort her. 

This lady seemed so desperate to have a baby RIGHT NOW. Katie started weeping quietly as I started going over the basics of assisted reproductive technology. Of course, we would have to figure out which method was best after examining the both of them. 

""There could be a million different causes,"" I started. ""From low sperm count to blocked fallopian tubes. We could start with some non-invasive tests to figure out the issues.""

Then Katie got up. Rob seemed a bit surprised, but stood up too as she said, ""Okay, thank you so much for your time... We will keep all that in mind."" This all was in less than ten minutes as this girl was booking it out of there. 

""Hold on, we can start with some examinations right now,"" I tried to catch up with her, but I felt too dismissed to take it any further. They paid the co-pay and got out.

Abdul brought it up later. ""Thanks for helping me, doctor.""

I wanted to say that I didn't do a single thing, but I was over the whole thing. I took on the next stream of patients.

I forgot about the whole thing until about two months later, I got a personal letter mailed to the office. It was strange, because I never get things like that. Inside was a note from that couple, announcing to me that they were pregnant. They wrote that they were so thankful for my help, and that they'd name their first-born after me.

This was all really fucked up. First of all, I wasn't even a fertility specialist. Secondly, I literally did NOTHING to help them. I wouldn't have even remembered them if it wasn't for how abruptly and rudely they left. Abdul found the letter before I threw that shit out, saying ""Doctors really do make a difference..."" wistfully. 

The next day, he comes into my office and hands me the phone. I don't really take phone calls like that - making appointments goes through the secretary. If he was giving it to me, it must have been important.

""Doctor ---- speaking,"" I tucked the phone between my cheek and shoulder as I sifted through paperwork.

""Hi doctor, it's me, Robert ----. Do you remember me from a few months back?"" His voice was much less optimistic than I last heard.

I put my pen and papers down and took the phone into my hand. I just felt really exasperated for some reason.

""Of course! What can I do for you?"" 

""Well, I was wondering if you got our letter...""

""Yes, I did. Congratulations, Mr. ---, I wish the best for your new family.""

""Right. So, Katie took a pregnancy test and it came out positive. Her belly has gotten a bit bigger, but the thing is, there's no way I can be the father."" He sighed into the phone, hard.

This is what he wanted a personal phone call about? 

""There are several options for paternity testing--""

""No, no, I don't mean like that. I mean like, we've never had sex."" 

He paused to let that sink in, but I didn't really get at what he was saying at all. I was just a doctor - just look at people's bodies and talk to them about that. They never had sex? 

""I don't really understand--"" 

""Look, I don't really want to be a part of this anymore. Good luck."" Click. I tried to ask him what the fuck he was talking about but he hung up. 

I sat there staring at the wall, looking like an idiot until Abdul came back in and took the phone. He said solemnly, 

""Katie is here for the ultrasound.""

I didn't even KNOW I was scheduled to give this lady one. But here we are in the ultrasound room of the downstairs radiology clinic, she's on the gurney, waiting for me. Abdul observes quietly in the corner of the dark room as the technician, Abby, kindly informs her of what's gonna go down. Katie looks giddy at her first experience. I wondered if she knew about the call Rob just gave me. Things were getting more and more strange. 

Abby, the sweet lady she is, asks Katie a whole bunch of questions about what she wants to name the baby, and all that shit as she gels her belly.

She explains how ultrasound is completely noninvasive, and how it's not that hard to become a technician. Katie bullshits back at her, saying that she came from Providence and moved up here to be with Rob and her ailing parents. She says Rob is the best man she's ever been with and is so happy that he is her baby's father. Abby smiles in passive listening, sliding the wand over her abdomen.

I can't see the sonogram at this angle, but I can see Abby's smile fall faster and faster. She adjusts the wand and the ultrasound over and over, squinting her eyes at the screen. My chest starts to tighten because I've never seen this happen before.

She finally set the wand down, and asked in a forced-composure voice, ""Doctor, can I speak with you outside for a moment?"" Abby looked up at me gravely. She got up and waited for me in the hall before I could even answer.

""What's going on?"" I asked in hushed urgency.

""Laura, that's not a baby.""

""Of course it's not a baby - it's not even three months yet.""

""No, I'm telling you. You KNOW what I mean. Act normally, and look at the sonogram again.""

We went back in, and there was Abdul, listening to Katie's useless cheerful baby banter. She chatted insistently at him as he closed his eyes, arms crossed. Abby turned my attention to the screen and pointed, as she shifted the wand.

There was no mistake of it. I had seen this kind of image when my dog was sick. Rocco would get into the garden and swallow anything that would fit in his mouth. I looked over and over again. I was 100 percent, completely certain of it. This woman's stomach was bulging, full of rocks. 

I didn't understand it at all. I tried not to panic, and realized this woman must be completely insane. I rushed took her upstairs again to have a pelvic examination. Was she forcing them up inside herself? 

Katie was starting to sense my urgency. She also grew a little concerned. Was she fucking faking it? 

""Is my baby okay?"" She put her ankles up on the stirrups. There was no baby. There was never a baby. I was playing back Rob's phone call in my head: 'Good luck', he said. He doesn't want to be a part of this anymore?

Then, I was fucking shocked. I looked between her legs with the light shining on her, and I shit you not, I almost fucking fell over. This Katie had a fully formed, anatomically normal penis attached to her pelvis, right over her testicles. She was absolutely in no way a hermaphrodite or Intersex either, as I mustered the composure to investigate further. 

I'm in no way biased against anyone who is transgender, cross-dressing, or anything of that sort. As a doctor, I hold myself to a non-discriminatory standard. But to not have a vagina or uterus, and pass as pregnant with a stomach full of stones? I was beside myself. She should have been in extreme pain, and in the emergency room. Katie just kept pleading for me to let her know what was going on. I rushed out and snatched the phone.

He picked up on one ring. ""I should have told you freaks to stop calling me.""

""What kind of sick joke is this?"" I was so angry. They were wasting my time and killing themselves over it. ""Are you in on this? Did you set her up to do this to herself?"" We are not allowed to talk to people about our patients, but this woman seemed mentally ill - it could turn criminal, and I was so angry.

""Listen, I told you before, I'm out. Oh, and tell that Indian weirdo he can keep his money.""

4ghc0j,2,2016-04-26,"Thinking about taking next semester off, what should I do?",YoungClassic,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4ghc0j/thinking_about_taking_next_semester_off_what/,"First off I would like to say that I'm not even 100% sure that I have depression, but I have been experiencing symptoms ever since December.  I am a Junior college student that is usually a go-getter academically, but this semester has really been something else.  Academically I have maintained a scholarship and a GPA of 3.5.  I have a lot of good things going for me and I know that, but I can't seem to shake this.  Here's what's going on:

It started this past winter break (December) when I was basically isolated in my house with no real interaction with others.  I was smoking a lot of weed, sometimes drinking myself to sleep, and spending all day on a computer game.  Time didn't really matter and I would sometimes go to sleep at 7AM and wake up at 6PM.  I was ashamed of this, but I still continued to do this.  During this time, nothing seemed very appealing to me and I basically felt like a waste of space.  I had family I could have seen, but I didn't reply to them and basically kept to myself.  I am almost certain that my mental decline began during this period.

The semester eventually started and I knew I wasn't ready for it.  The past semester had taken almost all the effort I could expend and I knew this would be different.  I started decently for a few weeks, but then abruptly fell behind on assignments, missed classes due to sleeping too much/through my alarm, failed tests because I haven't studied this semester, and basically blew off many necessary things I needed to do.  I was also drinking more on the weekdays and staying up late with my girlfriend.  She doesn't have nearly the amount of workload that I do and is basically able to skate by just fine.

My girlfriend and I had a falling out during the semester, but at this point, things are very much back on track.  She is a great source of relaxation and love, even if we can annoy each other sometimes.  We have been dating for three years.  When we had a little break it was excruciating for both of us.  My parents were very supportive during this time which leads me to believe that they may be a little more understanding than I make them out to be.

One great thing that happened during this semester is I formed a band that plays my original material.  It feels amazing to lose myself in that and we have had some great experience with performances.  Due to this though I have the constant thought that what I'm doing right now is holding me back from what I really love.  I know it's almost impossible to make it as a musician, but if I could have the chance I would take it instantly.  Being famous would never be a requirement if I could ride that dream for ~10 years and then live low/middle class for the rest of my life.  I really want it.  Lately I haven't had as much time to dedicate to it and I feel as though I might never.  

During this time, my parents also started drug testing me.  This was due to them not wanting me to spend their money (I don't have a job and they support me) on drugs which I 100% understand.  I have a great feeling that I will never be able to connect with them and be honest with them due to how they would react if they knew what I've done/been doing.  This drug testing has made me feel even farther from them even though I know why they are doing it.

My parents have also put pressure on me by pushing me to research/apply jobs and internships for my future.  Completely reasonable and even helpful, but I can never pull myself to do it and I end up putting it off.  This leaves me feeling overwhelmed when they ask me about it and I have literally no reason as to why I haven't been working as hard as I know I should be.  I just put everything off and let these expectations overwhelm me.

One good thing that happened recently is I've found a great full-time job for this summer that is in my field.  I have a lot to do in order to set it up, but I know if I try I can do it.  It almost seems like a saving grace at this point. 

During this semester, I've felt completely detached from what I am learning and have very little interest in it.  I love my major, but I am taking classes that are extremely unnecessary.  On top of that, they are extremely difficult, and not classes that you can put off and end up with a C in.  At one point I was often walking my bike home holding in tears to come home, light a cigarette, and drink a beer.  I wouldn't get drunk, but I would end up wasting time anyways.  I was feeling very angry.  Now I just feel melancholy and overwhelmed.

I tried to get help from a college counselor and even had the first session, but they didn't take my insurance.  They referred me to other therapists, but I was feeling a bit better so I didn't seek them out.  About two weeks later I'm back where I started at feeling completely unmotivated and helpless again.  I tell myself that I'm ""falling apart"" once or twice every day.

That's a little bit of background, but at this point, I'm pretty certain that I'm failing two of my major classes and barely scraping by in almost every other one.  I'm not sure if this is going to affect my scholarship, but I know there is a great possibility that it will.  I have some big projects I haven't even started on and writing this I'm still digging myself into a deeper hole.  I didn't do anything that I intended to today and feel like I'm headed towards the impending doom of this semester.  I have also gained weight and stopped caring as much about my health.  The word I have come up for how I feel at school is ""hellhole rat race"".

I feel like a spoiled brat knowing the opportunities that I have that I'm not taking advantage of.  I feel like major depression disorder is much more serious and that I am lucky for what I have even if I feel unhappy.  This makes me not want to talk to people about it and often I never have the words to express unless I write it out.

This leads to my original question:

Should I try taking the next session off?

During this time, I would be working this full-time job.  I may even pick up another job if necessary or I feel the need to use more of my time.  This is unlikely because I will be wanting to work on my music, but I may need to in order to pay bills and eat.  I fear that the next semester will be the same and I will waste even more of my parent's money.  My mom and step dad are wealthy, but my father is middle class and works very hard to support me knowing he doesn't have to.  I have done some research and there have been some positive results.

If you have actually read this and have any advice for me I would be very thankful.  Feeling pretty helpless right now and I have no idea what to say to my parents.

I will technically only be in the area for half a year so I would prefer it to be on the super low end, but I could get away with a little higher in which case the car would have to last a while and be ok for a long-distance trip (NY to GA) when I go home.

I don't care how many doors are on it, but some space for cargo when I leave would be nice if it's towards the upper end of my range.

my price range is 2k-5k.

I have never learned how to drive stickshift sadly, so automatic is kind of a must

As I said above, the car will mostly be used to commute (probably only an hour or 2 a day in the near future) to my internship.

edit: even knowing what a good year and mileage would be would be super helpful, also I've found that jeeps and ""tall"" cars are a little more comfortable to me. Not enough that I would mind small cars, but if that helps anyone help me...

Anyways, I am currently a Junior year undergrad at an HYPSM school studying Math related field with an okish GPA of ~3.5.
I see all of my friends/girlfriend getting great internship offers from (Google, Facebook, JP Morgan, Bain, etc) and having great prospects for careers/future. Even my high school friends are posting about their internship offers. Yet I still don't have a SINGLE internship :( Every time someone talks about summer plans I feel crushed. 

I tried really hard during on campus recruiting and got to couple super days/final round interviews , but did not get a single offer. I am still frantically applying to whatever I can find online, but at this point in time its really tough, and000 I still haven't had much success. 

School is ending really soon and I don't even know what to do this summer. At this point, since Junior year internship is so important, and if this years recruiting is any indication I feel so screwed for full time employment next year. 

Furthermore my immigration status is really making things uncertain for me. I am from a poor immigrant family, so much so that I qualified for enough aid to go to school for free (which I am really great full for). However, my fathers health (he had to get surgery recently) has really put a great financial strain on my family (my parents have 0 savings to speak of and work very low paying jobs), and I just feel so anxious that I won't be able to support them. 

I know this post may sounds like a privileged college brat, but everyday I just feel so depressed, anxious, with low self esteem in general. I just feel disgust and contempt in myself that I am not able to meet expectations."

4ghsam,8,2016-04-26,The importance of an internship,Shelby02,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ghsam/the_importance_of_an_internship/,"Hello,

I am a computer engineering student in Europe, and throughout my studies (5 years) I need to perform three internships. My first one was in a 3D and VR apps startup in my local area, I've been there for 3 months. Now I need to perform a 6 months internship and I need to make a choice. 
My dream career is to be a software engineer in the US, and I think what big companies will look at first in my resume is my experience.
I have found two internships yet: 
Web developer in Seoul.
Software Dev in my local area. 

I really want to go to Seoul because I have friends there and I want to experience the life there. Also, as my dream job is abroad, it could be a nice experience in my resume to have worked in Asia. 
On the other hand, it's web development. It is not very technical, and I won't learn a lot. I have learned about web Dev on my free time when I was younger and already have used the tools I need to use for this internship. I'm over qualified for this internship.
The software dev one will teach me a lot of things and I'll write in my resume that I used the languages I'm currently learning, etc. 
The salary of the internship doesn't really matter.


So here's my question (tl;dr):
What would you chose between: 
- A challenging internship near your home when you want to leave your country 
- A not very challenging internship in South Korea, but a country you really want to go live in for a couple of months and shows on your resume you're ready to work anywhere?

So I'm in the UK doing a Masters in HCI though and my classes are over, my course isn't technically finished until late September (exams and dissertation submission - fun!), and graduation isn't until January 2017. I'll also be doing a UX Research internship from June - Dec. Whenever I search for information for how far in advance one should look for a job before graduation, people always say the farther in advance, the better. 

So...I've been applying for full time positions quite a bit now and have had companies calling me back to interview, but it makes me nervous because it's April and I'm not free for work until end of December, beginning of January. I just recently had a phone interview with a great company that said that I came off really well and they'd put me forward, but after talking about my upcoming internship they needed someone to fill the position right away, and couldn't consider me. I never apply for positions that say they want someone to start ASAP, but it seems like that's what most companies are looking for when they post a job opening, even if it's not explicitly stated. 

I definitely don't want to waste anyone's time, but I'm also afraid of missing out on jobs. One of the other companies that called me to interview is similarly amazing, with great pay, and I'd hate to miss out on it because I made an internship commitment when they want to hire. 

What do you guys think - should I pump the brakes and hold off on putting out more applications until December/January?"

Last semester (fall), I was at school at Belmont University in Nashville for Audio Engineering as a freshman. It was great- I love Nashville, and had a ton of opportunities to work shows around the city during my semester. I was only in 1 class that was for my major (AET), and it was an introductory, very basic course. The problem is, I absolutely suck at school. All throughout high school and even now, I suck at school. I have a very difficult time going to classes that don't have anything to do with my interests, and even my one AET course last semester was challenging to attend, because it was all repeat information to me. Ultimately, I decided to come home this semester so I wouldn't waste any more money by failing three classes, getting a ""D"" in another, and barely scraping by with a ""B"" from my AET class.

Now I understand the value of a college education, and the doors it can open in one's future, but I really just don't think a regular four year college is a place I will ever be successful at. 

As far as my experience, I have been a tech at my church at home in Chicago for a few years, as well as the church I attended in Nashville, often mixing monitors. Additionally, as I said, I worked a good amount of shows in Nashville, usually as just a PA, but occasionally as monitor engineer. This summer I have an internship at a church in Charlotte well known for its production value.

My goal: To be a touring engineer. Whether it be FOH, monitors, systems tech, anything really. I just want to give people a better live music experience.

My question: Where do I go from here? Do I try to get a job at a production company in Chicago? Does my experience in the church realistically mean anything to those outside of it?

tl;dr: Left school after a semester, 4 year college isn't for me, lots of HOW experience, limited tour experience-&gt; What do I do next?"

My name is Matt and for the last year or so I have seriously considered changing careers and transitioning into the world of mobile app development. Over the last three months, I have started programming every night when i come home from work. I spend the majority of my free time taking online classes, tutorials (Udacity/Udemy/Coursera etc), as well as reading highly recommended Java and android Dev books. I can honestly say i am thoroughly enjoying it, and often find myself getting really excited over simple apps that i am making. I love how creative I can be, as well as the problem solving aspect of programming. Having said this, I have a few concerns to make this transition that I thought I would share with the community.

Let me give you a brief background on my situation. I am 29 years  old. I hold a Masters of Science in Cancer biology and have 4+ years of experience as a scientist. Currently, I am making decent money and have been told by my hiring manager that I am due for a salary increase as well as a title promotion. However, I can't find any excitement in this field any more. I have no more passion for science.

Although I am taking these courses, I am a little skeptical on how difficult it would be for me to get my foot through the door in an app development company. Sometime towards the end of the year, I will be moving back to London, UK (Currently living in the US). I aim to have developed my portfolio, as well as increasing my knowledge in Java and Android dev. Do you guys have any advice for my preparation? Any useful links or personal experiences would be appreciated. In my opinion, the best option is to apply for andriod development internships when i head back to London, but those are usually geared for computer science students. 

Thanks in advance!

**WHO THE HELL?**
My name is Moath Lowahi, I am a 18 years old game developer(-wannabe) and a hobbyist game designer from Morocco. I started programming at the age of 12. I have a big passion for video games, AI and computer graphics. Since I'm from a traditional Moroccan family, my parents didn't supported me to go further in this field, so I had to teach myself making games relying only on the free content available on the Internet, mainly: tutorials, devlogs and opensource game projects. Trial and error played an important role in the learning process.
I do game engine programming, graphic programming (OpenGL), AI programming and general programming. I use mainly c/c++ (My favorite programming language) and python. Additionally, I know javascript, lua and a bit of java. I use Visual Studio to make games and software. I prefer data driven architecture over object oriented paradigm (Something I learned the hard way). I made a video game entirely in c++ using OpenGL (link: https://moathmakesgames.itch.io/retroarcadeshooter) (some may consider this a shameless advertisement, so I would like to apologize in advance). Arabic is my native language, I speak both English and French (and a bit of German...).

**WHY THE HELL?**
As there is no university or institutes here, in Morocco, that provides an advanced formation for young gamedevs(again: -wannabes), (or there is?) studying abroad (in Europe) seems to be the only valid option if I want to continue in this domain. However, I will not be able to do such thing without any fund/income source, such as a part-time job, internship or a scholarship.

**WHAT THE HELL?**
I submitted this thread seeking both your advice and any helpful information you (dear reddit-er) can provide me with in term of scholarships, universities/colleges where working and studying is a an option for someone with my (very) humble skills... or anything that works! seriously..

**THE CONCLUSION.**
Finally, this thread should be useful not only for me, but for many student out there who are in the same situation. And, of course, Thank you for your attention and your time.

4gjf1s,4,2016-04-26,"[For Hire]GIS, Linux, and LAMP stack web developer, with public policy background.",meldroc,denverjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverjobs/comments/4gjf1s/for_hiregis_linux_and_lamp_stack_web_developer/,"Well, here I am, putting my shingle up, and maybe hoping for a little bit of advice.

My background is a little different than most computer geeks. I have both a tech background and a liberal arts background. I moved into the Denver area when I went to grad school. Now I'm done with school, with a master's degree in public administration, and a GIS certificate. I took a GIS class to keep my tech chops up, and liked the field enough that I went and got the certificate. Maps are cool, and GIS analysis is even cooler!

I already have a little GIS job experience, in the form of a research assistantship, an internship with the Sierra Club and a capstone with the City and County of Denver, where I've used my GIS skills.

On top of that, I have about five years in IT, working at places like Hewlett Packard, doing things from helpdesk &amp; tech support work to software development. I specialized in Linux programming, so I have a lot of experience with Linux (I've worked with Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, and Suse), as well as C, C++, Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash and other Unix shells, and PHP. I've also been working on my database mojo, having worked with MySQL and PostgreSQL mostly, though I've had the chance to tinker with Oracle. What's really fun is putting GIS extensions into these databases to give them map mojo (PostgreSQL + PostGIS...) I've worked freelance here and there putting together WordPress/LAMP stack web sites, mostly for little state and local election campaigns and nonprofits.

Part of what drove me back to school was because before, when I just had the computer science degree, I ended up put in software testing/QA work, and got a resume full of testing/QA work, which got really tedious and burned me out. Let's just say I want to do my coding on other types of projects.

As far as the liberal arts background, I also have a bachelor's degree in political science, and a master's degree in public administration, with a concentration in environmental policy, management, and law. Yes, I got bit by the politics bug.

Right now, since I've been out of the working world for a few years, going to school and putting more letters on my name, I'm trying to break my way back in, with the goal of first getting something, ideally a GIS/coding job in the public sector, ideally protecting the environment (OK, so I'm a little bit of a hippy). Down the road, well, there's a point to getting the MPA - I want to move up the ladder, say into project management, or if I get a job in government, get into administration there. In short, I want to start leveling up. I like the idea of eventually having a title like ""Director of IT"".

The GIS job market's been really hard lately, and we have the Saudis to thank for that. We're all going ""WOOHOO!"" because we've been paying $1.60 a gallon for gas, but the oil and gas industry here in Colorado's been laying a lot of people off. Including a lot of GIS wizards with 20 years experience. Granted, being an environmentalist, I'd feel pretty guilty if I ended up working for an oil company plotting out fracking operations, but at the same time, I'm at the point where I can't be too picky.

Lately, I've been spending time figuring out the ...ahem... uniqueness of USAJobs, to see if I can get a federal job - I'm just a hop, skip, and a jump from the Federal center in Lakewood, and I wouldn't mind working for BLM or the Forest Service, or for the Dept. of the Interior. I also would love to get a job, say at NCAR, or NREL, or NOAA, be it here in Denver, or in Boulder. I've also been trying at various state and local governments, though it's pretty hard to get work there.

But right now, I need work. Money's running thin. I've got skills, and I've been putting out resumes, going to networking events, and trying to get my name out there, but I haven't gotten offers yet. I'm trying to figure out how to get my ""in"".

So, If you need a GIS and Linux wizard, who also does public policy, shoot me a PM and I can send you a resume, a link to my portfolio site where I have my capstone papers, and a bunch of maps (and it's also a WordPress site that I put together.)

TL;DR: GIS, Linux, and WordPress/LAMP developer, AND a public policy wonk, offering his services to those with a paycheck, and ideally a good cause."

I have already graduated college with a B.S. and plan to get a PhD. I have already enrolled in a PhD program starting in the Fall of '16.

My company does random drug tests. The company is a decent size and my stay is only 6 or 7 months so I rolled the dice and smoked weed anyways. I got called for a random piss test yesterday (yep Monday after 4/20, who knew) and surely I failed (did not get results back yet).

I am particularly good with numbers and have proved myself to be extremely valuable. I am seen as a well above average employee. I solved an issue in 4 months that has been going on for over a year. I am worth WAY more than I am paid and I'm aware of this. I went to my boss and told him I failed a piss test and will most likely be fired.

My boss went to the head of the department (who has seen my work and respects me) to see if theres anything that can be done. Even though a failed piss test is automatic termination, the head of the department said he would try and convince others that I should be excused as I am simply a college kid crunching numbers on a computer all day (and I was planning on leaving in july anyways) - rather than a factory worker who could potentially injure someone.

I am unsure what will happen as I'm waiting for the higher ups to discuss. I'm ok with losing my job as I will just move to graduate school - I'm financially fine. The company actually needs me more than I need it.

If I do get fired - can I request to be allowed to resign on my own? That way I don't have to tell future employers I was fired in the past or have to cover it up. Should I just quit now to save myself from being fired? Is it possible to quit seconds before you are fired? This is a small company that I will never require a reference from, however, its the only company I ever worked for. The company does not do work in the area of research I will pursue in graduate school.

Interestingly, I am presenting my project to the company in two weeks - so it will be very damaging if I am let go before then. I think this makes them a little hesitant to fire me as well.

I'm in a weird place mentally, any advice or words would be very appreciated. I know smoking weed when I'm under a random drug test scenario is stupid but hey, I'm just living my life ya know?"
4gjq9i,1,2016-04-26,No one actually knows me.,somesadchick444,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4gjq9i/no_one_actually_knows_me/,"Over the last year or so I have realized that I truly am the black sheep in my family and no one knows anything about me. No one cares. I've been so emotionally abused that I'm petrified to tell my boyfriend anything about my life. Hi reddit, help me open up. 

I was born to parents that had intended to be a one night stand, my mother 8 years older than my father, she already had two children and was living with her mother, having recently separated from her abusive alcoholic husband. Neither of them wanted a child but my mother didn't have the heart to get an abortion. She told my dad many times throughout her pregnancy to leave, however he stayed. My mom starting renting a home and he moved in.

My father rushed home from work when my mother went into labor. I was born that stormy August of 1996, both parents hoping for a son, but it was a daughter. it was a daughter with red hair to which my father referred to me as ""the devil's child."" 

As an infant, my mother worked 3 jobs and my father couldn't be bothered. my 10 year old sister took care of me. She is the only family member I had a relationship with.

During the day I would stay with my father's mother.

Growing up I was all alone. I had no friends and no one to play with, so I turned to art. I wanted so badly for my parents to love me, showing them masterpiece after masterpiece. They just lay on the table with rings from coffee cups and food on them. My parents talked to me as an adult. My father is a schizophrenic and an alcoholic, I was always called names, beaten, yelled at and smacked for crying. The time I did spend with my mom was special, as she was secretly pagan or wiccan... I'm not sure. she used a ouija board and did practices with me to ""enhance"" my ability to sense spirits. This had continuously plagues me my entire life. but as a small child in a historical haunted home, I had spirits to play with. As a reader, you can believe what you want, but ""Pinchy"" was my best friend.

One day when I was in kindergarten, My father was taking me to my grandma's house. He locked up and said he would be just a minute in the basement. I said ""okay daddy, hurry, I have to pee!"" he said he would. I was standing outside in the cold for 40 minutes and I peed myself. he cane out of the basement and burned me with his cigarette, and proceeded to beat me. I wasn't allowed to change clothes. I had to sit in my mistake. That day I went to my grandma's, but I never made it to school.

Around age 5 my sister got a job and I was truly alone.

as if my parents ignoring me wasn't enough, my grandma ignored me too. My grandma also told me ""pinchy"" wasn't real. Slowly but surely, my only ""friend"" went away.

My uncle, my father's brother, has always had trouble. first with alcohol, then with drugs. He would come over to my grandmas house and beat her and yell at her and break things to get money. Only when my grandpa wasn't home. I liked my grandpa. He was like a protector, no one was mean to me when he was there. he would play with me and talk to me like the child I was.
Anyway, I thought emotional and domestic abuse was normal most of my life. sometimes my grandma would lock me in the closet until he left or I had to stay in the dark basement so he would think we weren't home, but he would bang on the doors and windows all day. I'm terrified of the dark.

As this progressed, my grandma would drive him to go get the drugs. I would sit in the back of her musty mustang for hours in the heat and in the cold, alone, outside of crack houses. Sometimes I would have to go in. as a little girl, I was raped on several occasions. No one cared. 

On friday nights I would sleep over at my grandma's house. Mostly because my parents didn't want me. They told me constantly. My uncle stored his things in my room at my grandma's house. Many a time I've woken up to him shooting up my my night light. Many a morning my grandma would wipe things off of my dresser. When I was about 6 I had a piggy bank. I so badly wanted to go to college to be a veterinarian. I loved animals so much. They were always nice to me and always wanted to play. I had been saving my small allowances and change I could for months. I had about $50, which, I thought vet school was $100. I was convinced that was like a million dollars. anyway, he stole it, and I said ""It's okay, he needs to go to college a lot sooner than I do!"" 

My grandma bribed me with food to not tell my parents anything. I have since struggled with eating disorders my entire life from binge eating to anorexia. I am now 19 and weigh 230lbs due to my current binge eating disorder.

Since no once cared, I never had clean clothing. In second grade I was constantly teased for being smelly. I only had two pairs of underwear that fit because my mom told me she's not buying more, I need to loose weight. As a second grader I had to figure out how to do wash by myself. But, if it was found out I did was more than once every two weeks, I was beat. I learned to hand sew my own underwear.

I had finally made a friend (who is still my friend today, who still knows none of this) despite constant teasing and bullying.

Backtracking, my kindergarten teacher was always awful to me and I feared school. However, school had emotional abuse, at least I wasn't being hit. My kindergarten teacher would pick on me and make fun of me with the class for my art, and when they went to extra classes like music or art I had to sit in the dark classroom alone. She always made sure I went to gym and would publicly announce that I wouldn't be having snack or drink that day, but I cup of water, because I was fat.

I never learned to play kickball, and when I moved to my new school where I had made my first real friend, no one would teach me. I hot hit with the ball and kicked off teams many times until I just stopped trying. I stopped wanted to learn, and I would go sit alone.

In 5th grade my mom learned from HER druggie brother, my other uncle, that I was sitting outside crack houses. My mom asked me about it but I didnt really tell her anything. I took a layoff from work so I didn't have to spend my summer at my grandma's house. I thought she did this out of love, however she blamed me for our family's growing debt every day. This same year, although my sister had been moved out for a few years, my sister moved very far away. I was mad because she always promised she would take me with her, that she would take me out of this mess. I only saw her on holidays until I was 16.

In 6th grade I had more bully teachers. But I really resorted to art. I distinctly remember painting a graphic picture that included a bloody noose, but no one batted an eye. That year I was diagnosed with clinical depression. Medication helped, but my parents decided it was too expensive and bullied me out of taking it. 

In middle school I again, had no one. I started purging after my binge eating and I wanted to have friends so badly that it turned into full on anorexia. although, I was so heavy that everyone praised my weight loss. I was severely depressed and would come home from school and sleep until the next morning. My dog was my only friend. Slowly I found music. I loved marilyn manson. I so desperately wanted him to be my father. Sometimes I lived with my cousin and aunt. I dyed my hair dark red from blonde and dyed my clothing black. I started wearing heavy makeup and I got teased even more. in 8th grade I made some friends who were also ""alternative"" and I felt like I belonged somewhere. I started to feel better. I had teachers that encouraged me in art and writing. I wanted my parents to be proud of me. I joined colorguard in the marching band. 

As I entered high school, drama ensued. One again, I lost my close friends. but at least I still had band and the colorguard girls. My mom would constantly complain about taking me to and from practice. these were my friends, this was my passion, other than finding my way to any concert I could. I was in love with  music and film and I had one very supportive film teacher. I always asked my parents to come to practice or football games or our state competitions. They never came. Not once. All the other band kids had their parents there, but I would just sit alone in the bleachers. I did this so my parents would like me and be proud of me. To treat me like a human being. But no. They didn't want to. they didn't want to see. Plus, I was bullied out of art classes. Eventually I quit. I quit and I smoked and sold and insane amount of weed. Weed was my life. Weed made me feel okay. Weed also made everyone your friend. weed also made me enough money to go to shows, by food and clothes I needed that my parents wouldn't. Weed gave me other couches to sleep on.

My senior year I went to a technical school. I didn't know anyone there. I went for film, but we learned a lot of media. My teachers Loved me, My class loved me. I was the class clown and the class therapist, and no one knew I was high. that I self medicated. I loved my life and I fell in love with photography, even going to a state photography competition to represent my school. My dad no longer hit me and only emotionally abused me, my mom was almost proud of me. I was promised an internship when I turned 18 with a local famous photographer.

Just before I graduated my dog died. She was my best friend. I held her in my arms as she passed away, the only constant in my life, now gone. I was diagnosed with anxiety and tried a number of medicines. I started binge eating again. No one would teach me to drive. My online boyfriend and only emotional support of three years left me that same day. I had been saving to move across the country to live with him when I graduated.

My parents put their foot down to another dog but I got one anyway. I named her Cricket. My parents were furious and I had to tell my dad I was suicidal (which was true) to keep her. I didn't previously include it, but prior to this I had struggled with self harm when my father stopped beating me and I had attempted suicide 4 times. 

I graduated high school and technical school with honors.

The summer came, and that stormy August I turned 18. the studio the promised me an internship stole my model and told me to go fuck myself.

My friend I had met through twitter and concerts invited me out to a show. Where she introduced her friend to me who I had been crushing on for 3 years now, since we were at all the same shows. he lived the next state over. I jot a job I could walk to, I had my puppy, and now this guy I crushed on for years wants to travel to come see me. so of course I said yes. He came alright. He stole my first kiss, not that I had minded at the time. He seemed like a nice guy. A nice guy 6 years older than me. Maybe he could save me. from my nightmare. this same summer I again began to struggle with anorexia. 

That day he came and took me away was like heaven. Although at the end of the date or what I thought was I date, I felt forced into giving my first blowjob. I could have probably said no and he would have been fine. But I didn't think that way then. I thought ""if he takes me out then he owns me."" obviously I wasn't brought up correctly.

Despite that upsetting me, he would come once a month, sometimes twice to see me. eventually I let him take my virginity.

Soon after that he took and unexpected flight across the country to visit friends. I found out he had sex with the minor he was visiting. I then found out he was having sex with other girls the entire time I thought we were together. I thought he loved me. But I was wrong. Painfully I had to cut it off. I don't think he understood.

I was kind of fucked up. I started talking to a lot of boys and trying to make a lot of dates. I had this mentality that I wanted to fuck guys and then leave them feeling used, how I felt. Men have always been my enemy. I wanted to hurt them.

My now boyfriend was one of those guys I wanted to hurt. I fell in love with him instead. We've been together for over a year now. He wants to know me but I'm so afraid. I don't want him to leave. I don't want him to judge me or hate me...I'm struggling with binge eating again and I hate myself every day. He is the only person I really have. He and my dog are my constants.

I don't know what to do.

thanks for listening.

Just wanted to write up another post to get some fresh views on the situation with some new information.

My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half now. For the first half a year, it was long distance, until she came home for the summer from school and I moved to her college town and into my very first apartment this past August. 

She was emotionally and verbally abused by her father and stepmother and so struggles with anxiety and depression, which she takes Sertraline for. I've talked to her about the sexual side effects of Sertraline, as well as the fact that it honestly appears to simply not be effective for her. She went to the doctor after much coaxing, but her doctor shamed her for not seeking counseling and then upped her dosage.

In addition, she is dealing with her family (mom, sister, grandmother, three dogs, four cats) moving across the state, her upcoming graduation and a 10 week internship which requires that she first go to Penn State for training and then back down to South Florida for the actual work, and finally is stressed about being able to find a job in time to start paying back her student loans. The idea of sex now even scares her, apparently. She has, I believe, an irrational fear of pregnancy even though we double up on contraceptives (She's on the pill and I always wear a condom). This could be because we had a few conversations in which she asked me how I would react if she were to accidentally get pregnant and I answered honestly that I would be initially unhappy but would come around to it and stay with her and the kid. She agreed she would also be unhappy initially, but I guess the ideal answer for her from me would be that I would be overjoyed at having a kid in my early 20s? I don't know. She has also had several past relationships where she was broken up with because she wouldn't have sex with them, these were all high school relationships, though, so I discount them, because some people simply aren't ready then, but they still color her interactions with me, obviously. She has told me that, since she knows I get disappointed when we don't have sex, it makes her more anxious about having sex or being intimate, since she doesn't want to disappoint me.

All in all, this all means we now have sex less than once a month. I'm not pushing the issue or initiating because I understand all of the factors that could be contributing to it and hope that after things calm down it will come back, but I worry because:

A) She's known for a while that she needs to return to counseling and won't because of money issues (her family is fairly poor), but has not done any research on avenues for free or reduced counseling, which I'm sure her school provides, since it's fairly prestigious.

B) She let her doctor up her dosage on a medication that could very likely be helping to kill her libido and admits that she really doesn't feel any different on this higher dosage than she did before.

C) Life might get a little less stressful for her than it is now after she graduates and starts her career, but not much. Adult life is stressful and if stress kills her libido, that doesn't bode well for a long-term relationship.

After she graduates, she'll be moving back to our home state and in with her family until she finds a job and home elsewhere. 

As for me, I dropped out for school a couple of years ago this May, but am returning to our home state to finish my Bachelor's degree this fall, which means we will once again be long distance, but close enough that it would be trivial to see each other every week.

I love her, but as much as it kills me, I'm prepared to break up with her if she does nothing within the next year to try to help herself (by seeking counseling, trying a different medication, reducing her stress by becoming financially stable and keeping a regular schedule) or if she does all of these things and it turns out that she simply has a very low libido."
4gk7gp,1,2016-04-26,[f4A] A world were all girls wear diapers,little_switch,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4gk7gp/f4a_a_world_were_all_girls_wear_diapers/,"Hey there I did this role on a different profile before and thought I'd try it again.  If you're not into diaper, watersports, and maybe some light scat then this role isn't for you.

Anyways this is a pretty open role, and can basically be anything that fits into this hypothetical world I'm making.  It's mostly like the real world, but in this one all women need to wear diapers.  Gender roles are mostly the same they are in the real world with the exception that women are supposed to wear diapers their whole lives, and men are expected to do most the changing.  Really other then immediate family, and some lesbians women don't change each others diapers.

There have been a few cultural shifts in modern time though.  Back in the day a man could go up to any woman he wants to reach under her skirt, and check her diaper then tell her she needs a change.  Women often don't realize when they've went so this was pretty handy.  Now a days many women prefer to be asked first before a man checks them, and often only by someone who's at least a semi-close acquaintance.

There are some women though who still prefer the traditional values, and get embarrassed when a man asks to check her rather then just taking the initiative to do it himself.  Also the new way of things has a pretty big flaw in that if a women wets herself when no men she knows are around, and she can't find a police officer, or local business that still offers that service they she might have to walk around wet in messy until she gets home, or a stranger offers to help her.

On the other extreme you have some feminists that have this idea in their head women shouldn't have to wear diapers.  This is especially common in colleges.  By the female students who's heads get flooded with ideas, or sometimes even professors who preach these lies.  The truth is that some women can have mild success with potty training, but sooner or later she's gonna have an accident, and it might not just be going number one.

As you can see the social conventions around diapers are a bit more complicated in the modern time then were in the past.  Also there is a kinda free use thing with this world too.  Everyone still has to consent, but casual, and public sex are pretty common in this society.  Basically asking a woman to have sex is about as easy as asking her if she wants her diaper changed.  If fact it's pretty common for the two to go together.  Most women her happy to show their appreciation after a man helps them with their problem.

Finally since this is AgeplayPenPals sexual partners with significant age gaps is an option.  While there is still a certain taboo around incest, and pedophilia there is nothing illegal about either, and they're really at most frowned upon.  No age limits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So like I said I'm not limiting this to any one role.  It can basically be anything that fits in this universe.

A family role.  A man performing his fatherly duties of changing his wife, and daughters, or maybe it's time the son learn to step up, and help with changing his mother, and sisters.  It would be nice practice for when he's changing his female friends, or some day his own wife.

There are roles involving grade school through high school.  Male teachers who have to change their female students, and even the other female teachers.  Eventually the boys reach an age where they can help to.  They even hone their diaper changing skills in Home-Ec.  Also it's a pretty well know secret that many teacher take up the job since they fancy children.

Once in college you have all those feminists trying to give up their diapers.  You might hit it off with a cute girl only for her to make a big mess when she has an accident with out her diaper.  Be you professor, or student it might be up to you to teach her the error of her ways.  You might even try to get the female professor filling the girls head with these ideas to see how wrong she is.  God forbid you little sister was coming over to visit, and they tried to fill her head with these ideas too.

There are also work place scenes.  You having to stop what you're doing to change one of your co-workers diapers.  Maybe the new intern, or maybe even your boss calls you in to help her with a real stinky one.  It could also be your job to help all the women with their diapers so everyone else can keep working.  If you worked a customer service job it could be any woman who walked in too.  Now just imagine if it was Take Your Daughter To Work Day also.

A simple role of two people just going on a first date would be fun too.  Is she an old fashion girl who wants you to just reach back, and check her, or would she rather you ask first.  Maybe she'd rather the one of the wait staff help her until she gets to know you better.  Worse what if she's one of those feminists who isn't even wearing a diaper.  Don't forget age gaps aren't off the table.

Most the things I've come up with a pretty f4m focused.  If you have any f4f, or, f4t I'm pretty open to those too.  I'll even do any T4A if that's what you want.

4gkans,2,2016-04-26,[f4A] A world were all girls wear diapers,little_switch,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4gkans/f4a_a_world_were_all_girls_wear_diapers/,"Hey there I did this role on a different profile before and thought I'd try it again.  If you're not into diaper, watersports, and maybe some light scat then this role isn't for you.

Anyways this is a pretty open role, and can basically be anything that fits into this hypothetical world I'm making.  It's mostly like the real world, but in this one all women need to wear diapers.  Gender roles are mostly the same they are in the real world with the exception that women are supposed to wear diapers their whole lives, and men are expected to do most the changing.  Really other then immediate family, and some lesbians women don't change each others diapers.

There have been a few cultural shifts in modern time though.  Back in the day a man could go up to any woman he wants to reach under her skirt, and check her diaper then tell her she needs a change.  Women often don't realize when they've went so this was pretty handy.  Now a days many women prefer to be asked first before a man checks them, and often only by someone who's at least a semi-close acquaintance.

There are some women though who still prefer the traditional values, and get embarrassed when a man asks to check her rather then just taking the initiative to do it himself.  Also the new way of things has a pretty big flaw in that if a women wets herself when no men she knows are around, and she can't find a police officer, or local business that still offers that service they she might have to walk around wet in messy until she gets home, or a stranger offers to help her.

On the other extreme you have some feminists that have this idea in their head women shouldn't have to wear diapers.  This is especially common in colleges.  By the female students who's heads get flooded with ideas, or sometimes even professors who preach these lies.  The truth is that some women can have mild success with potty training, but sooner or later she's gonna have an accident, and it might not just be going number one.

Finally sexual partners with significant age gaps is an option.  While there is still a certain taboo around incest, and taking young lovers neither is illegal, and they're really at most frowned upon.  We an talk ages in private.

Interns at Silicon Valley get pays up to $120k a year plus bonus plus housing seems insane to me.

Regular employees pay is double, triple, or even more than that.

How does that make any sense?

Why does the tech industry pay so well? Was it always like this? Is this a tech bubble about to burst?"

I have both a tech background and a liberal arts background. I moved into the Denver area when I went to grad school. Now I'm done with school, with a master's degree in public administration, and a GIS certificate. I took a GIS class to keep my tech chops up, and liked the field enough that I went and got the certificate. Maps are cool, and geospatial analysis is even cooler!

I already have a little GIS job experience, in the form of a research assistantship, an internship with the Sierra Club and a capstone with the City and County of Denver, where I've used my GIS skills.

On top of that, I have about five years in IT, working at places like Hewlett Packard, doing things from helpdesk &amp; tech support work to software development. I specialized in Linux programming, so I have a lot of experience with Linux (I've worked with Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, and Suse), as well as C, C++, Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash and other Unix shells, and PHP. I've also been working on my database mojo, having worked with MySQL and PostgreSQL mostly, though I've had the chance to tinker with Oracle. What's really fun is putting GIS extensions into these databases to give them map mojo (PostgreSQL + PostGIS...) I've worked freelance here and there putting together WordPress/LAMP stack web sites, mostly for little state and local election campaigns and nonprofits.

Part of what drove me back to school was because before, when I just had the computer science degree, I ended up in software testing/QA work, and got a resume full of testing/QA work, which got really tedious and burned me out. Let's just say I want to do my coding on other types of work.

Here's the thing. I've been in school for the past few years, instead of being a full-time coder, but now that I'm out, with some new letters after my name, I'm looking to get back in the business. So, If you need a GIS, WordPress, or Linux developer, shoot me a PM and I can send you a resume.

In the meantime, take a look at my portfolio website at http://dougholland.com/. It's an example of the kinds of WordPress sites I've put together for clients, and it has my master's capstone project and some examples of my GIS work."

Thank you for sending your CV to _____. She forwarded it to me and a look at it revealed that you have very interesting experience. 
Unfortunately, the technologies that we use extensively, and which are absolutelynecessary for the developer positions we are looking to fill, are C++ and Python. 

&gt;With your permission, I would like to keep your CV for future reference. Also, please feel free to send me updates of your CV, should you gain additional work experience in C++ and Python.


  Some background for myself: I'm a sophomore studying computer science and sent a letter applying for an internship for this summer. I am studying C++ in school in Data Structures and a couple other courses. I already have an internship at a corporate type company but would most definitely prefer to intern here. 
I personally met a few of the team members here in NY during an event and I think we clicked(I really enjoyed hanging out with them). My resume if it helps: https://www.dropbox.com/s/15f18vreil3r6v6/anonyme.pdf?dl=0

I would really like to convey that I want to intern here and that I am willing to prepare as much as necessary. I originally submitted this to someone who forwarded it. Should I be getting here feedback? Do you think I should respond as in trying harder to get the internship or should I accept the rejection gracefully?

I'm 19, I've been programming for around 6 years now. I didn't go to college, but I did land an internship at a local company that turned into a full time position. I don't make a lot of money, but I attribute that to my lack of professional experience and no degree. But, recently I've been having some hardships and I'd like to get a fresh start with new friends in a different area. Ideally I'd like to work for some ""hip"" company with younger employees so I can make more friends, my company right now is generally mid-twenties and up. I get along with most of them, but I just don't feel like we are in the same stage of life. 

My issue is my lack of professional experience, and I know that. But would it be feasible to move to a new area and land a job in say SV or Seattle? I *do* know my stuff (and the stuff I don't know I can certainly study up on), but are these companies looking for people that don't have much experience like me? I have a nice job at my company right now where I could stay for a couple years and get more experience, so I'm worried if I leave I might be screwed because companies might not want me. My boss really likes me and says he has no doubt I can learn all the technologies I might be exposed to here, so I guess that means I'm not a bad developer. I've worked as a full stack developer for about a year now. I have experience with Java, C#, ASP.NET (and MVC), JS (and tons of little libraries, although that doesn't really matter), SQL and probably some other obscure languages. I've never been *stuck* on a problem to the point where I can't finish a project, and I've had some decent projects already thrown at me in my time working here.

Any thoughts?"
4gkpp1,6,2016-04-26,CorporateLand: Working With Working Women In The Modern Corporate Environment,VasiliyZaitzev,RedPillWorkplace,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWorkplace/comments/4gkpp1/corporateland_working_with_working_women_in_the/,"**CorporateLand: Working With Working Women In The Modern Corporate Environment**

**Introduction:**

Working with women in the modern corporate environment.  It’s not as much fun as it used to be, for both men and women, mostly b/c of SJW thundercunts.  I had a question about this a couple of weeks ago, and I expanded it into a ""CorporateLand"" post, for the benefit of guys who will spend at least part of their careers in CorporateLand.

**Body:**

There are two types of women in the office: Pre-Wall and Post-Wall.

**For the Post-Wall/Mother Hen types**, utilize ""classic"" Western chivalry. Hold doors, offer help if they are carrying something heavy, etc. They've become (or are in the process of becoming) unused to attention from men. You aren't gaming them, at all but just being helpful &amp; nice, like your mama taught you. Like a bluepill. But you don't care about banging them, you just want them to like you, and say *""He's such a nice man""* and such.

Ex. Years ago, at a different gig, I happened to come into the office in the early evening as I sometimes do - nobody around to pester me, so you can get three hours of work done in an hour - and the HMFIC's admin was working on some huge project. So after just dropping by to alert her that I was on the floor--women working alone at night can be a bit jumpy -- and exchanging pleasantries, so I wouldn't scare the shit out of her accidentally, I went about my business.

As I was leaving, I noticed she was preparing what appeared to be a rather heavy box to be used at an off-site the next day, so without really thinking about it, I offered to carry it down to her car for her. Turns out it was a *really* heavy box, but I hoisted it on to my shoulder and off we went. Anyway, that was enough to get me onto her VIP list, and I didn't realize the extent that she had the ear of her boss, the HMFIC. Also, although I didn't know it at the time, as I was still something of a plebe at that point, she's an office politician in something of a ""Griselda Blanco"" kind of way, and good at rewarding her friends and punishing her enemies.

**For the Pre-Wall/Baby Chick types**, you want to run *light* game, but never give the impression that it's anything more than ""in fun"". Because HR doesn't have much of a sense of humor. Keep it light and fun, and stylish, not overt, and NO KINO. **A lot depends on who you are.** I had a former boss who was a total perv towards women in the office, but he would get away with it b/c he was a white-haired, grandpa type. You could see women doing the math in their heads and he always fell above the age line; i.e., a younger guy would have gotten nailed for it. I'm late 40s so I can easily camouflage myself as a ""Kindly Uncle"" {N.B. as opposed to the ""Creepy Uncle; it's important} when need be. Also, at this point I've been a ""known guy"" at work for nearly a decade.  N.B. Eventually, gramps toned it down because he didn’t want to get set adrift on an ice floe.

There are of course, exceptions. If the young chick is an SJW or otherwise psycho, maintain a perimeter, and keep interactions to a minimum.  

Oh, and a final point: the young hottie types, even the marginal ones, are going to have “young hot chick privilege” rocking.  They’re used to it, and they don’t want to give it up.  Too many young women spend their time being Too Cool For The Universe only to arrive in their 30s, wondering where all the male attention went.  

**Some Sample Interactions:**

I work with an older lady, in her 50s who you can tell was smoking hot back in the day, and who many guys in the office would happily bang now. Even one of the gay guys. Or so he told me. Anyway, she and I have a very friendly relationship as we're both natural extroverts, and I'm good at greasing her deals through. A lot of the younger women in the office look up to her as a role model, thus she provides me with a TON of social proof as she's very flirty, touch feely with me in social (like after hours) situations.

Similarly, I used to work with a woman named ""Maria"", who was well-past the Wall, had four kids and had never lost the baby weight and had packed on a bunch more besides, and likely hadn't been railed out by her hubby since the first Clinton Administration. So as it turns out, I'm a singer, and she walked into the coffee room one day while I was pouring a cup and I sang the first few bars of *""Maria""* from *""West Side Story""*. Now, clearly I was just being amusing, but it did make her whole day.

Do I do this from a Machiavellian perspective? Not really. I was happy to make Maria smile, and I enjoy the sales chick's company, in addition to the social proof she provides. Life is short and work sucks. Why not have fun? And if the fun pays dividends, so much the better.

**What To Do When You’re The FNG** 
 
When you're the FNG, keep your mouth shut until you learn the terrain. These things will be revealed over time. Some people leave obvious clues in the cubes/offices, others do not.
Listen more than you speak, and proceed from there.  Find out who is reliable and who isn’t.
Avoid having a female boss if possible. If not, an older one who gets it is ok. There is a very senior lady boss where I work who I would go to war with 7 out of 7 days of the week.  Why?  Because she totally thinks like a dude.  I’m convinced she can’t wear miniskirts because then everyone could see her balls.

The real problem is communication style. Women tend to be more obtuse and say things like *""Oh whenever you get to it""*, when they really mean *""By noon, tomorrow.""* So with a lady boss, emphasize clarity. Ask for specific milestones/deadlines/etc., and things will go more smoothly.

Oh, and it's not just us. You know who else prefers having a male boss? Women. More than we do. By a lot. Why? Because women *understand* other women, and they hate each other. And male bosses are more predictable, mood-wise, etc.

Regarding direct reports, women are going to have more problems/drama, come in later, leave earlier and take more sick days. Those are just the facts. It's part of the reason we get paid more - when we do get paid more.

From the ""hire"" side of the desk, I will hire old, ugly and skilled over young &amp; big tits, because Y&amp;BT, even if she has talent, will have *DRAMA*. **You will wind up doing, or delegating, Y&amp;BT's work.**

**Women You Will Meet At Work**

**The Lazy Ho’.**  I had a CA once who was a total pain in the ass. She'd had her last boss wrapped around her finger, and was lazy as fuck. Always agitating for more money -- she knew that the last woman who had the job before her got paid way more. Of course that woman had a shit-ton more talent. 

So this chick was also rocking the 'rocker chick slut look', and she did have a nice body, but was something of a ""butter face"", etc. If you ask me, she needed a good scrubbing—and that vag had seen more sausage than a butcher shop.

She would complain a lot and I finally told her if she put as much effort into doing her work as she did trying to get out of it, she wouldn't have any problems. So when we hired her - it was the HMFIC's call, not mine – the Hens thought I would go easy on her, but when I didn't they were happy—because women *hate* other women, and, well, the CA was a lazy ho’. And when she tried to make a move on me with the Dept Chair, the Hens locked themselves into a phalanx around me, and totally had my back. Verdict: The Rebellion was CRUSHED, mercilessly.  Another reason to cultivate the hens….

You are going to find some good citizens, though. You just have to understand who you're dealing with. If you think someone is a bit sketchy, leave the door to your office open or have a 3rd person present in the meeting, if possible. Or meet in a conference room, preferably the ""fishbowl"" kind.  

**The Nosey Parker**  Once upon a time, my department had an intern who was always nosing her way into conversations that didn’t involve her.  So I took to closing the door to my office when I had the other intern, who was a chill guy, in so we could talk about sport, politics and pussy without “Little Sister” eavesdropping on everything.  

Evidently, this counted as “intentionally excluding her”.  Or so the chick from HR said.  When she asked if I was intentionally excluding her, I said, *“If you mean am I intentionally excluding her from conversations that are none of her business but that she wants to overhear because she’s nosey?  Then yes, yes I am.”*  

So I started giving her work.  And when she was done, I gave her more work.  And more.  Maybe she even did some of it, but I didn’t care, because it was nonsense, busy work but it made her feel important and keep her out of my way.

**The Sick Girl**  Women take more sick days.  They come in later and they leave earlier.  And when they have kids, they get sicker, because, evidently, there are things called “schools” or “kindergartens” in which disease ridden children play with each other in close quarters and make sure they share all of each other’s germs.  The mums bring that shit into work with them and then infect everyone else through the miracle of HVAC.

Oh, and when they are out sick or taking some child to the doctor, they will expect you to cover for them.  Free.  And don’t every expect the favor to be returned because of Briffault’s Law and because there will be some sort of dance recital or cub scout meeting that gets in the way.

**The Girl Who Can’t Do Her Job**  I hate this cunt.  HATE HER.  I left a job over one of these.  Really, it was time for me to move on to bigger and better things, but this chick Could.Not.Do.Her.Job.  But she knew that I could.  In fact, the extra work would have been easy for me, and would only have marginally added to my workload.  She also had this fucked up idea that she could *order* me to do it, and when that failed, resorted to *screaming*.  Like I’m Rumplestiltskin and I’m supposed to stay late and spin straw into gold for her…for free.

So I bailed and found a gig with fewer issues and a substantial salary bump.  And when I left, I turned back a project she had managed to get her boss to assign to me (which he could, in fact, do), with a note to the effect that I was leaving the firm, and wasn’t going to get to it before I left.  It involved approximately 7 thousand pages of review and I made sure to hold on to it, and then return it on the Friday before a holiday weekend.  Because fuck her, that’s why. /grin

**Little Miss Selfish**  Women will often wind up wanting something because someone else has it.  Any time I hint that I’m taking a vacation week, I’ve had one co-worker consistently chime in that she was “might” take some days that week.  Even if she would have just gotten back from vacation.  It’s a reflexive response or something.  

I’m not averse to changing up, with enough notice, i.e. before tickets are bought, and I try to avoid school vacation weeks that my co-workers might need.  In one case, I flipped the week before Labor Day to the week after because school was starting or some shit, and one of my co-workers wanted to spend the last week of the summer with her kids.  It wasn’t a problem, and she *asked*, so no biggie.  But now I just take the days I take and everyone else can deal.  Seniority, muthafuckas.  RHIP.

**The Flirt**

Y’know those Attention Whores on Instagram?  Yeah, well, a lot of them have jobs and you might wind up working with one.  Don’t fall for her *“who, me?”* flirting and come-ons.  She’s just looking for validation.  It’s not worth your gig.  

And yeah, *“But lots of people bang co-workers!”*  I did, too.  I used to have a regular thing, long ago, with an admin I worked with who pretty much had the Rear of the Year.  My flat was close and she was DTF, so we’d bop over to my flat once or twice a week and have some fun, always leaving and arriving back separately.  **Important Point:** if you must bang someone at work, pick someone with more to lose than you have.  My “work plate” was engaged.  There was an understanding that the Fun Would End before her wedding, and it did.  Now she’s married and we both work at different places and AFAIK, her kids were all fathered by her husband, who is a TOTAL betbux.  He was also worried about me, big time.  She told me about it, once, after sex.  So I said, *""What does he have to worry about?  I'm only fucking you.  He can have you back when I'm done,""* and she giggled.  

Even the ""Good Girls"", fellas...even the 'good' girls...  

**The Queen Bee** - Often the admin...excuse me... *executive* admin for the HMFIC, such as the one I referenced when introducing the concept of the Mother Hen.  She might also be the Office Manager, or another senior admin.  Ex.  At the place I left because of the chick who couldn't do her work and expected me to do it for her, there were two Queen Bees, neither of whom were the CEO's admin - the CEOs admin was untouchable, but didn't participate in office politics.  She was sticking around to retire when the CEO did, so she could play golf full time instead of part-time.  How powerful was she?  She *named* the fucking company.  So she was too busy up on Mount Olympus to be bothered.  

Meanwhile down among the plebes, there was the Office Manager - she had a swankier title which I don't recall - and the admin of the 3rd or 4th ranking guy at the firm.  I'd put him at #3, but depends on how you rank the General Counsel, who was a cagey guy, but more like Templeton the Rat - a survivor, for sure, but outside of the power structure.  Anyway, she was Employee #4.  Their battles were *epic*.  I had a cordial relationship with the OM and was tight with the other Queen Bee, so never had a problem.  On the rare occasion that I got crossed up with the OM on something, I just had the other Queen Bee take care of it, because she always loved twisting the knife.  

**This Is Important**

Determine which are “good citizens” who can be counted on.  Take care of the admins – someday you are going to need a friend.  You always want to keep a positive balance in the Favor Bank.  

I used to joke that, if I ever announced that I cut off my girlfriend’s head {plate, really, but not a distinction I made at work} then Suzanne {my admin} would appear with a hatbox of the appropriate size, dispose of the evidence, and never speak of it again.  You can’t buy loyalty, you can only inspire it.

**Conclusions**

-Identify the “good citizens” and cultivate them.  Reward your friends, punish your enemies.

-The Mother Hen types often have more power than is evident on the surface.

-The Baby Chick types are susceptible to game, but keep it professional.

Aside from being paid well there are also benefits like expensive insurance and in general for my age (24) the money I get and the work I do is pretty high level (I fully support myself and live alone). Upon start of the work I had no intention to change it, my plan was to make a career here.

However regardless of my current comfortable and career-wise happy life I'm planning to relocate abroad after not longer than 2 years. Reason: I always wanted to live in that other country, been there many times, am fluent in the language since age 16. Only last year I realized that actually nothing major stops me from doing it. I also have a SO there.

So the more serious I am about relocating, the more things in my head changed regarding my career. For example, I picked cheaper trainings because if I quit before a year from them passes I'll have to pay their price myself. So in case I move earlier I don't want to get a big debt. Also there are some problems between me and some coworkers (nothing major) and instead of feeling too bad about it I just think ""nvm, this will be gone when I move"". During not busy hours at work I try to learn myself something new for the sake of being able to add more things in my resume which I'll send to places I apply in the new country and not for the sake of being a better employee here. I also quite often (at home) browse jobs there (in the same field as my own) and try to be active at work here so when I go to interviews there I can tell about what I achieved, etc. I also think to not move before I have a full 2 year experience here because on the resume it looks better than say 1.85 year.

Tl;dr, I am fixated on the idea to relocate and consequently find a new job in a new country. My thought process shifted from being a good employee who can make a career in the current place to my current employment being an ""investment"" towards a new job which is not even set up yet.

Is this healthy/normal or am I just bothering myself and should work as if I have no plans since they are quite long term?"
4gkw3p,1,2016-04-26,My life is going the wrong direction and I just cannot change it by myself,shichigatsu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4gkw3p/my_life_is_going_the_wrong_direction_and_i_just/,"The title doesn't do me justice. Everything is falling apart, myself included, and I feel like I have no control over it. 

Everyone always tells me to focus on school and get my degree but don't take into account the amount of work involved. Going back to school to finish my degree in math or physics means studying when I'm not at work, working when I'm not in calss, and sleeping when I finally get home and take my antidepressant/tranquilizer and some over the counter stuff to get me to fall asleep. I did that for six months last year and nearly lost my mind, it's just... It's beyond my capabilities. Lots of people do it and for some reason I can't. 

It's all I ever wanted. I wanted to be a scientist and do something meaningful and I set myself up to do just that. I got into college at 16. I had an associates degree at 18 along with an internship under my belt. Then I started falling apart, when I moved out of my parents house and realized just how fucked up the world is I couldn't handle it. There's a whole saga in my life for the time between 18 and 20, more fucked up shit than one person should have to handle. Now I'm almost 22 and have barely moved forward. I lost a second internship midway through because of anxiety and depression and then spent half a year crying about it. 

You don't make much as a student. Unless you are the best and the brightest there are no handouts and I'm so burnt out from trying to be the best and brightest that I can't even get myself to do easy practice problems without having an anxiety attack and then spending the rest of the day trying not to cry and scream. I've got a retail job that doesn't pay my bills. I'm living on a twin mattress in the dining room of my alcoholic aunts apartment and spending every cent I have on cigarettes because I can't get myself motivated to get the fuck up and do something else. I have no friends. I didn't maintain friendships because I was too busy trying to get my degree. Then I moved 300 miles away from everyone I know to my aunts apartment in Austin. 

I can't afford to only have one job. I can't go back to school making less than $1000 a month in Austin. I can barely eat and pay rent making less than $1000 a month in fucking Austin. I have no background in anything else but undergraduate math and physics. No tech certifications or programming knowledge because I flunked those classes trying to pass my major courses. No people skills because I sacrificed all my time trying to work towards this dream and didn't have time to care about making friends. I'm completely fucking useless. If I get a second job it's going to be another bullshit retail position or a call center. Neither will be full time. Neither will pay more than I'm already getting. I won't have time to go back to school. I tried that once, I worked 50 hour weeks and still barely fucking scraped by. I tried studying every night to prepare to go to school but I was so tired that I couldn't make sense of anything. 

I just don't know what to do. Every time I think about school and the dream I used to have I spend days trying to hold back my emotions so I don't fall apart. Every time I try to apply for another job I have an anxiety attack because it really will be the nail in the coffin for everything I wanted to do. Every time I realize how long it's been since I opened my textbooks reminds me of how fucking useless and pathetic I am. The only thing keeping me here is a promise I made to my mother. She doesn't understand what it's like to be trapped inside a cage with a vicious, demented mind, constantly reminded that it is just your own self tearing you apart. She just knows that she doesn't want her son to die no matter the reason. Don't worry about the suicidal thoughts, I won't act on them. I've gotten used to them actually. It's like staring into the sun. Because I'm so deadened to my own thoughts it's the one promise that I might actually be able to keep in my life, I just sit around getting bombarded by the thought of it until I find a distraction. 

You know what the best part is? I can't even get help. I can't afford it. I have health insurance and I have a job. I also have past due bills that I can barely afford to pay, an aging car that seems to have a new problem every month, and the inability to stop smoking a pack a day. I can't afford the copay right now to go and change my current prescription. In a week an a half when I get my next paycheck, and if something else doesn't blow up in my face and force me to spend everything I have to fix it, I could do it. I don't know if I would though. Sitting through a week and a half of destructive and suicidal thoughts makes you irrational. I can't afford to see a therapist or a psychologist in the mean-time, it's more than double a regular doctor visit. I can't ask my family here in Austin, they don't have the money to help themselves, much less me. I won't ask my mom, she's already given me too much. I lost count of it, I really did. When I was doing something with my life and working towards a goal it was fine for both of us. Now I'm just a useless drain on her. 

I want to get better. It'd be nice to wake up and not have to remind myself to not kill myself every morning otherwise I'd break my promise. I'd like to be able to quit smoking and stop the anxiety and depression I get over schoolwork. But I won't do it with charity. What is the point of fixing your own problem if someone fixes it for you? You don't learn anything, you don't grow, and it doesn't truly get fixed. However as soon as I get that glimmer of hope that I've got  the strength inside of me to fix this I'm reminded by myself that it'll never happen because I'm too weak to do it myself because I know it'll never happen. So I just sit around asking myself, ""what is the point?"" and burying everything I feel so that I can try and pretend to be normal until I'm financially stable enough to begin to fix the fucked up ball of shit that is me. 

If anyone happens to know of some magical cure all, some crazy irrational thing that fixes everyones problems give me a hint on it. "
4gkx2l,9,2016-04-26,Getting Started in the World That Is Voice Acting,Excel325,VoiceActing,https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/4gkx2l/getting_started_in_the_world_that_is_voice_acting/,"Hey all. I’m reaching out to anyone and everyone with this post. It’s long, I apologies. You’re basically getting my life story: 

With the phenomenon that is the Internet, getting your face and voice out across the globe has become easier than ever. However, actually being heard seems to be the more challenging part. With this in mind, I was hoping to start a general discussion regarding the industry and getting one’s feet wet. Are there better ways than others to get into the industry? Does age have anything to do with finding work? What’s the best way to get yourself exposure?

A brief background on myself and why I am so interested: I will be 30 this fall and have thought from the age of 16 that radio or some other vocal profession was the direction I should steer my life. At 16, working at a Goodwill, I would hear at least twice a shift (honest, not making this part up to make myself look good) that I have a career path in radio ahead of me. The daily overhead announcements were quickly a job that was handed to me while I was on shift.

Fast forward to my first run through college: I have an AAS in Audio Production &amp; Recording with an emphasis in Post Production audio. I dabbled here and there doing VO work for projects in school and got an internship at a post-production house in Minneapolis, MN. After a week of this internship and talking to employees, it sounded like the weekly man-hours (upwards of 80-90) to pay ratio (barely enough for sustainability without needing a second job) were well less than livable. I ventured on to another company that dealt with Internet Radio. This was an alright gig that I actually got to apply things I learned in college as an engineer/board op. Working 6 days a week, running 15 different shows, I was in constant voice only communication with the show hosts from all across the country (through ISDN, Skype, phone lines, etc.), most of which were continually telling me that I was on the wrong side of the board. One late night show host pulled me on the air for an hour once during his 12-3am central show just to chat. 

After several years, it became clear to me that at my then present pace (continually searching for work in the audio industry as an engineer), I would be lucky to make enough each paycheck to get me within 4 days of my next check (living paycheck to paycheck would have been a luxury). It was at this point that I grudgingly abandoned my hopes and dreams to find gainful employment that would pay the bills and still be able to put something aside to retire on. I ended up dealing cards for a Minnesota casino while I went back to school for Accounting. Going back to school for radio had crossed my mind, but the competition for that line of work being as steep as it was at the time (2010 or so) made me fear for the astronomical amount of student loans I would have after going to school twice. Plus who doesn’t need an accountant?

The casino ended up being more of the same Goodwill story. I chat with all sorts of folk, I hear that I should be in radio, etc. Management obviously heard the suggestions, because I was later given the job of being the live host for their late night weekend cosmic style bingo. Not to toot my own horn, but me off a microphone sounds pretty good, me over a pretty decent PA system was even better. I heard it often enough that I sounded like someone on the radio that I really started to wonder how I could break into the industry with nothing more than my audio engineering training. My last day after almost 2 years of hosting was met with regulars and newbies alike asking if I had finally gotten that job on the news or the radio. It was touching.

Now that I’m married, child on the way, buried under a mountain of student loan debt, and having sold all my audio equipment from my first run through college, I’m starting to get that feeling again that I could really go places anywhere in the voice talent community. I just need a little guidance: What sort of equipment would one need (other than your basic Pro Tools rig or audio capturing software and a large diaphragm condenser)? Where do people post themselves to be heard? Is YouTube a good place to start? If you don’t have the time to get out to get into plays or other productions, what do you do? How do people network in the industry? What are the best ways to practice? What agencies actively look for new talent? I have so many questions. With a 40 hour a week job and a kid on the way, I don’t have the free time I used to have, but this feels like I missed a huge opportunity early on in life that I would forever regret it if I didn’t get out there and really try.


TLDR: I’ve been told for the last 14 years I should be in radio/tv/voice acting. I’m a broke accountant with really no time or money on my hands. How does someone in their soon to be early 30’s get into the industry?

4gkyj1,1,2016-04-26,Should I take the paid internship or the unpaid?,Buisness_Fish,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4gkyj1/should_i_take_the_paid_internship_or_the_unpaid/,Right off the bat this sounds like a dumb question but allow me to explain. The paid one is for a an aerospace company back home where I will be working in IT basically. The second one is a local startup where I will help design database systems to sell to companies. The start up is being run by about two people and has been ongoing since late 2014. Their clients so far are mainly neighboring cities. Personally after I graduate I do not want to work IT. I have always been more interested in databases and software development. In your professional opinions is it worth losing the money for someone who might pay me but the work will better align with my career goals or should I take the IT one because at the end of the day it's just an internship.

So I applied maybe about 2 weeks ago, I dropped off my resume 3 days ago, introduced myself to the manager, and I'm just waiting to see if I can get an interview or not. 

What should I do if I don't hear back within a week or two? 

Was coming dropping off my resume a good idea? I have heard many good and bad things about doing that?

A little backroad about me: I'm 19, college student, I've been working at Starbucks for 3 years and it's time I look for another job. I use to intern at Kaiser and had a lot of leadership positions like in school and at church. 

Any good way for me to stand out? I dropped my resume off in a nice folder with a clear cover, hopefully that helped a little? 

For everyone that works at Apple or has worked at Apple, how do you guys like it and do you guys have any advice to give on how I can get the job?

Thanks in advance guys!!!"
4gkzx0,400,2016-04-26,"Let's Have a Study Break [M18, F23]",lovemesomeburritos,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4gkzx0/lets_have_a_study_break_m18_f23/,"Despite the current trend of entering into college with a five year plan, majors decided upon, and internships three years out lined up in order to justify the enormous debt that we would all be accruing over the next four years, I started college with no plan, no major, and not even a thought of a possible internship. My thought process was that all of that would work itself out, and in the meantime, I would not be at home with my parents and sisters. This thought process led to me signing up for some of the more obscure general education classes. One of these courses was Theater History. In high school I had taken two years of drama to fulfill my vocational requirement, acted in a few plays, and even directed my own one act play. I was by no means a drama geek, but I enjoyed the theater and thought that it would be a nice change of pace from my math and science heavy schedule. 

A morning of Calculus II and Introduction to Entomology had already left me mentally drained and with more reading than I wished to do. I stopped back at my dorm room to switch out books and grab a new spiral to take notes in my next class. I quietly opened the door to my room and was greeted by darkness and the musty smell of an unshowered roommate. 

I had lived with Juan for six days, and I was already frustrated with him as a living companion. He came from a wealthy family in Colombia, was obviously not used to picking up after himself, and expected everyone around him to cater to his every need. Juan was about 5’7”, had olive skin, was morbidly obese weighing close to 300 pounds, had thick black hair that he cut short, and a patchy beard. He continuously slept in until 2 or 3 in the afternoon, skipping most of his classes in the process I would discover later, and stayed up until 4 in the morning skyping his friends with his booming voice that he refused to lower. Needless to say, I attempted to spend as little time in my room as I could. 

I quickly exchanged the books in my backpack for the ones required in my Theater History class and left. I looked at my phone and saw that it was just before 1:00. My class did not begin until 2:00, so I had time to grab some lunch at the cafeteria and maybe begin reading for my entomology class. I walked up the winding staircase that led to the cafeteria, passing a large group going in the opposite direction who had just finished eating. I gave my school ID to the man standing at the register. He swiped my ID and returned it to me without uttering a word, waiting for the next student to come to the cafeteria. I grabbed a tray and made my way to the servers. They were serving pulled pork sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, and green beans. I eyed the food, accepting some of each before moving towards the tabled area, scanning the crowd for a familiar face. I found none, but I noticed that the cafeteria was less than half full, leaving plenty of open space for me to sit and read until I needed to leave for class. I selected an empty table by a window, allowing me an unimpeded view of the campus quad. I looked in my backpack for my entomology book, forgetting that I had placed it on the desk in my room along with my calculus book. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” I lamented when I realized my mistake. I instead pulled out my copy of Lysistrata and began to absentmindedly thumb through the editor’s notes at the front of the book. While browsing the introduction to Aristophanes’ raunchy masterpiece, I took a bite of my sandwich, debating on whether or not the kitchen used actual meat in the sandwiches or if it was a fake meat substitute that the college had gotten at a discount. 

As I was deep in thought over the legitimacy of the meal in front of me, I saw someone stop at the table that I was at and put their tray down. I looked up from my plate and was greeted by the sight of a gorgeous woman standing behind the chair directly across from me. I was immediately in awe of the being in front of me. As my eyes rose to meet hers, I attempted to take in all of her beauty. I saw her slightly tanned legs, the short jean shorts that hugged her hips, the peach colored tank top that clung to her athletic figure, her long curly red hair, and her vivid green eyes that shone with laughter. A kind smile danced across her lips, leaving me with a nervous sensation in my stomach. I had never seen this girl before and had no idea who she was, but I was really hoping that I would find out. 

“Is this seat taken?” I heard her ask.

Shocked that she was there, let alone talking to me, I shook my head no as she sat down. 

“Hi, I’m Tobin,” she began. “Sorry for barging in on you like this, but there isn’t really a whole lot of places to sit, and I noticed that you were kind of alone.”

I quickly glanced around the cafeteria and noticed a plethora of seating options other than with me, but I shrugged as maybe she did not want to eat alone. “Oh. It’s no problem. I’m just killing time between classes.”

“Me too!” She replied enthusiastically. “You’d think that by senior year I would have all my gen eds done, but I’ve been postponing my history one for as long as possible. I figured theater history might be more exciting than regular history.”

The statement hit me like a ton of bricks. She was taking the same class as me? What were the odds? “No way!” I exclaimed. “I’m taking that exact same class.”

“Crazy! Sorry I don’t think I caught your name. Are you a theater major or something?”

“Oh yeah. Sorry. I’m Mark. And no, I’m not an anything major. I’m an undeclared freshman.”

“What hall are you living in?” She asked. “I’m the fourth floor RA in Madsen Hall.

“I’m in Madsen too. Third floor.” I responded. 

I checked my phone and saw that it was 1:50. “We should probably get going to class if we want to make it on time.” I said.

Tobin nodded her agreement, popped the last bite of her sandwich into her mouth, and stood up. I placed my plate and empty glass onto the tray, grabbed my bag, and closely followed Tobin out of the cafeteria. 

We arrived at the classroom about a minute before class started and surveyed the room. Tobin recognised a friend, and as quickly as I had met her, she was gone. I surveyed the room looking for a someone that I recognised. I found one in Tyler, a junior lifeguard that I had met during the training for the entire recreational center staff. He saw me walk in, and waved his hand slightly for me to come sit by him. I walked over to him and pulled out a chair. I glanced at the row behind me, locating Tobin. She was laughing with her friend, completely oblivious to my presence. While I was not surprised, I was a little disappointed that she did not invite me to sit with her. My thoughts, however, were quickly occupied by the professor walking into the room and beginning the lecture. After fifty minutes of furious note taking and a lengthy homework assignment, class was over and I began to walk back to my room. 

“Hey, wait up!” I heard as I was about to exit the building. 

I turned around to see Tobin jog towards me, her breasts bouncing slightly underneath her tank top and her curls following suit. We started to walk back to the dorm together making small talk about the class we had just sat through, what she was going to do after graduation, and what other classes I was taking. We entered the building, and made our way up the staircase. 

“Well I guess I will see you in class on Wednesday.” I said as we reached the third floor.

“Yeah. Why don’t I give you my number and then we can meet up for lunch beforehand.”

“Okay” I said as if I were in a daze. Here was a beautiful senior who had just given a freshman her number and made plans in the future with him. I could barely contain my excitement and my nerves as I handed her my phone. 

“Shoot me a text so I have your number too.” Tobin said as she went up the stairs.

My eyes followed her legs and ass as they disappeared from sight up the stairs. I walked to my room. Before I even opened the door I heard two sounds; one was Juan’s alarm going off and the other was Juan snoring. I sighed and walked into the room and sat down at my desk. 

“Juan! Your alarm’s going off dude.” I said a little bit louder than my normal speaking voice. 

He didn’t stir. I repeated myself even louder this time, finally eliciting a response from him. He rolled over and turned off his alarm and got out of his bunk. “Oh shit! I’m late for work.” was his response to looking at his clock. Juan got dressed and ran out the door, allowing me to open the shades and the window to try and air out my room. I breathed in the fresh air as I got out my phone and typed a message to Tobin. I had no desire to seem desperate, but I did want to meet up with her again.

“Hey Tobin. It’s Mark.” Was what I decided to go with. It was just a formal message so that she had my number.

“Awesome!” She replied quickly.

I decided that I would not text her until Wednesday before class. I opened up my calculus book and began to start on the problems who were assigned earlier that day. I worked for a few hours on the homework and the assigned reading, eventually feeling tired from all of the work. I closed my calculus textbook and opened my entomology book. My eyes drifted over the pages, but I was not focusing. I stood up and cracked my back, thinking that I could stretch my legs for a few minutes, maybe get a snack from the campus store, and then come back with a renewed energy. I put on my shoes and walked over to the door. Just as I was about to open it, Juan walked in. We exchanged formalities, and he walked past me to his desk and opened his computer. Knowing that he was probably going to skype his friends back in Colombia, I walked back across the room, gathered my textbooks and notebooks into my backpack, and left to go to the library. Not paying attention to my surroundings, I walked briskly down the stairs. My shoulder collided with a soft body, causing me to instinctively reach out to try and stabilize myself and them. I looked up and saw that I had just ran into Tobin, and in an attempt to have her not fall down the staircase, one of my hands was around her waist and the other was on one of her breasts. Realising what position I was in I immediately removed my hands and I felt my face get hot. I was so embarrassed. 

“Oh my god, Tobin, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean...I mean I’m so...I’m…”

Tobin was surprised, but then she began to laugh. “You should probably buy me dinner first. I mean I barely gave you my number this afternoon.” She said between chuckles. “Where were you off to in such a hurry anyways?” 

“The store and then probably the library.” I replied as I backed away. I was still mortified about what had just happened. “My roommate is skyping his family back home and I needed to get some work done. And I really am sorry. I promise...”

“Relax.” Tobin said with a warm smile. “I know you didn’t mean to. It was a funny accident. And if you ever want, you can work on stuff in my room. I don’t have a roommate so there isn’t anyone to skype loudly in Spanish.” She joked.

“Thanks.” I said. “But I think I’ll go to the library tonight. I don’t want to bother you or anything.” 

Before she had a chance to respond, I left the area and walked to the library, forgoing my trip to the store. After that situation, I had enough adrenaline to finish all of the work that I needed to do. On my walk, my mind wandered back to the collision and my hand placement thereafter. My arm had wrapped around her slender waist with my hand resting at the small of her back, and my other hand had landed square on her left breast. Thinking back, I had not felt the padding of a bra, but instead the softness of a bare breast. “She wasn’t wearing a bra!” I whispered to myself as I smirked. Tobin had gone from an upperclassman who I had happened to have a class with to a fantasy in the span of ten seconds. I shook my head to try and concentrate on the reading that was in front of me. However, every time I pushed Tobin out of my head, she managed to reappear. Because of this, it took me until nearly 2:00 a.m. to finish all of my work. I packed my things and trudged back across campus and into my room where Juan was playing Starcraft. I collapsed in bed, exhausted from the day, but in my mind all I could think about was Tobin’s soft body and my hands against it. I began to feel a bulge grow in my pants as I thought about her. I flipped over on my bed, burying my erection into the mattress and hoping that I could ignore it long enough to fall asleep. Eventually, I fell asleep to the sounds of explosions and orders being barked out by virtual officers.

The entire next day, my mind was occupied by the new classes that I was taking, leaving little time for me to fantasize about Tobin. Wednesday, however, was completely different. By the time my entomology class ended, I was a nervous wreck about inviting Tobin to lunch with me before class. When I pulled out my phone to text her though, I saw that I already had a message. I opened it, and lo and behold, it was from Tobin. 

“Waiting for you in the caf.”

Suddenly I was no longer nervous. She had texted me about lunch. I walked to the cafeteria, grabbed my food, and looked around for Tobin. She was at a table by herself at the far end of the room. I walked over, pulled out a chair, and  sat down. Despite the “stairway incident” as I had begun to call it, our conversation was not awkward at all as we talked through lunch and on our walk to class. 

This routine continued for the next few months with Tobin and I gradually becoming better acquainted with each other, expanding our lunches to every day as opposed to only when we had class, sometimes having dinner together, but never doing much off campus. She had not offered for me to study in her room again since the incident, and I had not asked, spending most of my spare time in the library or in the room of other friends that I had met. For all our niceties, Tobin was still over four years older than me and had a much more active social life than me. 

The week before our Fall Break tended to be a stressful one, as that was usually the week of midterms, but I was pretty calm. I was doing well in all of my classes and was not worried about any of my grades, plus I had never been much for studying. My memory was pretty solid, and if I looked over some material for an hour or so the night before the test I was usually golden. I had made it through the week almost entirely unscathed, acing my two hardest midterms in entomology and calculus, and all I had left was my Theater History exam. I browsed the material and the plays that we had read over the course of the semester so far, but I was far from anxious. The professor I had found out was a pretty easy grader on essays, and the multiple choice portion of her tests were always straightforward. 

I planned to go to bed early regardless, but fate would not have it so. I reached for the handle of my door as I was coming back from the library, but it was locked. This was odd because I could hear Juan skyping in the room. I pulled out my keys and opened the door to a scene that I had not expected to witness in a thousand years. Juan was standing in front of his computer buck naked, with a full erection, talking to who I assumed was a girl back home who he had hooked up with in the past. Absolutely horrified by walking in on my obese roommate having skype sex, I froze for a second, and then rapidly leapt into action.

“Oh god. I’m so sorry! I’m leaving. Bye.” I said, most likely too fast for him to understand, and as I shut the door. I needed to go somewhere and forget that this moment had ever happened. I started down the hallway when I heard a familiar voice. 

“Hey, Mark.”

It was Tobin. I was still in shock after what I had just seen, and apparently my face showed it.

“You don’t look too well. You feeling ok?” She asked.

“Yeah. I’m alright.” I said, shaking my head as if my brain were an etch-a-sketch and the shaking would erase my most recent memory. “What’s up?”

“You are doing pretty well in history right?” She inquired.

“Yeah, I’m doing ok.” I responded, trying to be humble. I had learned long ago that bragging about grades in general was a major turn off to nearly everyone.

“Well do you think that maybe you could help me? I didn’t do so great on the last test, and I really need a B on this midterm. As of right now I don’t think that has a good chance of happening.”

“Sure. We can head to the library or down to the lounge in the basement if you want.” I said.

“Or we could just go to my room. It’s closer than both of those options, and it is way more comfortable. Plus there are added benefits to being in the RA’s room,” Tobin said with a wink. 

I had no idea what the last part of her statement meant, but her tone and flirty attitude that I had come to know pretty well over the last few months convinced me. I nodded to her suggestion, and we climbed the stairs to her room. She opened the door and walked in.

“Make yourself at home,” she stated casually.

Her bed was placed up against the wall with the window and she had a small love seat couch on the adjacent wall. She had a large 40 inch television across from the couch, a mini fridge in the corner, and photographs of her and her friends framed all over the room. Her room smelled vaguely of the vanilla scented perfume that she always wore, and as I entered I inhaled deeply. Tobin went directly over to her bed where she had papers and various books from our class laid out. I sat on the couch, slightly uneasy and very stiff. Tobin glanced over and noticed that I was obviously nervous.

“Loosen up a bit Mark. Oh I know what will help.” Tobin stated as she got up from the bed and went to her refrigerator. She pulled out a bottle of vodka and a few sodas to mix it with. 

“I don’t really drink that much. I mean you can if you want but I’m ok. I don’t want to be hung over for the test tomorrow.” I said. This was all true. I did not drink at all in high school, and since I had been to college, I had had a few beers, but I had never been tipsy let alone drunk. It was also against the rules, as the college was a dry campus. It finally dawned on me that this is what Tobin meant when she winked at me and was talking about the benefits of being in the RA’s room.

“Come on Mark,” said Tobin. “Don’t make me drink alone. Drunk studying is the best. Plus you can’t get in trouble because you’re with me.”

I contemplated my options, but eventually consented. Tobin mixed the drinks and we began studying the material. We made a game out of it where every time we answered a question wrong, the person answering had to take a drink, and every time we got an answer right, the person asking the question had to take a drink. I was much better at the game than Tobin, and within an hour she was fairly drunk while I was sober as a judge. She had gone through three and a half drinks while I was barely halfway through my first.

“Fuck Mark! Why are you so fucking good at this?” Tobin exclaimed after I answered another question correctly.

“Maybe you are just asking the wrong questions,” I jested back. 

“Fine. How many characters are there in Doctor Faustus?”

“Shit! That’s not fair!” I cried exasperated. “There is no way that we need to know that for the test tomorrow.” 

“Doesn’t matter. You don’t know. Now drink up.”

I took a large gulp of my drink, my mouth puckering at the now apparent taste of alcohol in my beverage. The questions she continued to ask bordered on the ridiculous, and I missed nearly all of them, resulting in my having to finish two drinks in approximately twenty minutes. As previously stated, I was not a big drinker at the time, and the rapid intake of alcohol had me feeling moderately light headed with my appendages tingling. I placed my empty glass down on her desk.

“Tobin, I don’t think I can drink anymore. I’m feeling kinda drunk I think.” I slurred.

“That’s good cause I’m feeling drunk too. I think that we had a productive study session.” Tobin said as she giggled.

Tobin closed up the books she had on her bed and walked over to the couch. I could not take my eyes off of her as she sat down beside me. I knew that this was probably a sign that I could probably make a move on her, but fear gripped me. I had only ever slept with one girl, my high school girlfriend, and she was not very adventurous, so I was severely lacking in experience. I also assumed that Tobin had high expectations. This made me think that the best course of action was to not do anything, and therefore I could not disappoint her. Sensing that I was nervous, Tobin reached over to me with her hand and put it on my thigh. Startled, I flinched.

“It’s ok, Mark,” said Tobin in a reassuring voice. “Have you ever done anything like this before?”

“Well, I mean, I had a girlfriend in high school but that was about it.” I replied sheepishly. 

“That’s nothing to be ashamed of.” She said as she inched closer to me. “I think that it’s sweet when a guy doesn’t brag about all of the people he’s been with.” 

Tobin was almost on top of me now. The last sentence she whispered into my ear, and followed it with a peck on the cheek. My breath became rapid and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I turned my head towards her, and she took my face in her hands. She planted her lips on mine and I felt her tongue probe into my mouth. I had made out with a few girls at some parties earlier in the year, but this was an entirely different experience. Her lips were soft upon mine, but she also kissed forcefully. She guided me down so that I was lying down on the couch leaving her on top of me. I felt her hands brush over my chest, feeling down my ribs to where my shirt and pants met. Tobin’s hands lifted up my shirt, and awkwardly, I rose my torso off the couch so that she could take my shirt completely off. Her lips came back to mine, and then I felt a small bite on my lower lip as her lips moved on from my lips down to my neck. She kissed down my chest to the button on my pants. I grew nervous as her hands began to unbutton my pants and drag the zipper down slowly as I could feel my dick becoming engorged. 

Tobin reached into my pants, and i felt her warm hand clasp around my shaft. She pulled it out from my pants and eased my pants all the way off. I was now completely naked on her couch, and I felt a bit self conscious as she was still clothed. 

“Hey, it’s no fair that I’m naked while you still have all of your clothes on.” I said, hoping that I didn’t ruin anything that was happening. 

Tobin gave me a sly smile. “All in good time, hun. Now lie back and close your eyes.”

I thought about protesting, but decided that my best course of action was to listen. No sooner had my eyes shut than I felt her wet lips on the tip of my cock. Her skills were far superior to my high school girlfriend, and I noticed immediately. Tobin went gradually farther and farther down my shaft, eventually taking my entire length in her mouth. After a few seconds, her mouth released my dick with an audible pop. She extended her tongue and licked the sides of my dick, periodically putting it in her mouth and bobbing up and down on it for a while. I suddenly felt the sensation stop and the cool air of the room met my wet dick. I opened my eyes to see what Tobin was doing, and to my excitement, she was taking off the orange Aeropostale shirt she was wearing. Underneath she had on a leopard print bra. Next, she removed her shorts, revealing a bright red thong. She climbed back on top of me, my wet dick rubbing on her stomach. I reached around her back, and tried to unclasp her bra, but I could not undo the clasp. My struggle continued for about thirty seconds before she placed my arms at my sides and undid the clasp herself.

“I’m sorry.” I said quietly. I could have died from embarrassment right then. 

Tobin smiled and gave me a kiss. “You’re cute.” 

She stood up and took my hand, bringing me over to the bed. I sat on the bed and watched as she removed the thong, gracefully stepping out of it. This was the first time that I was getting a good look at Tobin’s naked body. Her pale C cup breasts were beautiful on her figure, her light nipples were almost invisible. I saw that her pussy was completely shaved, and I thought that I could make out a slight glisten, showing that she was aroused. 

“Have you ever eaten a girl out before?” Tobin asked me.

“Yeah, just one.” I replied.

Taking this as an affirmative, Tobin laid down and spread her legs. I saw that my eyes had not deceived me, and she was indeed very wet. I nervously edged my way between her legs and started to gently lick her labia. My actions were met with an exhale of approval, spurring me to be slightly more aggressive. My hands parted her lips, exposing her small clit. My tongue darted over it, causing Tobin to buck her hips in the air. I kept going, switching off between licking the length of her slit and focusing on her clit. Tobin was moaning and squirming, and when I felt her hands on the back of my head, I knew that I was doing well. The pressure her hands were exerting became greater, and then I heard her say “Oh Fuck!” as her hips spasmed violently.

Tobin wasted no time after having gotten off, rising from the bed and pushing me flat onto my back. She took my dick in her mouth briefly, making sure that my dick was completely wet for penetration. I saw her begin to mount me, and I suddenly panicked.

“Shouldn’t I be wearing a condom?” I asked, immediately hating myself for being logical.

“It’s ok. I’m on the pill.” Tobin said as she positioned herself over my fully erect member. 

I nodded my understanding. I could feel the heat that her pussy was giving off radiating down my cock. Her hand guided me towards her entrance. We both let out a moan when my head entered her. She slid down inch by inch until I was fully inside of her. I had never had sex without a condom before, and I could not believe the difference. Tobin leaned forward and kissed me as she began to gently ride me. Her pussy felt like it was just the right size for my dick, as I filled her up entirely. I began to fondle her tits, lightly pinching her nipples, as she rocked back and forth. All of the sudden, Tobin stopped grinding. She grabbed my wrists and pulled my hands away from her tits pinning them to the bed. She leaned down to kiss me, but when I went to complete the kiss, she pulled her head back, teasing me. She eased off my cock so that only the tip was inside of her. She bounced ever so slightly on the tip of my dick, torturing me. I had a taste of her, and I wanted to fuck her so badly, but she was not allowing me. She flashed me her most devious smile.

“What do you want?” Tobin asked, full well knowing the answer.

“You,” was my response. 

“I guess you are going to have to take it then, because this is all I am going to give you.”

I smiled, thinking that she would give in. However, every time I went for a kiss or a deeper thrust she kept just out of reach. Incredibly horny and tired of being teased, I snapped. I broke her grip around my wrists and flipped positions on her. I was now on top of her, placed between her legs. Tobin smiled, waiting for me to take her, but I held action. I grabbed her wrists with one hand and pinned them above her head. I gently licked each nipple, and almost kissed her, but drew back at the last moment, just like she had done to me. With my free hand, I placed my dick at the entrance of her pussy, but did not thrust home. 

“How does it feel?” I asked, grinning at the reversal of power.

“Please fuck me. I need you inside of me right now.”

I decided to take it a bit further. “Not good enough.” I said as I rubbed her clit.

“Mmmm, fill me up!” Tobin moaned as she clamped her legs around my back, pulling me inside of her. 

The feeling of being pulled inside of her was fantastic. I let out a shudder as I began to thrust into her. “Harder!” She said as her breath started to become ragged and more rapid. I complied working up speed. Her legs grabbed me tighter as she began to get closer to orgasm. I watched as her face began to flush and her tits bounced in rhythm with my thrusts. Tobin’s legs opened up and her hands scratched at my back as her second orgasm rocked her body. I could feel myself getting close to finishing. 

“Where do you want me to finish?” I asked mid-thrust.

“Anywhere….you….want” was the out of breath reply. 

Even though she told me that she was on the pill, I was still nervous about cumming inside of her. My hips began to move faster and faster, and when I knew that I was about to burst, I pulled out, cum shooting out all over her. The first eruption shot up over her shoulder onto her cheek and hair. The second and third coated her tits, and the rest pooled in and around her belly button. Tobin looked at the aftermath. I rolled over to the side of her bed, physically exhausted from what had just transpired, and I watched as Tobin wiped off the cum on her cheek with her finger and then put her finger in her mouth. I was surprised and turned on by this action, but before I could do anything about it, she stood up, put on her bathrobe, and told me that she was going to go clean up. 

I put on my clothes and wondered what I should do. I was not sure if I should wait for her to get back or if I was supposed to leave. I got dressed and decided that I would wait. I sat on the couch, excited but also confused about the situation I was in. After what felt like eons, Tobin entered her room freshly showered. 

“And after all that work I did to get you out of those clothes, there you go and just put them all back on. I guess I’ll have to make sure you stay out of them next time,” she joked.

“Next time?” I asked. “There’s a next time?”

“Unless you don’t want there to be.”


I smiled at her and rose from the couch. “Next time sounds like fun.”"
4gl1b8,1,2016-04-26,How to handle offer while still interviewing.,mermaidpearl,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4gl1b8/how_to_handle_offer_while_still_interviewing/,"I was offered an internship over email today and while it would be a great internship, I am still interviewing at another company. In fact, tomorrow the director will be calling me for our first interview (I already talked to HR last week). As I understand it, his interview will be the last in the process but I am unsure if he will be giving me an answer tomorrow or not.

What should I say to the first company? It seems like they want me to respond right away, as they didn't give me a deadline to accept.

I want the internship with the company I'm talking to tomorrow more because they have a more defined program and when I spoke with the first company on the phone, the director I""d be under seemed skeptical about my school program requiring me to be there 25 hours a week. He has never had his own interns in his department before so he knew nothing about the typical hours they have at his company but he seemed like I would not have enough to do for 25 hours a week. He also said he would check and see if I could assist with certain duties in other departments, but his email mentioned nothing about my responsibilities and tasks and what I would be learning/doing at all. 

I need *something* to graduate, so I will take what I can get, but maybe you understand why I want to wait until tomorrow's interview. I also do not want to accept anything yet because I have no intention of backing out- I stick with my commitments.


Also, the internship I'm still interviewing for offers parking and pays, while the other doesn't pay, doesn't offer parking, and I don't live in that city so I'd have to ride the metro in or park at a parking garage everyday. (I don't live in either city but the first internship offers parking).

What should I say to the company that has offered me something so that I have time to make a decision about both and don't risk losing all opportunities? And can I ask the second company if they will be deciding this week about me, and say that I have an offer elsewhere but they are my top choice?

Thanks for your help."
4gl1h7,1,2016-04-26,"[20m] Smart, directionless and probably unhappy",prospectivesplitter,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4gl1h7/20m_smart_directionless_and_probably_unhappy/,"I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I'm very smart (2300 SAT, ~145 IQ, 174 mean practice LSAT score), but lately I've been feeling as though that's the only good thing about me. Everything that I've ever accomplished in my life has been the product of raw intellect, cleverness and a willingness to bend rules, or the support of my parents and their network. 

My first problem is that I don't have very much grit or mental toughness. I don't know how to fix this, or even if indeed it is fixable. It seems so intrinsic. But then again, I've never really seen people in general as having much agency at all- like everyone else, I am mostly, if not entirely, the product of my genetics and upbringing. If I grow tired too easily, break down too easily, am too averse to pain and discomfort- this to me seems no more intentionally changeable than one's intelligence or beliefs. 

My second problem is that everything seems so stupid.
 
Our politicians debate abortion without the slightest reference to bioethics, they discuss fiscal policy with little regard for empirical evidence or even the rules of arithmetic, and when it comes to immigration and foreign policy they don't even pretend to try to come to any sort of agreement. They just bash contradictory axioms into one another as though they are competing to see who can talk loudest.

Every internship I've held seems to be an exercise in jumping through hoops. I had a stint at an investment bank where I learned that my boss didn't understand probability and that success is often about getting lucky and/or getting people to like you. I had another internship at a manufacturing plant where I spent my time filling out forms and doing what essentially amounted to arts and crafts. 

The vast majority of my high school friendships and relationships took an enormous amount of energy and no small degree of pretending to sustain. I have four or five good friends from high school in my life, and I'm grateful for that, but the ease with which I drifted away from the rest made me realize what a pointless waste of time it is to try and be a part of a predefined group for its own sake. 

I don't seem to be able to sustain romantic relationships because I tend to end up feeling smarter than and superior to my partner. This doesn't always happen (I've dated at least one girl who was definitely smarter than I was, which was also probably my best relationship) but it happens in the vast majority of cases. And besides needing a smart partner, I also need someone who is relatively attractive and doesn't want much in the way of traditional emotional reciprocity- I'm a somewhat cold person and I don't expect that to change. It seems there is a good chance I'm just not cut out for a serious, lasting relationship. 

So the way politics are structured seems stupid, the way the professional world works seems stupid, and the vast majority of interpersonal relationships seem stupid. What am I supposed to do? 

I want to be important. I know that I have the intelligence, and there is so much about the world that I want to change, but I really don't think I have any of the other qualities associated with success (grit, optimism, fondness for people in general, a healthy sense of self) and I don't think these are things I (or anyone) can really consciously change. 

For what it's worth, I'm aware that there's a chance I'm a cerebral narcissist. That might fit, since I haven't always felt this way as strongly as I do now, and I am at the age where the disorder tends to manifest. But if that is the case, there isn't really anything that can be done to fix it. 

I know this rambled a bit and I apologize for that. I think that the long and short of it is that I want things that I probably won't be able to get, and might not even exist. I want people to listen to me, I want to make the world more logical, I want to be the decider-of-things, I want people to treat me as though I have some sort of special insight. I'm not in a bad life situation right now at all (good college, decent GPA, on track for decent-to-very-good postgrad prospects, reasonable social life) but I just don't know what I should do, how to get the things I want, or  how I should live with myself when I probably fail and am forced to settle.

4gl5go,3,2016-04-26,[Product Question] Cheaper alternative to Finacea / Azelaic Acid?,ilyjen,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/4gl5go/product_question_cheaper_alternative_to_finacea/,"Hi SCA

A week ago I had posted about my frustrating experience when I sought a dermatologist treatment for mild rosacea. 

Long story short, I'm on a graduate student / intern budget and my (soon to be former) derm was trying to sell me on a lot of expensive and excessive treatments for mild rosacea (overpriced/irritating skin care lines, brand name laser treatment sessions for $650 a piece, etc,.)

He had prescribed me Finacea gel (Azelaic Acid). However, it wasn't until I went to pick up my prescription that I realized it would be $160 per tube. I did a bit of research and there doesn't seem to be a generic of Finacea yet. 

I'm wondering if any one here knows of or has had success with a similar compound to treat rosacea or what I should consider asking him for. "
4glbet,49,2016-04-26,Return of DW (The Diddy trilogy),BillMurrayWuzHere,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/4glbet/return_of_dw_the_diddy_trilogy/,"Part 6. nah, I'm kidding; part 3. 

So we’re near the end of wedding plan mode and entering the realization that in just a short amount of time we were to be wed. There were a few bumps with the wedding plans and the biggest of course were Diddy and AlmostOrange. 
My wonderful DW had seemingly kept the two of them in check but it seems like they were both biding their time waiting to strike. Final payment was due for the caterer and Diddy wanted to make it. This was Diddy's only contribution to our wedding. We never asked, she never offered. Now; I’m not sure how other caterer’s do it but when the final payment is made, they total up the sum and refund everything so the final payment is just the complete payment. Whatever. Seemed weird to me but apparently other places (like Disney) have this practice as well. I’m not sure if it’s even remotely beneficial to anyone involved but whatever that’s how they do it. 


However our caterer done fucked up big time. When Diddy called to make the final payment they refunded HER the entire amount and Diddy fucking hung up the phone. Yeah dude. That means Diddy had now gained big $$$ that was rightfully ours (or the catering company). So after said company couldn’t get back in touch with Diddy, i wonder what happened given that they were just speaking to her, we received a message from them saying there was a problem with payment and that it needed to be made or we were to lose our date. 


DW contacted Diddy, as I assumed the worst and figured Diddy had something to do with it. What I didn't expect to learn was she had stolen our money. Diddy said that she had all the money and would give it back to the caterer when she worked everything out…(FUCKING WHAT) then laid out everything that bothered her during our wedding plans. 

• Diddy didn’t feel involved enough.

Honestly tough shit. She was right though, near the ending of the planning DW stopped inviting Diddy to things. Obviously because DW is a shitty person right?  Every time Diddy came to something she was just awful. Tastings? Hated everything, said we were stupid for even going with the caterer we chose. Wedding party gifts? Really the only person who deserves anything is AlmostOrange (SIL). Dress shopping? My wife found “the dress” Diddy told her not to buy it. Said there were millions of dresses and she should wait. Then come to find out, while they were there, “the dress” was actually on sale for 50% off, meaning the cost of “the dress” was now well under budget. Everyone but Diddy reasoned that maybe DW should just buy it, but Diddy had picked out several dresses, all almost 3x dress budget and maintained nobody “finds the one on so easily.” Whatever the hell that means. Diddy also made sure everyone knew she had no inclination in helping out finaces wise IF DW had even liked the other dresses, so who was she to volunteer? DW wanted “the dress” and my sister to her credit, threw the dress on the counter and paid in full in cash telling her “If you find something else; great, we’ll trash this one. DW wore “the dress” for our wedding.

•	The bachelorette party.

One of DW's friends’s made an off-hand comment to some of the guys in my wedding party that they would be getting strippers so it was ok for them to get some for me. Nothing else was said until the bachelor parties when someone brought it up. AlmostOrganges boyfriend at the time NormallyCoolGuy heard this and was a little upset. Apparently AlmostOrgange had sworn up and down to NormallyCoolGuy that there were to be no strippers (Their relationship was a mess, neither of them trusted each other,  he wanted to move, she didn’t want to leave her mother’s house, he got a new job, she would show up and attempt to hang around and would start a fight when he would try to get her to leave, it’s a whole thing) So he takes a few minutes for himself and calls up AlmostOrange to see what’s up? A few minutes after that I get a call from Diddy, I picked up so I guess I had it coming, about how I was going to pay after breaking up AlmostOrange and NormallyCoolGuy. I told her whatever was going on between them wasn’t any of my business, as I didn’t really know anything about what was happening yet, and said that it really wasn’t hers either but if she wanted to be involved to call one of them. Well she called AlmostOrange and I guess she was too drunk to put together a conversation, so Diddy took it to mean that I had done something to her. Yes, she thought I had drugged her. So guess what cops get called and show up to my house and my landlord calls me up and my bachelor party heads over to handle the police. Luckily Diddy has a file showing a ton of complaints towards her (from myself and a few others who have dealt with her shit) so once I explained AlmostOrgange was drunk and a WHOLE STATE AWAY, he offered his congratulations and sympathies and left. NormallyCoolGuy cooled off and apologized and an awesome night was had, sans strippers by the way.

•	No one from her list was invited.

We received a three page (double spaced) list of people Diddy wanted to invite to our wedding. DW didn’t know, hadn’t met, (or were actually dead!!!!) the majority of the list, but did invite those she did know, had met, and were still alive. To our surprise some of them declined! I’d say about 10 out of the 75 people she wanted us to invite came. Some sent us gifts, and some sent us gifts through Diddy. Her version of the story is that we did not invite a single solitary person from her list. So people she knew just showed up? Random wedding presents just arrived on her doorstop? One of guest (DW’s 2nd cousin) was visiting, I took it upon myself to  ask Diddy how could she say we didn’t invite anyone when 2nd Cousin had gone and I didn’t even know them before the wedding; Diddy pretended not to know what I was talking about. 2nd cousin pushed for an answer and Diddy just said she was too tired to remember. (People doing that drive me crazy. Being wrong is just unacceptable to some people, it’s just stupid) 


• And finally: I wasn’t working. 

She had me there. During the last 3 months before our wedding I had been interning at place I’d wanted to work at my entire life. The problem with said internship was that I wasn’t getting paid. Diddy harped that we couldn’t survive on a single income that we had spent too much on our wedding and honeymoon. I was an irresponsible adult who had left a pregnant ex-girlfriend and I would do the same to DW. Hold up. What. Like seriously what. Go ahead and take a shot at me not bringing in an income but the ex-girlfriend stuff? 
Buckle up because this is weird as shit.
AlmostOrange and Rita (my ex) had on their own decided to “get me back”. Get me back. Like revenge. Make me pay. For what you ask? Lying about being sick. (My other posts cover my illness as much as I felt like revealing; tell ‘em bitchbot!) Rita got it in her fucking head that she could have been really happy with me if I hadn’t tried to convince her I was sick, if I hadn’t done that she wouldn’t have cheated on me for those 4 months before I said anything. We could have had a baby together. So they decided to tell Diddy that I essentially bailed on what could have been a happy life with Rita so what would stop me from abandoning DW? 

You can unbuckle now.


DW hung up the phone and threw it; breaking it and our window. She has Amazonian strength.  This was such an unfamiliar feeling, I was overwhelmed but, by nothing. Logically speaking I knew that I hadn’t done anything wrong, but this was still a fucking problem I had to fix. I sat down and thought everything out the best I could. I really, honestly, wasn’t worried about the money. It was ours, caterers had records of our payment, and if it came to that we would just go to the police, catering company was being more than reasonable (granted it really was their fault refunding all the money to someone who hadn’t made a payment yet) and even told me a few MIL stories later. DW was not worried about the job (I mean, I certainly was) but she was convinced I would land a paying position there (I did) and that was enough for her. What she was pissed about was this shitty ex-gf kept popping up. AlmostOrange and Rita had worked together for awhile but now seemingly only met up to talk about this shit, so I said I would deal with Rita and DW would deal with AlmostOrange. I don’t know a lot about what happened between them but I do know DW and AlmostOrange like…had it out, you know what I mean? Like full on calling her out, yelling, screaming, the whole kit AND kaboodle. 

On my end, I did the only thing that I could think of. I called Rita’s mother. Now to hear Rita tell it, I didn’t even her mother’s first name (Its Ann) and I didn’t give a shit about her family. The actual truth is that Rita starting keeping me away from them once she started cheating on me and would tell them similar lies about how shitty I was. Nothing too serious I guess as I never received a threat or a police visit. Ann was all too happy to hear from me. She said she was keeping up with our various posts about the wedding and specifically was glad about our florist decision. After some tip-toeing on my end I finally told her why I was calling. I was nervous, I’m not normally confrontational and even less so when talking to someone’s parents. I let it out how awful Rita is being to me and that I’m not sure what to do, I mentioned how I was thinking about pressing charges, but didn’t want to, I just didn’t want to be stuck with her daughter attempting to screw up my life. I told her “Rita used to be so awesome and I’m having a hard time believing that she would actively try to ruin my life” Those were more or less my exact words, but that was the last part of my rant/part of the conversation.

Ann, to her credit, didn’t try to defend Rita; she gave me what felt like a heartfelt apology. Her part of the conversation didn’t really last long, she kept apologizing for Rita’s actions, and we hung up after she asked for our address so she could send us a wedding present. (Disney gift card if you’re curious) and that was it. I felt silly as I wasn’t really sure what I expected. It was…sort of nice to know that Rita’s own mother didn’t condone her daughter’s actions but outside of that, on my end, I felt flat and unaccomplished. Then my phone rang. It was Ann’s # so I picked up but it was Rita who spoke.
I won’t get into it her as I’ve kinda gotten far away from the MIL but I did get an apology. She cried, she yelled, she said a bunch of things but she said sorry and I told her I didn’t want to hear from her again. Specifically I didn’t want to hear about her filling AlmostOrange or Diddy with any bullshit. She promised and swore up and down that she was sorry, and I said thank you and hung up. And that’s it. Rita from that point on was now a memory. I mean not a good one but better a memory than whatever else she was, right?

So now back to Diddy. DW took a page out of my playbook and went to visit Diddy’s mom: Nana. Nana helped DW map out a plan on what to do, what to say, and really went over and over with DW about how sorry she was that her wedding was like this. Instead of stating what they came up with I’ll just tell it how I saw it with Diddy.
We arrive at Diddy’s household, AlmostOrange long gone as was requested (fucking told) by DW. DW sat down and read aloud what she and Nana wrote out. I could not find that paper for the life of me. That’s what took so long between my last post and this one; DW thought she had it in a memory box but we haven’t found it yet. 
DW: First off, we will not talk until you give/put/pay the money to the caterer. We cannot have a reasonable conversation if you are holding our wedding hostage. Period. Once we get word that the money is all set we will come back and talk about everything, but if you keep the money past x amount of time (I think it was 4 hours or 4 days, it was definitely a 4.) I will not ever speak to you again, period. 

And with that we got up and fucking left. I guess I still can’t believe it. DW was just awesome and unreal and all things incredible. 

We drove around for hardly any time at all; in fact I seem to remember leaving a drive thru line, when we got a call saying the money was all set.  We got back to Diddy’s house and DW laid it all out again. This is the best I can do from memory. 
DW: Bill and I are getting married. We love each other and want to spend the rest of our lives together. In order to be a part of that life we are only asking you to do one thing: Cut the shit. If you care about me at all that is what you will do. If you can’t do that you will not hear from me. You will miss out enjoying time with me, you will miss out on family events, and you will miss out on grandchildren and their lives. It’s your choice that you do and say hurtful things to us, so it is your choice to stop doing those things. You don’t have to decide now, but you will have to tell us by x day before the wedding as we won’t risk you ruining our day. We love you, if you love us than all you have to do is continue to love us and leave the rest of this garbage behind. 
DW of course was crying and Diddy began to cry which I hadn’t seen before. We left and Diddy ending up apologizing and promising a new start. She came to our wedding and everything went off without a hitch. We did have a friend provide some “security” (a few bouncers from his job) as we weren’t stupid.  


DW and Diddy have worked out a lot of issues and they get dinner every so often. There was other stuff that I didn’t mention as the road will always have bumps.  Diddy and I don’t really talk much but she is polite and conversational when I’m around and I’m more comfortable around her now. AlmostOrange has matured quite a bit from when I first met her, unfortunately it did take losing NormallyCoolGuy before she really applied herself, but I dunno sometimes people need that feeling to grow. 
Now that the big stuff is out of the way, and I got my catharsis, I hope to post the funnier dummy things they did, but for now (and I’ve always wanted to say this) That’s all folk’s!  "
4glf3v,38,2016-04-26,[Spoilers] Season 4 in a nutshell and reminder to not watch,yeasurewatever2k15,arrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/4glf3v/spoilers_season_4_in_a_nutshell_and_reminder_to/,"After Laurel got killed by Darhk, she immediately gets replaced by Madison McLaughlin who will wear her costume in the Canary Cry episode. So Oliver will be trying to beat the living crap out of a little girl who is dressed as his recently deceased ex-girlfriend right after Eleven-Fifty-Nine. Seems that Guggie decided to fridge the Black Canary in the last episode so Mericle can ruin her legacy for the next one.    

Detective Lance will hear about this Decoy Canary and then be in denial that his daughter died because the writing is stupid. Don’t get lured into the fact that Canary Cry has a flashback featuring Oliver and Laurel kissing because this is a Mericle and Schwartz crap written episode. Just wait for that clip to like go on YouTube or something to go see it.

Next episodes’ synopses feature more Smoak family drama bs and how Diggle/Felicity both handle Laurel’s death worse than Oliver did despite hardly interacting with her, which is also ridiculous. Plus Thea decides to go on vacation after everything that happened. 

For the finale, Oliver obviously kicks Darhk’s ass. Thea leaves the team for Malcolm for a very stupid reason. The Decoy Canary appears again. E-2 Black Siren does NOT. And it’s just narrowed down to an unreasonable excuse for having boring ass OTA for season 5. Only thing to be optimistic about would be imagining the looks on the showrunners’ faces if their combined effort on the finale got them worse ratings than that “Broken Hearts” episode written by interns.


That is the rest of season 4’s cringe in a nutshell. Don’t try to watch it unless you want to emotionally stress yourself out and have your intelligence insulted over again. Especially since all the remaining episodes are both written and directed by known Olicity shippers. 

Arrow already clarified the decadent direction it’s now taking from its showrunners trying to make terrible excuses for killing Laurel off. Also, the Arrow Writers room twitter account is still retweeting   Olicity/OTA pics for FanArt Friday instead of the Laurel ones with Oliver and even her father! Hopefully, the show might get forced to change if its ratings go down way more than expected. For those who are concerned if Olicity shippers might be the majority, they should go see what Jane the Virgin and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s viewership numbers look like to get the idea."

These feelings have just killed any motivation I have for doing any of the work I need to do right now.

I guess part of the reason I feel this way is because I attempted to get an internship last summer through a local programme but didn't even get shortlisted for any jobs so I feel like I have absolutely nothing to offer anyone.

I'm 22 years old.  I go to a top 50 college in the US and I messed up a great opportunity.

I came into this school with the intention to major in computer science, but I quickly failed out of my opportunity for that because you cannot fail a class twice and be in the program so I was forced to change my major, which I did to stats.

I will probably fail one more class this semester.

***


**Demographics:** Pittsburgh, White male, private school, upper middle class. Both parents went to college and I have an older sister at Harvard.

**Intended major(s):** Electrical Engineering. (comp E is my top choice, but it's usually offered as a subset of EE)

**Academics:**

* **SAT:** superscore: 2310 (710R, 800M, 800W)

* **SAT II:**
 * Math II - 800
 * Physics: (taking June)
 * Latin: (taking June)

* **GPA:** about 4.0, might drop to 3.9 this year though. (My school has a weird ranking system. A is 4.00, but A+ is 4.3. Sorry, I don't know what that is standardized.)

* **Coursework:** Current (Junior) year: BC calc part 2, physics calc, AP CS, US history, Latin 4a, Symphonic Band (I play the trombone and I'm low brass section leader), various english classes.
 * my school doesn't offer many AP courses, but I'm taking all of the ones offered I think. (besides other languages, art, etc) I'm taking the most rigorous schedule I can, which of course hurts my GPA (and sanity sometimes haha), but I like the classes themselves for the most part.
 * **AP scores:** (none taken yet.) 

 * BC Calc: 5 expected. (*easy* 5 on the mock exam my school offered, almost everyone in the class gets a 5.
 * I will also take physics C mech/E&amp;M, and Comp Sci.

* **Awards:** 
 * 4 or 5 top ten national Science Olympiad placements
 * Some latin contest awards
 * this is probably a big week spot for me, as I don't do too many outside of school competitions. (I'm building an ROV though that I want to enter into PRSEF, my region's ISEF feeder.)


**Extracurriculars:**

 * Robotics Club Captain - I'm in charge of my school's small robotics team which competes in FTC. We have 1 faculty member who isn't really that involved, so I'm the go-to and I put a huge amount of my time into this. (Every day from 3-6 for end of fall and winter. 3-9 for the two weeks leading up to competition.) We won our region this year, but we're not that good. However, we get almost zero school funding and when I got involved as a freshman they had gotten last place at states the year before, so I feel like I've made a good impact on the club. I set up the lab myself with a friend in the basement of the admissions office last summer and got IT to put a computer in and built a field myself with a friend.

 * I used to do Science Olympiad (as in SOINC) up until this year. I wuit last year when I became weary of a few team members and the head coach (everyone lied to each other and competed with each other a fuck load and the coach got kicked off the team for forgetting to sign them up this year, so I think I dodged a bullet by dropping it.)

**Summers:**

 * I teach [Andrew's Leap,](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./leap/) which is a 7 week CS and robotics course at CMU for high school students. It's about 40 kids and it's fairly competitive to get into. I took it two summers ago, and now I teach the robotics track. I help them build and program robots culminating in a final project. [Here are some from last year.](http://tomscherlis.com/otw-portfolio/leap/) I will be teaching again this summer but only part time. (I still get to teach the students but I won't monitor the lectures and stuff)

 * This summer I will be doing an internship at [Astrobotic](http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/research/projectEntry.php?id=LunarXPrize), the CMU team for the Lunar X Prize. I will be working on finishing the design of the camera board, an [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) which streams the live low res video as well as stores the HD video. I will be working mostly alone, as the *one* guy who works on that part of the rover before I got involved went out of town last week and won't be coming back until after summer, and won't be accessible all summer. I asked him who to ask if I ran into trouble and he said the internet lol. I will be working independently om this system, but I will still be involved with the rest of the team and hopefully can get a good rec letter at the end. This is a strong part of my application IMO.

**Portfolio/Hobbies**

This is a weird thing to add, but I think a large aspect of my life is my passion for engineering, which isn't really represented by my GPA or test scores. MIT has a portfolio section so I thought my personal projects might be relevant.

* My physics class has a term project each trimester that we have to do, and most students do something half-assed for the grade, but I try to do something ambitious if I can. Fall and this Spring I've been working on an ROV (robotic submarine), and I've put almost every sunday for the last month and most of fall as well as countless hours researching at home working on it with 2 of my friends. It's super cool, but doesn't work yet :P Hopefully I will get it working within the next 3 weeks. I also made a coil gun but that wasn't as cool. They are detailed [here](http://tomscherlis.com/otw-portfolio/nautilus-2/) and [here](http://tomscherlis.com/otw-portfolio/coilgun/). I'm getting a rec letter from my physics teacher hopefully, and I think these two projects will influence the letter a lot.

* Outside of school I also do a lot of projects, but idk how I can get any of that stuff noticed by colleges but also sound genuine. Engineering is 100% my favorite thing to do, but idk how I can convey that without sounding fake. Bonus project plug: I'm trying to build a mechanical bird for fun. It's super cool but nowhere near complete. I want to enter it into a contest but it's really more for fun. Details [here](http://tomscherlis.com/otw-portfolio/avidrone/) if you care about that stuff.

**Schools:**

I will apply for all EA, unless it is binding or restrictive

* MIT (big reach)
* CMU (I'm local and my dad is faculty there so that helps)
* U Penn
* Princeton
* Cornell
* Harvey Mudd
* Cal tech
* I'm open to suggestions. I haven't looked into this enough.

**Hooks?**

* not sure what to really put here. I have really severe [Cholinergic Urticaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic_urticaria) that has thus far been untreatable, which makes sports and things really really hard for me and makes interviews and other 1 on 1 situations difficult. Basically if I sweat or get nervous I break out almost instantly in severe hives. I've had it for a few years and it hasn't gotten better even with meds. My doctor doesn't really know what to do at this point but I guess I'll deal. :I I saw somewhat else put a disease in their hook so I guess I'll do the same.

**Questions**

I do a lot of personal projects that I think illustrate the amount of commitment I have towards engineering and making shit, but other than specific schools like MIT which have a portfolio option, I don't know how to incorporate that into my app without coming off as fake. Thanks everyone in advance!

4gm82w,18,2016-04-26,"I finally got back into reading by reading two books this week, after not reading anything in almost two years!",giants4210,books,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4gm82w/i_finally_got_back_into_reading_by_reading_two/,"Warning: may contain spoilers

I used to be such an avid reader as a kid, but since I got to college it's been a lot harder to get myself to read. I finally got the push to do it as I made a deal with my friend to trade suggestions, I'd give her film suggestions and she'd give me book suggestions (I'm a big film buff).

So the first thing that I read was The Subterraneans by Jack Kerouac. His writing style was a little off putting. It was hard to follow what he was talking about with his intentional stream-of-consciousness writing style. I still enjoyed it though. The pains of conflicting desires and actions is definitely relatable. I thought it was somewhat freudian that he mentions his mother and how he has to split time between her and his girlfriend, and once they break up the first thing he does is go to her. 

The second book I read was Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky. That book was phenomenal. I've never been so intrigued by someones rationale, his interesting contradictions, his loathing for the world. Dostoevsky mocks some views that I even held prior to reading the book. His criticism of them through this character is so strong I think it will be hard for me to think the same way after finishing it. I could hardly put this book down; it's probably one of my top 10 books I've ever read.

I'm just so glad to be back into reading. Other than this the only books I'd read in these two years were some investing books I had to read for my internship. I love music and film and I really want literature to be just as much a part of my life as those two. Hopefully the trend will continue!"
4gmak7,3,2016-04-26,[PI] From a prompt ages ago: You are an undercover Government agent investigating scientists who have effectively discovered how to travel back in time,thecoverstory,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4gmak7/pi_from_a_prompt_ages_ago_you_are_an_undercover/,"“Neo-Harvard degree in quantum mechanics, three years at Oxford for studies in time-frame continuum, and an additional two years research with the great Molso himself on effects of time shifting.” Mr. Tompkin set the port screen down precisely parallel to the edge of his desk before meeting my eyes. “Well, Miss Ulzaruk, your resume is exemplary.”

*It should be,* I thought, tucking a strand of black hair behind my ear. It took three agents over a year of hacking, bribing, and blackmail to make it. I uncrossed my legs, feeling awkward without my holster, but smiled without missing a beat. “Thank you, sir.”

“Which begs the question, why would you wish to work at my humble lab?”

“This ‘humble lab,’ sir,” I glanced pointedly at the row of solid and holographic awards lining oak—real, not recreated oak—shelves, “is where I belong.”

The hint of a smile pushed the wrinkles at the corner of his mouth deeper, but the rest of his face remained still. He rubbed a finger across the band of his watch. “I have reached a certain… renown.” 

I took a deep breath. “Given time, I am certain your renown will only grow. I wish to be part of that.”

“’Given time.’” The watch hand shifted, and with one long finger Mr. Tompkin tapped his lips. “Time is not a gift, Miss Ulzaruk. Time is.” Behind him, the light of the imitation sun shone through high windows, haloing him. “We take it, we use it, we create more.”

“I have always believed in living green.”

“Pardon?” An eyebrow raised.

“All the talk of preservation.” I nodded at the nearest trophy, a black monstrosity that proclaimed the property to be ‘Leading the Community through Conservation’ in what was doubtlessly rare marble stone. “Certainly, conservation is to be praised. Mostly, though, I think our strengths lie in recycling. I see no reason why time should not also be recycled. Is that not what we are trying to do here?” 

Mr. Tompkins considered me, the long finger still tapping like the hand of an old clock. “Quite so.” He leaned forward, lifted the port screen up, and tapped the back instead. 

I held my breath, my fingers twining around the edge of my shirt. A beep sounded, and through the reflection on the trophies behind him I saw ‘no messages’ flash briefly across the face of it. I took a tiny breath as the screen switched to a page of legal documents. 

“3:14 on a Tuesday.” He handed the screen to me. “Quite a time for a beginning. Welcome to TimeFame, Miss Ulzaruck.”

“Thank you, sir. You won’t regret this.”

“No, I won’t.” The tone was calm and his shoulders relaxed as he watched me scan my ID chip in acceptance. “I make it my business not to.”

I hunched over my desk, watching the numbers scroll down the face of it. My coffee, an archaic habit that somehow refreshed more than any advanced supplement I’d tried, sent up curls of steam that looked like ancient smoke signals hovering over the numbers. I sighed and rubbed my eyes. With a flick of my wrist, the numbers lifted off the desk and spun into a circle around me, before slowing and floating in place. I tapped the 294 that hung an inch or so above my head and watched the formulas that formed it bloom into view. I doubted they would be wrong, but I had to check. My handler was going to kill me if I got fired.

Faint, fake moonlight slid through my tiny window, as it had for nearly three months now. The computer-generated window moon colored the numbers silver as I worked through the formulas again. Sure enough, they simplified to 294, once more hovering in front of me in the last tentacles of my coffee’s steam. Another sigh. Another sip. Either my advanced mathematics skills—pretty good, if not nearly as spectacular as my resume claimed—were way out of their league, or something beyond the mathematics was wrong.

Things had seemed to start ok. The lab had piles of work for me to sort through, and though none of the material was what my handlers were looking for, it was something. And yet… it was as though a veil separated me from the others. Few spoke to me, aside from handing me some files with a muttered hello. Those files were mostly worthless as well. The information was scattered, had no context, or was so basic an intern could do it. At first I had chalked it up to being new and untested. After completing everything in record speed, trying to begin casual discussions with other workers, and getting brushed aside at every turn, desperation had finally cracked me. I stole several chips of information.

“What progress has been made, Miss Ulzaruck?”

I jumped. Even in the last hours before dawn Mr. Tompkin’s suit was immaculate. My own lab coat hung on me in a wrinkled mess, with tiny dots of coffee splatter on the hem of one sleeve. I’d have taken it off—not much need for one in the formula room—but the clothes under it were worse. I splayed my fingers and the numbers formed a wall behind me, clearing the air between Mr. Tompkin and myself--and tucking away three or four formulas I had not been given access to in the process. I hated this part, the lying. I was terrible at it. Only my necessary mathematics degrees had gotten me this placement, and still it was a near thing after a botched course in deception—sorry, intelligence-gathering. 

I took a swig of coffee. The hot liquid seared my throat, but the pain pushed exhaustion aside as much as the caffeine did. “We are still unbalanced, but shouldn’t be. The numbers seem to be in order.” 

“Let me see.” Mr. Tompkin reached into his pocket and held out his port screen. Like at my interview, the screen was empty except for the data retrieval symbol in the corner. Only this time, no light glowed for an incoming message. 

I hesitated, then fisted my hand, pulled forward several gigs of information, and dropped them into the device. A slight twitch of my pinkie banished my ill-gotten formulas in the process. “The thing is, sir, everything I have access to is correct, but it is as though sections of the information are, well, missing.”

A single eyebrow rose, his signature move, though his eyes did not leave the screen. “I assure you, we have given you everything we can. Checking the formulas is what I hired you for, not filling in the holes.”

“I know, I know.” With a frown, I tugged at my wrinkled coat. “It’s just… it’s almost complete. It eats at me.”  My voice trailed off as I went out the door into the main machine area. I pushed in the code, hearing the *tap, tap, tap* of his footsteps behind me. The door whooshed open to reveal the most advanced piece of machinery known to man.

The machine was small; small enough to fit in my hand. It was a round sphere, so black, it seemed to dull the very light of the room from its silver pedestal. Besides the color effect though, the sphere was only a sphere. A multi-billion dollar hunk of metal that had yet to produce any solid results.

“See, the formulas work,"" I muttered, pulling up the sphere's data drive, ""but the mass that they suggest we can project is almost nonexistent.”

The tapping behind me paused for a moment. I hardly noticed as I pulled up the latest readings. 

“The formulas work?” a cool voice behind me said.

I nodded, frowning at the numbers. 

“How, exactly, do they work?”

Testing came up on the screen, and with every date and result listed, my heart pounded harder. There was no need for caffeine to keep me going now. “Well, independently, they are almost meaningless. Yet, connected with Einstein's General Relativity Theorem, I believe they predict with accuracy the intersection of parallel lines not only in space, but also with time--or time lines.”

“We discarded the relation of time to hyperbolic geometry several months ago.” The scientist said sharply.

I shook my head. “We temporarily accepted time does not connect to previous times because we could not produce evidence to the contrary, but the model was consistent even if untried. Admittedly, the formulas for finding lines in relation to time are untried, but they are there.” I slid my hand into the last result page, bringing up the information. My voice echoed against the blank walls of the sphere's chamber. “Compiling the data found with our research, the formulas, and time-line theory, not only can we prove that the connection to time is there, we can pin-point time intersections.” 

“We can prove it.” Mr. Tompkin’s voice was a low rumble as I read through the results again. Dated only an hour before, it proclaimed that the test had been a failure, and that though the numbers had been run, the energy applied, and the overlap set to 2:39, Tuesday, November 4, 2542, no real results had been seen.

“Of course,” I added off-hand, “the amount of energy that can be transferred is dismally low. I mean, the best we could hope for is basically a burst of electricity, maybe a signal to a satellite, something like…” The screen wavered in front of me.

“You said the formulas work. How do you know?”

I leaned in closer to the data. 2:39 on November 4. 

“Miss Ulzaruck,” Mr. Tompkin stomped his foot hard, the loud smack breaking my attention. “This is a huge breakthrough. I must insist that you explain yourself.”

A cold fist tightened around my lungs as I turned to face him. “I think I was, um, over-excited.” The half-truth twisted awkwardly on my lips, and I knew he sensed the lie before the words were even finished. “I-I can’t, um, *prove* it.”

Mr. Tompkin stood perfectly still. His hand did not tap on the screen, nor did his foot strike the floor. As the echo of my words died, silence settled between us.

“I see.” His soft voice belied the look in his eyes. I took a step back and bumped into the wall. 

""It-it's a theory, just a theory,"" I scrambled to say.

*Bang*

The blaster shot struck me in the chest before I'd even seen the weapon in his hand. Pain hit a second after. I crumpled to the ground, the metal grate of the flooring slammed into my cheek, and I gasped for breath against the agony.
 
“You know, I did try, Miss Ulzaruk.” Two polished shoes entered my darkening vision. “I made the calls, found where you came from, and decided to hire you anyways. It always pays to know who is spying on you.” 

My chest was on fire, pain pulsing stronger with each weakening heartbeat.

“Your mathematical ability was both a blessing and a curse. Why, the first time you discovered the extent of our advances, you actually increased the amount of energy flow! Astonishing, simply astonishing.”

My vision started to fade, the beat of my heart slowing further.

“Of course, I had to stop you from reporting it. I admit, I shot you that time too.” He crouched down and reached out a hand. I flinched, a tiny, pathetic movement, but he only patted my head, ignoring my twitch. “Your mind was so strong, I wanted to see what you could do with a little more… supervision. I warned myself at the interview, and the time-line adjusted. This time line, you didn’t find out. Not in the first month, in any case.”

His voice sounded fuzzy. I tried to focus. There had to be something, *anything,* that I could do.

“But, here we are again."" Mr. Tompkin stood again. ""I appreciate your work, I really do. Therefore, I will spare you—or, more accurately, I will spare the previous you.”

I felt it when my heart stopped entirely, when darkness consumed me, and only the last remnants of sound echoed past. “I will see you before, Miss Ulzaruk.”

The world faded into nothing.

...

Mr. Tompkins considered me, the long finger still tapping like the hand of an old clock. He leaned forward, lifted the port screen up, and tapped the back instead. I held my breath, my fingers twining around the edge of my shirt.

There was a beep, and through the reflection on the trophies behind him I saw ‘two messages’ flash briefly across the face of it. I took a tiny breath as the screen switched to a page of typed words too small to work out in the distorted reflection. 

Mr. Tompkin read as I tried not to fidget. Finally, he set the screen on his desk, exactly parallel to the edge. 

“I apologize, Miss Ulzaruk,"" he said, his voice a soft rumble, ""I am afraid that there is not a place for you now. I do thank you for your time.""

4gmgu0,4,2016-04-26,My boyfriend lies. Should it matter?,Shewsman,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4gmgu0/my_boyfriend_lies_should_it_matter/,"My boyfriend and I started dating about 2.5 years ago. We sort of started off the relationship on the wrong foot as he had been going through depression and had lots of insecurities. It affected our sex life and honestly neither of us was really enjoying the sex although I really liked spending time with him in general. I tried to talk about sex a few times but he was still very self-conscious about it. He asked me not to put pressure on him about it and told me to just ""do it his way"" until he feels better about sex. He was starting to see a psychologist so there was hope. So I kept a monogamous relationship for a while until I went out of state to do an internship for the whole summer 2 years ago. 

Since I was far away from him and the sex had not been very satisfying, I wanted to have good sex. Eventually I ended up cheating on him, several times. We would talk on the phone everyday and when he asks ""did you meet anyone?"" I'd say no because I didn't want him to feel even more insecure and for me, it really was all just sex with the random guys, nothing emotional. Then he created a fake grindr profile etc to find out that I was looking to meet guys. Obviously, he was mad and started a fight. But while having a fight, he accidentally revealed he was meeting guys all summer as well. Yet, he was really mad that I cheated on him. Anyways, he broke up with me and I thought it was all over for us. So I met a guy one more time before the end of my internship. When I got back home, we started talking again. He asked me if I met anyone again and this time I told the truth because I thought I had learnt my lesson the last time. He then asked if the guy was cute and I said the truth again (yes). He went nuts and got very emotionally unstable. He told really mean things that I still feel sensitive about and he also told all his friends and parents about how I cheated on him etc (of course without telling them that he was also cheating) and started forwarding me his friends' mean comments about me to me. I guess it was his way of coping with things. Anyways, during the few weeks of break up, I realized that I loved him so I apologized like crazy and we eventually got back together. 

This time, we had no walls because he had already seen the worst of me and I didn't have anything to hide. So it was a lot easier to be open with him. We promised we would keep a monogamous relationship and work on our sex. And I've been committed to him since then. He slowly got out of depression as his psychologist and antidepressants helped. And our sex started improving as well. We still don't have as much sex as I want because my sex drive is much higher than his, but I'm happy with our relationship. We've been living together in a nice house for a year now and we're planning our future together after we finish grad school (like which city to live, what kind of jobs/career to pursue, the house we want to buy etc). It's been really nice.

Things kind of started turning ugly again this winter. I usually go to bed before him and one day I had to go to the bathroom during the night. I walked past behind him and he didn't hear me. I saw craigslist m4m section on his computer and he was checking grindr on his phone. When he saw me, he started explaining it was not what I thought and that I was getting the wrong idea. His explanation was that he thought I was meeting people so he wanted to check if I was looking. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me but I believed him because back then I was stressed with work and could have seemed a bit unnattached. After all, we had nothing to hide after the big fight we had 2 years ago so I thought he wouldn't lie.

Over the next few weeks, he was a little off and I could tell something was up. So I confronted him as if I knew he was cheating and his facial expression immediately gave it away. He's really bad at making a poker face. He kept apologizing and told me how much he loved me and that he wouldn't do it again etc. 

Lately, I've been feeling the same thing again and he has been very unaffectionate. We didn't have any sex for a few weeks. He does have small sex drive but it was too long without sex. So I told him he seemed unaffectionate lately. He acted all very caring and said that he loved me very much, he was very committed to me and he didn't want to meet anyone else. He kept saying ""how am I gonna convince you that I'm committed to you?"" and showed me that he has no dating apps installed on his phone. But I noticed he frequently changes his phone password so I decided to check if he was telling the truth. I've recently created fake profiles on different apps and websites and sure enough he was there. On one website, his username is ""[City_Name]suck"". He was offering to service pretty much anyone.

So that's pretty much all that's been happening. I know that we both have a history of cheating on each other but I feel that our relationship is very serious now (planning our future together) and we had agreed to be monogamous at his request. Honestly, I'd prefer an open relationship to a fake monogamous relationship but when I suggeted it in the past, he insisted he wanted a monogamous relationship. Yet he cheats on me. What I really have issue with is that telling me he is ""very committed"" while cheating on me is just a big lie. And it's not like I'm gonna act nuts if he tells me the truth because we have already gone through that kind of stuff and we basically have no shame. I just don't believe anything he says anymore. 

So I'm now doubting if our relationship is heading in the right direction. I don't want a relationship where we lie to each other. It's okay if he wants to suck a different cock but I just want there to be trust. I feel uncomfortable having unprotected sex with him now because I don't know who he has been doing stuff with and it really looked like he was trying to service as many men as possible. Can I trust him with the other aspects of life, like finance, emotional support and partnership, if he is not trustworthy in this regard?

I know I'm not making a lot of sense right now because obviously my mind is not very clear due to all the emotions I'm feeling. I want to confront him right away about why he's lying so much but I feel like I need to clear my mind and think through what I want from this relationship before I talk to him. So I'd really appreciate if you guys share your different perspectives and maybe suggest some questions that I should be asking myself. And thanks if you actually read until here. :)"

4gmrdo,4,2016-04-26,[Java] Suggestions for additional learning to coincide with college.,The_Fatness,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4gmrdo/java_suggestions_for_additional_learning_to/,"Hello all, I am about to finish my 2nd semester as a Computer Programming student and my schools main focus is Java as that is what is most prevalent in our state language wise. 

Unfortunately our instructor wasn't the greatest and I feel as though I did not learn as much as I could or should have. In combination with that, our 2nd Java based class isn't until spring of 2017, so we will have a large gap in time where we likely won't be coding much for school purposes. 

What I am looking for is some suggestions on what I can do to satiate my knowledge with regards to Java to not only keep it fresh but also keep adding to my skillset. I want to start really pushing to become proficient with Java so that I am better prepared when the time comes next Spring, as well as giving me a better chance of landing my degree-required internship by having a nice array(no pun intended) of projects. I know there are resources in the FAQ section, but most of what I have found is geared towards people just starting out. I spent 1 semester doing C# and now I am focusing on Java. So I have a decent background already and am trying to find that happy medium. 

I am willing to take free online courses, &lt; $40 online courses, coding challenges, etc. I am not overwhelmed with ideas or grand theories on how to reinvent the wheel with regards to programming. I don't have the desire to go create the next big app or program, I much prefer begin given a specific task and working to accomplish it. 

I have done some basic Googling for this stuff, but there is so much saturation with coding these days that it's hard to identify quality over quantity. 

Any help in regards to above is appreciated. Hopefully this is an acceptable post, as I've had some bad experiences on places like StackOverflow asking any form of questions. If my post is considered answered by the FAQ or anything, please feel free to delete it Mods. I am just trying to pursue all available avenues to better prepare myself for the future.

Pros of SJSU

I live near San Jose hence SJSU's location is convenient.
Also SJSU is in the middle of Silicon Valley and hence finding part time and summer internships might be easier. Also it'll be convenient to commute during part time internships assuming the companies are located in the bay area

Pros of UCD

It's ranked higher.
The research prospects and lab experience would be much better.
I like the town and love the campus!
Also, I have no problem in relocating to Davis.

I permanently moved to California, where my family's living, in June 2013. My diploma wasn't released until like December 2013 so I was only able to start my application for my California license by then. It took me a year to process everything because California BON needed a LOT of documents and since I was living in LA, I couldn't personally take care of the processing of my documents and had to ask friends to help me. Of course, they didn't have all the time to go to the school registrar / college secretary so I faced so many delays. Alas, a letter came and said I needed to fulfill extra units in order for CA BON to let me take the exam. That means looking for a school who will accomodate you just so you can fulfill your units. That means being on waiting list that can take up to 3 years! I was devastated. It was a year of processing and it all came to nothing. I almost gave up until my mom said to apply to another state. I started my application for Texas in October 2014. I got cleared by August 2015 and sat down for the exam on October 2015, which I passed after one take. I didn't immediately apply to jobs after I passed because I wanted to save more money before relocating (I don't have family in Texas). March 2016, my grandmother died and I had to go home to the Philippines to help in the funeral. When I came back, I immediately started applying to hospitals. My main worry is, it's been 3 years since I graduated. I feel like no hospital is gonna accept me. From all of the applications I submitted, only two so far replied. The other one I had a phone screening interview two weeks ago and I haven't heard from him since. Another one emailed me about the internship I applied to and will call in the next few weeks for a phone interview. I'm afraid I won't get into jobs or will be rejected because there are so many new grads there whose memories and skills are still fresh. Help :("

4gn5zs,22,2016-04-27,"CMV: The ""Skilled STEM Worker Shortage"" Is a Complete Myth",skilliard4,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/4gn5zs/cmv_the_skilled_stem_worker_shortage_is_a/,"Companies across the US constantly claim that they can't find enough skilled workers to fit their needs.

Yet at the same time, Computer Science graduates from top of the line universities with high GPAs are struggling to find jobs out of college that are in their field of study(software development).

Every job, even entry level ones, ask for several years experience. The closest thing you can do to meet that as a graduate is an internship. Internships are very hard to come by, and are extremely competitive unless you have connections. Many internships are unpaid, which make it even more difficult considering how outrageously expensive college is.

A lot of people will say that you don't need everything listed on a job posting. While that's true for things like familiarity with certain software or code libraries, stuff like work experience and education is almost always required. 

Without a bachelors degree and n years of experience, you won't even get a phone screen. It doesn't matter if you've worked on dozens of open source projects as part of a team using the language the job listing is for, and possess all of the skills needed to get the job done, HR just throws away any applicants that don't have a degree and x years of experience working at an actual salaried position.

The whole ""We can't find enough skilled workers!"" thing is just bullshit spread by large corporations to get politicians to support outsourcing of American jobs and importing of foreign H-1B employees. Corporations want to do this because they can pay a foreign worker a tiny fraction of what they would pay an American to do the same work. So they act like they can't find Americans to do the work, and complain about it until they get the rights to hire foreign workers to do the work for less than a third of the pay.

Companies are completely closed minded in their recruitment process and aren't willing to actually put in effort to find skilled workers. They won't test applicants on their programming ability(such as requiring them to write a program in the language they will be working with), because aptitude tests were ruled illegal due to apparently being discriminatory, and the legal department is too worried that programming based tests could be ruled the same way. So instead they rely strictly on education &amp; experience.

With college how outrageously expensive it is now, and affirmative action making it near impossible to obtain a scholarship if you're asian/white, it's closed minded to assume an applicant is only qualified if they have a degree. Programming is one of those things that can be easily self taught. Not only are there tons of resources online for learning, but you can get help on message boards such as stack overflow, and you can collaborate on open source projects to get real world experience working on a team. In many cases, you can learn MORE through self-learning than you do at university, where you sit in lecture halls with 100+ people, and don't get any 1-on 1 assistance or experience working on a project with others. 

To summarize, tech companies aren't willing to actually test applicants that have less than n years of work experience or xyz degree, and miss out on a lot of talent. They then complain that they can't find skilled workers, when they're throwing out applications from applicants that are certainly qualified to get the job done."

UK if that matters (from speaking with Americans, you guys seem to have more of a meritocracy, whereas the UK is a lot more bureaucratic for hiring, as well as having a much weaker tech jobs market). 

I worked in a shitty, go-nowhere field, then (having studied some CS and programming in my free time, and with zero success getting into other work directly) jumped on the data science hype train and did a 1 year masters in that. This seems like a mistake, but what's done is done.

I like programming and working with databases, but without a CS degree it seems like that's a no-go field for me, and I've had zero luck so far even getting into internships. I've also had zero success getting into higher level data science stuff, and the only lower level data analyst positions I've found seem to pay terribly (less than call centers) and have no real career development.

As I see it, I have two options:

1. Take some part time job that pays well but has zero career relevance. Spend the rest of the time further building my skills and portfolio so I have some great projects to show off, which might counter my lack of CS degree. Hope to then get an internship after that.

2. Get whatever crappy little data analyst position I can. Work on skills and portfolio in whatever spare time I have left after that, although this will probably take longer than option 1. Option 2 basically banks on the shitty position having at least some career relevance, which I'm not sure it does.

Recommendations on my next move? I'd also like to get the hell out of the UK ASAP, but without decent experience behind me, I don't think that's likely for a long time."

I am in a bit of a predicament regarding getting 2 speeding citations in the past month (my only 2 citations I have ever gotten for speeding, and anything regarding the law in general). A little background before I ask questions: 
I am an 18 year old college student located in North Carolina.  In late February, I got a a speeding citation for going 60mph on a 45 in Henderson county. The citation states that I was radar detected. A month later, unfortunately I got a second citation for going 84 on a 65 (19 over the speed limit). The police officer slammed me with a Class 2 Misdemeanor. All he told me was that I had to appear in court for a mandatory court date. For this citation, I was speed trapped by a laser gun in Cleveland County. I own a late 80s Nissan with pop up headlights. I contacted an attorney for the first citation, and he mentioned that he will most likely be able to get my first citation reduced to improper equipment.

1)Will the second citation impact the outcome of the sentencing for the first speeding citation even if the trial for the second citation would not have occurred yet?

2)If I get an attorney for the second citation which is a Class 2 Misdemeanor, what are my chances of getting the criminal charge dropped?

3)If my first citation sentencing results in an improper equipment scenario, can this positively impact my misdemeanor trial for the second citation?

4)I am a college student looking to get into internships soon as well as graduate programs in the future. If I do get convicted of a Class Misdemeanor, how much will it impact my future?

Time to lay down the Law.",dalenacio,SecretSubreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretSubreddit/comments/4gns5y/hello_this_is_your_new_chief_medical_officer/,"Hello facility, I am your new Chief Medical Officer. after a prompt recruiting process (the random button), I have been put in charge of all that concerns the health and safety of this facility, as well as ensuring that Medbay runs smoothly and efficiently.

During my short time here, I have made some truly frightening discoveries about the state of the Medbay that my predecessor, Dr. Cutsoffdicks PhD., has left me, and of the facility in general. In light of this, I would like to establish a few rules that I hope we will all follow so we can be swift and efficient with our patients. You'll thank me when you need that severed arm taken care of.

**0-**   New rules may be added, removed, or modified *at any time* by the Chief Medical Officer. It is your responsibility to keep up to date on the rule changes.

**1-**   Medbay is for patients and doctors only. You are not allowed to loiter around Medbay if you do not fall into either category. Furthermore, even if you *do*, you are *expressly* forbidden from performing any sexual acts while you are in Medbay. NO EXCEPTIONS. This rule comes after my discovery that Medbay has become a popular spot for sneaking off and, hrm, ""playing doctor"". Find somewhere else, or better yet, keep it in your pants. We're supposed to be professionals for God's sake.

**1-a** No flirting with the nurses or doctors While they're on the clock either!

**2-**   Medbay will **not** treat any injuries caused by or related to the following. Some of these we will treat the first time only. (This list is subject to expansion. You people are sick fucks):

* Dildo Guns
* Botched self-transformation attempts.
* Vent Tigers (Really, you should know better)
* Interns
* Executive Punishment
* Furry Mutants
* Scaly Mutants
* Tentacle mutants
* Pony Mutants
* Any Mutants
* Dildo Guns

**3-**    Medbay will not treat people who have broken any of the Medbay rules more than once. The first time's a warning, the second is not.

**4-**   Medbay will only treat *humans*. Seriously, what's with all the mutants running around the place. It really makes our life a *lot* more complicated when we have to operate on someone who thought it'd be cute to have his heart replaced with a second cock and balls. ~~Even something as simple as fur easily messes up our hygiene protocols~~ (no longer relevant). The one exception to this rule is mutants who wish to be turned back to humans. We have the technology, you know?

**4-a**   In light of recent funding increases, we now have a full-body decontamination shower that is compatible with the ""furred"", as they are commonly referred to. Because of this, we may now give basic medical procedures to them. Nothing requiring advanced chemicals yet though. Anyone falling into this category must submit to a full decontamination procedure before being allowed into Medbay. Absolutely no exceptions.

**5-**   I suppose we'll make an exception and treat you even if we wouldn't otherwise if you'd die without treatment. Be grateful you sorry lot. 

**6-**   If you find any people who are dead, dying, mostly dead, very dead, hurt, comatose, or any variation of the previous, they must be immediately brought to Medbay. If Medbay is destroyed, offline, taken over by aliens, on strike, or unavailable for any other reason, place them in your nearest facility-available cryostasis pod. We'll deal with them as soon as we can.

**6-a**   If the person in question seems to be afflicted by some sort of pathogen, **DO NOT TOUCH THEM**. This also applies to any bodily fluids or such. Report them in and a quarantine will be established around them, at which point a mobile medical team will take a look at them. Regardless of contact or not, you should put on a sterile mask (emergency cabinets) and await for the medical team away from other people. There is a chance you are also afflicted at this point, so don't spread it.

**7-a** In the event of a level 5 or higher Biohazard threat, or a level 8 or higher threat of any kind, Medbay will go into Code Red. While Code Red is active, we will not treat any non-life threatening problems. Even if it's life threatening, we may be too busy to treat you, in which case you should wait it out in a cryostasis pod.

That is all for now. Let's all have a good time here in this lovely facility! I hope there will be as few problems as possible, and that these rules will only rarely come into play. This is C██████ J█████, Codename ""CJ"", and CMO for this facility. Over and Out."
4goin9,2,2016-04-27,My boss [40sF] bounced my [23F] paycheck...,bloomingbliss,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4goin9/my_boss_40sf_bounced_my_23f_paycheck/,"I got a part-time job (3 days per week) in late March as a Social Media Coordinator for a woman who runs a small website design &amp; marketing company. It's just her, a few developers who work from home and an unpaid intern a few hours every week. 

Then there's me. I basically hold down the fort in the office. I pick up clients phone calls, I meet with them about their questions, and they're always happy to work with me. I also manage all of their business's social media and enjoy doing it. I have a college degree in producing media so I'm experienced at this.

When the clients work with her, they're always angry because she misses deadlines and is extremely unorganized. She also never gives them the designs that they want and just does whatever she wants. Then she complains to me about them complaining to her... ugh.

Some days she has nothing for me to do so I sit at the desk all day and try to make work for myself (post on our client's social media pages, research new social media marketing techniques) but eventually it feels like the day is 200 hours long. Then, other days, she dumps SO much work on me that I'm buried in it and don't have enough time to finish it all. Also, the pay is $11 which is what I made lifeguarding in high school lol -- not good.

When the girl who had my job before me left, she introduced me to the job duties by saying, ""here are the things you need to in know in order to deal with having this job"" -- I should have seen that as a warning sign right off the bat.

The problem, however, is that I've already signed a contract with her saying I'd work here for 3 months and she'd pay me on a bi-weekly basis.

She's been paying me on time (or a day late) until this week...

My fiance and I took $1,500 out of my bank account in cash to cover the deposit on a new apartment, which left me with only a few hundred in my account. It's due May 1.

Last night I got an alert that said my bank account was overdrawn by $200. I called the bank and they said that there was a ""return item chargeback"" on the check, which means that her bank denied my bank the money, causing me to lose all of that money in my bank account and then some. So basically, she bounced my check.

I made it to the bank last night and deposited some of the cash for the new apartment so my account wasn't overdrawn anymore. (I'll make enough money by May 1 at my other job to be able to take that money back out.)

I'm really not sure how to approach her about this. I REALLY want to quit because I have another job that I love that wants me full-time ASAP. They're just waiting for me to be out of this contract. 

It seems like she nulled the contract by not paying me on a bi-weekly basis and part of me feels like I have a right to give my two-weeks but I also don't want to get into legal trouble. I doubt she'd ever take any legal action, though. 

Any advice? :/"

I work for a small private company working directly under the CFO.  Duties include entering invoices into accounting system, reconciling bank statements, prepping sales tax remittances, managing business licenses, etc.  

This is a great entry job for a student looking to gain experience and boost the resume.  The owners and workers are awesome people.  The amount of work hours is flexible.  Up to 40, but I average about 30 a week.  I can take off for school anytime I need.  No weekends.  Pay is above minimum wage.  Plus I always hear from professors at UAB that  the one thing employers want to see more from UAB grads is being able to do journal entries.  You will get a lot of practice here. 

I'm hoping to find someone who I can train for a week before I leave.  

Shoot me a message if interested."

Previous boss pushed me, in a good way, to make python script for dept to use to interact w/devices over SSH.  I LOVE the challenge I get from Python stuff, but maybe that's just the newness of it. We recently hired a Director of IT, previously local ~IT~ reported to mgr of Engineering.  I chose to work for IT guy simply b/c that's where my background is.  We hired a friend of mine ~6 months~ ago to handle day to day.  I mostly focus on projects with some support....but I'm torn.  I think Python feels the most rewarding right now, but I worry that you need to be a mgr to make money and progress in your career.

###Backstory

*brace yourselves....wall of text is coming!*

I'm 30 and have been working in IT type jobs for a little over 8 years now.  About a year into things I decided to go to a *mediocre private* college.  I got my Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems, so that has helped me get my foot in the door w/my current employer.  I've typically hopped jobs about every 2 years.

I started off thinking I wanted to be a web designer and got an internship to do web stuff...turns out I was pretty crappy at it and it wasn't that fun either.  The lady I interned under def was amazing and I'll always be in her debt for her awesome guidance, understanding and overall awesomeness.  I submitted her to ThinkGeek Sysadmin Queen in 2011 and she [WON!](http://www.thinkgeek.com/blog/2011/07/)

After that I got random jobs for a while until I landed one doing IT support for mobile users at a power company.  This got me some exposure but eventually I needed benefits and that wasn't happening.  I went back to the company I intern'd at, unfortunately diff sysadmin though :(.  

At this company I got pushed pretty hard since I'd never supported Macs or had to do a lot of the server side stuff.  Mostly involved linux based things creating users and setting up permissions for an FTP.  I still don't use *nix too much and have long forget all of it.  Started going to school while here so I could get a better job.  I liked the environment but couldn't stand the guy who was above me.  He was literally the main reason I left, always a negative spin on anything that was not to his preference.  Quite often felt like an idiot or belittled.

Went back to the power company b/c they  needed someone specifically to support Netmotion for lower region of the state.  I was thankful for the opportunity but eventually got bored.  I write some scripts and one guy I worked with the first time around was now doing SCCM stuff.  He threw me a few bones to help me out and eventually I was on the brink of getting a job with a dept that packaged apps and deployed them.  The mgr of that dept was pretty old school and pretty much said the only way I could do the job was if I drove to HQ 1.5 hours away **EVERYDAY**, this obvs wasn't going to fly.  I ended up leaving the company once I got the picture that all the good jobs were at HQ.  Had some other gripes, but that single one is why I left.


Accepted offer from my current employer, whom found me on some website.  I walked in and knew I had a lot to change or improve upon.  They were in the middle of a win7 deployment and I was more or less the only **local** IT guy.  I reported to the person who was handling IT before, but he was and still is extremely busy.  I started using SCCM, corp already had this setup...just weren't using locally.  I also wrote a fair amount of scripts which went over quite well with the company.

I almost left b/c previous SCCM guy worked for a hospital and his dept was hiring.  He was senior engineer on managed desktop team (SCCM, packaging apps, etc).  I ultimately decided to stay b/c it seemed like manager at hospital was a bit of a slave driver and insensitive.  Also the manager of engineer, whom my boss at time reported to, offered me two options to stay.  One was to be an SDE, which he said he'd personally help me learn.  He looked at my scripts and said I could get to where he'd want me to be.  The second option was to just find more ways to automate things and be involved in more projects.  i opted for the second. 

~ **Current job situaion** ~

With this new position I mainly did powershell stuff with AD or helping do some minimal text editing on files that an autoclave machine spit out with garbled data.  Then my boss asked me if I could try using python since it could work on diff OS's.  He gave me simple tasks and eventually asked me to make a utility so a service dept could easily work on some devices we sell via SSH.  Before they were using WinSCP and scripts...lots of manual typing and chances to mess things up.  I wrote a script that lets them do way more than they were doing AND keeps a log of everything.  The logs and key files get backed up to server before and after upgrade.  I am extremely proud of what this thing has become...at this point it's the best thing I've made in my entire career.

Company then hired director of IT, I was told I could report to him or current boss.  I opted for IT guy simply b/c my background was in that and at that point I figured I could ""compete"" with my co-workers in that dept way easier.  One was the friend that we hired who does day to day support.  Other guy did SAP and didn't really have a lot of ""IT Knowledge""  he also has fumbled quite a bit with his large scale project.  I

t's been about 2 months and now I'm second guessing my decision.  When i open up ""automate the boring things"" I get the sense of excitement and ideas to do new things.  I still have my utility that I update from time to time...but it's not enough to consume my day.  I feel like if I want to RUN with Python I need to make it clear thats what I want to do.  Otherwise I'm likely going to be pulled into projects doing who knows what.

t's been about 2 months and now I'm second guessing my decision.  When i open up ""automate the boring things"" I get the sense of excitement and ideas to do new things.  I still have my utility that I update from time to time...but it's not enough to consume my day.  I feel like if I want to RUN with Python I need to make it clear thats what I want to do.  Otherwise I'm likely going to be pulled into projects doing who knows what.

I'll be interning for the summer and I'll need a place between June 1st and August 12th and I'm hoping to find a place to share with other college students/summer interns. I've been looking at places near the UAlbany, St.Rose, and Sage campuses, preferably near the Albany medical center where I'll be interning.

 Ideally looking for a fully furnished place, with washer/dryer available, and internet. I don't want to go above $550 in rent and utilities. If anybody has a place available or knows of someone who does, please let me know! Thanks!"
4gp8k4,143,2016-04-27,Our Alaskan Tribe,Victor_King,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4gp8k4/our_alaskan_tribe/,"When it comes to the war of Man versus Nature, Nature may have taken few knocks over the years but she is far from done fighting. That's the best way to describe the area of Alaska I'm from. It's a semi island deep in the the wilderness that's only accessible by boat or sea plane for a few months out of the year. We have one shop above our boat docks and our best entertainment is going there to shoot the shit. Most of us who live out here are either running from something or just plain don't like other people. We have all types though. From former criminals to your hardcore Libertarians. Past life, race, religion, social standing, gender. It's all bullshit that goes right out the window when the first snow comes in. All you have to do up here is survive a winter and you have joined one of the most exclusive clubs on Earth. A club were the secret handshake is weathered skin and a knowing grin across a counter whenever some new J.Crew hipsters roll into town. The grin that says, “They won't make it a month. But we will. See you in a bit friend”. 

I hate to admit it, but I misread Jamie Munsen the first time I saw her. I was sitting on the docks by the shop next to Jodie and Markus when she came off the barge with the other wide eyed would be settlers. Markus was full of the tough talk and John Wayne swagger that comes with having your first winter under your belt. Jodie and I were welcoming him into the tribe with back slaps and inside jokes when we heard the three horns of an incoming boat. We leaned back in our chairs and waited for the games to begin. 

There was the usual that came off the barge. A couple who didn't realize salt would turn their jackets gray and tattered in a few days who stopped to take a selfie by the boat before wandering off. The tacticool survivalist who didn't realize that vest he was wearing would over heat him in a hour of hard work. The hardcore vegan who put more thought into his dreadlocks than his footwear (Waterproof boots will save your feet out here. Sandals are a death sentence). Then there was Jamie. She hopped off the boat green as kelp wearing brand new flannel and jeans. She looked at the ground and practically ran off the gangway with her head down. She made it to the top of the dock before adding her lunch to the salt water. 

Wouldn't last a month we thought. 

Hipster couple were out in four days. Tacticool was done by that night. Vegan did three weeks before breaking down. But not Jamie. Sure enough, a year rolled by and she had the seat right next to Markus. Flannel was torn, jeans were worn and just looking at that barge turned her pale, but she was in. Damn we misread that woman.

Years went by and she became a permanent tribal member. Actually, she was damn near invaluable. Back in her old life she was some kind of genius doctor. She always lent a helping hand when it came to getting our gardens chemically balanced or with what I guess you could call advanced first aid. She's the good type. The kind of neighbor you hope for. 

Then Dr. Jacob Weeks showed up. 

It was the same as it had always been. All of us sitting out on those docks on an early Spring day watching as the waves brought in the next boat/turnip cart of fresh meat for the Alaskan Wilderness. A dweeby little guy stepped off in steel toe boots and cargo shorts. Jamie tensed up and her brow lowered. The thick air she produced smothered our laughter The dweeby man took four steps forward before looking up at her. His jaw practically *thunked* against the dock before he muttered, “Ja-.....Jamie”. Jamie nodded at him and her teeth clenched. “Jacob”. The dweeb ran up the stairs and into the store at the top. Jamie leaned back in her seat and stayed silent the rest of the evening.

The 2AM gunshot told us what happened to Jacob. 

You see, out here we have our own laws. Killing a tribe member is unforgivable. Killing an initiate has to be explained. Take Jodie for example. She has this pitbull that guarded her land named, Rocky. Few years back a different tacticool guy shot Rocky because he was scared of him. Jodie responded by putting four in the guys chest, chopping him into bits and dumping them off the coast. She told us the whole story over beers and we understood. Rocky made a full recovery thank god. Tacticool man wasn't all that missed but then again, who would miss the kind of man who shoots a dog?

And so it was with Jamie. All of us gathered around the bar in the shop at the top of those docks. Court was in session and Jamie had been there long enough to know it. Three quarters of a bottle of bourbon between us and she gave her side of the story.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The business of healing is always just that. A business. From the moment you don your first pair of clean scrubs to having your name plastered on the side of your own private practice, everything revolves around the almighty dollar. When the skies are clear and the numbers are black there is no shortage of Gatsby styled parties where older men brag about the new model (car or intern) they recently slipped inside of. But, when the numbers are red and the bar is stocked with Gold Label instead of Blue, heads need to roll. 

Jamie found herself on the wrong end of the political guillotine. She had finished her internship when a wealthy patron checked himself in with failing kidneys. He was being made comfortable while the hospital awaited an acceptable transplant. Unfortunately for the man, money can't buy everything. Especially when a idealist stands in the way. You see, the kidneys came in and the man was probably planning which scotch to use as a test run when he got out of the hospital. The same time he was debating the Glenfidditch or Macallan, Jamie stole the kidneys and gave them to her patient. 

Well, not really. Her patient was 12 year old boy who was placed higher on the priority list than the 78 year old tycoon. She didn't so much steal as follow procedure. But, that's not how the man's family saw it. Needless to say, Jamie's career was over after that. What dignified hospital could ever hire a doctor who showed a rich someone that death isn't just for us peasants? 

Jamie was young, brilliant, and completely unemployable. 

At least in this country. 

Funny thing about the American health care system. We can give you the best treatment money can ask for. Yet in some countries, as much as I hate to admit it, they've out capitalized the United States. That my friends, takes a special type of brutality. The type that doesn't care where those little Styrofoam coolers come from; as long as they show up on time and in good working order. This country in particular, was Brazil. 

Jamie was working under a guy who was half as smart and payed twice as much named, you guessed it, Dr. Jacob Weeks. 

That was her career for the longest time. She assisted a half wit during surgery as some second cousin of the Rockefellers tried to cheat death for a fifth time. Monday through pay day Friday. Rinse and repeat. It may not have been what she had imagined when she went into medical school but when you get kicked to the curb for doing the right thing, doing the wrong can feel very right. The brand new BMW in her driveway didn't hurt either. 

For the most part people assumed the organs came from slum kids or Chinese workers who dropped dead during production. People generally no one gives a shit about. Then one day they were doing an eye transplant. Some young trophy wife decided she wanted blue eyes and her husband was more than happy to foot the bill. Surgery went well and Jamie was looking over the charts when she saw the name of the donator. Thomas Munsen.

When she left the U.S., Jamie left behind her parents, an older sister, and a little brother. That little brother was riding his bike down a hill one day when he jumped a curb and went into a tree/coma. You can probably guess what happened when the young trophy wife started shopping around for a new pair of blue eyes. The plug was pulled and a Styrofoam cooler made an overnight trip to Brazil. 

Jamie, unknowingly put her brother's eye into the skull of a trophy wife. Jacob, on the other hand did know. In fact he was the one who placed the order. He didn't come into work the next day to avoid his obviously pissed off coworker. What he didn't expect or maybe he did was for Jamie to grab a scalpel and reclaim her brother's baby blues from the sockets of the sedated trophy wife. She hopped on the next boat and joined our little Alaskan family while two unseeing eyes rotted on a table next to a screaming blind blonde. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personally, I think she was justified to shoot Jacob. We all did, actually. Seriously. There was a vote and we decided to sink the doctor out in the bay. Shame. Jamie's good and all but you could always use a second doctor. But, you know what they say. Family is family. Hopefully next year will be more fun. "
4gpa7k,3,2016-04-27,How do you deal with insecurities?,the-chicken-chaser,INTP,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/4gpa7k/how_do_you_deal_with_insecurities/,"I don't know where I should post this, so I figure I'd better post it here because I think most of you guys can understand this and probably have been in my situation too. So I am a computer science student and in my place the rule is in your third year you've got to do some kind of internship in a real company or something like that. My time is due and I applied to a pretty big IT company dealing with big data and IT consultation. 

I didn't quite realize that it's indeed a big company and the challenges must be pretty real until I got to meet with the boss and we had this talk and discussed what we'd do in our internship etc. That's when I realized that what we'd do would be real BIG and difficult. Then he talked about some former interns who came from a prestigious uni (mine isn't that prestigious, but still a quite decent one) and that some of them were national winners of IT competition and something like that. And here I am like nothing, never won anything, never accomplished anything big, there's barely I can feel proud of. I am not even sure with my skills or even myself.

So I was actually thinking of stepping back, maybe find a smaller company, startups or something like that where the challenges won't be that difficult and I can be confident and feel good about myself. But when I told my friends and parents, they told me to just take it and ignore my doubt. To be honest I am scared. I keep overthinking about what if I can't do it there, I'll only embarrass myself. But on the other side I think if I don't take this chance, I am wasting something really really big. Also, this has always been my dream. I really want to learn about big data and consider being some kind of data scientist later. 

I also had this talk with my friend a while ago and in her words she kind of implied something like ""you're pretty smart, but why are you still in this position is something I don't understand."" Sometimes I look at myself and regret about this too, with my coding skill right now, I should have been somewhere, but I am not. I am still your ordinary college student who is too busy worrying instead of doing something useful. It frustrates me very much. I think that most of my problems come from my own self-doubt which I often blame myself for that. What do you think about this? Now that I am writing this, not only do I feel insecure, I suddenly feel I am stupid too. 

tldr: I have this chance to be an intern in a big IT company, but I am not sure I can do it because I am insecure with my skills and myself."

Pretty much as soon as i accepted it, a bunch of people who i trusted and who i believed to be on very good terms with, all came out of the woodwork with their best gossip about me. The person who was in charge of promoting me started to hear more and more weird things that he disliked and i ended up getting the position taken away from me. Im usually pretty trusting of people and in general i try to get along with everyone as best as i can, which is why i was so surprised that these people actively sabotaged my job, even though they had no reason to do it (They are people from another ""department"" who can not apply for the position, and i would not have power over them). So basically a bunch of people fucked me for what seems shits and giggles. Now im just feeling like i cant trust anyone, i shouldn't try to have good workplace relations because I'll just get fucked anyways. I would like to think that people are good in general, but now im pissed off at the world and im not sure i can go back to being a fun person at work, which is extra shitty for me because having a good time at my job is what helps me get through the day.

On top of all this, we are all college students, and its not an internship, so i simply cant believe how cutthroat everyone is being to me when i have offered nothing but trust and friendliness to them. I dont want to become one of those cynical people who just screws over everyone else and thinks ""survival of the fittest!"" but it looks like i have no other option, and that makes my life a little more depressing.

I've basically just started learning python and they're already asking for multiple languages. Are there internships developed for people with a lot of prior knowledge?

4gppft,11,2016-04-27,Candyflipping to Save My Soul,110mcg,MDMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/4gppft/candyflipping_to_save_my_soul/,"My first LSD experience (https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/4de1lw/ego_death_on_100110mcg_my_first_trip/) was harrowing and ego-shattering but I knew I had to go back and see what else it had for me. Eight days later I took a little less LSD than I had my first time (when I had a tripping partner)—80-100mcg. This time I was alone but I also had a 210mg strawberry Molly tablet on hand. I hadn't decided whether or not I would take any Molly as it would be my first time and I wasn't sure I wanted to combine the two. I get a little antsy with this stuff. Maybe it's just where I am in life right now but I can't imagine doing it for “fun”. I left the option open though, as I wanted to let my higher Self guide the experience. 

I have been in a deep process of difficult personal evolution the past few years , much of it arising out my facing trauma from my childhood. I went to significant trouble to do Ayahuasca two times and now acquire these Inquisition'd medicines because I was tired of all my unnecessary suffering, self-limitation, and ultimately not feeling like a totally real person with agency in the world. If you've had PTSD symptoms then you likely know what I'm talking about. I'm very functional--I work, I go to grad school, and I have a counseling internship but there remained a deep uneasiness in most personal interactions and even small everyday decisions. I knew I needed to go deeper and unlock my imprisoned self, especially if I'm going to be trying to help other people. 

Anyway, I took the Acid and the come-up was very slow and gentle, unlike my first time where I got sucked into oblivion pretty quickly. Thank god for the tolerance I likely had from my first trip. 

I began to feel fairly strong effects right around the 2 hour mark and then a memory bubbled up. It was a dream I had four years ago. In the dream I was lying on my Jungian analyst's couch and she was scratching my back. She said, “110mcg, what can you do to make yourself feel extraordinarily better?” I gave no answer in the dream and I never felt like I really answered the question in the subsequent years. The dream faded into the background even though I should have paid more attention to it. 

Coming up on the Lucy with the pleasant sensations coursing through my body I realized that this was it. This was the answer to my dream. I crawled over to where I had the Molly at my “altar” with several candles burning. I cut the little strawberry tablet in half with my pocket knife. It now looked like a bifurcated heart and in that moment, the room, the chemicals, my mind, felt incredibly sacred, like I was taking a sacrament. LSD was the body and MDMA was the blood. I chewed up the slightly-larger-than-half tablet and embraced the bitter taste as an important part of the experience.

I lay back down on my blanket on the floor and put some music through my over the ear headphones which, by the way, are amazing for really experiencing music in times like this. About 30 minutes later I felt the first stirrings and, oddly, I thought about how this chemical had been stumbled upon all the way back in 1912, just a few years before millions of young men slaughtered each other in the trenches of WWI. I wondered if maybe those same people would have been less apt to slaughter each other if they had had access to this experience? I thought of what we might be holding back now that could prevent untold suffering in the future.

Around 10 minutes later I had another thought that was probably unoriginal but here goes: MD-ME! I realized that this was a ME medicine. This was a way to feel the self that we forget and repress to get along with our parents, society, crappy friends, culture, etc. Trauma takes us away from being a real ME but Molly gently but firmly removes those barriers.


It's hard to quantify what happened in the next few hours on the floor but I felt like I gave birth to a more full and realized self. The self that couldn't fully incarnate into the world due to a terrible upbringing and subsequent clinging to that dysfunction. I remembered ME. The parts of me that I feel are inconvenient to others, the parts of me I killed or maimed to get along with my abusive parents and Christian school, and the child who never got to feel truly happy.

I also had the profound experience of really, truly realizing that I can say NO to people. This may sound silly or simple, but for someone like me this realization helped to topple some of the false edifices of my personality. I don't always have to be agreeable or a helper. I don't have to be a good little boy. I was not put here to save other people. I knew this intellectually, but in these few hours these sorts of realization sprang up from a neglected part of my larger self.

During this experience I fell in love with myself again. Not in a narcissistic way, but in a way that means I don't have so much of an inner dictator censoring me anymore and there is love and spontaneity circulating through my being like invisible blood. That dictator (picture him as a 5 year old combo of Hitler and Stalin) really just needed to feel deep, true joy.

Despite some of the trip reports I'd read, I felt no need to get in touch with other people while on the Molly or even dance. I was content to lie on the floor and stare up at the ceiling in wonder, much like an infant would. The music I had carefully chosen beforehand felt like part of my birthing process. The music energized and infused the new green shoots of my freedom.

This happened a few weeks ago and I've had struggles since then, including a second Molly/Lucy combo that was very difficult but ultimately another victorious piece of this rebuilding I'm doing. I'll post that one a bit later. Everything is not perfectly better as it felt in this experience but now in subsequent weeks I am so much more willing to be myself in every situation. I find myself inhabiting my body differently and being more aware of when I shrink back and my inner child dictator tries to take over. The universe has also given me several opportunities to say big NO's to people and groups of people and I have done that with so much more courage than before.

I'll end this with a quote from Aldous Huxley as I think it sums up what entheogens like this can do for the world and I hope that all of you who roll, will, each time, remember and collect some forgotten part of yourself. The world needs that, and maybe we can avoid the next great cataclysm if we consciously use these chemicals. “The arhat and the quietist may not practice contemplation in its fullness; but if they practice it at all, they may bring back enlightening reports of another, a transcendent country of the mind; and if they practice it in the height, they will become conduits through which some beneficent influence can flow out of that other country into a world of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack of it. “

4gppou,0,2016-04-27,Intern Salary to Full Time Salary,Leather_Sofa,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4gppou/intern_salary_to_full_time_salary/,"I have recently accepted an internship offer at one of the big four for IT audit. I know a few people in different LOS that have interned at the same firm and accepted full time as well. My one buddy interned in audit and his full time offer was essentially his hourly rate times 40 times 52; I hear this is the most common intern to full time salary conversion at the big four. However, another friend of mine who was in IT advisory told me his full time offer was was about 10% more than his internship salary (using the previous formula). My question is since IT audit is under IT advisory at my firm, would my full time salary conversion be closer to audit or advisory. The main reason why I am unsure is because IT audit doesn't really feel like advisory but closer to audit."

Newly-elected President Dwight Eisenhower has called upon Mexican leader Adolfo Ruiz Cortines to reunite with him at the White House. 

Amongst other things, the two men will discuss immigration issues, the possibility for more economic cooperation, and certain issues with illegal fishing in coastal areas. 

The general situation of Latin America will be discussed as well. Putting special emphasis on Cuba, Guatemala and Bolivia and the instability that could potentially spread elsewhere. 

President Eisenhower's move is welcomed by the American public after several cold decades of relationship between Cortines and Truman. 

***On Cuba:*** 

To demonstrate our government's willingness to avoid conflict, U.S. Ambassador Earl Smith will request to reunite with Raul Castro at brevity. 

Although many have criticized the move as demonstrating weakness towards Communism, President Eisenhower is retinent to become involved in a conflict with a nation so close to American waters, especially as the Communist threat in Asia grows, and would prefer to cooperate with Raul Castro's government as allies. 

[S] President Dwight Eisenhower, following the advice of his generals, has also approved the moving of 2500 U.S. Marines to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to participate in coordinated war games with the 1500 U.S. Soldiers appointed to the area. 

He hopes that this show of force will nudge Castro to the negotiation table. [/S] 

***On Guatemala*** 

President Eisenhower has ordered for the continued support of Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas. Another openly-Socialist country cannot be allowed to stand in Latin America. 

CIA Operatives around the world will begin contacting possible recruits for a mercenary force to join Castillo's remaining troops. These men will have to count with previous military or paramilitary experience but outside of this no requirements shall be met. 

The recruits will be moved to the Salvadoran coast from which they will intern themselves in the jungle to meet with Castillo, and another coup attempt will be made once these men number 1000. 

$5 Million will be made available to Castillo, as well, for the bribing of local officials and the recruitment of Salvadoran irregulars to participate in the coup. 

The men will also be provided with 120 M18 Claymore Anti-Personnel Mines, as this recently-developed model has not been battle tested and our engineers are curious of their use in the modern battlefield. 

***On Peru:***

President Manuel Prado Ugarteche is a firm ally of the United States, and President Eisenhower wants to continue to maintain this friendship. Which is why Congress has approved the granting of $30 million in development aid to Peru so that his country might continue growing stronger and stability can be maintained. 

[S] President Truman will also request permission from the Peruvian government to base aircraft in the country, and especially in and around the city of Puno. It will be heavily implied that this is strictly for Peru's sake as the CIA has uncovered plans for Bolivian rebels to cross the border and use Peru as a base of operations to retake power. 

Our government will also request Ugarteche's open support for Bolivia's new government. 

***On Paraguay:*** 

It is to noone a secret that Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner is a firm ally of the United States. It is also no secret that he has requested American aid several times in maintaining the economy of the small South American country growing. 

These request will finally be answered with the lending of $20 million at a low interest rate, and the granting of another $10 million to Paraguay for development. 

[S] President Truman will also offer Strossner's the CIA's support in routing out political enemies so that he might continue to retain power in the country unopposed. In exchange he will grant the United States complete support in our operations by allowing the unimpeded entry and exit of American ships and aircraft into and out of Paraguay. Stroessner will also publicly express his support for the new Bolivian government. 

***On Bolivia:*** 

Our government will support Bolivia's new government in its aim to maintain the stability of the country, and of the entire region, and for the future return of democracy to the nation. 

As such, our government will be lending a number of surplus weaponry to the Bolivians: 

* 5 B-17 Flying Fortress Aircraft

* 65 M115 Towed Howitzers

* 350 60mm M2 Light Mortars

* 1500 M35 Medium-Class Military Trucks

* 7500 M2 carbines"

I have a relative plan for both projects but am no where near a public build I can post on github. I am currently serving, after dropping out of the engineering program at my local college due to my 2.01 GPA. I have no certifications or provable relative experience because I have been serving since I was 19 [23M] and have never worked and internship. On the other hand I do have some project based experience with networking systems. Due to my frustration with the AT&amp;T standard router, I made a linux based router with a lighter server os and better slightly used parts, and its still holding strong with 25mb/s down and 5mb/s up, not great but it was something I am proud of cause I stuck to it even with the software set up issues. Hardware, I have been building my own computers with the acceptation of my most recent laptop, since I was 15 with the most complex system is a 80TB NAS server for my friends home, for backups to their devices and for storing torrent downloads. With a few days of work and hours of googling I managed to have all hard drives connected and running. Is there any internship/job shadowing opprotunities you think I am capable of applying for (even unpaid) in the Houston or Texas area? Or if not is there any career plan or resource you can suggest that can get me ready in &lt;6 months? Ideally before the fall semester starts. I am particularlly interested in becoming a full stack python developer for apps/ websites/ web apps or a job in data science. Is there any career plan you can suggest I follow without the need for a college education that I can put on a resume (projects are fine, I know wording will matter on a resume)? And is there a way I can get an internship or any insight to what these jobs actually entail? Thank you in advance!"

I haven't completed any pre-reqs but because of the math classes I've taken, my sGPA is a 3.6 and my cGPA is a 3.85.  I was originally planning on applying to law school but after talking to my mom (who's a lawyer), reading about working as a corporate lawyer, a few internships, and reading a few books about the law-school-aba-industrial complex, I've decided against applying to law school.  That said, I really don't want to get into a debate about law school v. medical school.  

I know a fair amount of doctors (most of whom like their jobs) and it seems like a good career choice.  Furthermore, my parents are friends with an anesthesiologist who offered me the opportunity to shadow her.  

Here's my plan so far: 

This summer: PHYS I/II (I already have AP credit for physics and was on the physics team in my high school, so I'm pretty confident about this subject).

Fall: Chem I/Bio I/Misc. math/computer sci (Not confident about chem at all)

Spring: Chem II/Bio II, upper division physics, math

Summer: Volunteer/shadow (and mixed throughout two years obviously)

Fall: Orgo I, math, xxx, xxx

Spring: Orgo II, biochem, xxx, xxx

How does this plan sound?"
4gptqo,6,2016-04-27,Candyflipping to Save My Soul (x-post from r/mdma),110mcg,LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/4gptqo/candyflipping_to_save_my_soul_xpost_from_rmdma/,"My first LSD experience (https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/4de1lw/ego_death_on_100110mcg_my_first_trip/) was harrowing and ego-shattering but I knew I had to go back and see what else it had for me. Eight days later I took a little less LSD than I had my first time (when I had a tripping partner)—80-100mcg. This time I was alone but I also had a 210mg strawberry Molly tablet on hand. I hadn't decided whether or not I would take any Molly as it would be my first time and I wasn't sure I wanted to combine the two. I get a little antsy with this stuff. Maybe it's just where I am in life right now but I can't imagine doing it for “fun”. I left the option open though, as I wanted to let my higher Self guide the experience.

I have been in a deep process of difficult personal evolution the past few years , much of it arising out my facing trauma from my childhood. I went to significant trouble to do Ayahuasca two times and now acquire these Inquisition'd medicines because I was tired of all my unnecessary suffering, self-limitation, and ultimately not feeling like a totally real person with agency in the world. If you've had PTSD symptoms then you likely know what I'm talking about. I'm very functional--I work, I go to grad school, and I have a counseling internship but there remained a deep uneasiness in most personal interactions and even small everyday decisions. I knew I needed to go deeper and unlock my imprisoned self, especially if I'm going to be trying to help other people.

Anyway, I took the Acid and the come-up was very slow and gentle, unlike my first time where I got sucked into oblivion pretty quickly. Thank god for the tolerance I likely had from my first trip.

I began to feel fairly strong effects right around the 2 hour mark and then a memory bubbled up. It was a dream I had four years ago. In the dream I was lying on my Jungian analyst's couch and she was scratching my back. She said, “110mcg, what can you do to make yourself feel extraordinarily better?” I gave no answer in the dream and I never felt like I really answered the question in the subsequent years. The dream faded into the background even though I should have paid more attention to it.

Coming up on the Lucy with the pleasant sensations coursing through my body I realized that this was it. This was the answer to my dream. I crawled over to where I had the Molly at my “altar” with several candles burning. I cut the little strawberry tablet in half with my pocket knife. It now looked like a bifurcated heart and in that moment, the room, the chemicals, my mind, felt incredibly sacred, like I was taking a sacrament. LSD was the body and MDMA was the blood. I chewed up the slightly-larger-than-half tablet and embraced the bitter taste as an important part of the experience.

I lay back down on my blanket on the floor and put some music through my over the ear headphones which, by the way, are amazing for really experiencing music in times like this. About 30 minutes later I felt the first stirrings and, oddly, I thought about how this chemical had been stumbled upon all the way back in 1912, just a few years before millions of young men slaughtered each other in the trenches of WWI. I wondered if maybe those same people would have been less apt to slaughter each other if they had had access to this experience? I thought of what we might be holding back now that could prevent untold suffering in the future.

Around 10 minutes later I had another thought that was probably unoriginal but here goes: MD-ME! I realized that this was a ME medicine. This was a way to feel the self that we forget and repress to get along with our parents, society, crappy friends, culture, etc. Trauma takes us away from being a real ME but Molly gently but firmly removes those barriers.

It's hard to quantify what happened in the next few hours on the floor but I felt like I gave birth to a more full and realized self. The self that couldn't fully incarnate into the world due to a terrible upbringing and subsequent clinging to that dysfunction. I remembered ME. The parts of me that I feel are inconvenient to others, the parts of me I killed or maimed to get along with my abusive parents and Christian school, and the child who never got to feel truly happy.

I also had the profound experience of really, truly realizing that I can say NO to people. This may sound silly or simple, but for someone like me this realization helped to topple some of the false edifices of my personality. I don't always have to be agreeable or a helper. I don't have to be a good little boy. I was not put here to save other people. I knew this intellectually, but in these few hours these sorts of realization sprang up from a neglected part of my larger self.

During this experience I fell in love with myself again. Not in a narcissistic way, but in a way that means I don't have so much of an inner dictator censoring me anymore and there is love and spontaneity circulating through my being like invisible blood. That dictator (picture him as a 5 year old combo of Hitler and Stalin) really just needed to feel deep, true joy.

Despite some of the trip reports I'd read, I felt no need to get in touch with other people while on the Molly or even dance. I was content to lie on the floor and stare up at the ceiling in wonder, much like an infant would. The music I had carefully chosen beforehand felt like part of my birthing process. The music energized and infused the new green shoots of my freedom.

This happened a few weeks ago and I've had struggles since then, including a second Molly/Lucy combo that was very difficult but ultimately another victorious piece of this rebuilding I'm doing. I'll post that one a bit later. Everything is not perfectly better as it felt in this experience but now in subsequent weeks I am so much more willing to be myself in every situation. I find myself inhabiting my body differently and being more aware of when I shrink back and my inner child dictator tries to take over. The universe has also given me several opportunities to say big NO's to people and groups of people and I have done that with so much more courage than before.

I'll end this with a quote from Aldous Huxley as I think it sums up what entheogens like this can do for the world and I hope that all of you who roll, will, each time, remember and collect some forgotten part of yourself. The world needs that, and maybe we can avoid the next great cataclysm if we consciously use these chemicals. “The arhat and the quietist may not practice contemplation in its fullness; but if they practice it at all, they may bring back enlightening reports of another, a transcendent country of the mind; and if they practice it in the height, they will become conduits through which some beneficent influence can flow out of that other country into a world of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack of it. “

4gpwgx,5,2016-04-27,Graduate with Honors or with a stacked portfolio?,afropuffdaddy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4gpwgx/graduate_with_honors_or_with_a_stacked_portfolio/,"Hello everyone,

I am at the end of my junior year in college with a CS major and math minor. I'm looking at my resume and applying for some internships for this summer, but am beginning to think about my plans for senior year and how to make myself look the best for a potential employer after college.

I go to a state university with an alright computer science department. My GPA is at a 3.43 right now. Some of the teachers aren't so great, but they do teach us and I feel that when I graduate I will be pretty well prepared to work. I have been a member of the honors program at my school since I entered as a freshman, and honestly it hasn't really required much out of me other than keeping a solid GPA and taking some Honors level classes. It's senior year when the honors program has it's members begin writing their thesis in order to graduate with honors. 

The question I have is this: is it worth my time to complete the thesis and graduate with honors, or would I be better served to drop the honors program and work on projects/apps to fill my portfolio? I understand that the thesis consists of mainly a lengthy paper with tons of research, as well as a ""coding journal"" to support it(almost like sources in a History paper or something). I feel like I will be spending a year doing tedious research and writing on a topic that may or may not have nothing to do with the field that I actually end up working in after college.

I want to know what really matters to an employer. If they see that you graduated with honors will they put your resume above the rest, or would they prefer to see a portfolio with loads of great work?

To me, that time seems better served with me working hard to learn more programming languages, work on large out-of-class projects(besides in class projects I really have no portfolio of work to show employers), and trying to beef up my resume with more experience in certain fields of computer science(ex: I have done some programming with C++, but am by no means an expert and can use this time to learn and apply new skills in C++). 

Also, I would attempt to do both but I know my limitations and think that senior year I will be occupied by this thesis if I go through with it and won't be able to bring myself to devote lots of time to learning new CS skills. 

A friend of mine raised the point that graduating with honors will make me stick out in a stack of applications, but I think it won't matter if I only have rudimentary or ""in class CS skills"".

TL:DR : Should I spend my senior year writing an honors thesis to graduate with honors or put my time into side projects and learning CS skills to beef up resume?"

I currently intern at a corporate company as a software intern. I took this opportunity in August 2015 and the plan was for me to shadow an existing employee. 2 weeks in, he resigned and I quickly picked up the pace to learn his responsibilities and workload.

In November, my boss wanted to hire another intern to cover the days I'm not in the office since I'm still finishing school. We hired someone in January but my coworker just put in his 2 weeks because he got offered an internship at Microsoft.

My boss was thinking of hiring another intern, but since I think I'm pretty qualified for this job and am interested in working here, I expressed my interest to my boss but he had to check with HR to see if I could get approved for more hours. Currently, interns cannot exceed 20 hours/week.

I met up with my boss last week and gave him some numbers about how the company would save money approving me of 30 hours a week this summer and in the fall. It would cost nearly another 10k to hire someone new than to just approve me of 30 hours which is around 4k more.

Although my boss is very willing to go this route, our plan was shot down because of HR/corporate reasons and how they must stick to the budget of 20 hours a week and not allowing interns to work more than 1000 hours a year (roughly 20 hours a week 1000 hours/ 52 weeks).

So here I am now, asking for some advice. I have 100% availability this summer and I can put in 30 hours next fall. Next spring I'll have 1 class so I'll be even more available... then come May, I graduate.

The way I see it, I have two options.

1. Stay at the current company until graduation and apply to entry level places along the way until graduation. Take a job with my current company if they offer or work somewhere else by then.

 **Pros:** I'll get a lot of experience and can say I've had 1.5 years of experience at one place on my resume.
 
 **Cons:** I'm limited to the hours and want to work more. I want to learn more and earn more. I'm pretty much limited to a take home pay of $1000 a month.

2. Apply for other opportunities now.

 **Pros:** I might find some place better with higher pay.

 **Cons:** I risk losing my current position and not getting any pay.

I am a transfer student who is attending UCLA this fall, but I plan on spending 3 years on my degree because I skipped a year of college at my community college (long story). Is it possible for me to get accepted into a good program without a lot of work experience?

* I really like math so I was planning on pursuing some kind of research during the next couple years, but should I be focusing on getting some kind of business experience so that I am a more competitive candidate when I apply? 

* Is there a chance I get accepted into a good program directly after undergraduate?

* Should I pursue an eMBA or an MBA if my goal is to get into management?

As in horribly chaotic. I'm talking about lectures and stuff, not about things I can actually change. I'm seeking advice on how to plan my regular studying/homework/etc. around that.
I work relatively well on a consistent schedule, but that's not what I'm getting (or will be getting somewhere in the foreseeable future).

Please let me know if you're reacting without reading the long story below ;)

---
The long story. 
So, what does a chaotic schedule mean? Let me pick out two weeks which are fairly representative of how my schedule usually is.

*Week 1*

* Monday: 7:00h - 16:00h internship (compulsory for college just like all other times I mention internship), starting at 7 means getting up at 5:30. Then I'm in a course from 19.30-21:00 (not for college, but I love to do it and won't get money back if I quit), I'm trying to be home before 22:00.
* Tuesday: 7:00h - 16:00h internship. There is this lecture from 16:00-18:00, but I'm not going there because I can't make it (and don't think it's so important I should discuss this at my internship). Then in the evening I'm in another course, we usually start at 18:30h and end somewhere between 23:30 and 01:00.
* Wednesday: lecture at the other location of my college (about 1 to 1 1/2h travel), from 18:00 to 21:00h.
* Thursday: lectures from 8:30 to 18:00 with two 15-min breaks.
* Friday: lectures from 8:30 to 11:45 with a 15 min break. Also, I want to join in an extra program next year (because I think my subjects are too easy), for that I have this day from 10:00 to after dinner - no exact time stated. The location for this day is not yet known, so I have no clue about the commuting time. In the evening there is this reunion with my secondary school class mates, I'm not sure whether I'll be going there though.
* Saturday: internship 07:00-13:00.
* Sunday: internship 07:00-13:00 (also, I don't mind doing stuff on Sundays).
(To be clear: I need to do 3 shifts on average every week, these weekend shifts are half shifts, so I'm doing 2 of those.)

*Week 2*

* Monday: 7:00h - 16:00h internship. Then the course from 19.30-21:00, I'm trying to be home before 22:00.
* Tuesday: 7:00h - 16:00h internship, getting up at 5:30 again. There is this lecture from 16:00-18:00, but I'm not going there because I can't make it (and don't think it's so important I should discuss this at my internship). Then in the evening the second course, we usually start at 18:30h and end somewhere between 23:30 and 01:00.
* Wednesday: internship from 17:15 to 22:45.
* Thursday: lectures from 11:45 to 16:30.
* Friday: internship from 7:00 to 16:00 and a lecture from 11:45 to 13:15 which I'll make up for at home (it's not hard). Friday evening I'll leave for a weekend with my boyfriend, we'll come back home Sunday evening.



This is my schedule of planned things, not of study sessions (which I haven't planned for these weeks yet, because it's not that close yet). Going away for the weekend might not sound representative, but in the coming 10 weeks, I'm either away for the weekend or busy with something in my home town (basically ""away"" in terms of chances of doing stuff, but sleeping at home) for 7 weekends. The weekend of the first week with my internship shifts is one of the 3 weekends I counted as ""being at home"".

For everything I'll need about half an hour of commuting time (either because it actually takes that long or because it takes 5-10 minutes less but I really have to be there in time), except for when I stated otherwise. Keep in mind that if I have lectures and a course, these are on different locations (and I usually go home in between, for food and changing of stuff/transport). Apart from that I need to do my own shopping (there is not such a thing as a meal plan here) which I cannot ask housemates (I live alone). I need to cook my own meals (buying them is horribly expensive and horribly unhealthy here), and I need to clean my own house.

Apart from all that I  try to fit in 2 runs every week, those take me an hour (including changing, the running itself, the post-run shower and changing back into normal clothes). I try to do these around 21:00 when I don't have my internship the next day, or an hour earlier if I have, because I can't concentrate after that.

Also, I will start working again in a couple of weeks (including the weeks described above), because I only work in the summer season (the pool is closed in winter). I can choose my own shifts (time and how often) and I am allowed to study on the job - usually it's 80% studying and 20% work.

For studying I need:
* About 1h/week for the Monday course;
* About 1h/week for the Tuesday course;
* About 2 hours of extra sleep per shift for the internship (because of personal circumstances);
* About 10-15 hours of studying for the various subjects;
* About 5 hours to work on assignments (these don't belong to a specific subject) - I do these with groups and all those people have different internship schedules, so planning meetings is a bit of a hassle. We meet about half an hour to an hour every 2 weeks, but it may be less or more, depending on what we need;
* About 2 hours to work on a big assignment (also not belonging to a specific subject) - this I do with 1 other student, but we still have different internship schedules. We need to sit together at least half the time, usually a little more.

Also, I'm not perfect. I do procrastinate, I do sometimes just fall asleep instead of studying, I do sometimes take waaaaay to much time for certain assignments, I write terribly long reddit posts and sometimes I just don't want to study.  Also, I work relatively well in a consistent schedule, which is not *really* the case in my life. I hope I don't need to add that I cannot change my lecture times (dropping subjects wouldn't help even if it were possible, because the subjects are not scheduled regularly) and/or my internship shifts. I don't really have a sleep schedule because of the crazy shifts and since lunch time at my internship and during lectures is ""when you're hungry and you've got 2-3 minutes to spare"", I also don't really have certain meal times.

Dear stranger, thank you for making it trough. You're awesome!

Any ideas on how to manage this? I sometimes feel like someone just picked up a perfectly fine schedule, threw it in a blender, then put it in a hydraulic press and then send it to me....

Still have a couple of interviews left with startups but I'm looking for something long term. 
If you ask me what I want long term, I don't know. I'm a decent programmer but consulting management also seems like an interesting career.

4gqzze,10,2016-04-27,"[Meta] Work discussion Wednesdays? Weekly sticky where we can discuss topics involving legal employment (e.g., job prospects, interviewing, practice areas, internships, public sector work, firms, non-profits, in house)?",noogan,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/4gqzze/meta_work_discussion_wednesdays_weekly_sticky/,"Hi all, 

Hopefully this hasn't already been brought up and discussed. I'd like to suggest another weekly topic thread (similar to 0L Tuesdays, where mods can create a new stickied post once a week) where we can discuss topics related to legal employment. 

Perhaps this category is a bit too broad - maybe it would be better if we narrowed the topic down to only allow specific questions/issues (such as evaluating your job prospects, interviewing skills/tips, deciding b/t different practice areas, 1L summer internships, getting into public sector work, deciding between firms, figuring out what a certain non-profit is looking for in a candidate, how &amp; when to in-house), such as not allowing for comment threads on the macro-scale legal employment topics. It's not that I don't love reading about the macro issues, but it would be nice to have a singular topic thread where people can ask their questions or share their wisdom all in the same thread.  

I think this would be helpful for a few reasons. 

1. For folks that have questions they'd like to ask: 
 * More people may look at it than if the question is asked in a standalone post, since threads can fall off the front page, whereas individual questions can all be lumped together in one spot and cycle once a week. The net result? Higher likelihood of being answered and a higher likelihood of better quality, substantive answers. 
 * Similar questions (or perhaps even ones that it didn't occur to ask) can be lumped into the same thread, allowing questioners to piggyback off one another if they see a lot of good advice being doled out on a similar question. 
 * It's easier to see if your question has already been answered by looking at a single week-old thread than pouring through a week's worth self posts. 
 * You have a question, but you don't want to take the time to make a new self post for it, then you may not take the trouble to get it answered. This will help you get those questions asked with minimal hassle. 
 
2. For the users that simply want to lurk and see what's being discussed: 
 * If you're like me, you want your lurking to be as efficient as possible and don't want to have to cycle back through pages and open up each post to see what the comments are. This way, you can see all the questions and comments for the past week (or hopefully the majority of them) and you'll only have to click one button.
 * Having a sticky post for employment questions can cut down on the number of similar posts, leaving more room for different types of content. If you want to read employment related posts, you'll have a place to easily find the latest discussions. If you don't want to look at employment issues, the number of self posts you'll scroll past will be fewer.

3. For those that want to share your wisdom and experience:
 * Ok, you're a 3L now - you're older, wiser, more jaded. You have a lot of good advice to share, but you can't be bothered to spend time ignoring your finals prep by going through every 1L and 0L post to see if you can help out. That's just not a good use of the time your spending not studying. You can't be bothered to give THAT much of a fuck when HBO shows just started their new seasons. Now you can have a thread you can quickly peruse before getting back to maximizing your procrastination. 

Quite frankly, I think it'd be nice if we had a couple more of these sorts of topic threads that cover a lot of the similar topics that come up - like employment, grades/stress, C&amp;F, black letter law &amp; major case questions.


Maybe I'm completely off base for even suggesting this, but I hope this is something other folks are interested in at least discussing."
4gr1z5,2,2016-04-27,Too tired from your own ambition?,jung-money,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4gr1z5/too_tired_from_your_own_ambition/,"This is a DAE post, I guess.

Does anyone else have a lot of creative ambition? Yet, in the process of realizing your goals, you find yourself exhausted, confused about if this is what you really want?

I'm not sure if this is necessarily an INFP issue, but I felt like what I'm about to say might resonate with others. 

Right now, I'm in the meat of my studies. I'm in my early twenties, and I'm an English major with an emphasis on Creative Writing. I've been looking into internships and considering career options since I'm not completely decided on what I want to do. Instead, there are a number of things I'd like to do.

1) Teach English overseas. The way I see it, not only am I providing a service to others, I'm also allowing myself to learn about new cultures. I get to travel and expand myself as a human being. The ""con"" to this is that I may not be able to creatively express myself as much as I want to.

2) Be a journalist/write for a popular publication. With this, I'd love to write for anything related to pop-culture. Music. Television. Movies. Etc. I digest media on a daily basis, so it would only make sense to use my appreciation for it and ability to write in my favor. The only ""con"" I see is being worn from deadlines and possibly the work environment.

3) Write for television/film. This is probably a dream job. I'm not sure how exactly I'd get my foot in the door in this field, but it's something I can imagine myself doing. Out of everything mentioned so far, it would allow me to be the most creative. I guess the major ""con"" I see is being able to get to this point.

Does anyone else have similar issues? I truly feel that I do have some level of potential. However, I conflict with myself. Part of me tells me to be selfless and live a life dedicated to serving others. The other part says to creatively express myself to the fullest and to pursue an adventurous lifestyle.

tldr; There's so many things I want to do, but so much drive. How do I gather the energy to focus on one objective? Is it limiting to do so?"
4gr5a4,1,2016-04-27,"As a soon-to-be grad with no full-time offers, should I consider an internship offer for the summer?",nuck_futs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4gr5a4/as_a_soontobe_grad_with_no_fulltime_offers_should/,"So, unfortunately I wasn't able to have a job lined up before graduation. That's a another story for another day. I had an internship with a small startup doing Android development last Fall, and I've gotten an offer from them to work this summer for likely an internship-like (hourly) wage. It will be a Mon-Fri, 40 hours/week job.

I'm going to be living in my current city until my lease runs out at the end of July. I'm mostly going to be looking at other cities for jobs, of which only one will be within reasonable driving distance if I were to get an offer from there before I can move. This means there is a chance I won't be able to work until post-July anyway.

Here is the dilemma: I'm concerned if I take the job, it will get in the way of finding a full-time job. However, if I don't take it, I'm worried I'll be missing out on an opportunity to get more experience and make myself more marketable. By the way, the internship mentioned above is my only job experience right now.

**tl,dr:** Should I take an internship for the summer for experience/money, or turn it down in favor of focusing my efforts toward finding a full-time job?

Edit: A couple of extra details: No chance at this becoming a full-time job. The startup in question is tiny and not stable enough to hire anyone long-term. Also, I don't want to quit mid-summer. If I'm going to commit to it, I'm going to commit to the entire summer.

Basically, I am stuck choosing between Pepperdine, ASU and Hofstra (mostly down to the former two). 

ASU's program seems strong, but the college is huge, and to be totally honest I want to spend the next four years in Malibu if attending either school will allow me to be successful in the field (I am confident that I will work hard and excel in college).

So, will a B.S. in Pepperdine's ""Computer Science and Mathematics"" program make it tough for me to succeed in comp sci, or will either school suffice (after all, Pepperdine is in a good are for internships, there is always the option to transfer to somewhere like USC, I know kids have gotten hired by by Google and Twitter after completing the program, and I could always attend graduate school and get a master's)?

TL;DR: I want to do CompSci. Prefer Pepperdine over ASU but have heard the program there is limited. Not really sure what that actually means, have reason to believe both schools would allow to me succeed but would like more advice. Thanks for any input. "
4gri8h,1,2016-04-27,Admin Assistant Who Wants to Move On,salad_day,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4gri8h/admin_assistant_who_wants_to_move_on/,"I’m currently an administrative assistant looking to move on, but I need ideas for possible future jobs/career paths. I've got a few scattershot interests and some experience, which are all below. I know this is long, but I want you to have all the needed information. Maybe someone here can make something out of it. Apologies in advance for the length. (For the record, I’ve read What Color is Your Parachute but it hasn’t really helped me. I’m also in therapy.)

So, several things about me:

-I’m in my late twenties, with a BA in English from a small, prestigious liberal arts college. I graduated with an okay GPA (3.3). I always had weak math skills, and was much better at writing/reading. I sometimes feel this disparity kind of boxed me in in my early years in that teachers, etc. didn’t bother to foster any sort of interest in math/science because I never showed any proficiency in it. 

-I also have Asperger’s. My social skills do need work, but they’re not nonexistent. Sometimes I have trouble controlling my emotions, and I’ve had a few social fuckups at work which are unlikely to recur (more on that below), but aside from that I’m managing okay. I do have some concentration issues, but they come and go. I definitely have trouble reading people/situations and making eye contact, though I try my best. Interviewing has been a struggle at times, but most of the feedback I’ve gotten in the past has been good. There have been times, though-- particularly at work-- where sometimes it will take me a while to form an answer, or I’ll be caught staring off into space, or whatever, and people will subsequently think I’m less bright than I actually am. At least, I think I give off that impression. I’m not extremely exceptional in the way some people on the spectrum are, but I am intelligent, and I have a degree, and one of the things I want to do in life is prove that to people. 

-I’m currently an administrative assistant at a state agency that investigates complaints against judges. I’ve been here about five years. I do a lot of scanning, checking documents, some reception, and some correspondence. I don’t schedule events or make travel arrangements-- no one at my agency really travels, and honestly, our budget is small enough that we try to avoid it. Basically, my duties are more “administrative assistant” than “executive assistant.”

-There is no chance of me advancing or learning anything advanced at this job. None. Full stop, end of story. The people above me are pretty entrenched-- in order for me to get promoted they’d have to either retire or die. They’re also very possessive of their jobs-- whenever I’ve asked to see what they do so I can learn I’ve gotten rebuffed. They even say I’m “too eager.” I’ve mentioned this to my boss and he has been no help. The only other people in my office are attorneys, and I have no interest in going to law school.

-Over the past year or so, I’ve been doing some freelance writing on the side, mostly autobiographical essays with some book criticism every now and then. I haven’t gotten paid a lot, but I’ve gotten some exposure, and the position of writer is on my resume and LinkedIn. I have a WordPress that I originally intended to be a portfolio of sorts, but I’ve been bad at updating it. The biggest thing I’ve written has been an article I wrote on having Asperger’s-- it is the first thing that comes up when you Google my name, actually. I’ve kind of stopped writing for the moment, for several reasons, one of which being that I’m not sure how much I want/like it. I’d be open to writing again, just not at this point in time. 

-My work knows I have Asperger’s. I don’t want to get into it, but I disclosed it after there were a couple of incidents at work. They gave me my own office-- none of the other admins have one-- and decided that it would be best if I disclose it in a mass email. I thought it was a good idea at the time, and I wanted to keep my job so I went along with it.  I’m not sure if anyone else remembers it, given that it happened almost five years ago. But I still feel kind of embarrassed, and since the disclosure I have had various duties taken away from me. None of my current duties are what I was initially hired to do. I feel like I’m not really given a chance to prove myself, and I think some of my co-workers think I’m stupid. I’m kind of just the outcast in the office.

-Before this job, I was a customer service representative at an inbound call center. I was there for several months before I was laid off. I fielded calls and answered questions about a skincare product that you’ve heard of. I mostly enjoyed it, though it was my first real job out of college and I had no frame of reference. Later on I got frustrated by the lack of advancement opportunities and constantly having to talk to people, and at the time I was laid off, was starting to apply for admin assistant jobs, thinking they would be better. 

Interests/skills:
-I have a bunch of scattershot interests. A major one of late has been economics/finance. I didn’t take any econ courses in college or any math after pre-calc; anything related to finance or numbers was Greek to me and I never made any effort to prove to myself otherwise. I made the recent discovery, though, that I really enjoyed writing articles for this one money/budget related blog (about my own finance/money experiences, though-- nothing journalistic), and I also loved talking to people about what kind of credit card to get and credit scores. So, I decided to explore that further. I read an econ textbook recently and found it mildly interesting, and I’m an avid listener of Marketplace. I read Barbarians at the Gate recently and found it slightly confusing but really interesting, and it got me looking up various mergers on Wikipedia. I recently got a corporate finance textbook that I plan to read.

-I also plan to take an intro to corporate finance MOOC over the summer. The course is part of a business fundamentals series that I plan to get a certification for, and once I get it I’ll put it on my resume. I think this would not only convey an interest/knowledge of finance/business, but would also stand as proof that I could start and follow through with something. This would be out of pocket-- my work doesn’t have the money to pay for further education, and in my case they probably wouldn’t want to anyway.

-I’ve loosely been considering getting an MBA at some point, but I’m not sure what I’d want to do with it. I haven’t taken the GRE or GMAT. We are talking kind of pipe dream with this one-- it may not even happen.

-Other interests I have that might be salable: the city of Los Angeles, the American West/South/Texas (I’ve never been to any of those areas, but they fascinate me for some reason), entertainment industry news (I read Variety and Deadline for fun), television (I watch quite a bit of it), makeup/fashion, literature (not interested in publishing, but I do like to read). I like going down Wikipedia rabbit holes and just going wherever the wind takes me.

-I’m also bizarrely interested in American Express and have been since childhood. I even wrote an overly enthusiastic essay about it about it that some said sounded like an ad. I’m a cardholder, and when giving my opinion on CCs I recommend them whenever I can. Yes, this is an extremely bizarre interest. Yes, I’ve applied for jobs there (admin jobs, since that’s the only thing I’m qualified for right now). No, nothing has panned out.

-For other skills: I do have a really good attention to detail. I love analyzing things-- I had a lot of experience analyzing literature in college, but since then I’ve been fascinated with figuring out the whys and hows of something. I’m also persistent, and can be a really quick learner if I’m interested in the subject matter. I can type about 60 wpm. I’m really good at Internet research. I know some French and Italian, but I’m much better at reading/writing than I am at speaking. I plan to learn Spanish at some point but I don’t know when. I know my way around Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat, but not much else, though, again, I’m a quick learner. 

What I’m looking for in a job:
-I’m in NYC and I’d like to stay there for now. I want to move to LA sometime in the future--I love it there--but I don’t have a set date or anything like that. 

-I’d like to move out of the public/non-profit sector. If there’s a position that’s really, really, really good I might be able to make an exception, but generally I want out. 

-I’m an introvert, so while I have customer service/reception experience, I’m not overly big on non-stop interaction with people. That said, I’d seriously consider returning to a customer service role if the pay was right and there were definite advancement opportunities.

-I’d like to be somewhere where I can advance in my career, or at least learn something. It’s a huge issue at my current position, and I feel like if I had at least the opportunity to advance here I might not be so frustrated. I want to be promoted, and maybe even have my own assistant one day. Business cards wouldn’t be so bad either. I guess I’m trying to say that I want to feel valued.

-This may sound weird, but I really envy my friends who have to travel for work. I’ll be lucky if I ever make it up to Albany during my time here. I actually like traveling-- I don’t even mind dealing with the minutiae, like schedules. I wouldn’t say no to a job that required travel.

-The ability to work from home would be nice, too, but it’s not required or anything. It’s something I’d only do if I had to, and I wouldn’t make a habit of it. 

-I’m not currently in a position where I can take something super low-paying. I also need something with health insurance-- I had skull base/brain surgery last month, and while I’m back at work, I’m not technically fully healed and won’t be for the next several months. I have periodic doctor’s appointments scheduled for at least that long. Needless to say, quitting and taking an unpaid internship someplace is not an option. Neither is moving back home.

-I guess above all else, what I want is a job that won’t treat me as a less-than or attack me because of my Asperger’s, if such a thing even exists. I’m not valued at my current job and because of that I often feel like I have nothing to offer anyone, anywhere. I want to believe that this isn’t true. I want to know that there are workplaces out there that won’t mind my quirkiness and jobs that I can do well. I want to know how to find out if a potential workplace would be like that.

I’d appreciate literally any advice you all could give. Thank you so much in advance!

Long version:
Hello, I am 24 and about to graduate from a regular 4-year undergrad program in Computer Science, from a university in my city. I will preface right now by saying I run into a lot of issues in life by not planning ahead and doing things wayyy too late (Choosing post-secondary education, the right program, self-learning). I managed a 3~ GPA, pretty low because I bombed my first year courses (skipping too many classes!) but I turned it around in second year; by now I would not say programming is my ""passion"" but it is ""something I can do"".  I'm feeling pretty concerned because I feel I didn't actually develop any real skills in university; looking through a lot of job postings on the usual job sites, I honestly cannot imagine myself qualified for any of the positions, even with search emphasis on ""junior"" or ""entry level"" type postings. 

A few examples:

- Job postings usually include many languages that I honestly have no experience with. My only realistic experience is in C and Java; these were the only langauges that were used for any assignments, excluding ""introductory"" assignments for other languages such as Haskell or C++ which were really short. The introductory assignments were a joke; usually it was all filled in code and we just added a few variables or used one or two functions to demonstrate something. 

- The actual assignments we did in depth are not what I'd really call useful or applicable; I can't bring myself to put them to a portfolio even though I have nothing on there yet. Even ""term projects"" did not seem difficult or impressive now that I look back on it; the longest project I can recall was a very basic user chatroom for a networking course that was just two ""clients"" opening sockets to a ""host"" and exchanging messages. I had very few group projects, only one of which was a real group effort. The others either involved me doing all the work, or my minor contributions getting replaced by another guy doing everything himself instead.

- Regarding theory learning, I can't recall in particular any fancy algorithms or details about concepts that I suspect are really common knowledge-type in this field. I know what big-o notation is for but I'd have to read it again to use it in any meaningful way; same with things like trees or the many search algorithms. If I was given the topic I would probably recall doing it at some point but I'd really have to read up on it. I feel like when I was in grade school and studied XYZ topic for a test, only to forget it over the next 2 weeks after the test.


I feel like after 4ish years of post-secondary study I only learned to crunch away at a given problem, with a fair amount of googling related topics until I created a solution. What's worse (to me) is that I know a lot of material we learned is freely available online, if one has the patience to go through it.
I realize that I contributed to my own problems by not doing enough on my own initiative; I have no ""personal projects"" that I feel are worth putting on a portfolio. A week after I finished my last exam I tried to make a sort of easy image viewer to see what the top images on a subreddit are: It came out ""okay"" but is honestly what I think a person just learning Java could make: the GUI code (made with a GUI designer plugin) is longer than the actual back end stuff. I also know I didn't take time to learn or explore new languages. My biggest regret so far,  I didn't apply for a co-op program that could have given some internship experience although with hindsight I would have been disqualified from co-op because of low GPA in first year. 


Going forward from here, I'm planning to do some online research and self-teaching on languages that seem popular like python, ruby, or html/css (for front end), or perhaps one related to mobile developement (probably android because I don't have an iphone). I will obviously try to make some personal projects to put together a portfolio (Sidenote: Any suggestions for cool portfolio projects or relevant languages to learn would be welcome. ) However again I am thinking, if I have to do all this  self-teaching, what did I even learn in university? Even worse, is it even worth pursuing at this point or are these ""obvious"" signs that programming is not the future for me?


I am really looking for an answer to: How can I make my degree work for me after all this? Did I waste my time by not at least getting internship experience?

So I work as an intern at a company.  I am paid hourly, and thus I clock in and out into a computer scheduling system every day.  I don't want to give much more away about my company, so I will just say my hours are flexible.  I became suspicious of my fellow intern coworker clocking hours that he definitely did not work.  I ""not so accidentally"" checked his schedule and he logs in at home (anywhere from 7:00 am - 9:30 am) then commutes into work!  By the way, there is definitely no working going on, because he doesn't sign on to Lync or other forms to be reached.  So essentially, he's stealing money from my company, AND not putting in the work.  I want to bring this up somehow, but the way I found out also lacks much integrity.  My suspicions were proven correct, however.  What should I do?  I don't want to sound like a taddle tale, or have bad karma if you believe in it.

I recently transferred from an out of state college that I attended for a year and a half. I went simply for the experience, to grow as a person, and I was able to do that. I made plenty of mistakes, but through making mistakes I discovered a lot about who I am.

One of the biggest reasons why I left...to get away from my toxic family and friends. My parents, mother 52 and father 56, are very dysfunctional people. Before I left for college two years  ago, my parents were still married, barely holding on, fighting all the time, taking their anger out on me from time to time. I got good grades and never got in trouble at school or with the law, never had a boyfriend, or did anything outlandish. But it was never good enough. Still never is. My dad's standards are impossible. If I forget to do the dishes or clean my room one day he belittles it for it whenever he can, saying that it's a mark against my maturity. When I tell him that I want to pursue engineering he says that it's not worth the extra time it will take. But when I was an English major apparently that was a fucking waste of time and money. I live with him in our house. My parents are divorced now.

My mom, on the other hand, is very passive, and lets my dad walk all over her, even after the divorce. She'll talk down to me but pretend that everything is okay. When she's talking down to me I'm not allowed to get a single word in. She rents her own apartment, which she shared with my thirty-year-old brother, who now apparently moved in with his drug dealer last week. They had been living together a year.
My brother doesn't have a job, and hasn't for about five years now. I haven't spoken to my brother in about a year, and don't plan to. He's controlling and a pothead and I don't need that in my life. My mom complains to me about him whenever she can. And when I say complain, she'll go on a twenty minute rant and occassionally nod my head. Part of the reason why I was so fucking quiet and shy growing up was because my mom literally talked AT me my entire life, and still does, and when I try to speak she speaks over me as if I didn't say anything, or makes it seem like it's my fault for not wanting to be talked at for literally hours on end. I had HORRIBLE self esteem because of this until I left for college and actually realized that it's okay to contribute to a conversation.

I just hate that my family is so dysfunctional and controlling and none of them have the self-awareness to do something about it. I'm the youngest and have either been completely ignored or put down my entire life by each of them. And they don't even fucking care due to their narcissism. Whenever I try to address how they speak to me, my parents now, given that I no longer speak to my brother, they say that I'm being too sensitive. I hate this. I live with my dad but my mom comes over any chance she can, and sometimes they both yell at me, even though I have done nothing wrong. They literally ganged up on me a few weeks ago, demanding that I take an internship at an airport instead of working at my current job at a record store, even after I'd said no several times. They will never take no for an answer.

But of course they won't yell at my piece of shit brother, because even though he lives with a fucking drug dealer, he was perfect all of his life through sports and awards, and even though he's thirty and never showers, its still perfectly okay for them to coddle him and never yell at him because he has ""depression"".

My friends from high school suck. Most of them are  disgustingly ignorant, insecure, and shallow. I felt like an outsider with them in high school, and I only hang out with them now for the sake of not feeling so alone. We hang out every few months, moreso in the summer. 

I have tried to make new friends at my new college, and it's been going well in some regards, but it's difficult as a commuter, and I obviously haven't made any best friends yet.

I just feel really shitty right now. I hate how much pressure my  parents put on me and their overall dysfunction, and the fact that I can't even put a stop to it because suddenly it becomes my fault. 

I hate the fact that if I told my high school friends that I was raped my freshman year they'd probably ask too many invasive questions and insinuate that it was my fault, or fake sympathy, because that's just the kinds of sociopaths that they are.

I feel really alone right now and feel like I have no one, because almost everyone in my life right now has treated me like shit at one time or another."
4grxgf,5,2016-04-27,"After a long day, feel like a shell of a person",throw_away_posts,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4grxgf/after_a_long_day_feel_like_a_shell_of_a_person/,"I am writing this after a long day of classes. The semester is just about wrapped up except finals. I've done well and am on track to receive straights A's for the second semester in a row in a fairly demanding major. I even landed an internship position for this upcoming summer. But man, I feel so fucking empty. In January, my girlfriend of 2 years left me. She hasn't talked to me since except to tell me that she's happier without me. Clearly it's over and I'm not dealing with it well. I've been reading self-help books and began seeing a counselor because I didn't know how to deal with it. I have such strong feelings of regret and guilt. These feelings consume 95% of my thoughts during the day. I understand that this isn't helping anything, but it's the truth. The proper and logical viewpoint to take would be ""Okay, I fucked up. Humans make mistakes, and I'm no exception. This is an opportunity to recognize and address *my* faults as a person and boyfriend."" However, the regret, loneliness, and sadness continue to cripple me. I get out and do things, but like I said the thoughts are always there. By the time I get home, or even on the drive home, I feel like a shell of a person. Like now. I feel empty. I feel hopeless about any future relationship. I feel like a shitty human being. All I want is a hug and to cry on someone.

As I continue to see my counselor, it's becoming clear that before my relationship with my ex I was depressed. Since I was a teen, I remember having a strong sense that I needed a girlfriend in order to be happy. In high school I had a traumatic experience in which my parents forbid me from seeing my then-girlfriend of 2 years. They accused me of beating her (I didn't). They called me a woman-beater, took the doorknob off of my bedroom, took the TV out as well, and my dad smashed the guitar that my grandma got me as a birthday present. All of that happened overnight. I remember feeling so alone and sad with no one to really go to. My parents were the ones calling me inadequate, and this exacerbated things since they isolated me. I coped with this through pornography and masturbation. Those feelings festered while I impulsively and desperately went from girl to girl seeking approval and acceptance, until I ended up dating my most recent ex. 

I won't go into the details of the relationship, but like any it had it's problems. Neither of us were perfect, I get that. Still, the regret persists. I don't have much support. I have a twin who knows I'm in counseling, but he doesn't truly know the degree to which this is affecting me. My counselor is the only one I can genuinely open up to, and waiting for that 50 minutes once a week I tend to grow anxious and impatient. I'm growing apathetic towards life in general and I feel hopeless. The pornography and masturbation thing has never really went away, and I've recognized it as an escape as I turn to it almost daily. I should stop, but it's one of the only pleasures I ever get out of life anymore. Wow, that's depressing to admit. Anyway, I haven't told my counselor about this yet, but I feel like my brain chemistry is probably so screwed up by now because of this (I'm familiar with /r/nofap). Between that and my experience with my girlfriend in high school, I also feel like I'm screwed up psychologically. I feel so broken. I'll note that I'm in the process of switching counselors since the one at my university who I currently am seeing is only meant to be temporary. I hope to talk about these things more in-depth with the new one.

My current counselor has suggested medication on multiple occasions. I'm apprehensive about this, but these feelings feel so permanent and endless. I still feel devastated about losing my ex after four months, and I find it difficult to take pride in my accomplishments or have hope for the future. I don't have a plan or intend to commit suicide, but lately I've been wanting to be dead."
4gs1x2,1,2016-04-27,1 The thought of talking to a therapist about my feelings gives me anxiety,setaem,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4gs1x2/1_the_thought_of_talking_to_a_therapist_about_my/,"The title is barely relevant to the contents of this post.
I feel inadequate. Since it's nearing the end of the school year, they have awards, and top 100 GPAs ect, and I'm not qualified for any of that. It makes sense. I'm taking standard level freshman classes as a sophomore and I'm typing this when I should be studying. I don't play sports, instruments, band. I applied for an internship I know I won't get. I'm doing better than last year when I was getting straight B's. I doubt any decent college would accept me, especially considering the fact that I'm Asian. I'm typing this right now instead of studying. I jealous easily and I have a younger cousin who excels at everything.
I want to do something this summer but it's likely too late for any camps or things that require me to sign up for. I applied for a job and they contacted me, but when I tried setting up an interview date they haven't replied.
I only had one friend I felt like I wasn't lying through my teeth and faking a personality when I talked to, but she rarely talks to me anymore. We have similar personalities and neither of us will go out of the way to talk to others. Fuck her though. She had another best friend last year, but she stopped talking to her. Now it's happening to me and I feel like a shitty person. Pretty shitty that I can only make one friend in 3 years. None of my 'friends' are mine. I just sit with them and listen to them talk.
When I'm doing things that require athletic ability, I just hit it as hard or as quick as possible. Like how I use to always speed walk. I guess I've been doing things slower now. I've almost been hit a car 4 times when crossing the street. I don't do it on purpose. Sometimes I walk too slow. Other times I was impatient after waiting for 5 minutes and took my running chance.
I feel gross all the time. I don't like it when people sit on my bed, especially with their day clothes on. I don't either because I consider all the germs that have been picked up on my clothes throughout the day. I lightly expressed this feeling to someone once and she reacted by telling several people in the house about it in awe. I'm a sensitive btch, yet I don't care enough at the same time. If someone ignores me I'll linger on that for a while. If someone calls me a name I'll hand on to it for months.
I'm horrible at communicating. I don't live with my parents. I haven't talked to dads in weeks and the last time it was just a greeting. I facetime my mother sometimes but I quickly get annoyed with talking to her. She doesn't tell me much, like how my sister-in-law was pregnant. She had a kid today and I found out about it last month from my cousin. I haven't talked to her or my brother in months. I get text messages but I neglect to reply. I lived somewhere for 2 years and I don't talk to anyone from there anymore because I didn't make any friends. I lose my train of thought a lot when I talk to others. Sometimes I get nervous that I'm taking too much time and I race to say everything. I'm really forgetful with a lot of things. Like when you wake up and can only remember parts of your dream before they disappear. That's how I think. I always mindlessly lay stuff down and I then proceed to spend 10 minutes looking for the item.
I care too much about how others perceive me, yet I know no one gives a shit. I'm depressed. I haven't been diagnosed, but I know I am. I've told no one because I don't feel comfortable talking with them about it. Ironically enough, the thought of talking to a therapist about my feelings gives me anxiety. The thought that my parents would have to pay for expensive therapy and possibly medicine makes me anxious too. And they're the type of people to tell everyone about everything. Like my mom all my relatives when I got my first period. Everyone. My 'friends' talk a lot about anxiety and sexual orientation. They're mostly queer, which is ironic because I'm the minority when I'm with them. One of them call me neurotypical because I've never said anything about having mental illnesses. Fuck them. Not like they make any effort to talk to me though. I've stopped trying to talk to them. The only thing I've been able to do is type this out anonymously on reddit. I've never posted it before because I assume people will just suggest for me to get help. How you know it's hard, but I just tell someone, things will get better. How it's my fault I'm keeping this all locked in.
I spend way too much of my time daydreaming about relationships, having friends, sex (another ironic thing considering the fact that I'm a kissless virgin). I also spend more time infront of my computer screen than I do with other people.
My body's gross. My skin has bumps all over, I asked to see a dermatologist but my request has been ignored. I have a huge overbite and my teeth are yellow, I remember my friend pointing it out in 4th grade. I think it's because I used to be sick a lot when I was little and I'd be fed liquid medicine. I don't think anyone started brushing my teeth until I was like 5. I blame my parents. Maybe I shouldn't.
I left tumblr because there's a lot of post about mental illnesses and I guess in a fucked up way I wanted to fit in, and I'd question if I had BDP or OCD whenever I'd see one of those post with a lot of notes. I suppose I'm an easily impressionable teen. Like when someone says ""I just looked through the notes"" I'll take it by word, go home and do exactly what they did, even if another method works better for me, because everyone's different. I want people to tell me things get better but I know I have to make them better and it get annoying to hear that response.
It feels nice to type this out because I never talk about this with anyone."

I really need advice, and I know there's so much text and it's painful to read but I would love if anyone out there could hear my story out. 

Let me introduce myself first. I'm a 27 years old male. I'm what you could call a ""brilliant guy"" at my job. I work at forensic sciences for the government (Genetics), a job where one has to get cold blood for all the kind of shit you get to see.
I'm an average-looking guy who works out a lot and I usually get a lot of praise at my work because I'm REALLY good at it I got a pretty high ego I guess.

About a year and half ago, a new intern girl got to work with us. She was really pretty, exactly the kind of girl I feel attracted to. She was short and thin, had freckles, white milk skin and really big eyes. So she became my intern and since I have the kind of job I have, I have to be very strict and honestly I'm kind of a douchebag but in a funny way so I was like ordering her a lot around and being bossy but she liked it and we were having fun.

Our relationship started when she asked why I was the way I was (strict, bossy, distant and an ass) but I just avoided getting into any real talk and told her to get to work. One day I asked her out and we went to our grandma's birthday, we had a lot of fun and that's where I told her I liked her and I told her my story. Previously I was a guy whose heart had been broken so many times I developed a high ego and became a bit more distant on people and kind of bitter honestly; nothing big happened afterwards, she just thanked me for telling her my story and smiled.

Now, an important thing here, she had a boyfriend at that time and the next time I asked her out to a party, I asked her ""why do you accept to go out with me when you have a boyfriend?"" She then told me her story, crying. Her ex bf before the current one, they were dating for 5 years and they were gonna get married but he started getting distant on her and she found out he was cheating on her and they broke up. He was her first boyfrien. He took her virginity. She was really into him and she just admired him a LOT since he was that typical wealthy, pretty looking guy young girls get obsessed with. 

She told me she started dating her then current boyfriend later, which she said she didn't really love but she felt confortable with since he was a really nice guy. She also told me her father abandoned her and her mother when she was a kid so she only lived with her mom. I just listened to her carefully and told her she shouldn't feel guilty for going out with me and that I would be happy if she was happy. She smiled and everything was good. We started trusting each other.

A couple weeks after we started randomly going out, she told me she broke with her latest boyfriend and was now single but she said she didn't do it because of me, but because she realized she didn't really love him and because she still couldn't get over her first bf. I was like okay then, do what you consider best, but then things started getting hot. In one of those dates, after I drove her home, we started making out and I'm really good at kissing so she got very passionate into it, but she started feeling guilty afterwards and was like ""no more kisses"" but the next date we kept doing it over and over. She was getting into me. 

I could tell she admired me a lot at my work. She admired how intelligent and forgiving I had become after being a douchebag, and she too started getting deep into my mind and later I told her I would try my best to fight for her so I started giving her flowers, being a gentleman, and being a really good guy with her and she was happy.

Then one night we got drunk after a party and we started making out like usual but she got a bit too hot in there and we got to 2nd base. Now I have to say I didn't really look at her in a sexual way at that time. I wanted to make her my girlfriend, not a hook so I said ""NO"" at least ten times but she was just too turned on and we tried to have sex. I say we tried because I couldn't get it up (literally). I was so worried about being such a perfect guy for her and since I didn't really see her in a sexual way I just couldn't focus and that was the most embarrassing thing I've ever gone through. She didn't really care she was just like ""let's forget that happened"" but being the stupid, high ego dumbass I am, the following days I tried to justify the fact I couldn't get it up and things started getting weird. We started sexting, sending nudes, she told me I was looking really insecure and a week after we gave it another try. 

That time everything went great on my end, I had a really good performance but now it was her who wasn't into it. I just wasn't doing the things she liked, and how could I possibly know? It was our first time doing it but she started getting frustrated and couldn't get off, so I once again felt ashamed even though I really tried... we fell asleep and the next morning, surprise, she was really happy! The next day she called me and she said she was really happy for having me in her life and she missed me a LOT, she told me so many nice things I thought she had finally started to have feelings for me. And then the sad crazy part came. A day later she called me and told me she didn't want to feel happy. She said she didn't want to miss me because it reminded her of her first boyfriend. She didn't want to miss anyone like she missed him, or feel dependant emotionally on anyone ever again and I was like, that's nonsense, why am I here then? Why am I trying to make you happy when you don't want to be happy? It was messed up.

We kept going out on a few more dates and I noticed she started getting more and more distant. She started to reject me physically and emotionally; in a party with my friends she ignored me, started dancing with another guy and I found out she was texting her first boyfriend (the 5 years one) and later she didn't allow me to even hold her hand. I couldn't take it anymore and became really frustrated at how irrational her way to make decisions was, on everything so one night I called her and I told her I couldn't keep going and ""broke up"" with her. The next day she called me crying. She said she didn't deserve such a good guy like me, she said I shouldn't be wasting my time with someone as complicated as her and she told my best friend (who she became friends with too), she couldn't love me the way I loved her.

She confused the hell out of me and one night I snapped. I told her a lot of horrible things. I told her she was really toxic in my life, I told her it was so unfair and that if we couldn't have a relationship, I wouldn't be her friend either. Because I just wouldn't be. I couldn't. Those words hurt her, she curled in my car and gave me her back, looking extremely sad. It was so traumatic for me to see I hurt her so I started crying out of frustration and I told her I needed love, and she told me ""I gave you love"" and cleaned up my tears and kissed me again. I drove her home but I was really hurt and just said bye and ""good luck with your next one"" referring to the next guy who tries something with her. She looked disappointed at me. We grew distant from that point.

Some time later it was my birthday and she didn't go. She made up a really bad excuse (stomachache) and being the extreme guy I am I just STOPPED talking to her on ice. Literally. No hi, no bye, no congratulations on your birthday, no nothing. I was really hurt and I felt I had already used all my options and it was a lost cause. I just didn't want to see her or know anything about her and I know she was also hurt because I didn't want to be her friend either. But having the experience she has with being abandoned (first by her father, then by her first boyfriend), I can tell she got over me very easily. She didn't try to talk to me either, she was like ""ok he doesn't want to talk to me so I won't talk to him either"". She blocked me on facebook out of nowhere and slowly stopped going to work and we just stopped seeing each other forever.

That was months ago and there's not a single day where I don't think about her. I am extremely frustrated and grinding my teeth every time I think about her because she hurt me so bad. I tried my absolute best and it had no effect whatsoever. To this day I have no idea why did she do what she did, what did really cross her mind behind her actions, why did she say so many beautiful things to me like ""I'm so thankful you're in my life"" and being so nice, to something like ""it doesn't matter how many qualities you have, I just don't want to be with you"". What did I do wrong? The worst part of it is that experience took away all of my sexual confidence. I can't get off my head the thoughts that if I had been better in bed, she would've wanted to be with me. I know she really enjoyed sex with her other boyfriends and she had more experience than I did so I don't know. And now I just found out she's now dating another guy after all that ""can't get over my ex"" crap she said. It was ME she lost interest on. I didn't turn out to be a guy she could fall in love with. What can I do to stop caring and being so frustrated?

tl;dr: I fell in love with a very complicated girl who also loved me but her past didn't allow her to begin a relationship. We had a couple bad experiences in bed and I can't stop feeling guilty about all the ""what ifs"". I still don't understand why she didn't give me a real oportunity and my confidence is crushed."

English is not my first language, sorry about the grammar errors. I'm looking for some outside perspective, advices, or maybe even a wake up slap.


I have a part-time job in a public agency for two years now, an internship actually, and i'm about to be hired full-time (yeah!). Since i started working there i developed a nice coworker relantionship with this woman (let's call her C). I always had a crush on her but at the time we were both in long term relationships, so never crossed my mind something could possibly happen between us, after all we were comitted with our SO at the time and we are coworkers.  Turned out we were both into shitty and troubled relationships.


In July 2015 my ex girlfriend broke up with me and i was finally free of that abusive relantionship (long story short, she cheated at me a lot, lied, manipulated me, gaslighted me for years, the same old story. she broke up with me by Messenger and two days later was dating someone else). About the same time, C also ended hers. One day i was there doing my job and she asked for my hangout. We started talking about music, life, our job, and it was nice and we hitted very well. We share a lot of interests. Books, music, political views. I'm about to get the same degree tha she has. One day i said i was going to the bar with some friends after work and she ended up going with me. We drank, it was really nice. We went again after that and kind of started flirting. One day we kissed, next day we had sex, and that was it. Totally pulled out of my head that you don't shit where you eat. She is not my boss and we don't work directly, but she is hierarchically miles above me. And plus, i'm a woman, which is news to her.
From the beginning we talked it was a friendship with benefits kind of relantionship. She is very paranoid about the coworker situation, about the age gap, bla bla bla. I'm about to get hired, i will not be in the same level as her, but the whole interns-public employee will not be an ethic problem anymore. What worries me, in fact, is the huge income gap we have. 


 We stayed in this on and off fwb thing, without any definition for months. I fell in love with her despite knowing it was a terrible idea. Well, she fell in love with me too, but since january she started to ghost me out of the blue. She likes to think she is very autonomous and dont let people get closer to her very easily. I dont know the best word in english to describe it, but i feel often put by side, someone who is nice to be in your day to day life. I said with all the words that i am head over heels, that i want more than this, and she avoids answering me. She is very cute and nice for weeks and then ghost me. Then i get frustrated, we have an argument, and end up hooking up again.


I'm really tired of this situation. I want a partner. I would like her to be my partner but i don't know how to unhesitatingly ask for it. 


I'm not sure what i'm asking you guys, but anything would be helpful...

I'm currently a second year Computer Science student and have an internship for the summer but I was looking to do my own little personal project.  Well not so little but something that has been a dream of mine for quite some time.  I wanted to create my own version of IBM's Watson.  I would be using this guide: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/InsideSystemStorage/entry/ibm_watson_how_to_build_your_own_watson_jr_in_your_basement7?lang=en

My main question is do you think this is feasible for four months as a single developer?  I have one year experience in Java and a bit of experience in Linux however nothing in Hadoop or any sort of AI or deep learning.  I'd love to hear opinions or if you know anyone who has in fact completed this endeavour.  

Thank you!"
4gseih,3,2016-04-28,Do I go my college graduation ceremony?,Caampbell,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4gseih/do_i_go_my_college_graduation_ceremony/,"I'll try to keep this brief.

&amp;nbsp;

Three years ago I had a rough patch in school and sincerely wondered if I was going to make it to graduation. I was severely struggling and it looked like my work ethic was going to kill me.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to now, it's my fifth year here and I've come a long way. I've gotten research positions and internships, taught classes that I made my own lectures and quizzes for, and got involved in some pretty amazing organizations along the way. I know almost everyone in the science department, and Saturday night is the last night for us to be together. The last night for us to thank the administrators for everything they've done. I go to a large university but I don't plan on attending the university graduation because of how informal it is. The science graduation has less than 100 graduates, and everyone gets called by name and we all know each other.

&amp;nbsp;

This morning my uncle passed away. He didn't live in the same town as the rest of my family but I saw him a few times a year and I can't think of a bad thing to say about him. He was a great guy and a lot of fun to be around, and he certainly means a lot to me. This kind of came out of nowhere.

&amp;nbsp;

The funeral is on Saturday. Same exact time as my graduation.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom texted me earlier asking me what she should do...""Do we go to my brother's funeral or our son's graduation?"" I proposed that it was more important to go to my uncle's last big event rather than a big event in the middle of my life. She agreed.

&amp;nbsp;

So reddit, do I go to my uncle's funeral and miss out on probably the biggest accomplishment of my life? My last chance to see all of my friends and colleagues and professors and thank everyone for this amazing journey? My chance to celebrate the fact that I somehow turned everything around and went from a surefire dropout to a pretty outstanding student?

&amp;nbsp;

Or do I go to my graduation ceremony alone? Even though this is supposed to be one of the best days in my life so far, I keep imagining standing in the hallway surrounded by proud families taking pictures with their kids, crying, ecstatic, proud, and together. I keep picturing myself standing in the bathroom alone, silently crying to myself, wishing my family were here. Or just leaving.

&amp;nbsp;

If I don't go to my uncle's funeral, I'll be upset because I didn't get to see my uncle one last time and say goodbye to him. I'll be sad because I'm not with my family. But if I miss my graduation, I'll miss a day I never thought I would see. I won't get to be around everyone who made my future possible. I won't be able to spend one last night with everyone who made the past five years of my life so special."

Between 7 and 13 viewers

[loading]

Alice: —so are the rest of you just here for screenshots, so you can talk about me on Reddit? 

(Alice grins, leans out of frame, lights a pipe, inhales.)

Commenter: Pass it!

Alice: Pass what? 

(Alice coughs) 

Alice: Pass what? What are you talking about? Pass beer? 

(Alice grins.)

(A commenter says, ""Not the beer."")

Alice: Hang on. (looks down) I'm not tamping, it's just out, man. (Smoke fills screen.) I never do it right, like ever. Ever. And that is not the marra-ja-wanna, kids, that is....not marra ja wanna. Fuck my balls. Come on, dude. (Bends out of screen, inhales) So is anyone actually gonna interact or is it pretty much, 'Let's watch Partypants be a trainwreck so we can talk about it?' Whatever. 

(Alice leans in to screen, applies lipstick) 

Alice: And there's your screenshot.

(A commenter asks, ""Do you have questions for us?"")

Alice: I always love to hear what brought someone to GOMI. That's always my question.

(A commenter asks, ""If it's not marijuana, what is it?"")

Alice: It's, um.

(A commenter says, ""Young House Love."")

Alice: I wanna know where the hell they went. I saw he did a post like the other day or something. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS! I do have a question for you guys. Does anyone like ""Modern Family,"" or am i a loser? I'm really into ""Modern Family"" right now for some reason. (Commenter says they watch it.) YAY, someone else is into ""Modern Family."" (Keeps talking about the show) (Adjusts shirt) C'MON, girls, work with me here. (Keeps talking about Young House Love.)

(A commenter says they are on GOMI for the ""WeddingBee snark."")

Alice: —I'm trying to binge watch (""Modern Family"") but I can only do it in blocks because, you know, stuff to do.

(The conversation turns back to WeddingBee/ThatWife)

Alice: I mean, I can't say much. I'm a fuckin' trainwreck .... I'm a trainwreck, but Jesus Christ, at least I turned the train wreck off a couple months ago. Yeah, there's a whole WeddingBee thread on GOMI. I feel weird because I don't really get, like I start reading it and I don't know who they're talking about or whatever 'cause it seems to be very ancillary. There's these in-jokes. You have to know someone. I don't really get it. I wish I could get it, you know?

(A commenter says they are on GOMI because of Katie Bower.)

Alice: Katie Bower and her crack house. I remember that one. Fine. Yeah, good times. Yeah, I love ""Modern Family."" What else. Any of you guys have cats? (Laughs)

(A commenter says they are on GOMI because of ""GhostBev."")

Alice: GhostBev! It's going to be funny forever. That's why there's the ghost emoji in the forums, so we can all do that. Ghost Bev is the best. She is like, the joke that doesn't get old. And you know, she got pregnant again with her new guy. (Gets distracted by her cats in the background.) Oh, there he goes, there's a cat. Pancakes, taking off. Not everyone enjoys NOT-MARIJUANA smoke, so. I still kind of actually wonder about Bev, like, did she have the baby, whatever?

(A commenter asks, ""Were there 2015 GOMI awards this year or did i miss it?"")

Alice: God, thank you! I keep forgetting to do the voting. I swear to god, it's gonna be like June .... I swear, I swear, I swear I'll get the GOMI awards up. Probably by June.""

(A commenter asks who GhostBev is.)

Alice: Settle in. Get a drink. Settle in. Do some shopping. Come back. Seriously, settle in. HEY! 

(Alice gets up, walks off screen, smacks pack of cigarettes against her hand.) 

Alice: Sorry to disgust everyone. I'm moving to cigarettes instead of...not cigarettes. No, where's the opening thing?

(Laughs, shouts at window.)

Alice: NO! Drunky Dickhead. Yeah, so, GhostBev. Around 2014 (lights cigarette) 

(Shouts at window again.)

Alice: All the way up! This chick shows up on GOMI who had like a thread with two posts. I guess she found it. She shows up, then pretends she's gonna go away now. Then, like, ten white knights show up — all with her IP address. 

(A commenter says that then, GhostBev ""died.""

Alice: Yes, then she dies. I'm not there. Hang in. I said, ""settle in."" Put on ""The View"" for a minute. So, she comes in with ten white knights, all under her IP address, talking about how great Beverly is. So, then, that finally stops and her (air quotes) husband (air quotes, and then more air quotes) shows up claiming that Beverly died in a car crash and, ""I hope you all feel bad about yourselves."" Same IP address. Still her. When I called her out, she was like, her sister or neighbor created an account. I mean, you just pulled the oldest, lamest troll ever. ""She's dead. I hope you're happy."" Yup, it was her, and if you actually go to the GOMI main page, down at the bottom of the page. 

(A commenter says that GhostBev came back from the dead.)

Alice: Oh, yes fucking way she came back from the dead like three times — same IP address continuing to comment on her thread. It was so ridiculous. 

(A commenter likens it to LiveJournal ca. 2005.)

Alice: YES, that is exactly what I said. SO LiveJournal. ""She's dead and I hope you're happy."" But they keep being around. So LiveJournal. It's absolutely a GOMI classic. That's why, like, in the title of the front page post, it was, ""GOMI Classics."" [Editor's note: the title of the thread is actually ""Forum Hall Of Fame: Beverly And The Haunting Of GOMI Manor""]

Alice: It was hysterical. It was so ridiculous.

(A commenter says GhostBev happened around the same time as the forum thread that discussed ""Grocery Store People."")

Alice: You know, what's funny — someone actually sent me La Croo-sette salt and pepper shakers as a gift and it had nothing to do with GOMI and it just cracked me up. It's actually a friend of mine who got the salt and pepper shakers as an engagement present .... (these days) I basically cut off pieces of cheese and put it on Triscuits. Or ramen, lately. Sorry, sometimes I feel like the only person who has to pay income taxes in April.

(Alice continues talking about ""grocery store people"" and gestures to something in the background, saying it's ""fake."") 

Alice: So, it's become dark since I started this. Can you guys see me? 

(A commenter asks if the brick wall is fake.)

Alice: Wait, what's fake? Which thing? Yeah, it's fake! I did the — it's actual brick, it's just real thin-cut real brick, you can just slice it and put it up on the wall and grout it in between the brick. I actually did it in the bedroom too. They're the actual external walls of the building, so it looked like it would be real. I used Brickweb on a meshed tile and there's 12 of them on a sheet. It's so fast and amazing. Highly recommend the Brickweb. The worst part is doing the grout. It's really messy. I hope you have someone around you who loves you and can see you naked with grout on this area (gesturing to stomach) while you hold a grout bag and do this. But yeah, I love it. It's exactly the look I was going for and it's actually the same price I was going for. It's less expensive than doing actual brick with all the scaffolding shit you need to hold the weight and incredibly more easy to do. It's actually the same price as Thin Brick and takes a third of the time to put up and I recommend OmniGrip mastic. Smear it all in, slap it up. I really like DIY stuff. Oh man, fuck spacers. The Brickweb stuff — it's pre-spaced on the web and even when you're fitting the next one on, it's pre-spaced. Well, I somehow managed it, because I'm special, clearly. Oh, wow, my computer's gonna die in a minute. 

(A commenter asks what the best hardware store is in New York and Alice says homedepot.com because they deliver. She swigs some more beer.)

Alice: Hah! I got a heart! (dances) Wait, so when's Jenna's thing? That's like, two hours from now, right. 

(Alice leans in to camera) 

Alice: OKAY, GUYS LET'S TALK ABOUT HATERS OR TROLLS.

(A commenter asks if GOMI meetups are generally just with people who live in New York.)

Alice: Yeah, whoever's in New York City. One second. Literally going right there because that's how large my awesomely millionaire apartment in New York City is. What do you want. 

(Alice gets up and walks off-screen.)

Alice: (from off-screen) Oh, look at my glamorous apartment.

(Alice, still off-screen, starts yelling.)

Alice: OKAY. SEE YOU. HAVE A NICE WEEKEND, DUDE. OKAY. SEE YOU. 

(Alice returns to her chair in front of the computer. A commenter says something about how they see one of her cats.)

Alice: I have neighbors who can see into every side of this apartment. Which cat? Oh, that's Pancakes. I did what an hour ago? Shit, what time is it? 

(Alice looks back at her cat.)

Alice: HAH, well, now, he's going under the amazing (IKEA) Karlstad.

(Alice gives a thumbs up to the camera. A commenter says the Karlstad is what Young House Love had.) 

Alice: Well, that's Baconcat under the table there. He's the shorthair. Pancakes has, apparently, started to go take a moment under the sofa, so i'm going to respect his choices. Okay, so I'm supposed to. Who has a Karlstaad, me? Who? 

(Alice swigs beer. The commenter says again that Young House Love had one.)

Alice: I feel like I missed something. Oh! Sherry and John. For the record, I didn't keep up with them that much. I didn't know they had it when I got mine. I got mine really cheap because they were discontinuing it, so I got two grey slipcovers on eBay, but I have this friend who makes slipcovers — okay, ex-boyfriend, in Poland. I get around. Well, I used to get around. God. He makes the leather ones, the leather slipcovers, and he wants to send me a camel one. 

(A commenter says, ""a real Pole from Poland?"")

Alice: Yes, a real Jew from Poland! Boy, are my parents upset I didn't lock that one down.

(A commenter asks why Alice started GOMI and Alice says it was because she was writing about Julia Allison for ReBlogging NonSociety and people liked it. Alice rubs her lips.)

Alice: That's partly why I started GOMI — I'm sorry, I have chapped lips. I'm not being weird. Oh my god, it's gonna drive me crazy. I got tired of talking about Julia Allison all the time. It felt like she was ending her relevancy cycle for me, pretty much that. And also to get really really rich. 

(Alice rolls her eyes, puts her pipe in her mouth, leans off screen, inhales, coughs, returns to the screen and grins.)

Alice: Don't worry, your ad money doesn't pay for that. 

(Alice leans off screen and smokes again.)

Alice: It has helped me deal with GOMI though.

(Someone asks what Alice's favorite ""fail-chievement"" category is.)

Alice: Myself! Wow, I should probably hang this up now. Uh, ""fail-chievement"" category, no, I love them all. 

(Alice looks at her beer bottle.) 

Alice: Wow, this is when you know you're not drinking anymore. It's room temperature, so you're not even interested anymore. I'm gonna go over in my amazingly large apartment is and get a beer. OOH LOOK AT HOW BIG MY APARTMENT IS. LOOK AT WHAT YOUR AD MONEY IS PAYING FOR 

(Alice moves the camera so it pans over to her fridge. A commenter says Alice should Periscope more.)

Alice: Probably not. This tape isn't holding. We can not ALL get tripods for these things. I'll be writing a letter to Gorilla Tape later. Also, BYE! I actually have to hit the road in about ten minutes so. 

(Alice waves goodbye.)

Alice: Should I just, like, pose badly so there can be screenshots or should I? What? Deal with my hair, maybe.

[Editor's note, Alice says she has to leave in ten minutes at 8:28 p.m. She does not end her Periscope for another two hours.]

(A commenter thanks her for doing the Periscope.)

Alice: You bet. It was cool, I guess. It was weird for me. Thanks for showing up, though. 

(Alice swigs beer. A commenter asks if this is her first Periscope broadcast.)

Alice: I think it's, like, my third. I haven't done one in about a year, mainly because of this. I'm really bad at it. I'm not good at just sitting around.

(A commenter tells Alice it's ""time to refill the gin"" and complain about her children like ThatWife.)

Alice: I haven't had gin since November, so .... and unfortunately, after ten years, my pets are fairly well behaved, not screaming at me so I can snapchat about it. Sorry, guys. God, now I miss gin. Oh, Hendrick's, why didn't you work well with my body?

(A commenter says that most Periscope broadcasts are terrible.)

Alice: Are they? I've seen Jenna and Stasia. I follow a few people. One is this guy in England who walks around parks. It looks like you guys are getting more interactive, which is helpful for me because i'm not a personal blogger person who sits around talking about themselves, so this is weird for me. The first time, I was looking at maps and walking around Brooklyn....but there are bloggers who insist on Snapchatting while driving. Like, STOP. 

(Alice leans off screen, smokes, inhales, coughs on screen.) 

Alice: I can't even with the people who Snapchat while they're driving. Like, please, just don't. Just do not do that. 

(A commenter asks, isn't that illegal?)

Alice: I think is IS. Actually, I mean, texting while driving is illegal in a lot of places, so Snapchatting has to be illegal as well, right? 

(Alice reapplies lipstick.) 

Alice: I'm actually curious, can you guys see each other's comments or do I need to read them out loud?

(A commenter asks where Alice is ""hitting the road"" to.)

Alice: No, I'm actually. I'm gonna be here. Um. I'm doing a thing with some friends. Here. So. But I kept thinking, like, they're not gonna be here 'till 10:30. I have to get around and clean the house. But, whatever. Good enough, right? They're my friends. Deal with some cat hair on the chair, am I right? AND HE CLOSED THE WINDOW BEFORE HE LEFT. Thanks, dickhead. No, I would not marry you again. 

(Alice gets up and walks off screen) 

Alice: Because some people don't know how to leave a window open. I'm just saying, in case YOU watch this later.

(Alice holds up a copy of Betty Neels' 2004 romance novel, ""The Right Kind of Girl."")

Alice: How about this? Mind-expanding literature. They have all these sales around Brooklyn and I just keep buying Harlequin romance novel-type shit. 

(Alice begins to pretend to sob.)

Alice: And I am just DONE being ashamed. I think if a woman wants to read her feelings in a romance novel-type paperback, hashtag yes I am so brave. Yes, yes I like some cheap paperback novels. It's like beach weather hashtag so brave. Yes, I am so brave. 

(Alice begins to pretend to sob.)

(A commenter asks, did you just say you would not marry that guy again?)

Alice: Who, my neighbor? Yeah, I did say that to my neighbor. Because he's marrying my neighbor. My neighbors and i hang out a lot, is the back story to that. But, yeah our joke is, as of that engagement party, he would marry me because he wouldn't have to move much furniture. We can't all have Park Slope lofts. Wow, it smells like Amsterdam here. Oh, and it should be clear about my neighbors, I'm friends with her and I'm friends with him and I'm friends with them both. I would not marry him. But it all came about because of the joke at the engagement party, because if he married me, he wouldn't have to move much furniture. Just to explain that. 

(Alice smokes more off screen, comes back on screen and waves hands in her air.) 

Alice: And that is my impression of plastic arm wavy guys outside car dealerships

(A commenter asks if Alice would get married again, but she is leaning off-screen, inhaling.)

Alice: (off screen) Down the shirt. Down the shirt! Oh my god, I am awesome. I saved it. 

(Alice comes back on-screen.)

Alice: So, what are you guys doing tonight? I might go on OKCupid. 

(A commenter says it's 2 a.m. and she can't sleep.)

Alice: It's 2 a.m. there? Why are you on periscope? Shouldn't you be sleeping or something? Well, how about you guys! Who's your favorite hate read? Um, besides me.

(A commenter says ""KERF."" Alice reads the screen and dances.)

Alice: You guys don't wanna see me dance again. Do you wanna see me dance again? I know you don't. I know you don't. Okay, no one's answering.

(A brief conversation ensues between Alice and someone who says they don't read many blogs because Google Reader is defunct. Alice taps out her pipe.)

Alice: Come ON. Ugh, God. When a pipe loves something very very much it might want to smoke it. So. YEAH. That's a ""yeah"" to all three of you. 

(A commenter asks what Alice's favorite threads are and says they enjoy the Members Only threads.)

Alice: Yeah, ""Members Only"" seems to be where it's at right now for a lot of people. 

(Alice smokes a cigarette.)

Alice: Yeah, That Wife is my favorite [thread] right now just because it's like a three-chin what the fuck. 

(Alice contorts herself so she is recoiling with her chin against her throat. A commenter says they are just worried about people registering and finding out details about other forum members.)

Alice: Uh, certain sections of Members Only, the Ask a Hamcat, and TTC and all that stuff — that is actually at a higher post count, so you have to be a ham who's been participating a while before you can see that stuff. It's for you guys' privacy. So it's not just someone who can join GOMI and see you guys talking about your husbands and shit. Yeah! 

(A commenter says they are a Senior Hamcat.)

Alice: You're a Senior Hamcat!? My cats are Senior Hamcats, at ten years old. 

(A commenter says they want to get to Expert level.)

Alice: Are you really DYING to get to Expert? Girl, if you're dying to get to Expert, just message me and say you were on the Periscope. 

(Alice's dog makes motions in the background.)

Alice: Oh, who wants to see the dog go crazy? The neighbors are coming home. The third-floor neighbors, not mine. You know, I feel like my Snapchat is super boring. Like, I don't binge drink anymore so, you know, my Snapchat is super boring. Cats, where are you going? Okay, see you. Where do they go? They have important cat business? No, I mean, I feel like that's the kind of shit I would do. Of course, now, I just don't. I have HEARD I have two kids. I heard that from the Internet. Hang on, mommy moment.

(Alice gets up, walks to her couch, and looks at her dog getting under a blanket.)

Alice: Sometimes, he needs help. Not this time. Now I don't feel needed.

(Alice pretends to cry. She swigs from her beer bottle. Her cats distract her from off screen, and she walks over and picks one of them up.)

Alice: So, when one of your kids mounts your other kid you have to do this. Okay, distraction, distraction. Let's try to not butt-sex your brother, okay? You're not Josh Duggar all right? Thank you. Thank you, sweetie. No, seriously, my cats are trained to come to certain noises. 

(A commenter says that KERF wearing a Mary Kay director's suit to the White House was one of their favorite moments on GOMI. Another commenter says that Alice's review of the Gluten Free Girl book was her favorite post.)

Alice: Yeah, KERF wearing Mary Kay was one of my favorite stories of this year. Yeah. It's not like she wore the blazer out of necessity. Gluten Free Girl was your favorite review? Book club is starting up again in May. Yeah, people were saying she [KERF] borrowed it from that girl she was staying with? 

(Alice looks down at her shirt. A commenter says they doubt if ThatWife actually thrifts her outfits.)

Alice: Just stay UP and stay covered. I don't know if Jenna actually thrifts. 

(Alice puts a new cigarette in her mouth, wrong end in.) 

Alice: That's what happens when you smoke...not marijuana. Legal things. (Pauses.) You guys realize I'm making fun of Jenna, right, with the? I mean, I hope you guys get that.

(Alice sings. She asks if anyone thinks her cats are getting too much screen time. A commenter asks if Alice is stressed about Mother's Day coming up.

Alice: Stressing about Mother's Day? I totally am. Oh, yeah.

(Alice gets up and walks off-screen. She returns, waves her beer bottle around, and says she doesn't understand why ThatWife has so many accounts on social media. A commenter asks how frequently Alice has to ban people and for what.)

Alice: God, I haven't banned anyone since December? January, I think? It's been a really long time. And why? Usually, repeated comment policy violations or spamming. Or, I have banned, like, two people in the last eight years for just — repeated ham complaints about them. Like, they're just instigating or starting fights and it's been going for months and it's running off users — and not just one or two users, but a large number of users. I'll ban them. But it's been two people — what's the one — New Year New You and this other one and their screen name was like, Fucking Dogs or something. That's that. I banned that Linda Sundry chick (from Sundry Mouning) one night. Yeah, it was gross. Because she was clearly in the midst of her emotional crazy shit and I didn't want her posting shit I knew she would regret. So I did ban her for 72 hours. She was really nutburgers. Personally, I think I did her a favor. 

(A commenter asks what happened to GOMI poster Green Jello.)

Alice: I have no idea with Green Jello. I think that Green Jello person — I don't know. They keep crossing the line a lot and it's getting old. 

(A commenter says something about Linda Sundry.)

Alice: Yeah, she was robo tripping. Oh, I don't know what that means, truck stop guy! Basically it's when you, like, you can actually microwave the Robitussin and do the taste thing and put it in vodka. Oh, I don't know ANYONE who EVER did that. I'm the best liar ever. You can do that. But I think that's what she was doing. People envision chugging and that's actually not the way you do it. 

(A commenter says something about codeine cough syrup.)

Alice: I will say — cocaine and Mt. Dew? What's up, bitch? Better with Mt. Dew in the freezer so you get the flakes. Um, why don't I remember college? It's pretty messed up, but maybe some of THEM are just trying to find THEMSELVES.

(Alice gestures and points at herself.)

Alice: God, I feel weird that I'm sitting in the dark and look like a skull-ah-tin. 

(Alice swigs beer. There is some more conversation about GhostBev.)

[Editor's note: It is now 9:10 — 40 minutes after Alice had to ""hit the road.""]

(A commenter asks ""is there anyone gone that you miss?"" Alice reads it and ignores. Someone else says something about the ""Ghostbusters"" movie reboot. FIXED, c/o /u/PickyWolverine: Alice says she loved Melissa McCarthy's performance in the movie ""Spy."" Someone points out that ""Ghostbusters"" won't be out until July.)

Alice: Wait, it's not out yet? Really? I thought ""Ghostbusters"" came out in March. Or is that when I heard about it?

(Alice starts talking about how she just bought another movie's soundtrack on iTunes. She dances in her seat and quotes from it.)

Alice: I can tell everyone's mad I said the r-word. I was just quoting the movie. It did make me very uncomfortable.

(A commenter asks if Alice thinks big bloggers are on GOMI snarking on their competition.)

Alice: I don't really think about it that much, honestly. Yeah, you don't think so? Yeah, I don't really think about that or try and find out because I don't really care. 

(Alice adjusts her shirt.)

Alice: Come on, girls. 

(Alice reapplies lipstick.) 

Alice: But if they are, they have as much right as anyone to come complain about their competition. I apparently weigh 300 pounds and live in a basement under a bridge. Well, I get regularly told I suck as a mod and an admin because I don't come in and tell you guys to stop fighting with each other. Yeah, I get told that a lot. You're fucking adults. You wanna fight in the thread? Work it out amongst yourselves. I don't wanna spend my life dealing with a thread. 

(A commenter mentions how Alice got judged on Reddit for saying marijuana brownies were a waste.)

Alice: Well. we were just gonna disagree so I just shut up. My feelings about pot brownies, y'know. I had and have an opinion about — putting pot in food is a fucking waste. JOINT? What are we, me two weeks ago? Get a pipe. In Brooklyn, you won't get arrested smoking a joint but if you're smoking a pipe you'll get a ticket. Happened to a friend of me. It happened to my cat. I understand, some people, they need to take their pot in an edible, but for me it's a waste. I could smoke that nug for a day, day and a half, and you're gonna rip it up and put it in a brownie? What a waste. Wow, everyone went really quiet. Did I do something? I love it when people are like HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT— yeah, shut up, there are like, 15 places talking about me. 

(Alice adjusts her video set-up.)

Alice: WHOA. THIS FUCKING — I swear to God, I'm writing a letter to Gorilla Tape. Okay. It's sticking. My weirdest thing is when people go, ""If they're talking shit, you're doing it right."" No, if they're talking shit, you're a trainwreck. That's why people talk about me. I'm a fuckin' trainwreck. Just don't read it. That's what I do. Oh my god, of course they are. And, you know, everyone talks shit about each other and everyone else behind each other's backs. That's all GOMI is, it's just public and anonymous. Jesus Christ, I have fucking girlfriends and they talk shit about other girlfriends. There was a night, couple nights ago, I posted a screencap from that show ""The Boys,"" [sic] and her friend is planning this elaborate bridal shower and [main character] P.J. [Franklin] goes, ""What happened to getting our nails done and talking shit?"" C'mon, ladies you all do it in real life or on the internet. And if someone shares to you, never talk to that bitch again. She'll do it again and if she's telling you about it, fuck her. One second.

(Alice leans out of frame, lights her pipe, and inhales. A commenter says that when they have a long day at work, nothing makes them feel better than GOMI.)

Alice: Amen, girl. I wouldn't spend so much time on it if I didn't love it.

(Commenter says it makes them happy to be able to ""talk shit all night."")

Alice: I agree. All night. Well, not all night for me because I have to do that thing, but I still have like, an hour and a half. That'll be when Jenna's show starts.

(A commenter asks what is something others have said about her that's untrue you want to correct?

Alice: What is something untrue about me that people have said that I would want to correct. Um. I don't really care. Um, I don't know if you've ever read the autobiography of Tallulah Bankhead — If you don't know who she is, she was crazy. Crazy. But also extremely talented as a writer and actress. There were all of these stories about her everywhere, like, she apparently, one night climbed up stairs through a fire escape at the New York Plaza Hotel to get to this guy she liked who had gin because she drank all hers, so she climbed up and, addressing that in her autobiography, everyone was waiting for an answer because she was found in his room, drunk. And she never explained why. She never refuted the stories of how she got in his room. She didn't address any of that. What she did, in a two-paragraph chapter, all on its own, said, if you all are waiting for me to respond to the accusations or all the scandals, she said, you will not find any of that in this book, and the second paragraph was this sentence, I'll let people believe whatever they want because it adds to my legend. She was the original amazing person. She knew she was just this boring person who was going to bed at 8 p.m. at night with her cats in Connecticut, but all these stories make her sound more interesting. Sounds KIND OF like what I think. ""Too long, didn't read;"" Kinda what I think. CATS and DIY projects. And REAL JOB outside of GOMI and FRIENDS and SOCIAL LIFE. Not quite as amazing or interesting as anyone thinks. I love Tallulah.

(Alice adjusts her hair.)

Alice: I'm sorry, I'm just thinking about Jenna trying to recreate that story and messing it up. It's cracking me up.

[Editor's note: The long-winded Tallulah Bankhead spoke at length about her antics overindulging in alcohol and cocaine and mentioned her ""legend"" several times but never wrote any such two-paragraph chapter as described in Tallulah: My Autobiography] 

(Alice leans out-of-frame, lights pipe. A commenter asks if Alice knows who is watching her Periscope.)

Alice: It has a little number, like, right there. I don't know or give a shit to check. Like who. I don't know if it would, like, show the user names.

(A commenter asks if people in real life knows about her online persona.)

Alice: Like, do people recognize me? No. Do friends, colleagues know? Yeah, a couple of my friends know about GOMI. It's not something I introduce myself with, like, ""I'm the world famous Alice from GOMI!"" It's not something I identify myself as.

(Alice adjusts her hair.)

Alice: Oh, look, and apparently, later, I'll be doing Lady Gaga. Dude, nobody knows who PartyPants is outside of GOMI. It's not some huge international sensation like Gawker. It's a pretty specific niche of people.

(Attempts to do something with her pipe, fake-cries and yells at it.)

Alice: I dunno, maybe I just lack that MUCH of an ego. Like, so many people seem to think I have this huge ego or think highly of myself. I don't. I don't really bring up GOMI until i've known someone for quite a while.

(A commenter asks if Alice has another job.)

Alice: Other than GOMI? Yeah.

(Alice attempts to pull down her ponytail and adjust it again.)

Alice: But, no, it's not like anyone outside knows who I am. I don't go around introducing myself. Wow. You have to like, be done when you're hearing Lady Gaga applause in your head.

(Alice leaves chair to tell her cats to move.)

Alice: And my third job is cat ranching!

(A commenter asks if Alice's family knows about GOMI.)

Alice: Does my family know about GOMI? No, it's a filthy, disgusting secret I only discuss with my rabbi. Of course they know about it.

(Commenters and Alice re-hash Jenna. Alice swigs beer.)

Alice: Can I just say, one night I accidentally closed the door with BaconCat in the bathroom. He was in there probably four hours. The whole time I'm like, ""Why is my other cat acting weird?"" And when it happened, I felt like the worst human garbage on the planet. Seriously. I felt terrible and all I could think was, he must have been so hungry, thirsty, confused, scared and that was four hours for my cat. She like, put 15 diapers on her kid and ignored him all night. I felt like a super asshole because my other cat was like, ""Get up!"" and I was like, ""Get off me, I have to work.""

(Re-applies lipstick)

Alice: Well, all I have to say is, there's times you have to admit you're not a parent and stop fucking up your kids and leave. I'm just saying, there are people who need to do that.

(Goes off-screen, explaining her cat is trying to climb out the window. More discussion about ThatWife.)

Alice: I've never seen anyone in the world who has more ""Me Time"" than Jenna. Dude, I live alone and I'm single with cats and I don't get as much ""Me Time"" as Jenna does. (Swigs beer.) Okay, this is room temperature, so I'm gonna take my obese self to get an actual cold beer, 'cause if I'm gonna drink beer tonight, guys, it's at least gonna be cold. I don't want some fuckin'.... (from off-screen) Talk amongst yourselves!

(Alice starts yelling, still off-screen)

Alice: SHE TEXTED ME EARLIER. SHE'S GONNA BE BACK AROUND TEN. TEN. OKAY. OKAY. SHE CAN BUZZ AND I'LL LET HER IN. WHAT? OKAY. OKAY. NO, JUST COME BACK AT 10:30 AND IF SHE GETS IN LATER I'LL BUZZ HER IN. ALL RIGHT. GOD DAMN. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TEXTING ME. JESUS!

(Alice returns to screen.) 

Alice: Sometimes, in Brooklyn, you have to lean out the window and yell because you're doing a Periscope and they're texting you and they're freaking out. Did i miss anything? Did you guys solve the Rubik's Cube of Jenna?

(Commenter asks if PartyPants is going to watch Jenna's Periscope.)

Alice: Nah, we're probably gonna watch some other stuff. She starts at 10 and her thing is at 10:30 so, we're probably gonna be doing some other stuff. Oh my god, hers was terrible. I mean, mine's not much better, but yeah.

(Commenter asks about fashion bloggers and posing like ballerinas, and Alice pretends to pose in fourth position.)

Alice: Oh yeah. That's gonna be a screen cap later. Yeah.

(Discussion continues about fashion bloggers and how they pose. Alice leans off-screen, smokes pipe, leans back, swigs beer. A commenter suggests she get an intern.)

Alice: Yeah, I think I should have an intern, what with my busy life of eating and sleeping and going out with people and the litter box — ooh, I could have them do that. Why do they all have assistants? I wish I could outsource the litter box. I'm just saying, seriously, I don't like litter boxes. I could pay someone five dollars a day to do the litter box. Maybe one of those self-cleaning litter boxes? Yeah, I don't get it. What are they paying these assistants for? So they can say they have assistants? Know what I have? Neighbors! They watch my cats when I go out of town for 48 hours and I still pay them. Right, I agree, the whole assistant/intern thing, it gives them some kind of cred like, yes, they are so important and popular they need an assistant, like back in old Hollywood, starlets would hire secretaries to answer their fan mail, like they had so much they couldn't handle it on their own.

(Commenter asks if there's a stripe on PartyPants' floor. She explains that she just re-did her floors and didn't line up the planks properly, which is why there's a big black bumpy stripe across half of it.)

Alice: —That's just bad floor-laying by me.

(Commenter asks how many reports she gets per day from people on the forums.)

Alice: How many reports do I get a day? On an average day...five? Seven? And I try to look at them — like, all the GOMI stuff, I do, like, twice a day at specific times so nothing goes TOO long. I actually have it filtered into a folder. I do it before I go to work — yeah, I have a real job — and then I do it before I go to bed. Anything else? Still got 45 minutes to kill, so. I'm just trying to not go over into Jenna's.

(Commenter says ""we love GOMI and you."")

Alice: I love you guys! I know it doesn't seem that way (dissolves into fake appreciative crying) but I love you guys. No, but I do. I do try hard. Where is my gold star? And I do actually read the tech support forums and fix the stuff i can fix, but it's in a queue. I have a to-do list for GOMI and then I have a to-do list for my life, and one for work, and one for my apartment. Don't ask to see the bedroom floor.

(Commenter suggests ""maybe you could hire a tech-support team."")

Alice: (Forgetting her Instagram where she publicly claimed to be spending $3,781/month on a ""bomb-ass tech team"") It's a good idea actually. Yeah. Um, yeah, that's a good idea.

(Commenter asks her if she should hire an assistant.)

Alice: I couldn't afford to pay an assistant.

(Commenter says, ""like KERF's editor."")

Alice: Does she have an editor? Really? .... God, this is boring. Uh. Okay, so, it's almost about time for Jenna's Periscope. Are any of you watching that? Like, live?

(The view suddenly changes and she shows everyone a game board she has stapled to her wall.)

Alice: Okay, i'm out. Jenna's thing is gonna start pretty soon, so partake of that and be sure to not tell your friends about the PartyPants show. (Starts dancing in her seat.) This is me dancing because it always weirds everyone out. Everybody have a great night.

(Commenters start saying, okay, bye! Have a great night!)

Alice: THIS IS AWESOME! MY DANCING IS ACTUALLY MAKING PEOPLE LEAVE THE ROOM! My friends were right. I bet if i sing Lisa Loeb, that'll make people clear the room, or maybe that's just at karaoke in Brooklyn. Well, this was interesting and you guys have a good night and update the thread so i can see what's going on (whispers) secretly with people here. Bye! This is weird.

4gszcu,9,2016-04-28,[ROLEPLAY] The True Price of Freedom,Azailon,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/4gszcu/roleplay_the_true_price_of_freedom/,"The Prime Minister cursed loudly in his office after hearing the news that the secret attempt to contact the Ukrainians had been exposed. Sure the message had been sent but the Lord Protector had found out. Luckily for the PM the Lord Protector was drunk that night so he had some time to cover up the damages.

He picked up the phone calling one of his Special Forces contacts, ""The message was found, you know what to do"" he said over the phone, ""You have the next eight to ten hours to fix this issue. We must make sure the plan proceeds."" He then set down the receiver, ending the call.

The man on the other end of the line knew what to do. He waited until the government offices had closed for the day, and gained building access by looking one of the night guards. He broke into an intern's computer at the office planting a false manuscript, as well as printed pages made to look like a book manuscript, the Ukrainian message looking like a book passage. He then replaced other paperwork on top of the false page, calmly relocking the office afterwards

The next day the intern, Juan Alvarez, a 22 year old young man from the local university came into the office, unaware of what had happened. It was about noon that day when armed police broke down the door to the office, and arrested Juan, citing that he had been charged with treason. They put a balaclava over his head blacking out his surroundings.

The next thing Juan knew, he was being forcefully pushed into a chair and bound to it. A pair of hands roughly ripped the hood from Juan's head, a blinding light pierced his eyes as he looked around. The Lord Protector himself stood in front of Juan, giving him an almost disappointed look.

""Juan, you were such a fine young man until you tried to undermine my authority with your little ""novel."" This sort of thing is what leads to chaos and sedition. Chaos and traitors are things that I will not allow."" An icy tone seemed to hang off of every word the Lord Protector said. ""For this to not happen again, an example must be set.""

The Lord Protector snapped his fingers, and a man came into the room, holding a small case and opened it for the Lord Protector. In the case there laid a small revolver, with a pearl colored handle at the end of it and six bullets. The Lord Protector opened the chamber of the revolver and loaded  the six shots, then closed the chamber, and dismissed the man with the case.

""You see Juan, I didn't just get to the top by being nice, but by doing whatever it takes. He sighed almost as if he didn't want to do this. ""Admit to the treason and your life may be spared."" Juan looked at the LP and remained silent. ""So be it, then"", the Lord Protector said with an almost nonchalant shrug of his shoulders. He calmly walked to Juan's shoulder placing the barrel against where the joints met.

He pulled the trigger, the bullet flying out of the chamber, and ripping into Juan, instantly destroying the joint. Juan screamed out sharply due to the pain. ""You see Juan, that joint isn't easy for doctors to heal, and if you aren't careful it could lead to death, and see I'm willing to get you a medic. There's one right in the next room, all you have to do is admit what you did.""

Juan refused, and the Lord Protector simply shot a round into the other shoulder joint, rendering Juan's arms useless. Juan passed out from the pain and the Lord Protector sighed, ""Take him out back, you all know what to do."" He said it as if someone were taking out the trash and walked out of the room.

The Prime Minister had received at least some news, that the message had been sent out successfully. However when he heard the news of Juan, he just went numb. He had sentenced this young man to death. Granted he didn't know what would happen but still, the young man's blood was on his hands.

The Prime Minister prepared a quick statement for the media, since the execution had been put out by the Lord Protector. ""A local intern has been blamed and arrested. The intern was writing a novel that would be considered traitorous to the state, and therefore was sentenced to death by firing squad. His pages somehow got mixed in with official documents.""

He packed up and left after that, and when he finally made it home, he just sat down and wept, not for just the intern, or himself, but for his country, his  continent and his people.

4gt65e,1,2016-04-28,"Our time is almost up, and I'm so sorry.",scootzgootz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4gt65e/our_time_is_almost_up_and_im_so_sorry/,"Its been around five years that I've known her, just over three we've been together. I think I've known how this would turn out the whole time, but the last few months have been hard.

I think I've always known that it would end this way, or, I've always known that I would be the one to end it. I was her first true love, but she was not mine. She was a virgin, I was not.  When we started dating, she had just quit the job we both held. She was 18, I was 20. I took a chance on this girl I had hardly gotten to know as she made the ""first move."" We went on a date that week, and it was so fresh and new, she was so beautiful. I hadn't been with someone I could respect so much in a long time.

We did long-distance for a while, with summers together. Never more than a couple hours apart, we saw each other once or twice a month. She was.. sheltered in many ways, but I tried to look past that. We had very different viewpoints on life. I smoked, she didn't. I played videogames, she didn't see the appeal. I had a social life partly based around drugs and alcohol, she never touched the stuff. I was arrested a couple times in my youth, she would never do such a thing. I kept telling myself that opposites attract, and that I should be happy to be with such a well-to-do woman. So attractive, ambitious, intelligent.

Through my complacency, I denied all the problems I knew would inevitably surface. The lack of connection between us has made it difficult to hold conversation. I feel that the only reason we lasted so long was due to the distance between us.

Out of ""convenience"" we moved in together after two years. In hindsight, it was not very well thought-out. I feel that I convinced her, in a way. I wanted to attend the university she was at, though not so we could go to school together. She seemed hesitant, thinking I would be isolated there. I can't deny that it sort of turned out that way. How naive of me to think that the idea of this being temporary and simply the best option for the both of us would stick. She now questions my commitment to her since I do not want to renew the lease, which I suppose is fitting.

It was nice at the beginning. We had a fun summer, lots of trips back home to see the boys, decent space between us and I found a good job. She had an internship, so time together felt precious. School started, I hadn't gotten into the university and decided to work through fall and start community college in January. I had always wanted a cat, and so we got one. It was decided that the cat ""chose"" me, since it would follow me wherever I went. The cat helped us bond, but in the end, I almost feel worse for taking the cat away from her than ending things.

I knew she was anxiety-ridden, but the constant stress she held became tiring on me, and I felt that no matter how positive and compassionate I was, it made no difference. It's a difficult task to transition from listener to motivator, and it seems I could not tackle it. I still feel this way. She said things would change when her workload lessened, it didn't. She said she would have more time for us and would help around the house more, there isn't, and she hasn't. I thought that we could have real conversations, instead of being a vessel for her to dump her emotions on. I felt that I could finally open up to her, but I ended up feeling more distanced as I could not relate to her. I feel that I hold most of the responsibilities, and I am beginning to feel like a parent. There is an apparent difference in the way we were brought up and the places we are at in life, and it's driven a wedge between us.

It's been three years, and I am not sure how to bring this up as an ultimatum. Our problems have come up in the past, but the long conversations we have had about our feelings don't seem to stick. As I told her how I really felt some months ago (before I felt it was truly over), she said that she honestly couldn't think of one negative thing about me and our relationship. Holding back tears, she looked away and I felt the hole in my chest get wider. She tends to blame herself for everything, and I know that's how she felt. How do you convince someone in denial that you really mean it, without crushing them?

I know what I have to do, it's just so damn hard."

I am 22 years old. I have just finished a bachelors degree in BA with 1/3 CS at a ""prestigious"" german uni. I am originally from Germany, but my english is absolutely fluent with little to no accent, thanks to a 10 month stay in the US when I was 17.

I have done an intership for Rocket Internet in Berlin recently and would now like to extend my horizon. I am an absolut multitalent when it comes to IT. I have worked in IT support, web design and some 3D-Prining(basic cad-skills with autodesk). I also can code basic stuff, little android games, some java. My greatest ressource is my open-minded character, though. I can talk to people and convince them to work with me, and I am not afraid to pitch something.

My dream would be an internship in a sv startup company for about 6 months. Is this realistic? What positions do you think could I apply to? (Obviously not development, but maybe marketing? Sales?) 

I am just looking for some information where to get started and whats realistic to expect.

Her parents are extremly muslim (more than the general) and would not accept me. Because of this her father doesnt know about my existence and her mom knows but is against it. I do not mind the fact that they might not accept me, but there are days, like for example a special ceremony before my gf internships which is a big thing (she is studying medicine), where I cannot attend because her parents are coming. I get that its hard for her but its just so tiring to always to be quiet when her family calls, beeing shushed, and not beeing able to be at the big days. I get plenty of other days though, it is a very sweet girl. But i hate my position in this, mostly because i cannot do anything :( I really feel powerless.

We have been talking about it, and i said its understandable that I could not go to the ceremony, although waiting for 2 years and not much progression with that family. But I asked her if she could promise me if I could be at her final graduation in about 2 years. She couldnt. And that made me real sad, thata I might not be able to go to one of the biggest days of my gf, because someone else might noit accept me. 2 years is a long time, and I think we should atleast be atthat point, do we ever plan to live together and have children. I would understand if her dad knows of me by then, and she would say "" anyone is welcome to join"" although he might be unfriendly, but Im sick of beeing the little secret and just wait in the shadows. 

Now we talked about it, but she cant promise anything. She got angry that I called her father behaviour lame and it kinda ended that way. So from here on its waiting again for me. But I dont wanna be in this doubt, she knows that but she wants to let it flow naturaly. Good idea, but its been 2 years, and it might be another 2 for very little progression.

Should I be more harsh about it and put my foot down&gt; should I just accept and wait?

4gtvtm,2,2016-04-28,Who am I?,one-rambling-idiot,oneramblingjournal,https://www.reddit.com/r/oneramblingjournal/comments/4gtvtm/who_am_i/,"Today was what you might call a bad day.

My name is...unimportant, I'd rather remain anonymous in this. I decided that I needed a place to vent, release the things that I bottle up before I end up a heart attack victim.

I do write fiction but this is all true. When I am me, which I will attempt to make clear, I will not lie to you.

The only exception to this is my name and some general characteristics.

I think the biggest thing I should admit now is that I am not quite alright.

Essentially I figure since no one will read this anyway that I can say what I want, air the things I won't tell others, and hopefully feel relieved.

I can say that as of right now I am a bundle of nerves on this but also...I feel that relief.

So. Me.

I am young. In my twenties.

I am educated. More than one piece of paper will corroborate that.

I am a capable individual with goals and dreams.

I am not where I thought I would be.

I do not feel like things will improve.

I am no longer capable of the facade of happiness as often as people would like it.

I am tired.

These are the things that I am, among others.

I write because it feels good. I escape in the writing. This is more or less my train of thought that helps keep the train from derailing.

Today was a bad day for me. In the middle of it I realized I needed to express that. I can no longer take these things to the people I care about and who presumably care about me. I feel that I've given them too much of my baggage and negativity. So I have you, emptiness of the internet void.

Today was a bad day because recently I heard great news.

I'm lucky. I have a very good friend, a best friend, who I've known for the vast majority of my life. Longer than some people who can read and comprehend this have even been alive.

We embarked on different paths but one things always connected us. We both wanted more. Neither of us ever made it happen but we wanted it.

I wanted to write a book, make a video game, learn a language, adventure and explore, start a business, so on.

These things I craved with an intensity reserved for mental patients. I needed it.

Then the craving would disappear because I am possibly incapable of pushing myself to achieve them (reason most likely) or other excuses I fed myself to feel better.

Money. Time. Effort. 

Wah.

This friend has been there for me. When I was, am, and will be down on myself he will listen. The world is terrible and he will let me say that as often as I need to.

(I am discouraged by my life direction and the effort I did make to get to a point that has not come to fruition after some years now, to simplify my state of mind)

This friend finished his new path and now has a new career. This within weeks of completing his program.

I'm happy, truly I am. There is no more caring, deserving, and kind-hearted person I have ever met. I wish nothing less than success for him.

I'm also angry. Angry that my path is so lost. That things have gone so wrong. That I undertake menial tasks for bare wages when I subscribed to the belief that education meant a career. I feel proven wrong.

Even after working so hard as an overworked intern of sorts, after proving myself and being promised a career (that was not delivered to a new employee but rather 2 that were near retirement). After all the work, two jobs and 60 hour weeks.

After loss. Pain. Struggle. Not the type of struggle that many endure such as war, poverty, or hunger but painful nonetheless.

Just cause there's worse shit out there doesn't mean my shit ain't shit.

So here I am.

Lost, probably depressed, angry. Dealing with one question almost every minute of every day.

Who am I?"

Unfortunately, I could only think of two references because everyone who could have vouched for my working experience was already listed as one of my former supervisors. I already interviewed for the position, and I believe the form/application the recruiter had me sign was just a formality, so it may not be held against me.

1) I've only taken 250 and 131 and 132 currently here. Reinhardt said hell be a reference for me for the cs scholarships but nelson can't cause has too many people asking. So that leaves me with only 1 cmns reference instead of 2. Do you guys have any ideas on what I should do cause I do need to apply to these scholarships. Should I just literally go ask a random cmns professor and see what happens lol? I mean I'm kind of desperate here. Any Ideas would be helpful.

2) this is actually also very important but when do companies start opening up applications for fall co op positions? I would like to intern at a software dev company this fall and want to get a leg up by applying early. I know of course every company opens their applications at different times but is generally now a good time to start researching companies or do they tend to open their fall co op positions in the summer for people to apply to? Any insight would be appreciated, especially if you yourself had a software dev internship in the fall and spring?

Thank you for your time."

As a gift to myself, I would love to travel abroad for 2 weeks sometime in August 2017. My internship will be done and I should have time before starting a job (most internships will then offer you a job, with a break between, so that would give me time for the travel.) 

My questions: I do not have a lot of money, like I said, but I figured that if I start saving now, I could at the very least go to one or two places abroad. How much money should I be putting aside, and how often? How soon should I be looking into booking flights and places to stay? What are the cheapest ways to travel abroad? 

I know this seems scattered, but I'm excited and nervous and I just hope that I can make this dream of mine a reality. Any advice from anyone, especially who have traveled abroad after graduating school, would be much appreciated! Thank you!"

What if we fondled her b4 we can understand her and we made beginning and end collapse on itself in the present? What if our future ancestors fixed this problem to make time and matter cooperate to make time stand still so we can live in perfection creation by realizing that its imperfect and consenting to that idea so we never rape time again and return to that original sin we committed in the present. What if the bible was old stories that took place between beginning and middle to learn that concept. And now that we're older and more mature we need to learn that lesson again by learning from past and future here in the moment where we committed that ultimate sin to prove that were ready for that perfect creation where we accept the shame of sin and balance it with a joke to laugh about it. This is how tragedy become comedy. Christ made it a joke so we can laugh. But now we need to learn consent. To do this we need to balance justice and liberty. This creates the 4 element consent and balance this with sin shame and joke. In this way we can express our internal intention outwardly without ever taking consent away from creation again and just enjoy all the world views and let it challenge you to grow your own world view and mature. What if this is how live in perfection. Everyone working together to good deeds just cause it's good and respecting the consent of being separate at the same time. What if this is how we work together in holy matrimony where time stands still but we're still separate and unique and every way? But consent goes both ways and we have to consent first to be pulled into eternity where it's not perfect but it's bliss and that's what makes it perfect. I don't want this knowledge but I feel I'm being forced to share it by intelligence that's hard for us to understand in the present. This is why it's so hard to communicate the truth to the present. That's why old religions seem magical and fake now this reality is becoming to fake to reject the truth. Our ancestors trapped themselves in hell and they wanted us to learn all of life's lessons about family so we know that we're ready to be born into the actual reality. Our future parents our literally asking us if we want to live or die the very thing we were arguing about at this time. They learned to appreciate our consent to chose life and intern peace and prosperity is granted and they used magical stories of old religions to teach us these lesson on the time paradox that was once hell but now serves a purpose. This is really intense knowledge to receive from the future but I know I want live and it's just a coincidence in an infinite paradox that some guy named Jesus is holding that form of consent to be born because he was the original sin the act of raping time and forgetting consent.

This overwhelming knowledge from the future is so hard to sift through and to decipher. Their great wisdom is so hard to understand and communicate. It feels like baby words pouring out of me. This is why prophets sound so crazy it's hard to be in the middle communicating future to passed. No one understands the messenger and how hard it is to bear this weight to communicate what is hard to understand to people who don't have faith enough to try to understand

Another thought opens a door to eternal knowledge and it turns into a rant that's hard to understand but it's this faith in family we have to hold on to pull us out the hell we created.

I was just trying to explain why everything sounds like a garbage poetic rant. But this time paradox plays in infinite loops just a lil different each time. One simple thought requires so much understanding and the words our hard to find in this paradox. We need to learn this concept of faith in family to be pulled out.

That's why everything seems like a coincidence here. The media always seems to predict the future before it happens. There's always magical mystery that doesn't seem real, UFOs magically appearing, these things don't really magically happen and that's the point to reveal our reality as fake so we might chose life. Time is falling on itself and all of history is exploding in our faces cause our parents want to show is this reality isn't real and they want us to choose task ever lasting life but it has to be out choice."

I am a junior in EE, and trying to identify a career path that suits my interests. I have taken a lot electives in EE (double what I need) because I am very interested in a lot of areas. The problem is I can not find jobs that incorporate my interests. I am trying to identify possible career paths for when I graduate next May.

My favorite topics so far have been board level circuit design, PCB design, firmware development (embedded C and Assembly), and DSP.

It seems when I find firmware jobs they expect an in depth education in software of C++, java, cloud stuff.... that isn't too interesting to me. Most EE jobs I find seem to be pure board level design with PCB design, but no firmware. 

Are there jobs out there that let you do board level circuits, PCB design, AND firmware (embedded C and Assembly) or are these really two separate jobs? If this is possible what are the titles called, and what companies should I look at?

For some background I have had one internship doing PCB layout, and board redesign. I have another internship this summer involving digital design with FPGAs, DSP, and firmware in C. I have taken 300 and 400 levels in Embedded Systems (assembly and C firmware), circuit design (analog and digital), and DSP (signals and systems, control systems, and filter design). I have an okay GPA of 3.15.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!

4guky7,219,2016-04-28,Got paid today and passed $100k net worth,ajswdf,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4guky7/got_paid_today_and_passed_100k_net_worth/,"[Mint stats](http://imgur.com/a/UJn5Z)

For as difficult as people make it seem, getting to $100k net worth was really easy. I'm 25 and have been working full time since August of 2013, so it was a pretty quick process getting there.

**Pre-Work**

(Skip this section if you just want the numbers without the story)

I went to Washington University in St. Louis and majored in Physics. I was always good at math and figured Physics was math that had a little more practical value. I loved the lower level course. Having a basic understanding of Physics gives you a deeper understanding of how the world around you works and trains you to analyze problems in a logical  and mathematical way. 

The problem started to come when I took more advanced courses, which were very difficult and not particularly interesting. I also discovered the life as a scientists was not as glorious as I had thought. It's very tedious work and often you're working on problems that are mind numbingly boring. And to get that glorious job you had to spend most of your 20's [getting paid less than people who do nothing](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd082109s.gif). I decided to make the shift to Computer Science.

There was just one problem, but the time I decided to switch I was a semester away from graduating (I graduated in 3 years). So I fit as many CS classes as I could before I left.

After graduation I moved back home to my parents' home in suburban KC and started working on my Masters in CS at a local university and applying for jobs. I only went to school part time so I could immediately start working if offered a job. This was the greatest part of my life so far. With so much free time, and being able to sleep in every day, it was basically a preview to FIRE.

After a year of this I had made no progress finding a job, so I started looking for internships instead. Thankfully a long time neighbor is the head of IT at the city, so I got an internship there. I was there for 2 months before deciding to start looking for a job again, and this time I got a ton of interest. I decided on a job that offered $60k a year (I negotiated up to $65k by saying that if they offered that I'd accept immediately).

**Career so far**

I've gotten very minimal raises so far, so my salary (including bonuses) has been roughly $70k for a while. After accepting my job in August of 2013, the very first thing I did was start house hunting. I had 3 main requirements:

1. The house shouldn't require any major work.

2. It should cost $75k or under.

3. It should be in the historic area of town.

I managed to find just such a house very quickly. This house had been bought as an investment and renovated shortly before the housing crash, so it was in good shape. It was also listed at $65k (which I negotiated down to $57k), and was, of course, in the historic district. The only major expense I put into the house was a $6k home energy renovation to reduce my utility bills (why they didn't properly insulate the house when they renovated it I'll never know).

I managed to pay off my house about 2 months ago, so now I'm entirely debt free. Outside of principle and interest (which I consider savings), I spend roughly $12k a year without feeling the need to spend any more. I live very comfortably. However, on top of the $12k I have spent some large sums of money, but they were always in order to save money in the longe run:

* The previously mentioned energy renovation ($6k).

* Upgrading my car to the same model but 7 years newer ($4.4k plus my old car).

* Paying off my student loans before they started charging interest ($17.5k)

* Finishing my Masters ($4k? I don't really remember)

* Paying off the house early (total of $46k if I had just done the minimum payments).

Note that all these expenses above my baseline $12k a year spending were both optional and should save me money in the long run (except the Masters). Unfortunately it left me with no investments other than my 401k.

*Path to FIRE*

With $12k spending every year, the 4% rule says I only need $300k to retire (this number doesn't include my house). It took 2.5 years to get to $100k net worth, so if everything remains the same I'd be able to retire in 7.5 years right around my 33rd birthday. 

However, now that I've accomplished one of my main financial goals (paying off my house), I can start investing my excess money and get to FIRE even quicker. I tell everybody the 35 number, but most likely it will happen well before then."
4gutho,16,2016-04-28,Candyflipping to Save My Soul (x-post from r/mdma),110mcg,Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/4gutho/candyflipping_to_save_my_soul_xpost_from_rmdma/,"My first LSD experience (https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/4de1lw/ego_death_on_100110mcg_my_first_trip/) was harrowing and ego-shattering but I knew I had to go back and see what else it had for me. Eight days later I took a little less LSD than I had my first time (when I had a tripping partner)—80-100mcg. This time I was alone but I also had a 210mg strawberry Molly tablet on hand. I hadn't decided whether or not I would take any Molly as it would be my first time and I wasn't sure I wanted to combine the two. I get a little antsy with this stuff. Maybe it's just where I am in life right now but I can't imagine doing it for “fun”. I left the option open though, as I wanted to let my higher Self guide the experience.

I have been in a deep process of difficult personal evolution the past few years , much of it arising out my facing trauma from my childhood. I went to significant trouble to do Ayahuasca two times and now acquire these Inquisition'd medicines because I was tired of all my unnecessary suffering, self-limitation, and ultimately not feeling like a totally real person with agency in the world. If you've had PTSD symptoms then you likely know what I'm talking about. I'm very functional--I work, I go to grad school, and I have a counseling internship but there remained a deep uneasiness in most personal interactions and even small everyday decisions. I knew I needed to go deeper and unlock my imprisoned self, especially if I'm going to be trying to help other people.

Anyway, I took the Acid and the come-up was very slow and gentle, unlike my first time where I got sucked into oblivion pretty quickly. Thank god for the tolerance I likely had from my first trip.

I began to feel fairly strong effects right around the 2 hour mark and then a memory bubbled up. It was a dream I had four years ago. In the dream I was lying on my Jungian analyst's couch and she was scratching my back. She said, “110mcg, what can you do to make yourself feel extraordinarily better?” I gave no answer in the dream and I never felt like I really answered the question in the subsequent years. The dream faded into the background even though I should have paid more attention to it.

Coming up on the Lucy with the pleasant sensations coursing through my body I realized that this was it. This was the answer to my dream. I crawled over to where I had the Molly at my “altar” with several candles burning. I cut the little strawberry tablet in half with my pocket knife. It now looked like a bifurcated heart and in that moment, the room, the chemicals, my mind, felt incredibly sacred, like I was taking a sacrament. LSD was the body and MDMA was the blood. I chewed up the slightly-larger-than-half tablet and embraced the bitter taste as an important part of the experience.

I lay back down on my blanket on the floor and put some music through my over the ear headphones which, by the way, are amazing for really experiencing music in times like this. About 30 minutes later I felt the first stirrings and, oddly, I thought about how this chemical had been stumbled upon all the way back in 1912, just a few years before millions of young men slaughtered each other in the trenches of WWI. I wondered if maybe those same people would have been less apt to slaughter each other if they had had access to this experience? I thought of what we might be holding back now that could prevent untold suffering in the future.

Around 10 minutes later I had another thought that was probably unoriginal but here goes: MD-ME! I realized that this was a ME medicine. This was a way to feel the self that we forget and repress to get along with our parents, society, crappy friends, culture, etc. Trauma takes us away from being a real ME but Molly gently but firmly removes those barriers.

It's hard to quantify what happened in the next few hours on the floor but I felt like I gave birth to a more full and realized self. The self that couldn't fully incarnate into the world due to a terrible upbringing and subsequent clinging to that dysfunction. I remembered ME. The parts of me that I feel are inconvenient to others, the parts of me I killed or maimed to get along with my abusive parents and Christian school, and the child who never got to feel truly happy.

I also had the profound experience of really, truly realizing that I can say NO to people. This may sound silly or simple, but for someone like me this realization helped to topple some of the false edifices of my personality. I don't always have to be agreeable or a helper. I don't have to be a good little boy. I was not put here to save other people. I knew this intellectually, but in these few hours these sorts of realization sprang up from a neglected part of my larger self.

During this experience I fell in love with myself again. Not in a narcissistic way, but in a way that means I don't have so much of an inner dictator censoring me anymore and there is love and spontaneity circulating through my being like invisible blood. That dictator (picture him as a 5 year old combo of Hitler and Stalin) really just needed to feel deep, true joy.

Despite some of the trip reports I'd read, I felt no need to get in touch with other people while on the Molly or even dance. I was content to lie on the floor and stare up at the ceiling in wonder, much like an infant would. The music I had carefully chosen beforehand felt like part of my birthing process. The music energized and infused the new green shoots of my freedom.

This happened a few weeks ago and I've had struggles since then, including a second Molly/Lucy combo that was very difficult but ultimately another victorious piece of this rebuilding I'm doing. I'll post that one a bit later. Everything is not perfectly better as it felt in this experience but now in subsequent weeks I am so much more willing to be myself in every situation. I find myself inhabiting my body differently and being more aware of when I shrink back and my inner child dictator tries to take over. The universe has also given me several opportunities to say big NO's to people and groups of people and I have done that with so much more courage than before.

I'll end this with a quote from Aldous Huxley as I think it sums up what entheogens like this can do for the world and I hope that all of you who roll, will, each time, remember and collect some forgotten part of yourself. The world needs that, and maybe we can avoid the next great cataclysm if we consciously use these chemicals. “The arhat and the quietist may not practice contemplation in its fullness; but if they practice it at all, they may bring back enlightening reports of another, a transcendent country of the mind; and if they practice it in the height, they will become conduits through which some beneficent influence can flow out of that other country into a world of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack of it. “

Me[23M]",mrconfused324,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4guvvm/my_boyfriend_21_m_of_1_year_has_yet_to_come_out/,"rMy boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year, and he has yet to come out to his parents and told them we're dating. I've never straight up told him that he needs to do it, but I've tried telling him how much better he would feel after he opens up. I've told my entire family, and things are much better because of it. 


Normally, this wouldn't be a big issue; however, because he hasn't come out to his family he's very cautious with me whenever we're out in public. He doesn't hold my hand or show any affection at all. The other day, I put my hand around his waist at the grocery store and he pulled away from me. I wasn't expected such a reaction, and it really hurt. 


We were best friends for about a year before we started dating, so his parents know me quite well. They've basically already adopted me as another son, as they've told me they want to claim me on their taxes(lol). At the end of the day, his parents already know about us he just hasn't told them himself. I understand how difficult it is to come out to your parents, but with this situation I see it being a lot easier than most. I mean, his parents are paying me to go on vacation with them this summer... So, I really don't think they would take this ""news"" very hard. His parents were near my hometown recently and even reached out to my parents, and they got dinner together! While my parents know, they still didn't say anything as they understand that my boyfriend should come out to his parents on his own. 


In a few months, he'll be moving in with me in my ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. His parents are fully aware of it, and are even going to help pay part of the rent (as he's still in college and staying with me for an internship nearby).


I hate talking to him about it, because I understand that it's a very personal thing and should be done on your own time. However, the thing that bothers me most is that whenever we're not behind closed doors, he will treat me more as his best friend than his boyfriend. 


I think that he really struggles with his own identity too, as this whole being gay thing is still kind of new to him. However, we basically came out together so it's just as new to each of us. I've told him that he needs to focus on himself, and be happy with himself, before he tries to make anyone else happy. Which is difficult while I'm the one that he's trying to make happy. 


I know this a lot and can be confusing, but I've been struggling with this for a while and don't know what to do. Not sure to talk to him about it(or what to say if I do), or just let time pass and see how it goes. I feel like I've been patient with him and really don't know where to go from here. Any advice is appreciated.


I forgot to mention that his older brother(24) is fully aware of the situation, and accepts us completely. We hang out with him and his girlfriend pretty often. Their Dad once asked the older brother if we were in a relationship, but he just said that he wasn't sure, even though he knew the truth. It wasn't his place to out his brother. The older brother and I have talked about it and he believes that his parents would have no problem with it.



   
**tl;dr**: His parents have a good hint for our relationship, but he still has yet to tell him. He treats me more like a best friend than a boyfriend in public because he's afraid of who will see. What do I do?"

I am a Los Angeles based producer at a company that has just successfully created a Film Fund to make 6-9 low-budget Indie Films. I have earned the exciting task of seeking out scripts and directors, as well as passionate crew filmmakers as well. I plan to post regularly as we hope to tackle these projects over the next three years. I would love to start a dialogue about how we could get the most from each other. I of course am scouting talented storytellers and if you are local to Los Angeles looking for talented filmmakers to fill out our crews. 

Current Opportunities:
Our company is currently accepting internships for summer students with college credit. We have a Television Network Image Campaign shooting on 4 major stages the week of May 23rd and will then go into Pre-Production on the first film of our slate that is due to start shooting the first week of July. This will be a great opportunity to experience a large television shoot as well as get insight into the world of Independent Filmmaking as you will participate in the process with a Sundance, Gotham, and Independent Spirit Award Winning Company.

Our company is also accepting resumes for local Los Angeles Location Scouts for our first feature set to film in July. We would like to find an enthusiastic scout who is familiar with Indie Film budgets to spend 3-5 days in search of possible locations for our main location. 

On-Going Opportunities:
If you are a scriptwriter with a Low-Budget concept we may be interested in reading your script. We are seeking genre scripts of the horror/sci-fi/thriller/contained action that can be filmed on a low budget in the Southern California area. 

If you are an experienced director with a script in development, I would be interested in starting a dialogue and seeing your reel and experience as well as a pitch about what your project is. We are still searching for 3-4 more projects to fill our slate

Finally, I would also like to be able to be a source of information about Independent Film and hopefully gain a bit of a social following behind our projects because my one of my first lessons is, “No one will see your film if no one knows about your film” What are things that I could provide r/Filmmakers with. I can do AMA’s with specific crew members, Once we are into casting we can share live streams of table reads and rehearsals and directing insights but I would like to here from the source what I can provide this community. 

I hired my first Redditor from Filmmakers last week and we are 1/1. You’re the man Dodge.

TL;DR
I am an indie filmmaker with a few upcoming projects and with funding for more. What are the best ways we can benefit from each other?

4gvbvr,0,2016-04-28,Internship Advice please?,throwawaycuzyeahob,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4gvbvr/internship_advice_please/,"Throw away due to specific companies could identify my city/school. Okay so this fall I'm going to be interviewing for an internship. I'll intern that spring then graduate with a bachelor's the following spring. My goal was to just get my bachelor's then work full time and slowly get my master's with that job providing tuition reimbursement. 

Fast forward to now I'm networking allot and trying to have connections with every possible company here. Right now the best connection I have is with EY. I know 5 of their hiring team on a name to name basis through networking. They really liked me. The issue is EY (as you know) only hires if you're CPA eligible. EY is the only Big Four company in my city. However there's Grant Thornton and BKD too who both have similar requirements. Besides that there's Koch Industries (private,) various staff accountant positions, and one regional accounting firm that will hire before CPA eligibility. It is the biggest accounting firm in my city. But it's only in this city. So I worry if it would be a short sided decision and not be productive for my future. EY would be the best option for my future career in accounting. 

But I'm kind of struggling wrapping my head around getting a master's. I know in the long run it'd be the better option. But I feel like I'm struggling with this for a couple of reasons. 

1. I grew up really poor. I've always been really poor. I'm honestly tired of being poor. I just want more and I'm tired of waiting. I had someone show me this.
www.playspent.org 
And so much of it describes my whole life. 

2. I'm afraid to get more loans. It took allot of me to get loans initially for college. If I take the internship at EY this upcoming spring (I really think I will get it) I'll have to find a new job for a semester until I get my bachelors. Then try to find a better job for a year while I get my master's that would hopefully pay tuition reimbursement. Graduate Assistant-ships at my school would also be an option since they waive the tuition fee for it. But I'm scared to just hope for that and not get it until it's too late.

3. I'm really miserable in college. I've hated school since pre-k. I just know it's not for me. Thankfully, I've never struggled academically. I just struggle emotionally through it allot. 


Soooo does anyone have any advice? It'd definitely be appreciated. This is relevant now because my official interviews for the internship is next semester and if I go with EY then I won't have another chance to interview for a firm that doesn't need CPA eligibility before I graduate. 

TLDR; Need to decide to settle for accounting job that doesn't require CPA eligibility or to keep trekking and work for the best opportunity I can get"
4gvddd,0,2016-04-28,Two Internships Concurrently: Need Advice,21cinemaclub,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4gvddd/two_internships_concurrently_need_advice/,"So I have a full time software engineering internship lined up for this summer in my hometown and I'm very happy about it. I also just recently heard back from a research lab at a very prestigious national hospital system and they want me to start interning with them part time this summer and through my senior year (I'll earn credit for this)

In addition, the lab is ok with me completing my work remotely ""sometimes but would like me in every now and then.""

So I'm wondering if it will look bad (assuming I can perform both job responsibilities well) to do both internships and have them listed on my resume with the same starting month? Would future interviewers ask why I did both? Does it look like I didn't work hard on the full time one if after work I work on the lab work?

Thanks for any input!"

4gvgh5,555,2016-04-28,My friend [22F] found out about how much money I'm [21F] making this summer and now she's being passive aggressive about it,CompSciPuppy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gvgh5/my_friend_22f_found_out_about_how_much_money_im/,"I work in a very high paying STEM field. I'm a junior in college and I've been blessed to have found one of the top internships in my field this summer, which coincidentally also pays a LOT of money. I worked super hard to get this. I applied to over 110 companies in 3 months, slaved away at internship applications, and practiced for hours every week making sure I aced my interview. It was hell.

I have a lot of pressure on me to succeed. My parents are both immigrants and my dad has a terminal disease. I am reminded weekly about how as the eldest daughter that I should be ready to financially care for my younger siblings once he passes. So when I got this internship both my parents cried from happiness. We never really had that much money before.

I told my friend Casey, who is a year older than me, about my internship. I didn't tell her my salary or anything, just how happy I was. She was very nice and congratulatory about it... Well, until...

She found a list of top companies salaries for internships. My company was on there. She took a screenshot and sent it to me, saying, ""This is so excessive."" and ""I've never made that much money in an entire summer"" and ""How is this real?"" and ""This isn't fair, all you guys do is sit in front of a computer all day.""

I'm honestly baffled because although I know it is a large sum of money I never really bragged about it and am just excited to have gotten it at all. In fact Casey last summer was bragging to me about how much she's made. I feel like she's being very rude, but I don't know how to address this. I haven't responded yet to her texts about it.

**TL;DR** My friend found out about how much I'm making this summer at my STEM internship and is being passive aggressive and kind of nasty about it. I want to stand up for myself but honestly I have never had money before in my life so I simply don't know how to respond..."

4gvoqd,89,2016-04-28,My award-winning research paper that has won me several acclaimed scholarships originated from an idea I had after accidentally taking 4 ultrapotent pot brownies.,CoconutGod,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/4gvoqd/my_awardwinning_research_paper_that_has_won_me/,"[Light], but very long.

**Disclaimer:** I am not condoning the use of psychoactive substances. I frankly don’t even enjoy them and I am not promoting drug use in any way. This is just an interesting anecdote that I want to share because of its bizarre nature.
 
 
That being said, those of you that have taken any edibles know that they totally mess with your mind and simple functions often become very difficult to do, even on a single “special brownie”. Before this incident, I hadn’t interacted with any drug in over a year (drug testing for undergrad internships) so my tolerance to basically EVERYTHING was extremely low.
 
So, I come home on a Friday evening after a hard day of studying and working in my campus research lab. Like every Friday, I’m just completely burnt out from the week, want to relax, and play some Fallout or something. I had also just had my drug test for this summer internship position and there was a party that my best friend (let’s call him Ben) was having that night which I had been looking forward to, where there was probably going to be joints being passed around. Needless to say, it was looking like a great Friday night. That is, until Ben’s girlfriend asked me to find some pot brownies for the party tonight.
 
So I’ve taken edibles maybe…twice in my life? And both times, I had relatively small doses to where I could barely feel anything at all during the high. I’ve never bought any edibles or any drugs at all, I have no idea how they work, and I might as well be a pot brownie virgin. After a lot of networking and asking around, I finally found this dude (“Shane”) that lived downtown who had just baked a fresh batch (is that what they’re called, “batches”?) and was willing to sell me the entire tray. I pooled money in from my inner circle of friends and went to Shane’s apartment with Ben.
 
Sidenote: the apartment was NICE. It was a penthouse in one of the tallest highrises in downtown, and this place looked straight out of an IKEA catalog. Everything looked extremely sleek and expensive, and you could tell that this dude was making a killing. Shane didn’t seem to be home, but his girlfriend Rae was there and had 20 brownies waiting for us in one of those cute glass Betty Crocker cake stands. Ben pays her, we take the brownies and start heading out. Me being the naïve lightweight I am, I ask what a good dose would be and Rae tells us that each brownie is pretty weak so 3-4 would do the trick. Ben nods and we head out.
 
So we get back to Ben’s place, and the party has already started. Our friends have come over, bottles have started opening, and we’re having a good time. Ben brings out the tray of brownies for the inner circle and we all take about two each to start off. Party continues and we’re still having a good time after about an hour, but I’m not drinking because I don’t want to get carried away and I have to get up early tomorrow for lab. Ben, Ben’s girlfriend and the girl I was talking to have started to feel it, but I am 100% sober and clear.
 
So it’s almost midnight at this point, ~2 hours after we took the brownies. People are just starting to leave and the party is dying down. Out of the 7 people that had eaten the brownies, 6 were feeling the full effects and I was still completely sober. I didn’t really know what it was supposed to feel and I asked Ben about it, who in turn advised me to “take two more” just in case even though I had to get up in 8 hours for work. I thought the effects of the extra two would kick in fast, and I take two more after almost everybody has left the party.
 
Ben asks me if I’ll be okay if he leaves for a bit to drop his girlfriend home. What’s the worst that could happen? I say sure and they leave, leaving me alone in his apartment with his roommate who is sleeping in the other room. I still don’t feel anything, so I’m just watching Netflix and drinking some orange juice like everything is okay. Then, I get a pretty overdue text from Shane telling me that Rae had given us the wrong batch of brownies; the ones that he was supposed to give us were about 4x less potent and our highly-potent tray was supposed to be for somebody else. He seemed to be panicking a lot and asking me how many we had eaten, but I was reassuring him that I still hadn’t felt anything…and that’s when I felt something.
 
In /r/trees terms, I was at a [12] after about 15 minutes of taking the last brownie. It literally felt like I had been hit by a car and couldn’t get up. If you’ve seen The Wolf of Wall Street, it was like that scene where Leonardo DiCaprio takes those super-Quaaludes and is crawling around the country club, except that country club was Ben’s living room rug. I was zoning in and out of consciousness, grunting, and had almost convinced myself several times that I could die at any minute. This went on for about 30 minutes, until Ben finally came back and helped me up onto the couch. He seemed to be feeling the effects too, but not nearly as badly as I was.
 
Eventually, I regained bodily control and went to the bathroom. Pissed all over Ben’s toilet seat and floor because I could not aim correctly and was having such vivid hallucinations that I might as well been blind, but we cleaned it up. I wasn’t in any shape to walk the mile back to my apartment, so Ben offered to drive me back and I was able stop grunting for a minute to mouth a “yes”.
 
I got back to my apartment and was feeling a lot better. Ben was there too, and we just talked for a bit – you know, spacey “stoner talk” about weird National Geographic-type topics. We’re both engineering majors and I’m doing research in alternative chemical energy, so the topic of the energy crisis comes up pretty quickly. It was actually pretty nerdy, just two dudes talking about sustainability and shit at 2 AM on a Friday night. Everything Ben is saying seems super profound and earth-shattering because I am absolutely out of my mind, so I’m writing all this stuff down on my phone to ask my research coordinator about in the morning. One important topic that we brought up was, as juvenile as it sounds, using our own urine as a fuel source. I’ll spare you guys the science-y talk, but I had been thinking about that for a while and it just…clicked somehow. I could visualize the process in my head and I knew exactly what to do. I was absolutely stoked, Ben eventually leaves when I am able to stop crawling around like a toddler, and I go to bed.
 
I wasn’t able to ask my coordinator about those questions because I didn’t wake up the next day until 6 PM. I came in on Monday though, apologized, and pitched her some of the ideas that Ben and I had talked about – she initially just laughed and asked me if I was drunk, but eventually understood what I was poking at after some thought and explanation from me. She and my dean gave me approval to work on an MFC urine conversion bioprocess, and I started work the very next day.
 
 
 
**Fast forward about 4 months**

My undergrad research paper is complete and had been submitted for publishing. I receive two coveted research grants from my school to continue investigation into biomass energy sources, and I’m fortunate enough to even bag a $10,000 scholarship from Chevron. My paper has been passed all around the chemical engineering department and professors are cosigning me left and right. I’m even going to a research conference in Pennsylvania this summer as a rep from my university to present my research to some of the world’s greatest inventors. But, for as much praise and attention as I am getting from people, it just seem really odd that nobody has a fucking clue that the idea for my defining research only came to me  because Shane messed up my pot brownie order. 

Well, nobody had a clue until now that I’ve come clean about it. Thanks for reading my story!

I never really put too much thought about what I would do with it or where I would go, always just assumed I would find myself along the way. I kept at it not because I loved it but because I was moderately good at it and could get by in my classes without much effort. Now I'm a year away from entering the ""real world"", working a shitty IT job that I hate, with no real professional programming skills. Deep down I know I'll end up in IT for the rest of my life, simply because it's easy and I do it well.  

And at this point, there's nothing I can do. I'm 20k in debt, 12 credits left to take, and no real options left. I secretly loathe my friends who are doing what they love and have awesome internships and having a ton of fun. I walked through my schools art gallery during a student exhibit and saw all these great creations that students poured themselves into to make and were now proudly showing off. Just seeing everyone so happy and confident in what they're doing makes me feel comparatively empty. 

I just wish I thought about these things before I dove in. My advice to anyone starting college soon, I know you hear it a lot, but think long and hard. If you don't absolutely love what you're doing after a semester or two - get out.

I'm honestly worried what my future holds. Guess I'm gonna find out either way."

4gvyg4,9,2016-04-28,Should I sue my employer for pregnancy discrimination,Thepinkflamingo328,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4gvyg4/should_i_sue_my_employer_for_pregnancy/,"TLDR: Fired for foul language even though EVERYONE uses it in my workplace, including my boss. Blamed it on my pregnancy saying that the hormones have affected me in a way that he cannot control and cannot have me in the restaurant. I was suspended without pay until after the baby was born (6 weeks prior to due date), and then later terminated (3 weeks prior to due date). Should I sue for discrimination?

So I am 38 weeks pregnant. But when this all started, I was 33 weeks pregnant. Lets start there. 

I had an argument with an employee, not in my department, that stated he was refusing to follow an order I had just given him. I gave him the instructions at his work station then returned to my office. I was training the girl who would be replacing me while I was out on maternity leave. After giving the instructions, the employee came to my office about an hour or so later stating he was not going to follow what I told him to do. I should have written him up, but as he was in my office, uninvited, telling me what he was going to do and not do, I just felt myself snap. I told him he was being childish and immature. I raised my voice to him while arguing back and forth over the policy. He immediately went and told my boss about the situation. I called my boss later on that evening. He asked that we both write up incident reports about the situation. I continued to work my normal work week. 

The week following the argument, my boss suspended me without pay. Below is what he said to me while issuing the suspension. 

1. My supervisor said he told the employee that I argued with, “You can’t control what is going through Nicole with the pregnancy.”

2. I was told, by my supervisor that, “Your pregnancy has affected you. It’s affected you to the point that I can’t have you around my people. I can’t trust you in the state you’re in.”
 

3. My supervisor said, “Here is the decision we have made. You have two choices. I don’t want you coming back to work until after the baby is born. You can be suspended until after the baby is born or you can be suspended for a week and then your doctor puts you on medical leave. I can’t afford right now to take a chance… there is something going through your body, I can’t control this.” What authority does my employer have to make assumptions about my pregnancy health? I am not on bed rest. I am physically able to still be working.. 

I have voice-recorded evidence of all of these statements. If that is not proof enough that discrimination has taken place, there is also another incident, similar to mine that took place just two days prior. 

4. A male employee called a female employee a “fucking hooker.” The female employee reported it to my boss, and he addressed the incident with the male employee. No further disciplinary action was taken. He worked his normal scheduled work hours that week. Two days later is when my incident occurred for which I am being suspended.  How can I be suspended for using foul language for 6 weeks, when in the same time frame, another incident occurs and no more than a verbal warning is given. It seems that my employer took advantage of this argument and had used it as a convenient way to dismiss me. 

My supervisor claims that I am held to a higher standard, as an officer of the company, and that is why my punishment for foul language was so severe.  I disagree, as our policy book that I signed does not differentiate between employee rank in the company. Also, I have a voice recording between my supervisor and I where he berates me. I am not treated as an officer of the company by my direct superior, and therefore do not feel I am held to a higher standard. 

Further more, when first notifying of my employer of my pregnancy, around 6 weeks gestation, he asked “Is it ""bobs"" or ""sams""?” ""Sam"" was a summer intern who left 3 weeks prior to my pregnancy, and ""Bob"" is a student intern who returned to work 2 weeks prior to my pregnancy. On July 4th, my boss told an entry level employee that he was not paying for me to flirt with ""Sam"". The rumor spread through the restaurant and came back to me as “I’m not paying for her to have an affair.” No clarification of this rumor ever came to light. My Boss says he said “flirt” The employee he spoke to said he used the word affair. 

I have since been terminated from my job. During termination, my boss pulled out 6 write ups for various offences that I had NEVER seen before, dating back over a year prior. He asked me to sign them and I refused as I did not agree with him on most of the write ups, and believe that he wrote them up during the time he suspended me and fired me. 

Should I sue for pregnancy discrimination or should I let it go.

4gw552,159,2016-04-28,My award-winning research paper that has won me several acclaimed scholarships originated from an idea I had after accidentally taking 4 ultrapotent pot brownies.,CoconutGod,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/4gw552/my_awardwinning_research_paper_that_has_won_me/,"[Light], but very long.

**Disclaimer:** I am not condoning the use of psychoactive substances. I frankly don’t even enjoy them and I am not promoting drug use in any way. This is just an interesting anecdote that I want to share because of its bizarre nature.

That being said, those of you that have taken any edibles know that they totally mess with your mind and simple functions often become very difficult to do, even on a single “special brownie”. Before this incident, I hadn’t interacted with any drug in over a year (drug testing for undergrad internships) so my tolerance to basically EVERYTHING was extremely low.

So, I come home on a Friday evening after a hard day of studying and working in my campus research lab. Like every Friday, I’m just completely burnt out from the week, want to relax, and play some Fallout or something. I had also just had my drug test for this summer internship position and there was a party that my best friend (let’s call him Ben) was having that night which I had been looking forward to, where there was probably going to be joints being passed around. Needless to say, it was looking like a great Friday night. That is, until Ben’s girlfriend asked me to find some pot brownies for the party tonight.

So I’ve taken edibles maybe…twice in my life? And both times, I had relatively small doses to where I could barely feel anything at all during the high. I’ve never bought any edibles or any drugs at all, I have no idea how they work, and I might as well be a pot brownie virgin. After a lot of networking and asking around, I finally found this dude (“Shane”) that lived downtown who had just baked a fresh batch (is that what they’re called, “batches”?) and was willing to sell me the entire tray. I pooled money in from my inner circle of friends and went to Shane’s apartment with Ben.

Sidenote: the apartment was NICE. It was a penthouse in one of the tallest highrises in downtown, and this place looked straight out of an IKEA catalog. Everything looked extremely sleek and expensive, and you could tell that this dude was making a killing. Shane didn’t seem to be home, but his girlfriend Rae was there and had 20 brownies waiting for us in one of those cute glass Betty Crocker cake stands. Ben pays her, we take the brownies and start heading out. Me being the naïve lightweight I am, I ask what a good dose would be and Rae tells us that each brownie is pretty weak so 3-4 would do the trick. Ben nods and we head out.

So we get back to Ben’s place, and the party has already started. Our friends have come over, bottles have started opening, and we’re having a good time. Ben brings out the tray of brownies for the inner circle and we all take about two each to start off. Party continues and we’re still having a good time after about an hour, but I’m not drinking because I don’t want to get carried away and I have to get up early tomorrow for lab. Ben, Ben’s girlfriend and the girl I was talking to have started to feel it, but I am 100% sober and clear.

So it’s almost midnight at this point, ~2 hours after we took the brownies. People are just starting to leave and the party is dying down. Out of the 7 people that had eaten the brownies, 6 were feeling the full effects and I was still completely sober. I didn’t really know what it was supposed to feel and I asked Ben about it, who in turn advised me to “take two more” just in case even though I had to get up in 8 hours for work. I thought the effects of the extra two would kick in fast, and I take two more after almost everybody has left the party.

Ben asks me if I’ll be okay if he leaves for a bit to drop his girlfriend home. What’s the worst that could happen? I say sure and they leave, leaving me alone in his apartment with his roommate who is sleeping in the other room. I still don’t feel anything, so I’m just watching Netflix and drinking some orange juice like everything is okay. Then, I get a pretty overdue text from Shane telling me that Rae had given us the wrong batch of brownies; the ones that he was supposed to give us were about 4x less potent and our highly-potent tray was supposed to be for somebody else. He seemed to be panicking a lot and asking me how many we had eaten, but I was reassuring him that I still hadn’t felt anything…and that’s when I felt something.

In /r/trees terms, I was at a [12] after about 15 minutes of taking the last brownie. It literally felt like I had been hit by a car and couldn’t get up. If you’ve seen The Wolf of Wall Street, it was like that scene where Leonardo DiCaprio takes those super-Quaaludes and is crawling around the country club, except that country club was Ben’s living room rug. I was zoning in and out of consciousness, grunting, and had almost convinced myself several times that I could die at any minute. This went on for about 30 minutes, until Ben finally came back and helped me up onto the couch. He seemed to be feeling the effects too, but not nearly as badly as I was.

Eventually, I regained bodily control and went to the bathroom. Pissed all over Ben’s toilet seat and floor because I could not aim correctly and was having such vivid hallucinations that I might as well been blind, but we cleaned it up. I wasn’t in any shape to walk the mile back to my apartment, so Ben offered to drive me back and I was able stop grunting for a minute to mouth a “yes”.

I got back to my apartment and was feeling a lot better. Ben was there too, and we just talked for a bit – you know, spacey “stoner talk” about weird National Geographic-type topics. We’re both engineering majors and I’m doing research in alternative chemical energy, so the topic of the energy crisis comes up pretty quickly. It was actually pretty nerdy, just two dudes talking about sustainability and shit at 2 AM on a Friday night. Everything Ben is saying seems super profound and earth-shattering because I am absolutely out of my mind, so I’m writing all this stuff down on my phone to ask my research coordinator about in the morning. One important topic that we brought up was, as juvenile as it sounds, using our own urine as a fuel source. I’ll spare you guys the science-y talk, but I had been thinking about that for a while and it just…clicked somehow. I could visualize the process in my head and I knew exactly what to do. I was absolutely stoked, Ben eventually leaves when I am able to stop crawling around like a toddler, and I go to bed.

I wasn’t able to ask my coordinator about those questions because I didn’t wake up the next day until 6 PM. I came in on Monday though, apologized, and pitched her some of the ideas that Ben and I had talked about – she initially just laughed and asked me if I was drunk, but eventually understood what I was poking at after some thought and explanation from me. She and my dean gave me approval to work on an MFC urine conversion bioprocess, and I started work the very next day.

**Fast forward about 4 months**

My undergrad research paper is complete and had been submitted for publishing. I receive two coveted research grants from my school to continue investigation into biomass energy sources, and I’m fortunate enough to even bag a $10,000 scholarship from Chevron. My paper has been passed all around the chemical engineering department and professors are cosigning me left and right. I’m even going to a research conference in Pennsylvania this summer as a rep from my university to present my research to some of the world’s greatest inventors. But, for as much praise and attention as I am getting from people, it just seem really odd that nobody has a fucking clue that the idea for my defining research only came to me because Shane messed up my pot brownie order. 

Well, nobody had a clue until now that I’ve come clean about it. Thanks for reading my story!

**TL;DR: Took too many pot brownies one night, accidentally solved the energy crisis.**"

  I've really loved the texture on the Secret Denim, and when I retire these, I'm very tempted to purchase a new pair to start all over again.  

The wear on this pair went from super hairy and neppy, all the way to this hazy beige weft color and vintagecast indigo color. The fit is a lot roomier than my previous pairs, but I think that it suits the more vintage coloring well.

4gwenc,3,2016-04-28,2.7 GPA in Computer Engineering - What graduate schools can I get into?,gradarch,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4gwenc/27_gpa_in_computer_engineering_what_graduate/,"I have a 2.7 GPA. My major GPA is probably less. My planned specialisation is computer architecture. I got a C- in my Computer Architecture and Organisation class. I have 0 research experience. I have 0 publications. [My university](https://www.aus.edu) is ranked ~400 worldwide. (I'm American so I'm thinking about applying to US universities for masters)

I'm starting to toy with the idea doing a masters now. Universities like MIT or UT Austin are out of the question. I *could* ask professors if I could assist them with research (if their doing any) over the summer and into the fall although I don't think there's time to publish anything with my name.

Industry likes internships and projects. Academia likes research and publications. I'd have to decline the internship offer that I'll receive soon (I have a verbal offer already) to do research. I have to decide soon. So...

What are the chances of me getting into one of the less selective computer engineering grad schools (e.g. University of Virginia) assuming I get a little research under my belt? Is it worth attempting with my lack of qualifications? Should I just stick with my internship forget about grad school?

Oh and letters of recommendation probably aren't an issue. Most of my professors think I'm smart because I go to programming contests and hackathons and stuff.

_______________________________________

As for why I'm suddenly considering grad school.

This spring semester I've done really well especially in the course that computer architecture was a prerequisite for(advanced digital system design [mainly verilog]). I'm actually kind of enjoying assignments and I'm expecting mostly As. I've also been reading a lot about computer architecture both at a high level and lower technical level (if that makes sense). I think I've plugged a lot of the gaps in my knowledge. So I'd like to work in something related to designing chips but apparently its a [really hard](https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-become-a-computer-architect/answer/Dan-Zhang-1?srid=7myq) field to get into without a masters. Intel has 3.0 cutoff too anyway.

So basically as I started to work harder on my coursework I grew more interested in computer architecture."
4gwfre,257,2016-04-28,[Let's Play Family] A recap on the drama within The Creatures fanbase,trevtron07,roosterteeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/4gwfre/lets_play_family_a_recap_on_the_drama_within_the/,"So, if you have been following the Creatures since the acquisition by Let's Play, your head is probably spinning concerning the drama that has been surrounding them recently. So here's a quick recap.

* For the majority of the Hub channel's lifespan, which was the channel for all the Creature content, there were many Creatures (SSoHPKC/Seamus, ImmortalHD/Aleks, Kootra/Jordan, DanzNews/Dan, UberHaxorNova/James, GoldenBlackHawk/Kevin, SlyFoxHound/Sly, and DexterManning/Dex) and a couple of interns (Intern Joe, Aron, Spencer) hired.
* After Creatures started to leave the company for personal reasons that had nothing to do with the companies business decisions, (Kevin and Sly) the interns/employees took the spotlight from them and the fans of the channel started to get a little mad, asking for Creatures that weren't currently in the office to be in more videos.
* For a while, the Hub channel consisted of live action videos where the interns and the Creatures would just fuck around in the office. Whether it be things they bought (rubber band guns, a whip, etc.) or toys they wanted to review, gameplay videos took a backseat. The latter involved a lot of destruction, whether it be the toys or the office itself. It got to a point where it was happening in a good majority of the videos and it got tiresome. Fans asked for more gameplay and less live action/destruction, and even though they got it, there was very little communication between the company and the fans on the issue.
* The company hired an intern named Aron to put work into a website and then completely abandoned it. This was even five months before the acquisition by Let's Play. 
* One member, Seamus, got sick with various illnesses throughout 2015 and stopped appearing on the Hub completely. There was almost no communication between the fans and the Creatures on his condition or his timeframe to come back to the channel, and eventually he just left the channel anyway when he got better.
* Another member, Dex,  left and vocalized his position, feeling stifled by the business aspect of the company and feeling like it got too overbearing on him. It became clear through his video that the Creatures tried to change him into something more politically correct and PG-13.
* The Creatures channel and the Creatures themselves stayed quiet about these issues and didn't communicate with the fans on most occasions. They let these issues fester and didn't address them.
* The most recent addition to the drama is that James and Aleks have left the Creatures with Intern Joe and Aron (and Trevor) and are now working fully on their new channel Cow Chop. 

Cow Chop is a part of Let's Play but is now no longer a part of The Creatures. It is not funded by Rooster Teeth or The Creatures and came directly out of James' pocket. Cow Chop and The Creatures will both be at RTX and Let's Play Live, but seperately. And now that James, Aleks, Intern Joe, and Aron have left the Creatures, this now leaves two original Creatures and four employees for the company. Jordan and Dan as the last two Creatures, and Stefani, Artist Joe, Alex, and Spencer as the last employees.

There's a very basic summary. Hopefully the mods don't remove this for first rule.

You can go to [The Creatures' subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/thecreatures) or the [Cow Chop subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cowchop) if you have questions or want more insight on what's happening.

School is ending really soon and I don't even know what to do this summer. At this point, since Junior year internship is so important, and if this years recruiting is any indication I feel so screwed for full time employment next year.

Furthermore my immigration status is really making things uncertain for me. I am from a poor immigrant family, so much so that I qualified for enough aid to go to school for free (which I am really great full for).

4gwm2v,13,2016-04-28,Tales to Terrify is less than thrilled about their Hugo Nomination,generalvostok,TorInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorInAction/comments/4gwm2v/tales_to_terrify_is_less_than_thrilled_about/,"I received the below in my email today. It's a bit disappointing that they see us in this way. Tales to Terrify is a damn fine podcast and Larry Santoro was the best podcaster I've ever heard.

&gt;Hello everyone. Tony C. Smith here, founder and editor-in-chief of the District of Wonders podcast network, which includes StarShipSofa, Far-Fetched Fables, and Tales to Terrify.

&gt;You may remember that StarShipSofa won a Hugo Award back in 2010. We were so proud, back then. We were new on the WorldCon scene, but we learned pretty quick about how these awards work – and how they’re supposed to work. We are, as we were then, so proud of our Hugo Award, but we were even more proud to be a part of the science fiction community. To this day, we are just so appreciative of all of our supporters, and the many excellent podcasts that have been Hugo winners and nominees since.

&gt;Just yesterday, we learned that Tales to Terrify was nominated for the Hugo for Best Fancast. We were completely surprised, and so thrilled! Tales to Terrify produces excellent horror fiction every week and has a very strong following. It’s also a sentimental favourite for many – the living legacy of our beloved original host, the late Lawrence Santoro (1944-2014), carried on under the very capable leadership of Host Stephen Kilpatrick and Submissions Editors Scott Silk, Philip Oldham and intern Laura Nealis.

&gt;For a few sweet hours, we thought this nomination would have made Larry proud.

&gt;Then, just yesturday, we found out that Tales to Terrify was one of the fancasts on the Rabid Puppies slate. To be honest, it was like the whole thing turned into a real-life horror story. Something to make our most stalwart listener’s blood run cold.

&gt;Still reeling from the sheer shock and disappointment, we just wanted to let our listeners and the science fiction community know that we did not know we were on the Rabid Puppies slate. We would never agree to be on their slate. We have never agreed with either the Sad or Rabid Puppies, or their ideas about what science fiction should be and who should write it, or their bullying tactics. We do not support the Puppies’ attempts to ruin the Hugo Awards. We are disgusted that we were drawn into their ugliness without our knowledge. In the words of someone close to Tales to Terrify, “this has been like being presented a polished turd.”

&gt;We’re all sickened by it. Tales to Terrify and the entire District of Wonders has always (and will always) celebrate a diverse range of voices, be they authors, narrators, or editors. We do not agree on shutting anyone out or any form of discrimination.

&gt;Larry Santoro put so much into the podcast. The entire community adored him – he was a powerhouse and the rock on which the podcast stood. It crushed us all when he passed. Tales to Terrify being on the Rabid Puppies list like this threatens to dishonour his reputation and everything he built the podcast to be. If Larry were around today I’d want him to be proud of what we’ve accomplished. And the Rabid Puppies want to tear that down and disrespect his memory. And it sickens me. It sickens everyone of us.
Last year, these Puppies peed all over so many Award categories, and the biggest winner was “no award” – whether there were deserving nominees on the ballot or not. So much of the joy was just taken out of the Hugos for so many… What the Puppies did wasn’t right.

&gt;Now it looks like this year’s awards will carry the stink of these Puppies as well. We only hope that the changes in Hugo Award rules for next year will stop them messing on the red carpet anymore. Let’s get back to celebrating what’s great – the works we love.

&gt;For now, we need to decide what to do about Tales to Terrify’s sh… uh… slate-stained Hugo nomination. It was a hard call. Honestly, it still is.

&gt;After lots of conversations today, and checking out the wise words of George R. R. Martin, John Scalzi, and others, we have decided to allow our nomination to stand. In the LA Times yesterday, John Scalzi said “Hugo voters are smart enough, and trust their own tastes enough, to know the truth.” So, I’d just like to invite you to have a listen when the Voters Packet comes out, think about all the nominations in all the categories, and vote for whatever you consider to be deserving, according to your conscience and good judgement. I’d invite you to vote based on merit, not on a slate. What you feel is worthy.

&gt;In the meantime, I speak for the whole District of Wonders in saying we stand firmly against the Rabid Puppies’ tactics and all that they stand for. We stand with other nominees who were slated without their knowledge and against their wishes, and with the fans who look forward to the return of joy to the Hugo Awards.

&gt;Tales to Terrify, like all the podcasts in the District of Wonders, celebrates diversity in the authors and content we seek out and present, as well as in our team on the mics and behind the scenes, and in our community of listeners. The District of Wonders is where great fiction and good people come together. Like I say, everyone has a story in the District of Wonders. The Puppies aren’t going to destroy that, and they aren’t going to destroy the Hugo Awards. We’re going to hold our heads high. We’re going to honour Larry’s work and what he stood for.

&gt;See you on the other side.

&gt;Best,

So this takes place late-2000s, I'd just finished college in a medium-sized US city and offered a job from my internship company ""Orangered"" (a small IT contract company of ~30 people). This was my first break from retail and in IT. 

Details have been altered for readability, names have been changed to protect the innocent and the guilty, and any similarities found to real events are *completely* unintentional. 

Our cast of characters:

* Myself: fresh college grad and PFY

* Susan: HR and classmate from college

* Dave: Owner of Orangered IT

* Jack: Senior support tech

* Arnold: Support tech manager, ex-Army Drill Sergeant (unconfirmed)

* Randy: Developer

* Jim: Security specialist

&gt; * Internal monologue. We occasionally see eye-to-eye

**Part IV**

A new prospective client has been chatting with Jack on the phone. They were a small legal office whose IT guy quit with no notice a month ago, and now were looking at replacing some of the old equipment in their network closet. After some discussion about contract support and client needs, I'm given an email stating this will be a client under my wing if they sign on. In the meantime, they do need a new switch installed and want to meet someone from the company in-person. I should dress to impress, and the switch Jack sold them is in stock and paid for, install fee included. 

&gt; Please, please, just be an easy win. I don't want another grade-school scolding from Dave.

I arrive onsite about 10 minutes early, turquoise switch in-hand and a naive smile on my face to meet their Front Desk Lady (Emily, as not to confuse with SalesClient's FrontDeskLady). This is a law office, but it hosts two lawyers that have to have their own privacy between cases. Due to being cheap, they use the same office area, printers, networking equipment and secretaries. They are the legal experts, though, so I'm going to comply with what they say they need.

Emily: ""Lawyer1 and 2 are out today, but they said Orangered was sending someone to look at our computers and meet us.""

The lay of the land was fairly simple: two Lawyers, two office workers and Emily as the joint-secretary of the office. After some pleasantries, she explains that the two lawyers have to store things separately and that security is a concern now that they're working more sensitive cases. 

Also, their old IT guy was a cousin of Lawyer2 and he upset one of the office lasses and had to be escorted off site. And badge-in doors were suddenly installed. 

Emily downplayed the ordeal, and said Lawyer1 wanted to revisit some of the network to make sure it was secure, because the wires 'looked messy'. 

&gt; Sometimes, I feel like the Jaws tension music is our theme song. And we're the ignorant swimmer.

Once the network closet is open, I'm actually rather surprised. There's four little 4/5-port Linksys switches connected with a web of Cat5, with a modem and a small *labeled* patch panel for Cat5 lines running out to the office. All of it is quite clean, mounted to the wall and the wires are bundled with plastic zip-ties.

&gt; Well, I was expecting much worse. 

Some more discussion with Emily, and I find that her PC is used as file storage for Lawyer1, and she has another tower tucked under her desk used for storage for Lawyer2. They are on separate domains, separate monitors and keyboards, and no trusts have been created so they're effectively separate. Not my preferred setup, but it does meet their needs and was cheap.

After my review, I can't help but wonder why we sold them a switch. From my walkthrough, a KMC switch would be nice for the FrontDeskLady and a thorough review of access logs to verify Cousin was not trying anything funny should be all they need. Emily says that Lawyer1 doesn't trust Lawyer2's cousin's setup and wants a professional doing it. 

&gt; Fair enough, it's not that expensive of a switch anyway. Peace of mind for the cost seems legit.

I go back to the networking closet and it dawns on me: these Linksys routers from WorstPurchase are effectively all daisy-chained, right? None of these things support any fancy technologies, like VLANing or-

&gt; This switch doesn't support VLANs either. And these two MUST have separate networks.

A quick call over to Jack verifies I have the right switch he sold, but I recommended we use a switch supporting VLANs due to client needs. 

Jack: ""Just install VLANs or whatever on it. It's a turquoise switch, it'll basically do everything.""

ಠ_ಠ

Most_Humble: ""What's the price difference between the two switches? Can we just write off the difference as goodwill for a prospective client?""

Jack: ""You'll have to ask Dave.""

Most_Humble: ""Let me conference him in real quick.""

*Click*. Sounds like Jack is just as excited as I am about this.

Dave: ""Are you at LawClient yet?""

Most_Humble: ""I'm here, I've evaluated the site. The switch Jack sold doesn't support VLANs, which this client needs.""

Dave: ""Why didn't you sell them the VLAN switch?""

Most_Humble: ""Jack was the one who sold it, and the client site was en route for me so I fielded it.""

Dave: ""I'll send Arnold over to help you.""

*Click*. 

Emily seemed curious, so I went out and explained that I was recommending a better switch instead of the one that was sold, since Lawyer1 and 2 needed separate networks. I tried to keep the tech-speak to a minimum, and she seemed content. 

It didn't take long for Arnold to arrive. He was an interesting sight: slacks and button-up with tattoos clearly visible on his wrists and neck, shaved head and earring with a goatee. Almost cartoonishly villain-esque, as if he were about to explain his world domination plans. No switch was in sight, though.

*A quick breakdown of the client setup later.*

Arnold: ""Dave said you didn't know how to do this. Sounds like Jack just sold the wrong switch.""

Most_Humble: ""I told Jack and Dave that, but no luck. I don't suppose you brought a VLAN switch with you?""

Arnold: ""Well, I have an assortment in the back of the company van I brought. I'm sure we can figure something out.""

He takes me out to the parking deck, where I get my first glimpse of the company van: a big windowless iron bucket of technology on wheels. At least a dozen different boxed switches and routers sat in the back, tools scrambled all over the floorboards. I pick out another turquoise switch that is just a hint of a step up from Jack's with VLANs, headed back and had Arnold hover over the rest of my installation. I got a rather interesting chuckle from him with the enthusiasm I took to velcro-ing the cables in an organized pattern. 

Arnold: ""Next time, I'll just text you. If I followed Dave's orders, this wouldn't have been done today. I'll write off the expense of the switch. All things considered, I'll consider this a win.""

I thought I'd finally shown some prowess here, but I did not escape the malevolent email from Dave:

'Client was undercharged for services. Failure to adequately evaluate client needs and sold wrong hardware. You need to pay attention to detail next time, we don't have sufficient budget to send another tech to hand-hold you through a simple install.'

4gx6zq,0,2016-04-28,"Sister reported us to the IRS, need advice desperately (CA/TX/NYC)",badsisterlegalhelp,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4gx6zq/sister_reported_us_to_the_irs_need_advice/,"Hi, 
We are a couple (39m/37f).  We are so furiously angry but we will try to stick to the facts.  Names of everyone have been changed (obviously)

2009:  We are living in New York City, I (Aaron) am in grad school and working part time, my wife (Betty) is working in a non profit.  We decide to get an apartment in the city so we do not keep wasting money on rent.  This is difficult to do because NYC apartments (even in not great areas) are not cheap.  

Betty's father (Chuck) DECIDES--INDEPENDENTLY-- that he will help us with the down payment.  NYC real estate is a great investment.  So we let him give us a LOAN to help us out.  Let me be clear--this was a LOAN, and we had everything notarized.  We were FULLY planning on paying him back.  

Since Chuck is going to retire soon, the only way he could help us is by taking a second mortgage on his house.  But again--he WANTED to help us.  He winds up paying about 130k in a downpayment.  WHICH HE WANTS TO DO.   

Betty's OLDER sister (I'll just call her Horriblina (f/38), she's about 31 at this time) hears about this and throws a fit.  We BOTH think that Horriblina is jealous of us and that's why she's throwing the fit.  Chuck can't afford to help out Horriblina.  But Horrible has a job in the private  sector (so she's making much more than Betty) and also, she does not live in an area that is as great an INVESTMENT as NYC.  

2012: Through a series of things that cannot be avoided (we had a child, Aaron had some health issues, etc) we are not able to keep up with the mortgage payments.  It should be emphasized that we tried EVERYTHING.  Literally.  Working 20 hours a day, on weekends, begging money from EVERYONE we knew.  But ultimately, we just couldn't do it.  The strain drove us almost to mental collapse.  And we made the terrible, heart wrenching decision to go through with a short sale of the apartment.  

This was not an easy choice.  At ALL.  It strained everything: our marriage, relationships that both of us have had for DECADES, etc.  So then, we decided to move back with Aaron's family In Texas 

Chuck, seeing what strain we were under, generously decided (again--INDEPENDENTLY) to forgive the loan.  For which we were extremely grateful.  

2015: Chuck is diagnosed with cancer.  Horriblina is the closest of Chucks' three children geographically, plus her job (she's a lawyer) allows her to work basically within the bounds of CA.  So she is at his apartment.  

We think (we have no solid proof) that Horriblina was able to go through his papers (Chuck was also a lawyer, and kept EVERYTHING beautifully organized--taxes, bank statements, etc).  We think that she was able to a) find the original loan docs; b) find the corresponding bank statements and mortgage statements and c) find evidence (in emails) that the loan was forgiven.  We didn't SEE her pawing through his stuff, but she definitely has all the relevant docs NOW.   

Chuck ultimately passes on in May of 2015. 

Present:  Now, here's the tricky part:  Chuck's will states that his estate will be divided three ways: between Betty, Horriblina, and Eric (son from a different marriage).  It ALSO states that if one contests the will in probate, that the contester gives up the rights to the estate.  

When the Will was read, Horrblina (and her lawyer) threw a fit because we didn't pay back the loan.  But they were stuck, because of the no-contest clause.  I think they tried to say that was invalid but I don't know.  

NOW, we got a letter from the IRS, saying (basically) that Chuck's loan forgiveness was considered part of our income (!!!!).  Chuck NEVER intended that.  Chuck's money was an INVESTMENT, and sometimes, you lose on investments.  Chuck understood ALL of this when he invested with us.  Betty called her mom in a panic, trying to figure out what happened.  Her mom called Horriblina, and Horriblina just straight out admitted that she reported us to the IRS.  

So now, our questions are: 
1) What do we do about the IRS demanding money???

2) Can we sue Horriblina because she contested the will?  

3) Can we sue her for reporting us???  

Other facts that may be relevant: 

-At the time of the loan being made, Aaron hoped to be a computer programmer, and had lots of prestigious jobs and internships.  So this wasn't taking advantage of Chuck AT ALL.  

-We have two children, Horriblina has one, and Eric has one.  

Please let us know if more info is needed!

ETA:  We consulted already with Betty's Friend's Father, who is a lawyer in their hometown and who works with the IRS frequently.  He only told us to pay the IRS what it wants; which, obviously, we don't want to do.  However, he works mostly with big corporations, and he DID say that we could get a second opinion with a personal tax lawyer.  Before we spend the money, we want to know if it is worth it.  "

I am very embarassed to ask this question but I have no one to turn to. 

I have only seen small amount of major success in my life, I was able to transfer successfully from a community college to a top 50 research institute for my engineering education. I have a research opportunity (which I will start this coming summer). Some mediocre internships and decent connections. After all this, I hardly feel accomplished and never made my parents proud. 

My life is a complete hell right now. I am in my mid 20s and just a boy (mentally speaking). I am afraid of challenges, communicating with people, very shy, unmotivated, lack confidence, live an introverted life and have no friends. Having aspergers makes me weird and socially awkward (which repels people away). No one appreciates me, I am just another stranger to the world and I have no idea what my purpose in life is.  I’ve never even made a single friend in my life, I have never connected to other humans (except family) at a personal level. I don’t know what its like sharing a laugh, moments, with others (I am completely hollow). 

I have ADHD, which makes concentration very difficult; not to mention I lack discipline as well to keep up with all my work. I am in engineering school and academically struggling. I am falling behind in all my courses, I can’t even figure simple things out (in comparison to all my classmates). I have an interest in computer programming and software development but I get scared of the future simply because I can’t even figure out some of my simple assignments. If I can’t figure things out in my class, how can I figure out at jobs, I’ll be fired by the end of the week (and won’t be able to hold a job). 

My parents are very disappointed at the way things are happening in my life. I have already poured my heart out to my family members but my tone has always been negative about my life. I can sense they do not appreciate my attitude and say that I am not trying hard enough/not accepting more responsibility. I have suddenly become so afraid of challenges (and have a negative aspect of life) that more responsibilities seem to scare me. I try my best every day to make things right but everything I do ends up in a disaster, which brings more disappointment to my family. 

With all the bad things happening, I have no focus, no mindset for success (always negative). I don’t know how to turn things around. There are times where I wonder why am I like this? Why am I different from the world? Why is my life just a living hell while everyone is out there enjoying? (sure they’re struggling but I struggle even more than your average Joe). I compare myself to others, I see their Facebook updates, my classmates (current and from past) are all enjoying their lives. Some are already managers of top tech company earning $100K a year, some are getting married, some going to grad school, while I am dead on the inside and have no direction in life. 

I don’t know what to do. I have no idea where my life is going and I cry myself to sleep everyday thinking about it. I will be done with school by the end of the year and I don’t have a future door after graduation (i.e. no job). Sometimes I think about killing myself, but my conscious is too strong for that. It tells me that I am living for someone else, I am here to accomplish something but I don’t know what (or how). 

I look at the great successful men and see how they have accomplished so much in life. I use them as an inspiration model to boost my inner strength but it doesn’t help much. I know I cannot be like them, I cannot succeed like them. 

So I turn to you reddit, what can a mid-20s boy do to become a man and turn things around? I have a dream and I don’t want to fail. Please advice because this year is my final fight, otherwise I really am finished. 

Please help!"

4gxggo,3,2016-04-28,Just looking for somewhere to rant,rant--throwaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4gxggo/just_looking_for_somewhere_to_rant/,"I don't know if this is an appropriate place for me to post this, but I just need somewhere to write about how I've been recently.  This might be a wall of text.

I don't know what to say.  I'm a junior in college and I've been depressed this semester.  Why?  No fucking reason.  I have friends, I'm captain of a sports team, my girlfriend and I just celebrated our 1 year anniversary a couple weeks ago, all that good old ""I have no reason to be depressed"" bullshit.   But here I am, sitting in the dark in my room.

I'm double majoring in math and computer science at a fairly prestigious school, and my workload is, understandably, quite large.  It's never been a problem in the past, and I've actually enjoyed the challenge in past years.  But this semester, about a month in, I started feeling like shit.  I started missing classes, stopped doing my work, and my grades of course began to suffer tremendously.  Then began a fun cycle of ""My grades suck because I'm feeling depressed because my grades suck"".

I started becoming less and less interested in my sport - let me tell you, it *really* sucks captaining a team you are losing interest in.  Playing the game I used to love so much more slowly became nothing but a time sink to me.  Beyond this, my relationship with my girlfriend has also suffered slightly this semester due to how I've been feeling.

So, I thought maybe I just needed a break from everything (this was about 6 weeks ago).  Thank god spring break was coming up, and I would be able to get away, get my mind off of everything, and come back and clean everything up.  I felt great for about a week following the break, and then the depression started seeping back in.

So, here I am many weeks later, having pulled my grades back together to where I'm expecting straight C's this semester (thank god my professors are incredible people), which has taken basically nonstop work for the past month.  I can't wait for this goddamn year to be over, despite the fact that my girlfriend and I live a considerable distance from each other outside of school.  At least I'll be able to visit her and her family for a little as I did last year, right?  Well, having just got off the phone with my parents to discuss my plans, let's just leave it at *we'll see*.

Turns out my parents don't want me to take a trip to see her.  I failed to land an internship for the summer, and they're concerned ""where my priorities lie"" in regards to school and everything.  I know they mean the best, but when this was said, I kind of lost it.  I essentially left the conversation with ""Life his been incredibly shitty this semester with how much work I have had, and other aspects of my life have suffered from it.  I *promise* you don't need to question my fucking priorities.  It's my money, I'll do what I want""  (This was probably said much less succinctly than this).  I cried when I got off the phone, because that's what happens now on the rare occasions where I get angry.

So my life has sucked this semester.  But hey, junior year is always the hardest, right?  Well, usually, but ohoho of fucking course not for me.  I can't even look forward to my next semester because it is going to be *far more* work than this semester.  I have **two** theses to do next semester, *each* likely requiring 15-20 hours of work a week.  This is on top of a full course load.  I've talked to my academic advisers(one in each department I'm majoring in) about my concerns for next semester, and it's really encouraging to basically be told ""yep, your life is going to suck next semester.  Don't miss any deadlines for either thesis, or you won't have to worry about finding a full-time job the next summer.""  My favorite part was when my adviser in the math department casually told me I should just consider dropping the major if I was concerned about the workload.  Yeah, I'll just drop the major after dragging my GPA down taking 95% of the required courses in the department with the lowest average GPA in my school - fuck you, Professor.

So, my life in school is going to suck for the foreseeable future.  I'm constantly hearing from my parents how my 3.1GPA is really just not leaving me with options once I'm done with school (which is bullshit given my school and majors, but it's draining after a while).  I've decided to drop my captaincy of my team for next year.

**tl;dr** Didn't have a tangible reason to be depressed but was.  This led to me having ""reasons"" to be depressed.  The near future is gloomy.

**Reflection:**
**Essays, Essays, Essays!** I didn't realize how important they were and because of it I delayed my essays a ton. I applied to Georgia Tech because they had a super early deadline to force myself to finish up my Common App Essay. I actually wrote 2 essays, gave them to my guidance counselor to read and then used the one he said was more powerful. I think applying to an early school to force you is a good idea and everybody should apply to at least one early school, if not for scholarships, but to set a deadline for yourself. Pour your heart out into essays my friends. I truly think they are the most important part of your application. I wasn't anything special to UChicago but I was given(in the words of my regional counselor) the largest merit scholarship that's not Stamps in our super competitive region. 
What's interesting too is that if you asked me where I would get in after I wrote my essays I'd be pretty spot on. I was very confident in my essays at UChicago and I got in. I was very genuine and I was happy with my essays for Stanford and I got waitlisted RD. (which is top 7% of applicants I think) For Princeton and Yale I wasn't too confident in my essay. 

Also, interviews suck. I never could get used to them and I think I did bad interviews at everywhere I applied to.
**INTEREST IS IMPORTANT**. Check if the college weighs interest or not and then be sure to show interest if they do. An example of this is UChicago. I showed a shitload of interest in them. I went on a diversity fly-in program and then wrote, what I and every teacher I've shown it to have said, the best essay I've written in my life about the college. At Cornell I showed no interest but was still admitted. In fact, I showed anti-interest. I cancelled a visit I was going to go on with the alumni committee because I was ""sick"".(I just really didn't feel like going)

Don't waste your early. Many schools only give scholarships to applicants who apply early and others give huge boosts in acceptance rates. An example of this is UChicago, which had a 10% EA acceptance rate this year, 2% EA-&gt;Defer-&gt;RD acceptance and 4% RD. They deferred a lot so the real ea acceptance rate was ~ 11-12%, almost 3x as much as RD. 

In retrospect, I'm not bitter that I didn't get into Yale,Princeton and Duke. I wouldn't have been able to attend even if they did accept me. My net price calculator put them ~30k above what my family can afford. My only real regret is not applying to USC. I fell in love with them after their scholarship deadline :(

Also, **do what makes you happy and what you want do and you'll do well in the college admissions process. Just be sure to do something. At worst, you'll have spent your high school years doing what you like to do.** Take courses because you want to, not because you have to. Every course I took was because I wanted to and I craved the knowledge. I figured: I'm going to be in school anyway, might as well make the most of it and learn the most possible. All my ECs were me and were because I wanted to do them. 


After much deliberation between Maryland and Chicago, I'll be attending UChicago."

His armored gloves have separated fingers, allowing him to have greater control of his blood manipulation. His legs are a little more armored because the majority of his attacks go through his hands.  The feet of his soles are made of a rough metal in order to get better grip on slick surfaces.  His suit is made out of a porous alloy that is as strong as titanium but has the weight of Aluminum.  It is reinforced underneath with a carbon fiber weave, allowing him to use his armor as storage channels for his blood.  He is able to harden his blood inside the suit, strengthening it further.

* When not wearing his super suit, he likes to wear a graphic t-shirt and jeans.  He wears his suit during public appearances.

Personality: Despite his macabre power, he is usually really laid back and enjoys having fun. He has a very odd sense of humor and tends to speak first and think later when with friends. He can be very persuasive, and loves strategy.  He tends to be a very warm and friendly person, but can be outright intimidating if he doesn't trust you. He is kind of nerdy as well despite his years in battle, and loves to make pop culture references.  Sometimes even during mission briefings. He can be very serious if needs to be and has gotten more serious throughout the years.  He essentially has two modes: battle-hardened veteran and perky manchild.

Backstory: Growing up in Florida to immigrant parents, Sam was an outcast.  Despite being born and raised in Florida, he was always the foreign kid.  He didn't have many friends, either.  Except for a select few, everyone saw him as that one weird brown kid that didn’t know how to talk to people.  Instead, he turned to science and books.  He’d spend his days in the fantasy land of a book or game, or researching a new theory in biochemistry.  As time went on, he cultivated a reputation as the resident nerd of the school.  
All that changed when he was 13 years old, when Mexico and Canada declared war.  Like pretty much every place close to the borders, he was caught in the crossfire.  Suddenly, Canadian sympathizers were accusing him of helping Mexico.  Despite not actually being Mexican, he was caught up in Anti-Mexican sentiment due to his looks.  This drove him closer into his research, where he spent most of his time.  He graduated high school at the age of 17 and immediately began an internship with Booster Tech in the biological research division, where he studied biology based powers for potential artificial power creation.  

 The next year, war broke out once again: the Mexican-Canadian war became a world war when more countries joined in to support their allies. Living in Florida, he was all too aware of the effects of the war.  This time, it was the other side that hated him.  One day, while walking back to his place from work, he was ambushed by men shouting at him in Spanish.  When he woke up, he was more than 4000 miles away in Spain.  He spent the few weeks as a human punching bag for Spanish nationalists before breaking out.  

One day, upon waking up in the dark, humid cell that he was being kept in, something clicked in him.  He could feel liquid rushing through his body, pulsing with every beat his heart took.  After cutting his hand on a particularly sharp rock, he noticed that the cut on his hand wasn’t bleeding red.  It was covered with a shimmering golden substance.  His very blood itself had changed.  After a week or two of constant practice, he was able to control his new powers with some confidence.  The very next day, he escaped in a surprise attack.  Not one person was spared.

After a few uneasy weeks of blending in to the surrounding area and adjusting to his new life as a super, he received the news: The war was finally over.  Then, a few weeks later came another surprise: A large aircraft carrier had docked itself in Vigo.  It was definitely not a Spanish model ship.  His new neighbors had tensed up.  Did the ship not get the message that the war was over?  After a few days came another surprise: the identity of the sailors.  Emboldened by this new opportunity, Sam went to go check it out.  Finally, he would have a chance to be where he belonged.

-------

After helping his allies on board the HCMS Phantom Shadow defeat the Purifiers, Ichor received a chance to lead when the leaders stepped down in order to pursue other ventures.  As a newly elected Squad leader, he was given joint control of the ship.  Along with the other squad leaders, he founded Cape City around the site of the Phantom Shadow.  As a place where super powered individuals could live in peace with regular people, it quickly became a bustling city.  Eventually SPECTRUM sprung out of the former squads, with Ichor as one of its leaders, as an organization that could work all around the world to preserve this peace.

_____
Power: Hemokinesis.

He can shape, control, and manipulate blood. He is even able to compact and crystallize the blood. He possesses overactive Bone Marrow, which replenishes the blood at much faster rates than normal. This gives him massive amounts of blood to use at his disposal and gives him superhuman healing (about 3-4X the normal speed). Due to his mutation, his blood is an extremely efficient carrier of oxygen and nutrients. He has some conscious control of the blood while it is still inside his body, and is able to manipulate the flow of blood to different areas of the body to rapidly increase healing in these parts.  He is able to pull the blood straight from the pores of his skin.  The blood that he uses in battle is a golden color rather than a dark-red, as a result of his mutations. Any crystallized blood will evaporate into a harmless vapor after about half an hour.  He is able to create some bio-luminescent pigments in his blood, and uses this to make tracer rounds or to mark enemies.  The texture of the hardened blood can be manipulated to be hard and crystallized or jelly-like, or anywhere in between.

He has perfected various techniques over years of practice:

* Blood Blaster: He is able to shoot blood bullets of different sizes and shapes from his hands. This is one of his most used attacks, and can fire at speeds up to that of a Sub Machine Gun (about 1000 RPM) At low speeds he is able to change the direction of the bullet in midair. However, the blood cannot be reused once it hits its target.  This ability can rapidly deplete blood if he's not careful.
* Blood Blade: He is able to create blades of varying size and shape out of blood that can attach to various body parts. He is able to create a sort of inner webbing in the blade to minimize blood loss while extending the blade. The blades are about as sharp and durable as steel, and can break. The broken end is still controllable.  He can combine this with his Blood Blaster to create streams of razor blades.
* Blood Bulwark: He is able create protective armor out of the blood. The armor is as tough as steel and can be detached from his skin to form a mobile shield. He is able to create the armor anywhere on his body, and the armor can be detached. He often uses it on his arms as kind of an accompaniment to the protection already offered by the guards on the Katar that he uses.  He also uses this in conjunction with his blood blades to create blood claws.
* Blood Bullwhip: He is able to elongate his blood armor into a flexible whip that extends out of the front of his hands. The whip is about as tough as leather and is used to hold on to objects. He prefers to use this for functional purposes.  
  * Blood Brambles: He places spikes on the end of his whips, allowing him to use them offensively.
* Blood Brand: He is able to transfer heat from a heat source using the blood, allowing him to burn or even melt objects if the heat source is hot enough.

Drawbacks: His hemokinesis requires warm temperatures to function correctly, so he is weakened considerably by cold temperatures. He finds it hard to use his blood manipulation in the cold because doing so drastically lowers his body temperature.  He can only manipulate his own blood or fluid that is at least partially made up of his own blood. With the latter, however, he has diminished control depending on how much blood is in the fluid. He is unable to redirect that blood back inside his body, so it is lost after battle.  He has to consume massive amounts of calories as well as iron supplements to account for his massive blood production. He has no control over how much blood is produced, so he has to use his powers often to prevent himself from getting hypertension.  The golden blood that he uses in battle is very distinctive and can be identified easily, especially when it is glowing. His armor is short lived due to solidified blood evaporating after use.  Blood contaminated by anything that would kill his hyper-active blood cells is not usable. Overusing his abilities risks his blood becoming deoxygenated, which can suffocate him.  He is extra susceptible to the effects of poisons. 

Resistances: He is resistant to heat.  He is resistant to physical attacks due to his blood closing up the wound easily and his healing factor.

Weapon: He owns a [pair of Katar](https://i.imgur.com/JmKcRNE.jpg) that he uses as a short-range weapon and to extend the use of his powers.  These katar have channels in them that he can use as barrels to steady his aim for long range attacks.

Special Skills: He is a good strategist and is an expert at biology as well as biochemistry and chemistry.  He is skilled at first aid, and used to be a Doctor before he became a full-time hero.  He is a master of his fighting style and is skilled at the use of his Katar. He is a great talker, and is skilled at making people feel at ease.

4gy3ek,2,2016-04-29,Having a job AND having overseas internships? Can I?,MittensTheLizard,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4gy3ek/having_a_job_and_having_overseas_internships_can_i/,"I'm a second year 19yo computer engineering student and I have 3 more years until my degree is over. While I'm still in uni, I want to experience going on paid internships overseas (partly because it'll be incredibly fulfilling, also because my boyfriend lives overses- pls don't judge). The only problem is that I plan on moving out soon so I'll have rent to pay and I'm going to need stable work while I'm not away.

I really doubt many employers would be okay with me taking three months off work though. Will I be a job hopper if I have 2-3 jobs on my resume that I worked less than a year for? Is there any way for me to have my cake and eat it too here?

Thanks!"

I am graduating with a B.S. ChemE in May 2016. I have a post-bac engineering internship lined up for this summer. But I plan to apply to ChemE Ph.D programs this fall b/c R&amp;D of renewable energy technologies is what I truly want to do. 
My cumulative and major GPA are 3.91 and 3.97, respectively. I've had two internships at two different DOE National Laboratories doing biomass fuels/products research. Unfortunately no publications at the moment, but co-author on a couple of reports/presentations.
I am wondering from those who have gone through the grad school app process:

1. Where should I apply to? And what are my chances at some of the bigger programs? (Graduating from a smaller state program)
2. What do you think helped you most in getting accepted to your school?
3. Did you apply to any graduate fellowships?
4. What do you like most, and what do you like least about being a ChemE grad student?

Any input would be useful in my decisions.

4gy8q0,3,2016-04-29,My Experience with the Creatures,ZeVikingSif,TheCreatures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/4gy8q0/my_experience_with_the_creatures/,"Hi everyone. I'm not really a frequenter on this subreddit, and this is an extremely minor post but i wanted to get it out there. I've been watching The Creatures since early 2012, and i continue to watch them, and their content have made me feel happier, even on the worst of days. I just wanted to take this time and share my experience with them.

Way back in the day, i had joined a community that was very unrelated to gaming in general, but had a group chat where people can talk about basically anything. Long story short, the more popular members were talking about this game called Minecraft, and i hadn't even heard of it. I wanted to be in on the conversation, so i looked it up on youtube, and found Minecraft: Red &amp; Blue by Nova and Seamus, and this was my first exposure to the Creatures.

And immediately, they caught my attention and had me laughing. I had binge-watched all of Nova's videos, such as Techno Kitteh Adventure, Hershel's Land, Quad Mountain Survival, DC Universe Online, Call of Duty Zombies, Happy Wheels, Game of Life, etc, etc. I guess i can say i'm familiar with most of the major series' that Nova has uploaded, hell, at the time of me typing this, i will have binge-watched CoD Zombies again for the 25th time.

And from there, i found the other Creatures and even the main Creatures channel. There's so much to talk about but i remember James hitting 1 Million Subs, i remember when Gassy was kicked out, i remember Seamus playing GTA, i remember tuning in everytime Nova and Kootra would play CoD Zombies, i remember everytime Nova abruptly ended a series like Far Cry 3 and Quad Mountain, i remember when TreeTopia was first uploaded, i remember when Nova was on Minecraft Daily, i remember when James and Dan would play Just Cause 2, when James and Sp00n would play Dead Rising 3, when Sp00n would play Tokyo Hosto, when Nova finished Sleeping Dogs, when Nova and Kootra would play Asgard Adventures, when Ze would play Worms, Cards Against Humanity, Monopoly.

I could go on and on, but you get my point. You can probably Nova/James is my favorite Creature, and yes, it's true. I don't think i hated any Creature, though i wasn't the biggest fan of Gassy or the Interns. To all the Creatures, i want to thank them for making me laugh every single day, i want to thank Nova, Kootra, Sp00n, Dan, Sly, Aleks, Ze, Dex, Seamus, &amp; Kevin for indirectly helping me out even through tough times, despite them not knowing i even exist. I continue to go back every other week to binge-watch another series created by them, no exaggeration. Every single one of them in some way have made my life happier, and i'm proud to say i'm a fan of the Creatures.

Their departure is upsetting, but i know each of them can do greater things. I'm hoping that this departure doesn't make it so they can never play with each other again. Cow Chop is doing amazingly right now, the interns are actually doing even better somehow, and i hope it just becomes even better from here. As for The Creatures, and as sad as it is for me to say this, i'm not enjoying their content. I like Kootra and Dan individually and i will remain subscribed to them, but it's not the same watching the hub anymore. 

I would just like to say Thank You to all the Creatures, i will forever love them and their content that they put out and even still. Here's to another few years."

I'm on Day 5 of Attempt ??? and I'm going through the painful first week of not being able to sleep well, yet being incredibly tired. Longtime lurker of the thread, sometimes contributor, under many usernames, always ashamed when I fell off the wagon. Never done a Saturday Share before, but I have nothing better to do, and I can't sleep, so here goes:

I'm StarryStarryNightAZ, and I'm an alcoholic. I have no idea when I started drinking, or when I took my first drink. I'm guessing I was around 10-11. All I know is that my relationship with alcohol was instantly unhealthy. I can't recall more than a handful of times in my life where I've just had a drink or two. I drank to DRINK. I LOVED to drink. My first real clear memory of being drunk was at my dad and stepmother's wedding--I was probably 14 or 15, and me and three of my girlfriends made off to my room with several bottles of champagne, since all the adults at the party were either drunk or high out of their minds, no one gave a shit. We killed those, and a bottle of Goldschlager. I remember vomiting up gold flakes and saying ""I'm never drinking again"". Turns out, wouldn't be the last time those words came out of my mouth!

Graduated from highschool with a 4.5 GPA, with honors, top 10 in my class. Went to college for a semester, but I graduated at a young 17 and wasn't mature enough to handle it. Made it through half a semester, living on my own, partying my ass off, and was glad I had the wherewithal to withdraw before the halfway point so my failing grades didn't affect my future GPA. Dad was pissed that I dropped out and cut me off (I paid tuition, he helped with the living expenses), so I had to get a full-time job. I had been working part-time in kitchens to support my party habit, so I started working full-time as a cook. Turns out, kitchens are terrible places for 17-year-old alcoholics!

Worked as a cook for several years, made it all the way up to sous chef at a fancy, fancy, starred-and-diamonded restaurant. Did so much cocaine it's not even funny, because it was easy, and free, and around. Drank myself stupid. But I showed up for work every day, and worked hard (so I was told, or at least, compared to all the other alcoholics and addicts who worked there). I remember being so fucking hung over one day that I was alternating between grill and walk-in freezer to keep myself from puking on myself all shift long. Sadly, that's probably my clearest memory from that time. Made a bunch of terrible relationship/sex decisions, but also met my future husband (one of the not terrible decisions, obviously). He was a restaurant worker and party-guy, too, so we got along famously. Lots of drinking.

Got clean for awhile after we started dating seriously, and decided to get my shit together and go back to college. Didn't drink -- OK, maybe I had a dozen or so beers the whole time. Graduated with a 4.0 summa cum laude, with my full Bachelor's degree, in 2 years, taking 24+ credit hours a semester, working a full-time job and doing three internships at the same time. 

Once I graduated, I started working in the newspaper business (also, a fucking TERRIBLE choice for an alcoholic). I suddenly had a bunch of free time on my hands, and I was working weird shifts. Cue the drinking and the bad decision-making. No drugs though. No drugs ever again after the kitchen life...weirdly that was easy to quit for me. Was an asshole to my then-boyfriend, now-husband. Did terrible, unforgivable things, was forgiven. Why? I don't know, but I'm so thankful.

Rinse and repeat for years. I finally decided to clean up my act again when the industry took a crap and all the newspapers went out of business. Started working in other industries, got picked out as smart and talented, quickly became management material. Moved around a bit in jobs, but stayed pretty stable. Got married, had an occasional drink here and there, kept my life in check. Wonderfully boring and awesome.

Cue my insane narcissist mother inserting herself into my life and marriage, moving in with us unannounced. I'm too nice to kick her dumb alcoholic ass out, because I feel sorry for her. Started drinking heavily again. My husband has always been a bit of a binge drinker as well (I'll let him decide when he's ready to say he's an alcoholic), and he joined me in this drinking. Finally kicked her ass out after 6 months, but kept up the drinking.

Found out I was pregnant very early on (2 weeks) and quit on the spot, no problem. The smell of alcohol during my entire pregnancy nauseated me. I was like a damn bloodhound, I could smell that shit from a mile away, even a drop. Husband kept drinking through the pregnancy, but cut it down a good bit.

Had a wonderful, wonderful healthy and fantastic boy, nursed him (non-drinking). Then, once I was done nursing, I just started. I don't know why. Part of it was the ""craft-beer-snob-culture"" excuse. It was an easy outlet for stress (even though it just made me more stressed). Would try to quit every so often, would quit for awhile, then would relapse, each time worse than the last. Got my Master's degree, mostly while drunk. Don't remember a whole lot. Managed to graduate with a 4.0. I remember one boss who knew I drank a lot telling me, ""you're smart as hell, you ever wonder how smart you could be if you stopped killing all those damn brain cells?"". That kind of stung, and stuck in my head, too. Did well at work. Was always getting promoted. But still, the drinking. Never at work. Always with lots of rules. Which I would break and rationalize away.

Found /stopdrinking. Lurked a lot. Tried to quit a few times. Changed my username a few times. Had a huge breakdown, had an affair, got caught, had an even bigger breakdown, had some sobriety. Then I lapsed a bit, just a few. A few turns into many. I turn into a miserable human being. I create chaos. I self-destruct for no reason. 

Last weekend the husband and I bought impromptu date-night tickets to a Broadway show. Had some drinks before. Went to dinner. Had some drinks with dinner. Went to the show. Had some drinks at the show. I remember nothing. I remember buying tickets, going to dinner, walking to the show, buying a drink, then puking in the bathroom sometime during the second half. 

Money is a big issue for us right now, and I was ashamed that the one thing we splurged on, I didn't even remember. Apparently I even ran into a coworker (who either couldn't tell how drunk I was or was far too nice/weirded out to say anything), who asked me on Monday if I liked the show (too embarrassed to say anything but just play along). Sunday I spent half the day in bed, miserable, hungover. Sunday I decided that this is my last attempt at being sober. 

I have a fantastic job. A fantastic husband (minus the sometimes excessive drinking, but he's working on it, too). A fantastic house. Fantastic friends. A beautiful, amazing, fantastic child. Funny sweet dogs/cats/fishes. Nothing but wonderful... from the outside.

Why do I constantly try to throw that away? No idea. But I'm tired of it. I'm tired of my own antics. I'm getting therapy for the deeper issues that I know are there. I'm being honest and straightforward with my sobriety with friends and family this time (that's a first). I'm considering a meeting, but I live in a very heavily religious area, and I'm not religious. Nothing against anyone who is, just not my cup of tea. And I'm here. Checking in, participating, helping myself, hopefully helping some of you.

And most of all, participating and being present in my own life--not just watching it like a movie, wondering what bullshit lurks around the next corner for the protagonist. Instead, I'm going to BE the protagonist in my own life.

TL;DR: No tragic reason for being an alcoholic, just another asshole throwing my life away; ready to make a change.

Thanks for listening to my bullshit, sobernauts. "

I'm currently working as an intern at a small company where I have to do an assignment for my study. Although me and my boss have some different views and I'm very curious what the input of you guys on the project is.

Goal: create a compact system that can hold and transport small balls (d=2.8mm) non stop. The reserve consists of a few thousand balls. The system shouldn't be able to get jammed easily and if so it should be easy to fix it (it's purpose is to be part of a mass production line in China).

The biggest challenge are:
-The balls have to move against gravity.
-The balls get jammed easily at the end of a funnel etc.
-There should always be a ball input so it's easy to make the input&gt;output, however this can lead to extra pressure/friction on parts.

My favorites:
-Transport with an Archimedes screw. The same screw can be used to keep the balls in reserve moving so they don't get jammed.
-Air pressure. This is a simple method with little chance of failures. However I haven't fount an appropriate manner of stopping the balls from getting jammed.

Could you guys please give me your input? Maybe some innovative ideas will find me this way!

Much appreciation and sorry for my English!"

And managed to find some parts to make it function. So far this is the pc:
*Nvidia gtx 520
*Cooler Master RS-430-PCAR power supply
*4gb of ddr2 or 3 memory **not sure about this**
*Intel Core 2 duo E7400 @ 2.8GHz
*Not really sure of the motherboard

You see Im a student who works paid internships to finance myself, my family doesn't really support the PC building thing. I do have $150 in hand right now. So I can use that in a graphic card, the asus geforce gtx 750 ti looked good.

I have come to terms with your decision to break up. I understand that your life changes a lot as you finish this final year in university and enter the ‘real world’ and I can understand why you didn’t think we would be able to work next year. Although we both know this is a shame I can see why it would be difficult and possibly unrealistic to maintain our relationship when we are in different stages of our lives, with you seeking an internship or job while I’m finishing the final year of my degree. I also understand that for whatever reason, or maybe for no reason at all, feelings can change and although mine hadn’t yours apparently had and you had felt yourself slipping out of the relationship. I understand why you would want to break up if you had been feeling this way as it is not fair on either of us to be in an imbalanced relationship. 

Although I understand this, I miss having you as a close friend and I’m sure you will be missing me a little too. 

I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for my behavior just after breaking up. I shouldn’t have tried to text and call you and I know I should have respected what you said and not tried to get in touch. I hope you can understand that at the time I was feeling very emotional and the suddenness of the break up surprised me a lot. I do acknowledge that I wasn’t considering how those messages would have made you feel but please know I would never have intended to upset you.

I know you thought of me as the person you were closest to at university and I felt that way of you too. I’m glad we became the good friends we did and we were always happy to be in each other’s company. I still care about you and your life, which I feel is only normal after having been so invested in each other’s lives for the 6 months at university we spent together. I would really like to know how you got on with your final exams, graduation and what you’ll be doing next year with an internship or potentially doing something abroad like you had mentioned. I also hope that you managed to book those flights to go on holiday to Australia with your friends as I know you wanted to go there so much. If you do read this, and would like to, I’d appreciate a small text or message just letting me know how all your exams and graduation went. I hope that everything went as planned and you managed to pass all your exams and got the grade you deserved.

I have only good memories from our relationship that I can remember fondly, and can only thank you for being nothing other than a kind, thoughtful and caring girlfriend during the time we spent together. I was always very proud to have you by my side and I cared about you an awful lot. I can’t think of one bad moment I experienced in the time we spent together and I hope that you feel the same way too. I felt that our relationship was always very happy and I hope that when you see the teddy bear I got you for Valentine’s Day, or even those bear socks that were a little Easter gift, or anything that reminds you of me, you remember me for being the kind boyfriend I always tried my best to be. I’m very thankful I got to share part of my life and create so many happy memories with a person like you,

4gz0lc,12,2016-04-29,Candyflipping to Save My Soul (x-post from r/mdma),110mcg,mdmatherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mdmatherapy/comments/4gz0lc/candyflipping_to_save_my_soul_xpost_from_rmdma/,"My first LSD experience (https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/4de1lw/ego_death_on_100110mcg_my_first_trip/) was harrowing and ego-shattering but I knew I had to go back and see what else it had for me. Eight days later I took a little less LSD than I had my first time (when I had a tripping partner)—80-100mcg. This time I was alone but I also had a 210mg strawberry Molly tablet on hand. I hadn't decided whether or not I would take any Molly as it would be my first time and I wasn't sure I wanted to combine the two. I get a little antsy with this stuff. Maybe it's just where I am in life right now but I can't imagine doing it for “fun”. I left the option open though, as I wanted to let my higher Self guide the experience.

I have been in a deep process of difficult personal evolution the past few years , much of it arising out my facing trauma from my childhood. I went to significant trouble to do Ayahuasca two times and now acquire these Inquisition'd medicines because I was tired of all my unnecessary suffering, self-limitation, and ultimately not feeling like a totally real person with agency in the world. If you've had PTSD symptoms then you likely know what I'm talking about. I'm very functional--I work, I go to grad school, and I have a counseling internship but there remained a deep uneasiness in most personal interactions and even small everyday decisions. I knew I needed to go deeper and unlock my imprisoned self, especially if I'm going to be trying to help other people.

Anyway, I took the Acid and the come-up was very slow and gentle, unlike my first time where I got sucked into oblivion pretty quickly. Thank god for the tolerance I likely had from my first trip.

I began to feel fairly strong effects right around the 2 hour mark and then a memory bubbled up. It was a dream I had four years ago. In the dream I was lying on my Jungian analyst's couch and she was scratching my back. She said, “110mcg, what can you do to make yourself feel extraordinarily better?” I gave no answer in the dream and I never felt like I really answered the question in the subsequent years. The dream faded into the background even though I should have paid more attention to it.

Coming up on the Lucy with the pleasant sensations coursing through my body I realized that this was it. This was the answer to my dream. I crawled over to where I had the Molly at my “altar” with several candles burning. I cut the little strawberry tablet in half with my pocket knife. It now looked like a bifurcated heart and in that moment, the room, the chemicals, my mind, felt incredibly sacred, like I was taking a sacrament. LSD was the body and MDMA was the blood. I chewed up the slightly-larger-than-half tablet and embraced the bitter taste as an important part of the experience.

I lay back down on my blanket on the floor and put some music through my over the ear headphones which, by the way, are amazing for really experiencing music in times like this. About 30 minutes later I felt the first stirrings and, oddly, I thought about how this chemical had been stumbled upon all the way back in 1912, just a few years before millions of young men slaughtered each other in the trenches of WWI. I wondered if maybe those same people would have been less apt to slaughter each other if they had had access to this experience? I thought of what we might be holding back now that could prevent untold suffering in the future.

Around 10 minutes later I had another thought that was probably unoriginal but here goes: MD-ME! I realized that this was a ME medicine. This was a way to feel the self that we forget and repress to get along with our parents, society, crappy friends, culture, etc. Trauma takes us away from being a real ME but Molly gently but firmly removes those barriers.

It's hard to quantify what happened in the next few hours on the floor but I felt like I gave birth to a more full and realized self. The self that couldn't fully incarnate into the world due to a terrible upbringing and subsequent clinging to that dysfunction. I remembered ME. The parts of me that I feel are inconvenient to others, the parts of me I killed or maimed to get along with my abusive parents and Christian school, and the child who never got to feel truly happy.

I also had the profound experience of really, truly realizing that I can say NO to people. This may sound silly or simple, but for someone like me this realization helped to topple some of the false edifices of my personality. I don't always have to be agreeable or a helper. I don't have to be a good little boy. I was not put here to save other people. I knew this intellectually, but in these few hours these sorts of realization sprang up from a neglected part of my larger self.

During this experience I fell in love with myself again. Not in a narcissistic way, but in a way that means I don't have so much of an inner dictator censoring me anymore and there is love and spontaneity circulating through my being like invisible blood. That dictator (picture him as a 5 year old combo of Hitler and Stalin) really just needed to feel deep, true joy.

Despite some of the trip reports I'd read, I felt no need to get in touch with other people while on the Molly or even dance. I was content to lie on the floor and stare up at the ceiling in wonder, much like an infant would. The music I had carefully chosen beforehand felt like part of my birthing process. The music energized and infused the new green shoots of my freedom.

This happened a few weeks ago and I've had struggles since then, including a second Molly/Lucy combo that was very difficult but ultimately another victorious piece of this rebuilding I'm doing. I'll post that one a bit later. Everything is not perfectly better as it felt in this experience but now in subsequent weeks I am so much more willing to be myself in every situation. I find myself inhabiting my body differently and being more aware of when I shrink back and my inner child dictator tries to take over. The universe has also given me several opportunities to say big NO's to people and groups of people and I have done that with so much more courage than before.

I'll end this with a quote from Aldous Huxley as I think it sums up what entheogens like this can do for the world and I hope that all of you who roll, will, each time, remember and collect some forgotten part of yourself. The world needs that, and maybe we can avoid the next great cataclysm if we consciously use these chemicals. “The arhat and the quietist may not practice contemplation in its fullness; but if they practice it at all, they may bring back enlightening reports of another, a transcendent country of the mind; and if they practice it in the height, they will become conduits through which some beneficent influence can flow out of that other country into a world of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack of it. “

I'm a senior computer science and math major with two semesters left for my undergrad. I finish out my CS courses this semester and then work on finishing out the math courses. I'm working on deciding what the next step in my career should be, either working in industry or pursuing my graduate degree.

I attend a medium sized state school with a relatively small CS department. I currently have a 4.0 cumulative GPA, and after this summer will have completed my third internship.

I'm positive that I want to eventually get my graduate degree and Phd, because I know I want to teach at the university level after working for a while. Would I be better off working and then getting my graduate degree, or applying for grad school during my last couple of semesters while all of my knowledge is still fresh?

I've also been looking into programs like CyberCorps, which is a government sponsored program that pays for grad school in cyber security. Are these programs worth considering, or is it better to find a way to pay for grad school myself?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!"
4gzrkm,10,2016-04-29,Three months NC and still hurting. [21 M] with my ex [24 M/F] of 1 and 1/2 years,ZedFreakinPanda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gzrkm/three_months_nc_and_still_hurting_21_m_with_my_ex/,"I'm still struggling to put the pieces of everything together. 

BACKGROUND: I'm 21, almost 22. I dated a girl who I considered my best friend for a very long time. We met on a youth trip to Israel, about three years ago. We fell for eachother after a couple of days, slowly getting to know eachother. We decided we would try to date back home in the States, seeing eachother long distance for awhile. I was just entering sophomore year in school, she had just graduated. She came to visit often, probably every other week, and I would visit her on weekends as well. After travelling to Israel again together, she moved in with me after about 8 months of dating. It didn't last. I started working full-time in an internship I had, but I was miserable. I didn't get along with my boss, my coworkers, and got less and less attached to her. We went back to my parents house for new years, and went out with a bunch of old friends. One of them confessed to me that I hadn't been myself for awhile, and I finally pulled the trigger on something that had been eating my soul- breaking up with her. She was devastated. We then got snowed in for several days right after we broke up, prolonging the move-out... but she eventually left, after some really messy breakup sex and my trying to hold and comfort her through it. 

That begun the hardest year of my life. On and off dating, hurting eachother, finding out painful truths about her love life. All the while, I stayed single. I never really met anyone else, or hooked up with anyone else. We started talking a month later only to find out that she had started going on dates, which I felt I should know all about. It hurt and stung like I had never hurt before, but I stubbornly kept after her. I realize in retrospect that I simply hadn't gotten over her, and my chasing her again was like trying to fix the mistake I made in breaking up too preemptively. But the damage was done. We never were able to reconnect the same way. There was always a lack of trust, for me. I couldn't forgive her, I couldn't stop hurting. We started seeing eachother, hooking up again. It would start out innocent, happy, in love again, until I looked deep into her eyes and realized how hateful I was because of how much pain I had been through because of her.

I never let that go. Still haven't. And after awhile, we drifted apart again. We've since gotten back together twice, and of three months ago, broken up for good. 

I haven't talked to her since. She hasn't messaged me either. I promised myself I wouldn't talk to her for three months, which was agonizing at times, but worth it. 

Now here I am, at my parents house for a couple days following the end of my 4th year in college. I've got a week and a half until my summer semester. I'm finally having to tackle the problem of her- I still miss her and think we should be together. But I've spent so much time trying to move on. And I'm sure she has too. 

Is it bad to break NC now? Half of me thinks I can finally have the conversation with her I've been longing for- just to catch up and see how she's doing. But... I think that same part of me simply wants her back. The other part of me wants NOTHING to do with her, because I'm still in a lot of pain. I want to let go of that pain, and move the fuck on. I want my own life. But... I still very clearly miss the life I had with her.

Be blunt with me, what the hell should I do? 
   
tl;dr: Dated a girl for 1.5 years, on/off for 1 year, now split for good. Put off talking to her for three months to deal with school, now facing the full weight of my emotions and struggling not to reach out again- HELP!"

4gzyx0,4,2016-04-29,Not sure what my salary should be? Need negotiation help,blackcatlady927,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4gzyx0/not_sure_what_my_salary_should_be_need/,"My company is trying to pull a fast one on me. 

I started working here as an intern making 21.50 an hour. It was a program through my school where you work for 6 months then go to school for 6 months. This pay was negotiated in May of 2014 and implemented in September of 2014, when my final co-op started. 

My frustration begins as I was VERY transparent with them. I received an offer for $23 an hour, however, it was a bit farther. I created a sheet with the current travel expenses and the travel expenses had I switched jobs and said ""This company is offering me $23 an hour but is a further commute. In order for me to have the same take home pay here, I would need to be making 21.50 an hour. Is this something we can agree to? If not, I will be taking the other position."" They immediately agreed that it's fair to pay me the 21.50 and have me stay. 

I completed my last co-op at the company and was working part time while going back to school. In June of 2015, still making 21.50 an hour, I approached them to see if they were interested in hiring me as a full time salaried employee upon my graduation in December of 2015. I only asked because if they did not plan on hiring me, I needed to look for another job. They said they were planning on offering me a position before September to come on full time in December. Gave me the rundown of vacation/benefits and told me we would discuss pay in January of 2016, when everyone's annual review was.

This past January, my review came around... I got all great reviews from all 3 partners and was given two more responsibilities that were added to my job title because they wanted these titles to be recognized by the firm and our clients since ""you would be the first one we'd hire had you just walked off the street and applied."" At the very end of the review, there was a small sentence ""Oh, we'll talk about your salary after tax season(were an accounting firm)"" and then I was rushed out of the room.

I was obviously a little confused as I had been told back in June that my salary would be discussed during my review. I approached one of the partners and told them my situation. I said ""My rate was negotiated when I was an intern back in May of 2014 and I've had the same rate since September of 2014. I am now a college graduate with two more positions meaning much more responsibilities... I feel those should be reflected in my salary."" I was asking for 50,000, which I thought was incredibly reasonable.

The partner skirted around the whole ""Well a salary means you need to work until the work is done. Everyone is getting more responsibility with new clients and everyone only got a 2-3% raise. You're asking for a 13% raise."" I rebuttled with ""I share in that 'new client responsibility' as well as managing our new client portal and being the technical coordinator. You don't think I should get 3%, as everyone else, plus 5% for each of my new roles? That would get us to the 13%.. And pretty fairly in my opinion""

He once again skirted around the argument and said he would talk to the other partners and get back to me. Which he never did.

Now, since tax season is over, I'd like to bring it up again. However, my research is suggesting that I should be asking for more. I am not entirely sure how to go about finding out an actual figure. 

A Staff Accountant at a small accounting firm in our area makes about 50k. Technical coordinators make about 47k and client service managers make about 42k. If I added those together, I would get 139k, which seems very absurd to me.

My main role is the accountant so my starting point is 50k, I'm just wondering how much(%) of the other two salaries I should take to add to that 50k to get an actual number to ask for. 

I'm going to pose it as ""I had time to do research from my rejected offer until now and it turns out I should be making more than I initially asked. This is the number I came up with and how I came up with it. If that can not be met, I will be looking for employment elsewhere.""

Help! Feel free to ask any questions as I realize it may seem a little complicated.

Im a 2nd year stem major (dabbling in geo/enviro/earth sci) but Im feeling pretty beat up. I was an idiot my freshman year and took on too much and messed up 2 quarters in a row so my GPA is low (hovering at a 2.7, is now a 3.00 with hard work) and i had to retake some classes. Im a year behind in biology and ochem (will be taking it as a third year) and in general I feel like im not smart enough to make through the weeder classes but after this year will be done with math, chem and physics. Ive been burnt out though because i had to to stay all of summer and i just want this year to end and go home.

I guess I feel burnt out and that im not smart enough. I really do love what I study (started some taking upper divs) and have an internship lines up but am worried im too behind/wont be as successful because my gpa is so low/my transcripts look shitty and that maybe id be better off in some ""easier"" major (dont mean to offend) even if im not interested (all non stem courses ive taken ive gotten As in). I know I have some mental health stuff + family problems (parents are divorcing) but I dont want to blame my poor decisions on that. I feel embarassed to talk to a counselor and I feel Im in too deep to switch but simultaneously dont know what i would switch too (i thought about the BA for enviro but didnt like how bare bones it was).

I guess what im looking for is some advice or if anyone feels similarly. Its affecting my self esteem or vice versa, I cant tell. Or if anything, thanks for listening."

I'm finishing up my first year at college. I took one computer class so far, which is ""Intro to CS"", where I learned C++. I want to learn Swift in the next couple of months, by myself, so that I can get an internship in the future, knowing more languages. I am a really good learner, but my problem that I'm lazy and I often lose motivation, but if I apply myself to my studies, I can get pretty good grades.. There is nothing else I'm really good at but computers. 

Now my questions:

1-) I stutter. My stutter is from moderate, to severe. Throughout the year my stutter becomes light, but is not that often nor it last for a long period of time. As a Software Engineer, how much talking do you have to do? How is this going to affect my interviews?

2-) I really have no connections to no one. I'm solo on this. Am I going to possibly get far like that? 

3-) How do keep yourself motivated? How do you practice coding at home?

4-) What are the languages I MUST learn in the next 3 years?

This summer I will be moving up to Oregon from Arizona for an internship and it is becoming very clear that I will need a car while I am up there. I have been looking everywhere for a used car around $5000, which would be my budget consisting of $3000 cash and a $2000 loan. However, nothing I have found seems reliable for my summer trip to Oregon it. I was recently talking with my father who brought up leasing a brand new Subaru Forester. The cost breakdown being:

$229 montly for the lease (36 Payments)

$160 monthly for insurance

$450 monthly rent payment

$500 monthly living/leisure (very generous)

School covered by scholarships

With all of this taken into account my income should be somewhere around $2161.25 per month including tax for the next 12 months, after which I will graduate with a job lined up. This means that all expenses included I would have around $800 left over. 

The details of the lease are that it is a 36 month lease with all maintenance included and a limit of 12000 miles a year.

Does it make sense for me to lease a car that I know will be reliable and last me at least three years with the chance of buying it after (minimum $8244 over three years)? Or should I continue looking for a cheap car around $5000? 

I am currently leaning towards the lease option as I will have a more reliable car which I know will last me at least 3 years where the used car will likely barely last that long. Any guidance is appreciated. "

As cheap as possible, usa.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
With my budget whatever I can get, prefer single laptop though.
* **How important is weight to you?**
 Anything under 8 pounds would be spectacular.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 I've used all 3 so doesn't really matter. Although premier runs a lot smoother on osx and windows.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Once again with my budget whatever I can get.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
I am going to be using photoshop and premier on almost a daily basis for college work and interning at a small business. The only games I would play on it would be League of Legends, dota 2, and blizzard games. 

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
I know I'm being very vague and I apologize for that, I understand that I won't be able to play any of the titles listed above on great settings, although no stuttering would be ideal.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 A somewhat decent build quality as I will be travelling with it in my briefcase every day.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
Once again I would like to apologize for being so vague. I am nearing the end of my schooling and start interning middle of May. This laptop would primarily be an inbetweener if I had to put a name on it. I'm pretty broke right now so it only has to last me until I finish my internship and get hired in my field. After that I will be making enough money to afford something better. Thanks.


Edit: The price I'd be willing to pay is literally just as cheap as possible. I technically could go up to 500 but if you think I can get by with 200 or something that would be sweet."

4h1mal,1,2016-04-29,Recent Graduate Troubles,microcosm12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4h1mal/recent_graduate_troubles/,"Hello people of cscareerquestions. I haven't been on Reddit in a long time, but I am writing today because I am looking for some perspective, advice, and hope. I guess I'll start with my background. Please skip the rest of this paragraph if you are in a hurry. Ever since I was a little kid I fell in love with computers. They were incredibly fascinating to me even though the closest thing to a computer I had in my house was my dad's (my mom still used a typewriter) work laptop, which I was only rarely allowed to use, and my PlayStation, which completely blew my mind when I first got it. Towards the end of middle school my older brother, who was in high school at the time, bought a computer and started taking a Visual Basic programming class that the high school taught. He taught me a little of it and I was addicted. I started learning as much about programming as I possibly could. When I got to high school I took the Visual Basic class myself along with all of AP Computer Science classes that were offered. In fact I took almost any class that had anything to do with computers: graphic imaging, auto cad, IT, etc. I joined the two technology related clubs that were offered: tech club and the robotics team. I also got my CompTIA A+ certification. I was so obsessed with computers and programming in high school that I slacked off in my other classes to program instead of doing homework when I got home, and I took multiple study halls my senior year so I could spend more time learning about programming on my own. I graduated high school with okay grades and decided to go to the local satellite campus of a reputable university. I did this not just because my grades weren't the best in high school and their entry standards were lower, but because it was affordable.

&amp;nbsp;

I went through five years of college going a minimum of 12 credit hours a semester and working 30-40+ hours a week depending on the semester. While I was in college I worked as a delivery driver for a pizza place in between school and home. In 2014 I found an internship for a local startup software company. I worked there for about 8 months. It started off as part time during the spring semester (yes I worked two jobs and went to school full time during this semester. It sucked.), but became full time during the summer (I took the summer off from the pizza place). I hated it. The place was poorly run. The owner had a habit of micromanaging and setting insane deadlines even though he had no software or technical experience of any kind. He also reminded me of my troubled, abusive home life as a child with constant screaming and fighting, either with the investors, interns or with the project manager. By the end of high school most of my family problems were starting to resolve and go away, and it felt like working for him was sucking me back into it. I was miserable. The project manager was overworked and rarely knew what was going on with the interns. About half of the interns could barely program FizzBuzz or speak and understand English. The good news is the other half (maybe closer to a third) of the interns were great. I really loved working with them and we accomplished a lot. The internship ended in August and I had no plans on returning. Unfortunately, because I am/was poor I couldn't afford to move away, and the only industry in my area is/was fast food and retail. As a result this was my only internship. During my last semester of college I started applying to jobs, and I went to the large career fair the main campus had. The only nibble I got was with Facebook. Most others either ignored my applications or told me to apply once I graduated. I managed to get an in-person technical interview with Facebook. Boy was I excited! The interview went badly though, (my mind tends to go blank when under severe pressure) and I didn't get the job or another interview. It sucks but life goes on, so I spent the rest of the semester focusing on school and trying to be positive. In December 2015 I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science (minor in Math) and a 3.0 GPA. Since then I have been applying to many jobs only to get rejection emails or to be ignored.

&amp;nbsp;

After I graduated I maintained my shitty pizza delivery job until last week. The delivery job really sucked. Management was extremely unprofessional and lots of the other employees had criminal records and came to work drunk and/or stoned. The job was very dangerous (we had a driver get robbed at gunpoint) and the wages were bad (I didn't get even a 10 cent raise in over five years and a shocking number of people don't understand the concept of tipping). I had thought about quitting many times over the years, but didn't because it was so flexible with my school schedule. I had finally had enough when a manager shouted and berated me for not answering her unimportant phone call when I was on the phone with a customer. I quit on the spot. It felt good at the time, but I have bills to pay and now no income. Since I haven't had much luck with programming jobs (just Facebook and one other place that tried to catfish me into doing data entry) I started applying to low wage jobs. A couple days after I quit I got an interview with a nearby grocery store as a stocker. Today I received a phone call with a job offer. The job only pays $7.50 an hour but I took it because I am desperate. I am starting to lose hope and becoming frustrated. Why the hell did I suffer and struggle working and going to school for the past five years to get good degree with a decent GPA only to be working with a bunch of high school kids for a quarter over minimum wage in my state. I went to school for computer science because I wanted to do programming work. I am very passionate about programming and have been programming every day since middle school. As happy as I am for their success, it is very demoralizing seeing people I graduated with who had poor programming skills, no passion, little motivation, and no experience get good jobs with high wages while I am stuck with crappy minimum wage jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

I have started to expand the companies I apply for. I have been applying recently for IT positions, even low level and low paying ones. One I applied to required a minimum of a high school diploma and an optimal candidate was to have an associates degree in a computer related field preferably computer science. I applied to this job and got a rejection email a few days later. WTF I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE! I HAVE AN A+ CERTIFICATION! Why on Earth did I not at least get a phone screening? I am sorry if this sounds like a long-winded rant from a depressing person, but I am normally not like this. My situation is making me sad and depressed.

&amp;nbsp;

I am telling my story because I want to hear your stories and if anybody can relate to my situation. I am looking for hope and advice. What did you guys do to get your first job after graduating? Thanks for listening."

I did development under the following.  

* Javascript  
* Rails [Ruby, Rspec, capybara, geocoder, activeadmin, haml, etc]
* SCSS &amp; HTML,
* Jenkins with Github (Every pull request has to be reviewed, and tested. Then tested on staging, then to prod.)
* Unix  
* Mysql &amp; Postgresql | importing/exporting databases, writing SQL and tasks. Creating error scripts to help debug.

I have lots of testing experience, and learned how to work independently.  
I worked as a front end developer from last September to January.  
(I can link you website to show you.)

I'm Junior level, I been doing rails contracts independently

I've always loved the culture, and although I speak it well I want to be proficient in Spanish.
I had looked for internships, for jobs...but it was not really serious. Plus, sometimes, when we were in bed, he would tell me not to go there (lol).
Then, he found his new gf and it's been complete NC for more than three weeks now, and of course I started to rethink my journey seriously.
 I saw them from afar yesterday night, they looked really happy, it tore my heart to pieces and it made me want to leave even more and just going so that I won't ever see him again.

Truth is I don't have anything there : no internship yet, no friends, no one that I know...And as much as I'd love to go somewhere with no plan, gap year is a part of my study and my uni friends are all telling me that I could find better opportunities in my country, that I should wait before going abroad.

I am starting to wonder if I'm not just running away from my issues : him, friendship issues...and if the brave thing to do would just be to stay and work here.

A little background:

 - I am paid 20/hr (which calculates to roughly 41k/yr)
 - I have been here about 6 months and have demonstrated that I do quality work
 - The only other person on my team left about 2 months ago, so I am the sole caretaker of my particular portion of the system
 - I left a higher paid Tech Support job somewhere else to take this internship as I wanted to use my degree

I was recently given a salaried offer of 55k, significantly lower than average entry level web devs in the area make. I knew a couple of things going into this though that would play in my favor.

 - They would be up shit creek if I left (literally no one else here knows the system I work on) and it would be very difficult to jump in and figure it out (the developer before me had very poor practices and sloppy style)
 - We are at a very important/busy stage of production

So I told him that the salary was way too low (I wasn't specific on how much I wanted) and he said he would go talk to the CEO, but that there was a good chance he would say no. In the meantime, I am going to start looking at job listings in the area, but I really do want to stay with this company as the location and culture is a perfect fit for me. So here is my question:

If the offer stays the same... is there any reason I should not just accept it (which is still a raise), find a better job at my leisure, and ditch (and screw) the company I'm at? I can't help feeling like I have the upper hand here and that they would be pretty stupid to not offer me a fair salary. Am I missing something?"

---

The Detroit Lions introduced first-round pick T Taylor Decker to the media today. The following is a quote sheet with excerpts from the media session.

##LIONS HEAD COACH JIM CALDWELL
**Opening statement:** “Good afternoon. Certainly a great day for us. We’re certainly happy about Taylor Decker coming to join us. He’s a guy that checks off all the boxes for us, toughness, athleticism, size, intelligence. He’s a guy that’s been in a program that’s won a lot of football games, he understands what winning is all about. So, without further ado, I’d like to invite him to the podium, say welcome to the family and we’re glad to have you.”
 
##LIONS T TAYLOR DECKER
**Opening statement:** “I just wanted to say, I’m really excited to be a part of this organization. It’s going to be a wonderful opportunity for me, but I realize that it’s an opportunity. So, I’m looking forward to coming in and working hard.”

**On what it means to him to hear compliments about his leadership and character:** “I’d say one, just growing up that was kind of values that were instilled in me, high character, discipline, responsibility and respect. I think that’s suited me well in my football career. I think as a leader you have to have respect for people, but you also have to be able to tell them, especially in college, when things aren’t going so well and when they are. So, I’ve always kind of been a lead-by-example guy in my college career.”

**On what he brings to the table in terms of versatility:** “I mean, versatility, you can just play multiple positions and I’m 100-percent willing to do that. It’s not like I’m going to come in and be like, ‘Oh, I want to play this or that,’ I just want to come in and work hard and I know I’m going to have to earn anything that I get here. Nothing is going to be guaranteed coming in. So, I’m just excited for the opportunity, excited to meet my teammates and just get working.”

**On what the last 18 hours have been like for him:** “It’s just been pretty wild obviously, as I’m sure it is for all the guys that got drafted last night. Everybody is congratulating you and everything. Probably one of the coolest ones was, I was hopping on the plane to come here and Matt Stafford sent me a text saying congratulations. Me being a guy who hasn’t played a down in this league, for him to reach out, that was huge, that was awesome.”
**
On what the text exchange was like with QB Matthew Stafford:** “It was just a congratulations, you know, I’m looking forward to getting to meet you and, I mean, I said the same thing. Obviously, he’s a great player and I’m looking forward to meeting him, along with all the other guys. There’s plenty of great players on this team and you know, again, I’m a guy who hasn’t played in this league, so I’m looking forward to learning from them and seeing what they have to teach me.”

**On how nice it is to have G Larry Warford here after working out with him the past few months:** “Absolutely, I mean, I’ve been out there the past few months, so I’ve gotten to know Larry. I get along really well with him. I think he’s a great guy and obviously he’s a great player. So, just having some familiarity, that will be nice to kind of have a guy there, along with some of the older veteran guys just to see what they do, learn from them. Kind of follow them to learn how to be a pro.”

**On if he’s spoken with Warford in the last day:** “Just a quick congratulations. I know once I do get some downtime, he’ll definitely be a guy that I want reach out and call, but you know, obviously right now it’s just been crazy, hectic.”

**On the highlight of today after seeing the facility and meeting new people:** “I’m just excited to be here and finally know where I’m going to be, where my new home is going to be, the people that I’m going to be working with every day. I know I’m excited to be here and get to work here this coming week. So, it’s just cool to see where my new home is going to be, for me.”

**On what the transition from Ohio to Michigan will be like for him:** “Yeah, I mean, playing there I obviously have seen the state of Michigan is very passionate about football. I have a lot of respect for that. So, I’m looking forward to being up here around a passionate fan base, people who love football. If you play football, you love that and you’ll gravitate towards it.”

**On the improvements he needs to make in his game:** “Even in run-blocking I have tons of improvements to make. I just think, one, as a lineman you have to be consistent. I think that’s the name of the game as being a lineman. So, just staying square in pass-protection and keeping proper footwork, don’t get overextended and things like that. There’s so many little subtleties that I know Coach (Ron) Prince will coach me up on and I think he’s going to make me a much, much better player.”

**On his first impressions of Assistant Head Coach/Offensive Line Coach Ron Prince:** “I think he’s a really, really intelligent guy. Obviously, just from speaking with him the few times that I have, he knows what he’s talking about. I think he really cares, wants guys to do better and again, this just from the brief time that I’ve known him. So, I’m excited to work with him, it’s going to be fun.”

**On if there is an NFL offensive tackle that he has modeled his game after:** “Not particularly. I’ve always thought that there’s certain tackles that they can do things that maybe I can’t do or I can do different things than them. It’s just how you’re built. So, I think you just take little things from each guy’s game, you look at the top tackles and you just try to model broadly, get a thing here and there. You definitely watch them, but obviously I’m going to be Taylor. There’s obviously a lot of great guys to learn from, but I’m going to have to play football too.”

**On how discouraging his first start at Ohio State was for him:** “I think that was huge for my development going forward. Winning a starting job at Ohio State was a dream of mine and then my very first start to draw Khalil Mack, that was a tough one, that was a tough one. He’s obviously shown to be a great, great player, but I think that kind of instilled in me the preparation going forward. Just because you’re playing a small school doesn’t mean those guys aren’t on scholarship either. Moving forward, just taking everything very seriously. Just because you play for this team doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy.”

**On the value of practicing against his former teammate DE Joey Bosa:** “I mean, I just think he’s an incredibly complete player. He was huge in my development, going against him every single day. Coach (Urban) Meyer would make sure that we always had matchups in practice, because he’s really strong against the run. Obviously, everybody sees his pass-rush skills, but really, really good against the run. He can shock and shed you in pass-rush. He’s quick off the ball, he has a really refined technique with his hands. He’s powerful, he’s a powerful guy. Practicing against the best every day has helped me.”

**On his experience as an intern at the Columbus Zoo:** “So, I just had a general interest in animals growing up, not like I had any crazy animals or grew up on a farm or anything. So, I went into school and majored in animal sciences and the graduation requirement for that was 200 hours of an internship. So, I was fortunate to get into the animal programs department, which is Jack Hanna’s department at the Columbus Zoo. We would have the animals that would go and do programs, go to local schools, libraries, things like that. Then, our department, not me particularly, because I wasn’t as qualified, would raise a lot of the babies. They take them home at night, they’d take home a leopard or something, so it was pretty cool.”

**On if he was able to take home the animals:** “No, no not me. I said I’m not qualified for that. I’m not qualified for that (laughing). But, I mean, it was a great, great experience as far as getting some relatable experience and something I could do with that degree and there were just great, great people there. So, I really, really enjoyed my time there.”

**On the weirdest interaction he had with an animal during his time there:** “I mean, they’re wild animals. It can be anything, you’re going to get bit, scratched, stuff like that. I wouldn’t say there was any weird interactions, I would just say that there’s just cool things that you learn. Like all the cheetahs were raised with yellow labs, because the yellow labs were their best friends and it would give them confidence because they’re kind of skittish by nature. Just little things like that, that you would never think of. We had penguins that were from Africa. People always think penguins are cold weather, stuff like that. There’s just all kinds of little things that I learned in my time there. It was definitely interesting and fun.”

**On how different his path to the NFL would have been had he decided to go to Notre Dame:** “That’s tough for me to answer, because obviously that situation didn’t play out. Growing up in Ohio I always wanted to be Buckeye and thankfully Coach Meyer gave me that opportunity and I tried to do the most I could with it. I know Ronnie (Stanley), great guy, love him and wish him all the best as well.”"

4h1w62,6,2016-04-29,Need advice - Employer changed terms of offer day before I'm scheduled to start,howzlife,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4h1w62/need_advice_employer_changed_terms_of_offer_day/,"This is with regard to a job offer I got from a major tech company. I'm in Ottawa Canada, the position is in Toronto. 

I interned at this company last summer in Toronto, and was offered a full-time position at the end of my internship, once I had finished my studies. My start date is May 2nd 2016 (i.e. monday). At the time I accepted the offer (last september), the terms outlined were: 

95k salary, 27k signing bonus, 20k bonus second year, and 53k in stock vested over four years. I should note that the email that contained the offer letter did say that the terms could change depending on where you are placed, however the offer letter I signed had those terms clearly outlined. 

I accepted, and was informed that I was placed back in Toronto sometime last November. I didn't hear anything that had to do with my salary changing between the time I got my offer (September) and today (April 29th). With the salary I was offered, I relied on it to get an apartment in Toronto, moving truck, etc. I was also given relocation expenses. 

So I'm scheduled to start monday, and I'm all set to move this weekend from Ottawa. They sent me a link yesterday with some documents to sign digitally - read them all, no problem. Then they sent me ANOTHER link today at 3pm (Friday, April 29th - 3 days before my start), with a new offer letter for me to sign, with different, significantly lower terms. The terms are: 

$80k starting salary (down from 95), 15k signing bonus (down from 27), and 10k second year bonus (down from 20). I emailed them asking about the discrepancy, and they simply told me that, since I was in Toronto, the terms were different than had I been placed where their head office is in the US.  

My issue is that this is literally the last business day before I start, and I relied on the previous offer for things like finding an apartment, car, relocating, etc. I also haven't applied to any other companies in the last 8 months, so its not like I have competing offers. 

What should I do? It's pretty douchey of them to bring this up to me on the last business day before I start, and its a big deal - it amounts to over 80k over 4 years, which is 20k per year lower. So its not like its a small amount. Also, it obviously gives me no chance to negotiate. 

I haven't signed the new letter, and I plan on going in monday. But should I talk to HR? Just sign the offer? Take the offer but start looking elsewhere? Ask for what I was promised? 

Any help is welcome "

In my GIS classes, I've learned a lot about GIS and Geography basics...enough to be dangerous basic concepts like projections, rasters, vectors, various tools within ArcMap, basic buzzwords and lingo etc. 

My idea was to just use Google Maps API, store all the data in GeoJSON files for each marker and import them to the map or try and use a database with SQL...but maybe is there a better route to do something like this?     

I do know the basics of web development. Not too concerned with knowing what languages to learn...just like what frameworks or tools to use to do something like this.

4h2mt4,4,2016-04-29,How to get an internship in writing,mmlaggan,Writing_Jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Writing_Jobs/comments/4h2mt4/how_to_get_an_internship_in_writing/,"Hi! I'm writing a wiki how page for how to get an internship in writing, anyone have suggestions? Here's what I have so far (this is just the text, it's formatted better on the wikihow : 

If your major is in Communication, Writing or English, one of the most useful and sought after skills that you can build is your ability to write and edit text. Outside of the more obvious careers like being a novelist or journalist, there are plenty of niche occupations and odd jobs that exist for writers that can at the very least help you to make money. Words are everywhere! Although writing may seem fairly intuitive to you, companies everywhere need someone who can create and well written copy in order to accurately represent their ideas, news or product.

1. Identify what type of writing you'd like to do or learn about. Because there are so many ways to apply writing in society you need to consider what kind of writing you want to do, and what you want to be writing about. A few of the different types of writing you can do are journalism, creative writing, technical writing, screen writing and communicative writing. That said, whether you want to be writing about contemporary culture, science, marketing, politics, video games, or whatever, you can become involved in any of these fields if you learn about and gain experience in the type of writing that is used within them. Decide whether it's more important to you to gain experience in a specific field or experience with writing, because some internships that are related to your field of interest may give you more experience in doing grunt work than building your writing skills.

2. Research the different careers related to your area of interest. Once you know what direction you want to move in, find out about all of the jobs involved in the field, and decide what kind of internship will help you gain those skills. People that want to be CEOs at a Fortune 500 company have to start out as a business or economics interns. If you want to be the editor-in-chief at your favorite magazine, you have to find out what internships will best prepare you for that role

3. Research internship positions available in your area. This will probably be pretty easy if you live in or near a city. That said, a lot of internships allow telecommuting if you live far away, so keep this in mind if you can't find a position of interest near you, look on the internet for positions advertised in large cities like New York and LA. A lot of companies just advertise there because there are so many people living there, but they'll allow you to telecommute from anywhere.

4. Modify your resume to suit the places to which you're applying. If you're a college student, you've probably had you're fair share of retail or food industry jobs. These positions don't matter if you didn't utilize your writing skills. Re-arrange your resume so that everything is related to writing. Even if the jobs were volunteering at an after school program for writing, or just a position on your school newspaper, make sure to use their description to talk about the writing that you did.

5. Create a cover letter. Always read the application thoroughly! If it has instructions for what the company wants included in the cover letter, follow them exactly. If a company sees that you didn’t provide all of the information they asked for, it could be a bad reflection of your communication skills. If a company doesn't include any specific instructions, just make sure your cover letter is very thorough and well thought out, but not overly wordy. Keep the language on your cover letter professional, but try to include some personality so that that they can get a sense of your style as a writer.

6. Go on interviews.  There are a number of resources on the internet that can help you to do well on any general interview, for example, http://www.wikihow.com/Have-a-Good-Job-Interview. As a writer, the same things apply, but you're going to want to bring two writing samples with you to give your interviewer. These samples don't neccessarily have to be related to the job you're applying for, (though it's normally best if they do) but make sure they contain your best work!


7. Evaluate which jobs will give you the most useful experience. Internships are about building experience and skill. Although your ultimate goal may be to work as a writer in Hollywood, an internship at a huge production company with probably just involve a lot of grunt work. However, a job at a small ad production company could give you experience in script writing for commercials, or working at a marketing agency could help you improve your writing skills by allowing you to create content for the websites of their clients. After evaluating your offers, you may have to decide if you would rather get your foot in the door or improve your writing skills.

TIPS
Attend events and network. You can learn more about what kinds of opportunities are around if you're in an environment where there are people with experience in your field. Attend a writer's workshop or a poetry reading, even if you aren't interested in creative writing, many authors and poets have day jobs in writing to help support themselves. Ask them about it.
Start your own blog. This looks GREAT on applications because it shows that you're willing to take initiative and accomplish things on your own, plus it gives you a forum on which to practice, improve and publish your work.
Learn how to use WordPress, editing softwares like adobe suites and communication platforms like mail chimp in order to make yourself more marketable. WordPress is the most widely used hosting sight on the internet. Whether you're in marketing, creative writing, journalism or anything else, writing as a whole has transformed into something that takes place largely within a digital context. The more tools you know how to use, the more appealing you will be to employers.
Join a school or local news paper. This is another great, low pressure way to practice improving your writing and editing skills."

4h365f,0,2016-04-30,"Hey, EPIC. Can you come in here? We need to talk.",POSITIVEMENTALDUDE,paragon,https://www.reddit.com/r/paragon/comments/4h365f/hey_epic_can_you_come_in_here_we_need_to_talk/,"Recently I've been seeing quite a few posts about the viability of certain champions in the current ""meta"". Now, all of you Kumbaya singing, participation medal owning, keyboard crusaders out there seem to think that there are 15 champions, (heroes or paragons whatever you want to call them) that exist in Paragon. You would be incorrect. There are currently only 6 champions in Paragon. Ill list them out for you right now in no particular order:


TwinBlast. Steel. Sparrow. Murdoc. Muriel. Rampage. 


""B-b-but VisceraL, I went 18-0 on Kallari by myself just the other day, don't you dare say shes a bad champion!"" Well that's just fan-fucking-tastic little Timmy, how did it feel beating up new guys who have played in only 1 other game total? Bet it felt reallll nice. 



Just in case you guys aren't fully grasping the current state of Paragon, let me give you guys my brief rundown of the current state of solo queue:



If I solo queue into a game as Howitzer or Gideon I am nothing short of a liability to my team after 20-30 minutes of playing. 



If I solo queue as Iggy I'm forced into some bastardization of a bruiser build that is more like a cheese strategy than what the champion was intended to be. 



If I solo queue as Sevarog, Feng Mao, or Grux I had better hope that the enemy team doesn't have a Muriel or Steel because my champion would be useless then.



If I solo queue as Dekkar or Kallari I'm essentially gimping my team for the whole game unless we're collectively MUCH better than our opponents.  



So what do we do? We play TwinBlast, Steel, Sparrow, Murdoc, Muriel, or Rampage. Aquire elo. Lose Brain Cells.


It amazes me how people can be so oblivious to the fact that ALL games are centered around Murdoc, Twin, and Sparrow being ticking time bombs that will eventually just two shot over half the characters in the game. It amazes me how people continuously give EPIC a free pass on balance for the atrocious job they've done with the carries alongside the absurd amount of utility (and not to mention damage) of Rampage, Steel, and Muriel. If this was any other game people would be flipping shit at the current state of things. People would be going absolutely mental. 


But no, we get: HUR DUUURR GAEM IS IN BETA VISCERAL STFU -1. 


Its like you people don't get the point of all of this. ITS A FUCKING BETA GAME. CHANGE SHIT. GO FUCKING NUTS FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST.


Look EPIC, here are some ideas for your interns to take credit for later: Reduce total Critical Damage from 250% down to 200% max. Try out capping flat stats. Put a limit on how many of the same card you can put in your deck. Or for a weekend try having no card limit to decks at all. Remove Muriel from the game for a rework. Un-fuck Grux. Lower Twin and Murdoc's innate attack speed. Make Prime cards actually interesting. Remove tree ward spots. Revert the Buff Timing changes you just did. Buff the OP buff mob. Make Black buff more desirable so people would fight over it as an objective. Make outer tier towers do more damage while simultaneously buffing their health. Give minions a movement speed buff when there are no other creep around, a la League of Legends. Award all CXP to the person who last hit an enemy champion regardless if they've stepped on the orbs at all. Make the side harvesters give your minions bonuses to health and damage to make them worthwhile. 



In a world where this game was honestly a beta, something would change, and quickly. But actually what has happened, is that EPIC essentially released their game to the public, untested, unfit for general consumption, and unaware of how badly they fucked up on the first iteration of Paragon. For now, I'm gonna peace out for a week or so. Play some Overwatch, watch Civil War, and drink a lot more water to re-hydrate myself because this game turned me into a salt mine. "

One day though, I saw that there was a hack in the ""to be moderated hacks"" section called ""Super Blood World"". I thought it was just a glitch, seeing as the site had just launched. I downloaded it, and patched it onto a clean Super Mario World ROM.

4h3h4k,9,2016-04-30,"Struggling with my internship, was told I'm not technical. How do I better advocate for myself?",noobintern,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4h3h4k/struggling_with_my_internship_was_told_im_not/,"Two months ago I started my internship at a well-established software company. I came from a boot camp type training program for cyber security (learned a bit about penetration testing/web application security etc.) which “partners” of the program use as a pipeline. An internship is pretty much guaranteed after completion and placement is dependent on if the team is deemed a cultural fit. In my case however, my program saw an opportunity for a new partner and sent me and another student to interview for security analyst spots for said company. We did extremely well during the interview and the team immediately took us on a campus tour and meet and greet with the team.

I’ve always been a shy person and hate being in the spot light so at first I was excited to be going into the internship with let’s call the person “S”. Through the program we attended together, I observed S as being a “people person”. He isn’t shy when approaching people, isn’t awkward about networking, and is very good at connecting with people. Me, I don’t mind networking since I know it’s a key factor to my success long term, but I dislike making connections just for the sake of networking. I tend to be more reserved and take longer to open up or work myself up to approaching someone. That’s why I was glad to be partnered with S. During the interview, he would lead on personality type questions while I would answer all of the technical ones to which he would echo what I said in his own words. I mentioned during the interview that gaming is a hobby of mine, and the manager shared that I’d fit in just fine since the team talks about gaming constantly.

Fast forward to the start of my internship, the first week went extremely well. They had a well-documented training program to get new hires up to speed. It laid out what each week would look like and what we should familiarize ourselves with. I got through all the reading my first week there and was eager to start shadowing and eventually handling incidents on my own. However, we were then told to shadow current analysts and to work on a training document for the remainder of our internship. At first I wasn’t too worried as I thought maybe the ramp up time is just a bit on the longer side… Np, I’m patient. Another couple of weeks pass with no progress and still the only project assigned to us was to work on said training document. Although we weren’t assigned work I made sure to keep myself busy and contribute in any way possible. I started taking notes during scrum meetings since I observed members of the team asking questions/having difficulties with things covered during the meetings. I received good feedback and am now the designated note taker (yay?). While shadowing I brought an email that was initially overlooked to the attention of one of the analysts that ended up being reopened and escalated for investigation. I think this helped me gain some trust as the next day one of the analysts walked me through using a template to respond to a user. I sent the email thinking YAY things are changing as I’ve earned myself more hands on. Sadly, I received an email from my supervisor later that day saying that I should get approval before reaching out on behalf of the security team. I had to explain to him that I did it under the watch and instruction of an analyst and that it wasn’t something I did to try to show that I’m taking initiative. I was well aware of the procedures set in place and explained to him that it wasn’t my intention to deviate. 
This was extremely demotivational since I worked hard in the program (top of my class) to do penetration testing/web application security type of work and now can’t be trusted to send an email using a template with supervision. Still, I figured slow ramp up time… I understand.

The interns (S and I) would meet weekly with the manager and sr. manager to discuss our progress and give feedback to the team. Each time they would say that we’re doing great and that we’re exactly the type of people they look for in new hires except there were cuts in their department and that they’re already over by 1 hire. Although the likely hood of us being converted into full-time employees post internship is very low, members of them team (mangers included) were looking for opportunities for us to stay within the company until a position opens up etc. Great news... 
A week later our supervisor came to us and shared that he has plans for the both of us. They were looking into sending S into a DevOps or penetration testing role while I was being sent to compliance. DevOps/penetration testing was exactly my thing and what I was interested in. S is not a very technical person so I couldn’t understand why he would be referred for a more technical role while I was to do more documentation work (which I hate). Through the program, I often had to help him with websites, servers, tutor him on how to do various tasks, and frantically troubleshoot why his scripts weren’t working before class when they were due (copy/paste while not being aware of smart quotes).

I was actually very disappointed but an opportunity is an opportunity so I thought to myself they probably trust me to give me work in compliance pertaining to our security team. After about a couple days I started to feel better about my opportunity with compliance but then we had another interns meeting. During that meeting S asked for feedback from the managers and they basically said the same thing as always. You’re both doing great work, keep it up… Then added that this is a more “technical” learn for me and that I should work on being more technical. Sure, great advice except they couldn’t give me any specific examples or reasoning as to why they thought I was struggling technically?
Since the start of my internship S and I have not had the opportunity to show what we can do technically. The only project that we were able to work on was a training document. One that was assigned to both of us. One that he refused to work on so I had to complete myself (he also received credit). 

Another thing is that there is a tool we use that I found a free online certification for which I shared with S and we both signed up for. It was a WebEx class so I showed up to work at 5 AM to prep for it since it started at 6. S was a no show and didn’t come in until 9 to which he was hours behind already and I had to help catch him up to speed. After completing labs, I took the exam and passed to receive my certification. S begged me to take it for him. I told him that he should at least attempt and if he’s still struggling I would help him. He never passed the exam but tells the managers that he is certified.

I'm mostly upset because I receive feedback saying that the internship is a more technical learn for me while S is doing just fine and should do work more challenging than an analyst.

Basically, my question is how do I better advocate for myself technically? And how do I deal with a partner who lies about his qualifications?

4h3mru,2,2016-04-30,I don't know where to go,chauncy4life,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4h3mru/i_dont_know_where_to_go/,"I write this being drunk and on 60mgs of adderall trying to feel something in my life. I feel lost and depressed and i feel like i have no where to turn despite me having at least in my mind plenty of places i could go and have no reason to be unhappy.

I was born in October of 1994 in Dallas Texas with one brother born two years later. My early childhood was filled with my mom and my dad fighting all the time. My earliest memories are of them screaming at each other while me and my brother sat around watching. I don’t remember much on exactly what my father was doing but according to my mom it boiled down to neglecting me and my brother while sleeping around with other women and not wanting to work. My mom was a nurse and worked third shift all the time. there was never any physical abuse other then both of them throwing shit at each other while fighting. there was an attempt at separation when i was 5ish but we turned around after packing up around half way to the my grandparents. my dad was with us so it must have been mutual and i guess they made up half way there. Nothing changed though.
	At some point when i was 8, the summer between my 3rd and 4th grade, my mom moved out and took us to live with a man she had met in indiana. I have no memory of us actually moving there except i got lice some how and my god mom helped pick at my hair. The man we moved in with has turned into a real father to me. I always call him his name but tell others that he’s my father in passing. My mom had a planters wart removed around this time and this is when she got sick. The surgeon butchers the surgery to remove it and cut a nerve by accident. she went from being an athlete to being basically disabled as its deteriorated over the years. its a long story from here till now with her health, with her almost dying when i was 16 from a screwed up gull bladder removal that nicked a bile duct. i basically have to take care of her, with my step father traveling all the time for work and my brother not wanting to help. fast forward some and I’m in college right now and in a frat and etc.
	Thats basically my life story for all purposes.

	I don’t feel happy at all. i feel like I’m close to no one except my gf that goes to school in boston, and even then some days i don’t feel close to her. I should feel close to a ton of people and have a ton of friends being in a frat but i don’t feel like that at all. During the week i can bull shit around with my brothers but i freeze up on the weekends. During parties nine out of ten times i feel frozen. i don’t talk to anyone, girls will come up and want to chat but i can barely hold a conversation. i try to hang out with my bros but it ends up with my third wheeling and eventually just going up to my room to watch tv by my self. I have a separate friend group that is from high school that i feel like i can be more relaxed around but still barely feel close to them as well, and almost always hate going out with due to the same situation above happening.
	I don’t know why i am like this, i used to be so much more out going. I have tried so many self help sources to learn to “socialize” more, and different mind set sites. things like sub reddits here, the red pill, books on being a man and social skills that go along with that. It helps but i feel like i lose my way. I even went RX, I am on wellbutrin and it hasn’t done crap to lift me out of this. 

	I genuinely feel alone, and i shouldn’t feel like this. I didn’t have a bad home life. yea it sucks sometimes being the parent and taking care of my mom at a young age but it shouldnt be this huge burden, especially compared to people that have so many worse situations out in the world. The frat has awarded me with a huge network to socialize with, and i do have a lot of friends. I have a wonderful gf, and girls come up to me at places though out the day to talk to me. I am doing decently in school even with some procrastination issues, and have internships lined up. Hell i even have an outlet with bodybuliding to take my frustrations out on that i really do love to do.

	Despite all of this i feel lost, and have this large bottomless feeling in me. i feel numb spread across a pit about to fall in. I drink to make my self feel better, i take uppers to force my self to talk more, hell I’m on anabolic steroids ( obvious bonus to my hobby aside) trying to make my self feel better with higher test levels. Ive tried counceling through the school and always end up with horrible councilors.

	I have no fucking reason to feel like this, yet for years i feel away from everyone. Im so lost. I just want to feel like everyone self. Im not suicidal or anything but i look to my future and wee nothing. I look to my present and see nothing. I don’t care about anything, i just want to sleep and lay around. 

	Im sorry if this is all disjointed, i figured maybe typing this out will make me feel better or give me an epiphany, There are so many worst off individuals that would want my life, i have no reason to feel like this. "
4h3p81,29,2016-04-30,Bimbos Are Ruining This World,Botanical-Concepts,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/4h3p81/bimbos_are_ruining_this_world/,"A bimbo is a woman that is attractive yet lacks intelligence/critical thinking and a sense of purpose/direction in their life. I am 27 year old man born of the millennial generation. I look out at the women of my generation and I ask myself this question: ""How many women these days fit that description?"". Well not all women, some women aren't attractive at all. For those that are left, many lack critical thinking and direction... either one or both. I put it to you that this is a serious problem of our time. 

The first point I would like to address is elevation by beauty. This is a topic often talked about in MGTOW/manosphere and is often called ""pussy pass"". Essentially a female can get away with some things simply because of her appearance. This elevation through beauty is partly the reason why attractive women become bimbos. Attractive women don't require intelligence, critical thinking or life planning, so they often won't develop them very well. At least compared with a man for which they are necessities for success. 

A good example I saw recently on [Jerry Liu's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhb6KGDZths) was a news intern. She was model level beautiful and was put on television her first week to demonstrate make up application or something. Undoubtedly she had been treated in a similar way alot of her life. She had been elevated by her beauty. 

There was a point where the news anchor had to go on maternity leave. This lady had the balls to walk up to the boss and ask if she could pretty please be the fill in for the news anchor. She thought her elevation through beauty was on par with real qualification... You know like elevation through skills? We elevate women because of their beauty and at the same time never call them on their smelly ass shit.  This is why the world is full of fucking millenial bimbos.

Another good example is bree olson. She is another bimbo. Attractive, dumb as a doornail, no direction. Don't get me wrong, she is smart in a cunning way. She convinced [361 manginas to donate 26,195$ in 15 days](https://www.gofundme.com/rehabforbreeolson) on her gofundme page. This despite being worth over 5 million dollars. How? ""Ohh I'm a poor little princess and I need therapy to help recover from my trauma"". You mean the vaginal trauma from being gang banged by 10,000 cocks? Oh but you said there is nothing wrong with porn. Disgusting. That kind of manipulative intelligence is everything wrong with women. She is a bimbo.

And women are trained and encouraged to behave like this. I even feel within myself sometimes the ""urge of the inner mangina"" as barbar puts it, to favour girls and women and give them the pussy pass that will turn them into bimbos. Muslims put birkahs on women and cover them up. I think us western men need to cover up our inner mangina and hide it away from the preying eyes of bimbos like bree olson.

You can see how women are trained to act like bimbos from a young age. Youtube channels like [yuya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPH4rfrm7_g) or [bethany mota](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6xjSnEqok) teach young girls that make up, fashion and handbags are the first priority in life.I understand there is an inclination towards these things, partly because they improve sexual market value. But fostering a culture that exacerbates natural hypergamous inclination isn't helping one bit. 

These kinds of ""bimbo"" beauty channels show the vanity of females. And I mean vanity in an Ecclesiastes kinda way like ""woe woe all is vanity and useless"". It shows how women are satiated by boring bullshit. And not only that make up, fashion and handbags are satisfying persuits... but they are top priorities which you should pursue. The more a woman relies on her a appearance, the more of a bimbo she is likely to become. 

There is one last thing I would like to bring up which I have been thinking about most recently; Blogilates. For those of you who don't know Blogilates is fitness youtuber, the most popular female fitness youtube channel I believe. Her content isn't as bad as the make up channels because diet and exercise is important. But damn her exercise and food offerings are terrible. 

Basically Blogilates has made alot of illegal youtube copyright claims in an attempt to dampen criticism of her. Specifically these criticisms are coming from the vegan community criticizing her diet. The strange thing is, her last few food videos are all vegan recipes. To me this signals that she made those videos for money, and she filed the illegal copyright claims for money. What a fake two faced cunt. 

I have been listening to barbarosa recently (I never used to, it was Stardusk who I first started listening to back in 2012). He made note on his channel that ""glitz and glamour are girls things"". He said this in reference to the recent MGTOW vs anti-feminist saga. Basically the anti-feminists try to ""intellectually pwn"" people in a glitzy way whereas MGTOW prefer more of a radio style content focused presentation on youtube (generally). 

But bimbos like glitz and glam. Blogilates channel is exactly like this. Anyway one who has watched any kind of bimbo/beauty channel channel will know what I'm talking about. The shitty girly music, the giddy dancing, the fake smiles. Some of these bitches have 1 minute long fake as fuck intros. 

In her videos ***oh vegan recipes are great*** in her copyright claims ***fuck you if you criticize me***. It reminds me that generally women don't want free speech (i.e. freedom to criticize them openly). Which was demonstrated most recently by [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFrZsGbO6N0) particular land whale. 

Anyway those are just some things I thought I would share and please sahre yer own thoughts. Feel free to check out this [companion video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piXCcDwYi9Q) I have prepared."

This is a wonderful sub-reddit. Im transitioning from the PS4 to a PC, and without any prior PC building knowledge, Im finding that a bit difficult. My brother had some old parts lying around, and I managed to get them together (with the help of YouTube), and make a functioning PC. So far the specs:

Intel Core 2 Duo E7500 @ 2.9ghz.
Nvidia GTX 520.
4gb of ddr2 ram.
Cooler Master RS-430-PCAR PSU
Not exactly sure about the motherboard, but it's some local brand (Pakistan)

Now Im 16, and to pair that up I live in Pakistan, where the price of hardware is insane, several hundreds of dollars more than the original. My family doesn't really support me in the PC building stuff. So I work internships to earn some cash. I have about 150-170$ in hand right now. What steps should I take to make this into a decent gaming rig. Im not looking for anything fancy. But something that can run modern games on medium- high-ish settings with good frame rates. I've looked into a few things, and thought of buying the 950, with a better PSU and a quad core processor of ebay. I'd appreciate if you guys could help me out here."

UK citizen here.,curls4dgurls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4h4ain/advice_is_this_internship_offer_good_uk_citizen/,"Hi. So I'm in the midst of interviews for a large American insurance company. The role is for a Software Developer internship for 11 months. The job is provided as a partnership between my Uni and the company. They are offering visa fees paid for. 3K$ upon arrival to help with accommodation. And 18-25$ a hour. I will be based in either Seattle or Boston. The amount they are paying sounds like a lot to me as in the UK a similar position would only be netting me around 10-15$ an hour. But I know these cities are expensive. If this was on either the lower end or the higher end of what they are offering me would I be able to live comfortably and have a good time over there? I'm leaning towards the Boston area if I get to choose as the flights back to the UK are pretty cheap. What are your thoughts? 

I really want to get out to America after I graduate so this may be the best option I have.

my personal examples of moments of awful storyline fuckery editings:

i've never been a pearl stan, but i was feeling a lot of bullying towards herself, her real story. she never needed pity to be popular.

awful copy and paste parts to put down the loser's performance on LSFYL

derrick and bob's feud as if they hated each other. i've had worse fights in high school.

darienne and bendelacreme.

rebecca glasscock as the 'underdog' and shannel as the 'arrogant.' yes, shannel is full of entitlement, but on season 1 bitch had nerve. and, yes, she deserved to win some challenges.

tyra sanchez's storyline was mildly uninteresting towards the ending, as if she wasn't there. her image was really rough at the beginning. on the other hand, i still think she deserved to win.

ginger minj was CLEARLY the favorite to win, but i guess some intern was pissed with wow, because her portrayed image was really a rough spot, gurl. i couldn't understand her edit at all. can we talk about an underdog? violet chachki. she wasn't pinned to win at all, imo. she really came through.

I really don’t know if I should stay with my girlfriend. We have a relationship for more then 2 years. But I am doubting if I should stay in this relationship. I feel like she doesn’t tread me well but when I discuss something with her, she is mosto of the time unreasonable. Let me give you guys some examples:




1.Last year me and my girlfriend were driving on our way to the theathers for a movie. On the way we talked about things and I said I watched a Demi Lovato (I like her as an artist and went once to a concert of her) clip where she covers Adele’s Hello. Out of nowhere she started to freak out. She screamed at me that I should never watch her again. She was really mad. And that all because of a Youtube video.



2.Me and my friends want to go to a party later this month. My girlfriend is okay with it ONLY if i go with my friends. Because I have a friend who regulary brings his girlfriend with her. So if my friend brings his girlfriend, my girlfriend wont let me go to that party. And my girlfriend doesn’t even know her like wtf.



3.Last year I had a internship at a small company with only female colleagues. And guess what? My girlfriend told me she didn’t like her, even with out knowing them. And When I was at my internship I texted with my girlfriend. But when I didn’t respond for a while for no good reason, she thought I had a good time with my female colleagues while my girlfriend didn’t allow me to have a good time with my colleagues. And later on in the internship, I had a project for 2 weeks where I worked with some other colleagues from the same company but from other offices. Both male and female colleagues. When I told her I had that project, she wanted me to search only the females colleagues who are also working on that same project with me just to see if they are goodlooking.




Don’t get me wrong. I am also not the perfect boyfriend and I made lots of mistakes during our relationship, but isn’t this just a little too much? I really need some thoughts about this.


TLDR: should I stay with my girlfriend after she regulary overreacts?

4h56io,7,2016-04-30,We're slowly fading away,grossko19,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/4h56io/were_slowly_fading_away/,"We (22F and 24M) have been together for 3 years, an ocean apart, saw each other 4 times + 5 months in the same country + 3 months living together.

The last time I kissed him goodbye was on a sunday night, 21st of February, and to cheer me up I kept thinking to myself: ""the more goodbyes we say, the less goodbyes we've yet to say"" and that's true, unfortunately not in the sense that we'll soon close the distance but we might be breaking up in the near future. This time after he left I found myself completely empty, we parted without plans of seeing each other in the near future and with the fact that it'll still take me three years to get my bachelor in International Relations. He doesn't have money and if he doesn't find a summer internship he won't be able to visit me next year, my country is under a severe crisis and I can't find a job to help me raise any big amount onf money (I've been selling cookies at my university though), big enough to make up for all the astronomic conversion rates I'll face to buy tickets and go to Europe. Given all this, today we tried to facetime but when I'm available, he's studying or watching football and when he's available, I'm studying so we just closed the topic by saying ""Okay baby, we'll find a time that works."" We're definitely out of sync and I don't know how much I'm invested in improving this situation.

A background to my situation is nice since we've been through tough times. I found out he cheated on me a few times while living in China, I also heard him saying to the friend who lived there with him and just went back that if (my boyfriend) he was invited to visit him in China, he would never leave again and just start living there, obviously without me since I wouldn't spend a second in China given all the cheating trauma and value conflicts. The last straw was ruling out the possibility of seeing him this summer, before even knowing if I'd have the money. He straightforwardly said: ""No, you can't come here in July because I have to work."" but he doesn't have a job yet nor looks for one and when I pointed out some interesting summer internships that deal specifically with Latin America he just says that he'll check it later.

Of course I'm no saint, I have my own mental/personality problems that makes me either cling or distance myself to the point of breaking every possibility of contact with the person. Last month I was crying on my phone and breaking things cause he was too drunk to let me know he arrived back home from the club, now it feels like an effort to talk to him. All this uncertainity led me to cheat on him a few weeks ago, I went to a rave with a friend of mine and stayed by his side the whole night, if it was my boyfriend he would just disappear in the crowd, come back to give me water and then disappear again. I knew what I was doing, I won't put the blame on any substance cause I chose to kiss that guy and dance till morning with him, but I doubt I would have done this had I a ticket to see him, had I tickets for summer festivals to go together, had I any proof that I'm not on a sinking boat.

Everything now keeps me wondering if it's worth to wait for a guy I don't even know if I'll see again. I love him a lot, I love all of our memories, good times and bad time, I would give everything to experience life with him together but being 22 and that unsure blocks my ability to wait and look forward to a future I don't know if will come.

Everyone is fairly tight knit, and many of the employees have worked together in some capacity for years.

When I started, I was excited to finally get some exposure as a developer. I was told I'd be working in languages and frameworks I was keen to gain experience with, and would have a mentor to answer my questions and take some ownership of my learning. 


Unfortunately, after starting with the company it quickly became obvious that my team lead's attendance record was poor. There have been roughly 160 work days since I started in August, and in that time he's taken 58 sick days and 15 vacation days. 72 days off since the end of August, you read that right.


At this point, it's basically become ""flip a coin, maybe Mike comes in today"". The most frustrating thing to me is how nobody on my team discusses it. Nobody mentioned to me, ""Hey the person who's supposed to be giving you some direction and feedback is going to be out of the office nearly half the time you're here"". They act like it's some unusual event when we're holding another status meeting and our team's head is missing - honestly the other senior developers are the leaders of the team in all but name.


My confidence in my ability to write code has absolutely cratered. Mike missed nearly 3 weeks of my first month when needs for onboarding and guidance were at their highest. I was told that another developer would help me get ramped up, but this new guy's explanations were so poor and contradictory at times that I got nowhere. Imagine taking the time to work through a tough task for the better part of two weeks, getting guidance from the more junior developers on my team and people outside of it. I'm feeling pretty good about what I've written, tests are passing. Mike comes in after a lengthly absence, reads through my code and tears it apart. He doesn't like that I used a design pattern his team typically avoids, he's confused as to why I didn't make use of some obscure classes that our platform team created three years ago (and that I've never seen until he mentioned it). All of these comments are delivered in a terse and condescending way, then poof - he's gone for an indeterminate amount of time because ""Dang, I started feeling sick again"".


Mike is a nice enough guy outside of work. He's clearly smart and when he's around he often has some very helpful advice to give. What's frustrating is that he's never explained WHY he is absent so often. I completely sympathize with his situation if he's struggling with physical or mental health issues, however I think it's irresponsible on his (and more importantly, our company's) part to maintain his position. 


I'm a highly driven individual. I want to be good at what I do and I want to make the most of this opportunity. It really bothers me to watch the company's other interns make an impact on their respective teams while receiving consistent feedback and guidance. I kept telling myself it would get better, that I could learn what I needed without having my supervisor present. I didn't bring up my frustrations because I didn't want to rock the boat. Requests to move to other teams on a different pretence were rejected.


I'm wrapping up this internship in May before starting a new one with a different employer in June. I'm honestly feeling absolutely defeated, like I'm a crappy developer incapable of learning. I really enjoy working with software, but now I'm going in to the next job with no confidence. The silver lining is that I've met my new team and have been really impressed by how well they communicate and function together.


Anyways, that's my rant. I'd appreciate people sharing advice.

4h5p46,2,2016-04-30,Econ student looking for advice on landing first finance internship or entree level position.,anxstudent101,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4h5p46/econ_student_looking_for_advice_on_landing_first/,"
Looking for some career advice and guidance. Background - I’m early 20s F and started a liberal arts education at a really good school. Stopped and started working in media business development for about 2 years. Realized the culture wasn’t for me, I wanted something more analytical and fast paced and enrolled in a cheaper state school where I live and am finishing my degree in Econ. Right now, I’m focusing on getting a bulk of my gen ed requirements out of the way and I haven’t taken any Econ courses yet. I read a lot, follow courses online, write about business and talk to the coupe of friends I have in finance and that’s the extent of my ‘technical’ finance/econ credentials. I also live in a very popular city for finance. 

Once I was back in school I started reading a lot about pursing a career in finance and the path people take and have become very insecure and lacking confidence because everything I read tells me to have rich parents, come from an Ivy, be a member of every club and sports team available to you and have something stellar and singular to put on your resume that sets you apart from the thousands of other applicants. I have a really strong resume that shows I have stable work experience and have excellent grades, pretty good SAT scores and qualifications. But, I don’t have any ‘finance’ criteria necessarily. Which makes me feel like that is something I need to focusing on this year to put on my resume. I can graduate by late 2017 or early 2018, depending on my course load. Part of me feels like I should relax for the rest of this year and complete the bulk of my credits, but another part of me is afraid that if I don’t start building a more finance targeted resume that I will be fucked. Is this normal? Am I being irrational/jumping the gun or practical and smart? I don’t understand how so many 20 year olds who have no work experience can somehow get internships on the trading floor of major BBs while someone a couple years older with years of bizdev experience (me lol) feels massively under qualified and scared to even apply. (not a rhetorical statement, I really don't understand! What do they talk about in interviews? Course work and how taking a class on financial modeling and reading The Intelligent Investor inspired them to work in finance? Real question). 

I understand networking is very important, but like I said I don’t come from a super finance heavy community - does that really matter? Most of the people I know who have stable careers in finance (young and old) just applied online and took it one step at a time. Is the internet making me more insecure with these “10 steps to a career in finance” overgeneralization of the market? Has anyone else felt this way? I would love to start interning for something related to finance/accounting by the fall semester that would be 2-3 days a  week so I could continue with taking 18 credits, is this realistic? Both my schools job/career nets are decent (even though my previous school is a major feeder into wall st), what are other good places to look online? Should I be reaching out to recruiters or people via linkedin? If so, how do I do that? What do I say? I appreciate any and all feedback, but please be specific! I’ve been reading every other post on every forum I can find and everyone’s feedback and advice is very general and vague. 

Does anyone really know what part of finance they want to pursue while they’re in college? Maybe this is a poor perspective on the outside but how can anyone really explain to an interviewer why they want to be an investment banker when they’re 20 and have never had a job? Do recruiters/interviewers believe these answers lol? What are they looking for?

If its too soon for finance, what are some other options that seem more realistic that would be impressive to financial recruiters? Or maybe looking into smaller boutique firms? 

People in finance - how did you get your first job/internship? School career fair? School job/career site postings? Did you stress as much as I'm stressing haha? Did you applying through company website? Recruiter? Connection? Any specific feedback of the process, what you put on your coverletter, things to add to resume, important extra curricular or other work you think made a significant impact on your application. Should I be panicking... 

A very helpful question to answer - what exactly do you do as an entree level intern in finance or accounting? Specifically. I would like to become more familiar with these skills so I can add to resume and cover letters and feel more prepared for interviews. 


Thank you! "

My ex gf and I met in college and lived next door to each other in the dorms.  We became friends and I asked her out, we dated for two years and 3 months.  She was my first girlfriend, first kiss, first everything, and she always said she was so glad she was my first and she wanted to be my only.

The first year of our relationship was amazing.  We were madly in love and I didn't think either of us would ever stop loving each other.

About a year ago I lost a job at a company that had contracted me to work for them for 3 years after I graduated college.  Since then I have scrambled to find a career choice that could make me happy, but mostly in my experience I don't find full time jobs enjoyable and I like the idea of maybe one day just being a stay at home dad and house husband because I love kids and enjoy doing sweet things for my SO.

All the time I was spending trying to figure out what I wanted to do, while at the same time my gf was as well, and went through a crisis of if she even enjoyed her field of work.  I tried to make suggestions and help her through all of the trying times in her life, as well as her anxiety about social situations and other problems.  I wasn't perfect but I tried to be a loving boyfriend all the way through.  Because she was socially anxious and didn't have many friends, we often ended up spending our time together just cuddling and doting on each other and watching Netflix.

Around the time I lost my job though, I started sinking into depression and felt hopeless about my future and that caused me to be scared for my relationship with the woman I loved.  I would go through times of feeling no emotions and it was very strange.  I would say really weird things, honestly I don't even remember what I said, I would just remember feeling despair, then my gf would be crying, and I would try to console her.  These episodes would happen pretty frequently for about 2 months, but I managed to get a part time job and a summer internship and they stopped.

She managed to get an internship far away, so for the second summer in a row, we were long distance.  I was working 56 hours a week and for most of her internship, she wasn't doing much and was bored, and she hated it for most of her time there, so I was helping her with the stresses of her job in a new city while working 56 hours a week and trying to help my roommate who told me he was going to kill himself.

Fast forward to this past fall, things seem to be going well with our relationship, although I still don't have a job for after school and am just trying to focus on actually graduating and I'm starting to try to actually talk to her about planning a way to move to the same city so we don't have to date long distance after she graduates (I graduated in December, she graduates in a week).  We even traveled a great distance and went to a job fair in Atlanta together to try to maybe find a job at the same company.  I should mention here that she felt hopeless about her job search and actually was entertaining the idea of moving back with her parents in a really tiny town where there are no jobs for her to work at a fast food restaurant she worked at in high school.  However, I tried to discourage that because she's amazing at what she does and suggested she come move in with me in a bigger city where she could have a better chance to find a job in her field.  She was not very open to that idea and would avoid talking about a compromise any time I brought it up.

Fast forward again, I graduated and moved back in with my parents while I found a job.  I text her often because I'm insanely bored all day but she's super busy, she tells me she feels suffocated and doesn't want to talk about marriage for a while.  Ok, I oblige.  I realize she's in her last semester in college and wants to enjoy her time there, so I try to cut back on texting her as much because she's busy and wants to see her friends before they all go their separate ways.  2 months pass and I finally get a job and move to a new city... which I get fired from after 2 weeks because I was given no training and wasn't capable enough.  I go full panic mode that night and Skype my girlfriend feeling insanely depressed, and tell her I feel like if I didn't have her in my life I would have killed myself already (I know, terrible thing to say, but I was in an awful place).  We both end up crying, I apologize, she kind of stops talking to me for a couple days.  When she finally does we have a good talk and she says she feels better after talking to me and really missed talking to me because I'm her best friend.

I decide to search for a different kind of job in my field and get one after about a week, but they don't want me to start until a month after I accept the position, so I've been spending the last month basically alone in my apartment in a city that I've never lived in before, too scared and depressed to really go do anything.

During the past month I went to spend time with my girlfriend only once even though it's only a two hour drive to her, because she was so busy, which I understood because she's trying to graduate and everything.  Also, she now suddenly loves what she does after debating for a long time if she even wanted to be in her field, got an internship at a place two states away, and suddenly seems to have found herself.

Then after about another two weeks she calls me and we have a long talk, she says we at least need to take a break.  She wants us to spend time figuring ourselves out, she has been lying to herself and hasn't been happy for a while, she feels like every time I'm with her she's responsible for entertaining me and making me happy.  She says that if we could make it long distance until August, when her internship/job ends, that we might be able to end up together, but she doesn't want to make me wait or make it hurt worse later.  She says she's benefited from our relationship but for right now, we need to focus on ourselves.  She also says that I should work on myself and once I feel like I've figured out what makes me happy that we could talk again about our compatibility, but right now we are at a crossroads and want different things.

For the most part I agree with her, I need time to work on myself because I've spent so much time trying to help her and others in my life that I was ignoring the fact that I'm depressed and have not been a person I'm happy with for the past year.

She broke up with me two weeks ago, but she said she'd still talk to me and help me any way she could because she does miss talking to her best friend (me).  So we talked for a week about random shit and I told her if she needed space to tell me.  She did eventually and we haven't talked in a week.  I want to work on myself, but mostly I just want her back and I feel like now that I see clearly all of the things that have gone wrong in my life in the past year, I could both be in a relationship with her and work on myself.

So, if anyone actually read all this, what do I do now?  Is there any hope for getting back together with her or should I just try to forget about her and move on?

tl;dr: Please read all of it, but basically I've spent the last year and a half of my life trying to help others, like my now ex girlfriend find herself, and my suicidal roommate, instead of focusing on self growth.  I'm now so far behind in being happy by myself that my girlfriend broke up with me.  What do I do now?"

As far as my resume goes, I got rid of my work experience and just filled it up with projects that I have worked/am working on. I just have one job on there. So far, the people who looked at it like what I have on there, including professors. Any thing I should be doing? Is my GPA too low? Is it my lack of experience?

I think I'll do fine eventually, but I'm just worried about my current situation."

I would like to ask her out but unfortunately if she were to say no then that would make work quite awkward so I think i will wait until september when she is finished placement.

4h6egk,2,2016-04-30,Burned out and a bit confused on how to proceed,tyrael71,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4h6egk/burned_out_and_a_bit_confused_on_how_to_proceed/,"**Background**
I graduated from a CS+Econ bachelors last summer, decided to take a year off anything related to academia and did some freelance work + a product management internship until now. During college I worked full-time. I have approx. 2 years of experience as an engineer (web+mobile) + 1 product management internship + some projects. I am 22.

**Current situation**
I have been job/internship searching for a few months, my mistake was that I started applying late and most intern slots are taken. Currently I am discussing full-time opportunities with a few startups (but none of the Big 4/big ones). I have also been accepted to a few MSc's in London and Amsterdam (I am from Europe).

Currently it seems my options are either doing a masters (I've been accepted to a few programs in the UK) or going for a full-time opportunity.

**Problem**
I am somewhat burned out because of the very disappointing culture of the teams I have previously worked with. Although I feel I've learned a lot technically, the environment hasn't been oriented towards growth and some of the work was what I would call meaningless. As such, I've developed what you would call 'trust issues' with regards to the next company I work for. I don't feel attracted to the companies I am currently discussing with but don't have anything else lined up either.

I am not sure if this is the right attitude to have as there much more developers than there are companies and I haven't been working for a lot of time in the field, however right now it feels like 80% of the companies out there are doing completely pointless things. I love programming, however I would like to contribute to a product/company that is actually doing something meaningful.

I decided to learn some new things and have been learning golang and doing a machine learning course and am really enjoying learning on my own and doing my own small projects. These past months of learning on my own have been much more enjoyable and fulfilling than what I've previously done. *If I would not accept a job for a while and continue to learn on my own, how much of a hit would my career take?*

Another issue right now is confidence. I feel like I am not good enough for the companies I would want to work for. *For a person just out of school with some experience what would it be strange to wait until I do a masters and apply for an internship this fall?* I've done ~200 problems on leetcode/hackerrank/lintcode and all the problems in CTCI (I enjoy problem solving), however after applying for their full-time positions I haven't heard anything back.

I am sorry if this is not very coherent, I am still trying to understand exactly what the issue is, however having just recently finished school there is somewhat of a pressure to get into work again."

I'm a 21 yo student studying CS, currently in my second year. I only started programming in my first year of university so I had no prior experience with it before that.      
I have been taking it very seriously, because I want to be in a very good position financially by the time I'm 25.      
Everyone I know from the field, says I need to dedicate a lot of my time to study , practice programming , work on personal projects, and this will put me ahead of most people when I'll be looking for jobs.        
I enjoy programming but I can't say I enjoy doing it in my free time. I have other hobbies that I would like to develop. I also want to have a normal life outside. Rest on weekends, go hiking, travel, clubs too.     
But everytime I'm doing something different than programming , I feel kinda guilty, because I'm not working towards my main goal.        
But at the same time I'm seeing other people that seem to be enjoying their early 20's ,and they don't care nearly as much as me. They spend a lot of time outside, carefree.      I kinda envy them, that they have the luxury to do what they like all the time.        One really sad moment I had : It was a beautiful evening , very nice sunset, some friends invited me to play football, but I said no because I have to work. I was seeing them from my window playing and enjoying themselves, and I just felt miserable.           
So I'm just torn between two things. I have to practice, but at the same time I want to enjoy life.        
I did an internship the previous summer, and it was really depressing and unusual for me to see the sun for 15 minutes in the morning, work from 10-6, see the sun another 15 minutes in the evening while I'm going to the gym, and by the time I'd get out of the gym , it would be dark. And then I think that someday I'll get  hired and I'll have to do the same shit all day.            
                   

                 
                         
So successful people , in their mid twenties who have made it. Older guys. It this shit worth it? How did you do it? How did you balance your work-life? Do you ever feel miserable because of your type of job? Do you ever felt like missing out on life?        
Sorry if everything I wrote confuses you....I'm confused myself"
4h6sdy,37,2016-04-30,Art,BaronVonRuthless91,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4h6sdy/art/,"Old photographs and paintings have always seemed a little bit creepy.  As it turns out there is often a good reason for this.  The old black and white photographs required that the subject of the photo stay perfectly still for a very long period of time.  This was obviously very difficult to do and as a result a very peculiar thing began to occur.  The photographs were taken only after their subjects were dead.  After all, dead men do not move.  Well, usually they don’t anyhow.  This gives those old photos of the children all dressed up in their Sunday best, a more sinister side now that we know that a lot of times Junior was a rapidly rotting corpse when he posed for that photo.  Maybe it is because of this that we are slightly unnerved whenever we are around paintings or statues.  Anyone who has ever seen an old Scooby-Doo mystery knows that if there is a painting in the room its eyes are almost certain to move the minute everyone’s back is turned.  I always brushed these stories of cursed paintings and the like aside as nonsense.  As I grew older, however, I encountered a few things in my life that made me reevaluate my earlier skepticism.  Some of these stories, such as my run in with a pissed of Aztec idol while I was away at college and a near miss with what might have been a Wendigo when I was working at a Boy Scout camp, I have already related on this very subreddit.  This is another such story.


When I graduated college I was in a bit of a tight spot when it came to money.  As it turns out not many schools are looking to hire teachers who have just graduated and have little classroom experience outside of student teaching.  Most of the people I talked to made some mention of me “putting in my time” in the profession.  This meant substitute teaching.  Unfortunately there was very little demand for substitute teachers in my hometown over the summer vacation and I was forced to seek alternate employment in order to get ahead of my student loan payments.  There was also the fact that I was beginning to seriously think about proposing to my girlfriend, Emily, and I was quietly setting aside money in order to buy a proper ring.  This was how I ended up working for our local historical society as a seasonal employee.  Usually they had interns from a nearby college to help out but, seeing as it was summer vacation, they were shorthanded and were willing to take on anyone who handed in a resume.  My job for the summer was to help out with cataloging and moving around any new acquisitions that the society came into possession of.  That was the summer that the historical society finally got its hands on the Cole Mansion.  


The Cole family had been lived in the area for pretty much as long as anyone could remember and the last member of the family had just died.  Let me revise that.  What I meant to say was that the last surviving member of the family, Ezra Cole, had just been declared dead.  He had disappeared seven years previously and in Pennsylvania that is how long you have to be missing before you are declared dead.  The mansion had fallen into disrepair over the last few years as the caretaker of the estate, a highly unpleasant man by the name of Charles Lee, had been in legal trouble for suspected tax evasion and it was suspected that he may have behaved inappropriately with children.  As a result, he only had a little time to look after the property.  Anyhow, the estate was now the property of the historical society, much to Lee’s displeasure, and I went along to take inventory of what exactly the society had gotten its hands on.  It quickly emerged that the late Ezra Cole had fancied himself a bit of an artist.  The interior of the house was full of paintings, statues, and old photographs that were doubtless of immense historical significance.  


The first sign of the trouble to come was when we entered the library.  The paintings in this room were different.  There were far less of them, only four in fact, and they were all turned around so that they were facing the wall.  For some reason Cole had not wanted to look at these paintings.  I turned the paintings around with the help of my friend Robin, who was also working for the society for that summer.  (The job market for theology majors was even smaller than that for English teachers as it turned out.)  When we turned around the first painting Robin let out a small squeak of fright and practically dropped the damn thing.  My grumbles of annoyance were quickly silenced as I saw what the painting depicted.  The painting was…disturbing.  It depicted a witch burning by a band of puritans only this witch burning had not gone exactly as expected.  The witch was tied to the stake, to be sure, but she was laughing and her face was contorted into a look of maniacal glee.  Instead of her being burned, it was the villagers surrounding her who were being devoured by the flame.  As the men, women, and children of the village (I believe there were twelve of them depicted) screamed in pain, the witch continued to laugh and laugh and laugh.  I shuddered and set the painting down.  


Of the other three paintings, two of them were almost as disturbing.  The first showed a medieval torture chamber where a man lay stretched out on a rack.  The door to the dungeon was only open a crack, but it showed a long torch lit hallway and, at the far end, a figure approaching.  The face of the man in the rack showed one of the most realistic looks of fear I have ever seen depicted as he looked toward the partially open doorway.  The next painting was far more modern.  It showed a scuba diver exploring the wreck of a sunken ship.  The unsettling thing about this painting was the faint shadow of a shark which was reflected onto the wall behind the unsuspecting diver.  The man was being hunted and he had no idea.  The final painting was far less disturbing, or so I thought at the time, as it only depicted a forest clearing which was dyed a shade of red by the setting sun.  I wondered why this painting had been turned in the same way as the others.  There didn’t seem to be any violent subject matter being depicted here.


Both Robin and I were feeling a little bit spooked at this point.  The bright light of the afternoon had faded into twilight and neither of us wanted to be in the house after dark.  We locked up and got into Robin’s car to head back to the society and drop some paperwork off.  As we pulled out of the gate to the estate we heard the unmistakable sound of crackling flames, and something very large and glowing hurtled past the car and crashed into the road in front of us.  Robin swerved to miss the object and we quickly pulled over.  I half expected the comet, or fire demon, of whatever it was, to have vanished by the time we got out of the car to examine it, but it was still there crackling away.  It was it this point that we realized that the thing in the road was a human body.  It was at this point that Robin was violently sick.  It was also at this point that I decided to call the police for the first, but not the last, time.  The police arrived very promptly as the town was very small and boring and the most action the police ever saw was when the local college students got overly drunk on St. Patrick’s day.  As a result the police seemed to have a sort of morbid excitement at having an actual corpse to deal with.  Robin and I gave our statements but I don’t think the police thought we were very reliable witnesses.  After all, we did claim that the burning body had come hurtling past our car like a wrathful dragon.  They tested both of us for alcohol and drugs before finally deciding to let us go.  As I left I glanced back towards the mansion one last time.  For a brief moment, so brief that to this day I cannot swear that my eyes were not playing tricks on me, I saw a brief flash of movement in the library window.  I stared at the window for a few minutes more but then the cops started giving me weird looks again and I decided to leave.


The next week or two were very frustrating for the historical society.  The front entrance to the Cole Mansion was now technically a crime scene and the police were in no hurry to speed up the process.  The body was too badly burned to identify so they sent it off for DNA testing which would take a couple of weeks.  The body had been projected from within the grounds of the mansion and so the cops were taking advantage of this fact to poke around the grounds looking for evidence for the upcoming trial against Charles Lee while they had the excuse that they were investigating the burning corpse.  After two weeks of the property being in limbo, the police finally wrapped up the crime scene tape and let us back on the property.  A side effect of this was that Charles Lee now refused to leave us alone whenever we were in the house.  He was technically still the caretaker of the estate, and he was convinced that he would be arrested if he set foot off the property so he now had nothing to do but harass Robin and me while we were working in the house.  Robin and I had barely set foot in the library when Robin cast a nervous glance at the paintings.  His face went pale and he tore out of the room with a wail.  Lee burst out into laughter at this.  I found Robin in the front entrance of the house sitting at the bottom of the staircase rocking back and forth.


“All right,” I asked.  “What happened this time?  You saw those creepy paintings before and you were able to handle them.”


“Think really hard about the painting of the witch burning,” he replied after a minute of silence.  “How many villagers did you see getting burned in the painting?”


I thought about it for a minute.  “Twelve, I think.  I can’t swear to an exact number.”


Robin shuddered.  “I was afraid of that.  I counted twelve of them last time to.  There are only eleven now.”


“We must have counted wrong.”  I reassured him.  As I said this I felt a shiver run up my spine that I quickly banished from my mind.  The last thing we needed was for both of us to have a nervous breakdown.


I went back to the room and carefully examined the paintings.  Sure enough, there were eleven villagers being burned alive by the witch.  I could not be sure but I thought that one of the men was missing from the picture.  I decided to take a look at the other paintings.  The first one I checked was the one of the clearing in the woods at sunset.  There were no apparent changes.  I could not swear to the same with the other two paintings.  I looked at the picture of the medieval torture chamber and the door seemed to be open a couple more inches than it had the last time I was in the house.  At the same time the figure at the end of the corridor looked like it had come closer.  In the painting of the scuba diver the shadow of the shark had disappeared entirely.  I went into the middle of the room, well away from the paintings, and considered the matter.  If there were changes to the pictures they were slight.  I had no solid proof of anything and it was entirely possible that I had let my imagination run away with me.  Maybe there was no shadow of a shark.  Maybe the door had always been open that much.  Maybe there had always been only eleven people being burned.  At the same time, there was the unmistakable fact that a burning corpse had been hurled in front of Robin’s car the last time we left the house.  THAT was not in my imagination.  I took out my cell phone and snapped multiple photos of the paintings.  If anything else happened I would hopefully have proof this time.
That night, after Robin and I had left, I went to our local library and placed an anonymous call to the police station.  I told them that I had seen a suspicious figure snooping around the Cole Mansion and trying to break in.  I quickly hung up before they could trace the call.  Hopefully there would now be someone else keeping an eye on the place in case there were any shenanigans.


  The next day Robin tried to persuade our boss, a stuttering history professor named Dr. Whitmore, that our services could best be used elsewhere.  Unfortunately the Cole Mansion was vast and the higher ups in the historical society wanted the place evaluated as soon as possible.  If we wanted to keep our jobs we would have to continue working in the mansion.  Robin almost quit at that point.  The only reason that he did not was because I was staying on.  Robin did not like the idea of being under the same roof as those paintings but he liked the idea of leaving me there with no one, other than creepy old Charles Lee, to help if things went pear shaped.  Why did I stay?  Honestly I needed the money.  I suspected that something was going on and I was by no means a skeptic due to previous experiences.  At the same time, I thought of the wedding ring that I would propose to Emily with once I had enough money.


There was one good thing that came out of our meetings with Dr. Whitmore.  I managed to convince him that the mansion was too big for us to handle by ourselves and it was in the best interest of the society if the work got done as quickly as possible.  As a result Robin and I were no longer the only people working in the house.  There were always at least half a dozen coeds at various places in the house.  This had the added benefit of not only reassuring Robin, but also keeping Charles Lee occupied.  He was more concerned with hitting on the coeds who were sorting the clothes upstairs than with creeping out the two guys in their early twenties who were sorting the books in the library.  We also never stayed in the house for to long after the sun went down.  The cops had taken my anonymous tip more seriously than I had expected and had a squad car drive past the house every half hour or so.  The burning body had not been identified and the cops were unsettled by the whole situation.  It got to the point where the one of the cops, Officer Slemp, would stop by the house once or twice a day to check on how we were doing.  I think the fact that I made sure he always had coffee when he arrived helped with this.  Officer Slemp would stay and chat with us until Charles Lee would realize that he was on the premises.  He would then wander into the room and make vague comments about suing the department for violating his fourth amendment rights or something, at which point Officer Slemp would roll his eyes and leave.


I tried to ignore the paintings as much as possible.  Robin pretended that they did not exist but every once and a while my curiosity would get the better of me and I would check to see if there were any changes.  The more often I checked the paintings, the more I became convinced there was a problem.  The changes were slight but they were there.  In the painting of the dungeon for instance the figure in the corridor seemed to move a few steps closer every day.  There were even one or two times I thought I heard the echo of distant footsteps when I was working on the other side of the room.  There was also the day I caught the man on the rack turn his head to look at me.  I only saw the movement out of the corner of my eye but the head was definitely now facing me when it had not been before.  The flames on the burning villagers also seemed to dance and there was one occasion where I thought I heard the crackling of flames and distant screams, which were suddenly silenced and then followed by a low cackle.  Robin had to go outside and take a drink to calm down when that happened.  I gritted my teeth, turned my back to the painting, and thought of my wedding night.  The scuba diver and the forest clearing did not provide as much trouble.  The diver would sometimes be in a slightly different position then he was the day before, and the light in the forest clearing seemed to grow a little bit darker as time went by, but nothing to scary happened with them.  I made sure to take photos of the paintings at the end of each day.  Every night at my apartment I would look over the photos.  Strangely enough the photos never seemed to change.  If the man on the rack moved his head and I photographed it, the picture would show him in the same position as he was on that first day that I took the picture.  This did not help my paranoia or my doubts about my own sanity.


The only thing that kept me from panicking was the fact that all the paintings seemed to be able to do was make small movements and occasionally project soft sounds into the library.  If that was the worst that could happen then I could live with it.  The burning man in the roadway was the only exception to this rule, if in fact he had anything to do with the paintings at all.  I was not sure there had been twelve people in the painting that first day and I had no way of proving it one way or the other.  Maybe the burning man was just some sort of elaborate suicide.  Whatever the case was he did not seem to fit in with the other occurrences.  If the paintings could project themselves from their frames like that then why had they not done so again over the weeks that followed?  No, the burning corpse must have been something else.


Then one of the coeds disappeared.  She just didn’t show up for work one day.  Dr. Whitmore was confused but not unduly worried.  I am afraid that his career as a college professor had given him a rather cynical view about the sense of responsibility of men and women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two.  The girl’s parents were worried of course.  In fact they were downright furious when they found out that their daughter had been working in the same house as a man who was being investigated for sex crimes.  Apparently Dr. Whitmore had neglected to mention this fact to the coeds when he asked them to help us out in the house.  After that they all refused to set foot in the same house as Charles Lee, and Dr. Whitmore himself had to come to the mansion and help Robin and me finish up the job.  Thankfully we were almost done with cataloging the contents of the house.  It had been almost a month since we had started working on the house.  In fact the night that we had first gone into the house had been the night of the full moon.  It was now almost the full moon again.  If we had recognized this fact maybe we would have been more careful and the horror that ensued could have been averted. 


The paintings had become bolder.  They now made small movements when I was staring right at them.  The figure had almost reached the end of the hallway now and he was close enough now for me to realize that he was dressed up as a medieval plague doctor.  If you have never heard of Plague Doctors before believe me when I say that they look like something out of your worst nightmares.  The man was dressed in a black robe with a wide brimmed hat and an apparatus on his face that resembled a giant crow’s beak.  The apparatus was apparently meant to protect him from catching a fatal disease but it also served to make him look incredibly creepy.  The diver had now vanished from the underwater painting.  I once saw a torn flipper float past and I had a pretty good idea what had happened to him.  The crackling of flames had become an almost constant background sound in the library although it frustratingly stopped whenever Dr. Whitmore or Charles Lee came into the room.  


Then one night, just as the sun was setting and we were packing up to go, the painting of the forest clearing became completely dark.  The sun in the painting had finally set and a mist had rolled into the scene.  At the far side of the clearing a figure that resembled a naked, very pale man appeared , shrouded in the mist.  Judging by the trees on either side of it the figure had to be around seven feet tall.  The figure in the clearing stood there motionless for a long time.  I had stopped working the minute I saw it and was currently staring at it.  I can only imagine that this is how a bird must feel when it is transfixed by the gaze of a snake.  


The figure then let out a shriek so loud that Dr Whitmore heard it in the attic and stopped working.  The creature then opened its mouth far wider than any normal creature should have been able to, giving me a good look at the rows of sharp teeth in its mouth and let out another shriek before racing towards the front of the picture.  The creature hit the edge of the frame and fell back.  I let out a breath that I did not realize that I had been holding.  The creature could not get out of the painting.  The creature ran back to the other side of the clearing before racing toward the front again.  It slammed into the front of the painting with even greater force than the last time. 


The painting rocked on the wall.


The paintings could affect things outside of their canvas.


There was dead silence in the library.  The creature looked at the edges of the painting and let out a predatory grim, making sure that I saw every one of its many teeth.  It then began to tear at the sides of the painting in an unmistakable attempt to get out.  I decided that the time had come for me to get the hell out of dodge.  I turned to get Robin and found him staring at the creature which was now shrieking in the forest clearing.  In order to do this he had to turn his back to the underwater scene.  I saw many impossible things that night but this was without a doubt one of the most impossible of all.  The painting of the submerged shipwreck seemed to…reach out.  There is no other way of describing it.  The painting swallowed up Robin before my eyes and the next thing I knew Robin was inside of the painting.  Unlike the diver Robin did not have a scuba tank.  Robin frantically banged on the inside of the painting and tried to scream for help only to remember to late that he was underwater.  His mouth filled with water and his scream turned into a helpless gurgle.


Dr. Whitmore and Charles Lee burst into the library.  When the creature in the clearing saw them it ducked behind the frame and out of our vision.  The plague doctor did the exact opposite.  The door to the dungeon scene blew open with a thunderous crash.  A long sharp blade had appeared in the plague doctor’s hand.  The blade slashed right through the canvas and the plague doctor stepped into the library.  Charles Lee turned to run.  He didn’t run fast enough.  The knife flew through the air and imbedded itself in Lee’s back and he fell to the floor.  The medieval nightmare then turned to the rest of us in the room.  Me standing stunned in the middle of the room.  Dr. Whitmore leaning against the doorway to shocked to scream.  Robin in the painting unable to breathe.  The plague doctor took in the entire scene and gave me a brief nod before sweeping out the door into the hallway past the stunned Dr. Whitmore.


The creature in the clearing reappeared.  It was holding something in its hand.  It was the head of the missing coed.  Dr. Whitmore let out a final sob and whatever sanity the man still had broke completely.  He began to laugh.  The witch began to laugh.  The creature in the clearing began to tear at the side of the frame again.  I turned to do what I could for Robin and I saw the shadow of the shark reappear behind him.  My best friend was going to die because of my recklessness.  We were all going to die.


Unless.


The Knife.


My gaze fell on the lifeless body of Charles Lee and I rushed over to do what I had to do.  If I was going to die then I would die trying to save my friend.  There were worse ways to go.  I pulled the knife from the corpse and turned to help Robin.  Behind me I heard a tearing sound as the creature in the clearing finally tore through whatever barrier there was between its world and this one.  I braced myself for the claws of the creature to pierce my back.  They never came.  I heard the creature let out another shriek that was drowned out by the scream of Dr. Whitmore.  The creature had chosen the easier victim first just like any predator.  I tried my hardest to ignore the wet crunching sounds from behind me and drove the knife into the underwater scene just as the shark loomed behind Robin.  The knife pierced the canvas.  I remember Robin, a very large shark, and an immeasurably vast amount of water exploding out of the painting and then everything went black.


The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital with Emily sleeping in the chair next to my bed.  I let out a low groan and she woke up.  After she was done hugging and kissing me for being alive she explained more or less what had happened.  As it turns out my habit of giving Officer Slemp coffee had saved me and Robin that fateful night.  Officer Slemp had been driving by the house and saw the lights on at the mansion.  He decided to stop by and say hi.  As he was pulling up the driveway he heard the uproar from the house and a large wave of water  blasted out of the library window.  Officer Slemp had rushed onto the scene and found me and Robin in the wreckage of the house.  As it turns out Robin was in better shape than I was and had managed to pull me away from the chaos and had hidden me behind a fallen bookshelf until help had arrived.  Officer Slemp’s official report said that Charles Lee and Dr. Whitmore had been killed in a freak flash flood which was the official explanation for the whole business.  What exactly Officer Slemp had seen when he arrived on the scene and what exactly Robin had felt the need to hide me from neither of them ever said.  I remembered the creature in the clearing and did not press the matter.  

The next week the police identified the body of the burned man.  It was Ezra Cole.  If I had to guess I would theorize that the paintings were only really dangerous during the full moon, like the night we arrived at the house and the night we visited it for the last time, and Ezra Cole must have run afoul of the witch on one of the full moons several years previously.  The police file on his death, and the disappearance of the coed, remain open although no one is really investigating them.  I suspect that Officer Slemp had a quiet word with his superiors and the matter was swept under the rug with minimal fuss.  The fact that what was left of all four of the paintings were locked up in police evidence gives further credence to this theory.  I saw the paintings once more.  They looked exactly the same as they did the first time I saw them, with one difference.  There was no figure at the end of the hall in the dungeon scene.  There are nights where I imagine that I see a hooded figure with a crow like apparatus on its face watching me from the shadows.  There are nights where I think I hear the cry of the creature from the clearing in the depths of the forest hunting it prey.  Then again, maybe this is all in my head.  But I do not think it is.
