If I posted this in the wrong sub, I will post it in the appropriate one.

Hello, I self-taught myself C++ and that's all I've really known in regards to programming languages. Im a CS major and currently taking my classes but its still in C++ and going over things I've already taught myself. Since its going to be my junior year I need to get started on my actual career choices along with internships and what to focus on learning next on my own time. I have a couple of questions:

* Most of my professors say that a lot of people wont get into the actual coding aspect in the Computer Science degree but may do other jobs related to them. Can anyone elaborate on what they meant or were they wrong?

* My assumption most programming work is split between: Web-based development or regular application development and then it goes into front-end and back-end for each of them. How did most of you decide between them? What programming languages should I look into that would help me decide what I like best?

* When talking about job security, is it better to know a little bit of everything or focus down on a certain aspect like Web-based back end development, etc?

* This one is unrelated to the others but since I want to try using API from companies like, [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/getting-started) and [Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/), can I do any of this with C++ or is C++ meant more for regular desktop applications? I know it can be done with languages like Ruby, PHP, Java, etc. but since I dont have alot of knowledge with anything other than some C++, I dont know what's the best language to choose.

Any help with any of these questions would be greatly appreciated."

I am a current Junior with double major Comp Sci and Math. I just accepted an offer to be a technical analyst intern this summer at Goldman Sachs. This is my first internship but I'm also my school's Google Student Ambassador. As much as I enjoy my classes, I think I'd rather be a Program/Project Manager. My school offers the option to get a 5th year MBA so I take a few business classes next year and then finish it in one more full year of school. If I did this, I would have one more summer to intern somewhere. The only PM internship I've seen is from Microsoft. Are there others? And, the real question, is getting an MBA and a second internship (hopefully a PM-specific one) worth delaying going into the workforce by another year? I regret not having more internships and I'm worried that my lack of professional experience will make it harder to find a good job as a new grad PM.

Thanks!"

To do this I need to translate a query we run on our DB into a similar query that runs on BQ.

I was hoping that some one could help me translate this SQL query into a valid BigQuery query:

I know this sounds kind of irrational and dumb, but I am a college senior at a pretty decent university and I am set to graduate come this spring (4 months). I've been applying to spring internships right now because my course load is very very light (barely any class), being my last semester and all. However, it seems that when I get a phone interview I do really well...until I get an email to move on to the next round...then I get all anxious, doubtful, and have a mini freak out. I don't know why I do this exactly.    
I have had many doubts about myself. :(   

Last summer I successfully secured an internship after doing the whole apply, cancel interview cycle with many other companies.  For some odd reason, I was feeling very confident (though still scared) and actually went it and did it.    

I think I'm scared of not doing well? Not getting along with he company culture? Scared that I'll hate it and regret it? I know that by cancelling all these interviews I'm just harming myself. I'm letting so many opportunities slip by, and I am really at a loss right now. I do get mild social anxiety...however it NEVER shows (or what I've been told). I feel like it's all in my head. Also the doubting my abilities aspect too. I feel like these doubts keep on manifesting itself in my mind, and I'm starting to feel so doubtful about everything....relationships, friends, career prospects, life.   


What do I do? I don't want to come off as ungrateful, because I really am not!! I just don't know why moments like these come and take over my rational side. When my friends ask, ""how'd the interview(s) go?"" I usually lie and said it went okay...though I really cancelled. 


I think I have a problem. I'm afraid these actions are really hurting me, both in the short run and long run....can anyone please give me some advice? Anyone been in the same situation? 


It's really taking a toll on me :(

43nbvs,213,2016-02-01,Alone ti[m]e with the o[f]fice intern,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/43nbvs/alone_time_with_the_office_intern/,"I work as an events coordinator for the School of Computer Science at a university. As a 23 year old in an office of researchers and executives, I was by far the youngest in the team, so I was pretty excited when I found out we were hiring an intern. The successful candidate, James, was 20 years old and in his second year of a Software Engineering degree. He was tall and slim, with glasses and scruffy brown hair. He struck me as a little shy, but was always really friendly in our interactions. I was quick to buddy up to James and show him the ropes in the office and, before long, I found we had plenty to chat about. Our conversations involved some playful banter and I was enjoying the odd bit of flirting here and there as it made the work days go much quicker.

Fast forward to last month, when my school was hosting their first public lecture event for the year. I was rather nervous as this would be the first event where I was solely in charge of the event management for the night. My supervisor asked James to help me out for the evening, and I was thankful for the help but also excited to be spending some one-to-one time with my new colleague.

The evening of the event, I arrived at the venue early to set up the space. When James rocked up, I must've done a double-take as I barely recognised him. Between finishing work for the day and arriving at the event, he had gotten a neat haircut, which (and I know it sounds corny to say, but) really brought out the gorgeous blue in his eyes. He was also wearing a suit and tie, a step up from the business shirts he normally wears to the office, and boy do I have a weakness for guys in suits.

""Well, don't you tidy up well?"" I called over to him.

""Heh heh, hey Michelle!"" James chuckled as he walked over to join me. He always had this sweet chuckle whenever we joked around, which in turn has me giggling like a school girl. ""Thanks,"" he replied, ""I thought it was about time I trimmed that mop off. And you look great too"" he said, gesturing at my blue dress and blazer. I thanked him as I passed him a copy of the event run sheet and we continued on with the set up. 

The evening that followed went off without a hitch. The theatre where we held the lecture was packed and it was well past 9pm by the time all the guests had slowly made their exit, leaving just James and I.

While I tidied up some leftover wine glasses from the earlier networking event, I found an unopened bottle of wine leftover from the caterers. I ducked my head into the theatre where James was tidying up and waved the wine bottle at him.

""What say we celebrate a successful night?""

""Nice! Won't say no to that!"" he grinned, as I joined him in the theatre with the bottle and some clean glasses. I filled our glasses and handed him his as we took a seat in the front row of seats.

""Cheers to a great night! And what a great team!""

""Cheers,"" James agreed, as we clinked glasses. ""And yes, we do make a pretty awesome team.""

As we sipped our wine, we exchanged observations from the night and I, feeling particularly flirty all of a sudden, worked in some playful touches to his leg. While I'm sure the alcohol couldn't have possibly reached my brain in such a short amount of time, I think all the adrenaline from running such a big event had me feeling as though I were tipsy. Inhibitions were well and truly out the window by this stage, so I took another sip of wine and rested my head on his shoulder.

""James, stop me if I'm just repeating myself, but did I tell you how great you look in that suit?"" I said, while running a finger playfully down the centre of his chest.

""Uhh haha, thanks! You may have, but I don't get sick of hearing it!""

I tilted my head up to look at him, and I saw that his eyes were now wide, watching the path of my finger as it made its way along the buttons of his shirt. I sensed that he was probably holding his breath at that moment as well as his chest lay absolutely still. I traced my finger back up his chest, then continued along up the side of his neck and ran my fingers through his hair.

""And this hair, I love this hair...""

James tilted his head up to face me and his gaze met mine. Even in the dimly lit theatre I could see his beautiful blue eyes glistening.

Yep. Inhibitions totally gone. All my pent up adrenaline from the evening had turned itself into this wild, sexual energy that was now driving my every action. I leaned in to kiss him gently on the mouth and I was relieved when he I felt that he didn't pull away. I broke away momentarily to place my wine glass on the floor beside me, then went back for another kiss, gently cupping his face with my now free hand. I think the brief pause allowed James' mind to catch up with what was happening as he returned my kiss with more enthusiasm this time around. I leaned further into him in his seat as our kiss grew deeper, my lips and tongue exploring his, tasting the wine in each others mouths. Perhaps this was the alcohol finally started to kick in, but god he tasted good. One of my hands felt his chest through his shirt while the other steadied myself on the chairs. James had a hand firmly on my hips, his thumb stroking me through the tight fabric of my dress.

I needed more. I could feel my pussy starting to throb in anticipation. I wanted his hands and fingers and tongue all over me. I brought one leg over the arm rest dividing us and tried to bring the other over too, but at that point realised that my dress was a little more restrictive than I first thought and the chairs were also a little narrower too. James chuckled as I shimmied my dress further up my thighs to give myself more flexibility and I not so gracefully wriggled my other leg to fit in on the seat beside his.

""God Michelle, you're so damn sexy"" James said as he traced his hands over my hips and cupped my now partly exposed ass. His fingers spread over both cheeks and he stroked my skin in small circular motions.

I leaned back in to kiss him, then broke into smaller part-kisses part-licks up his jaw line and down his neck. I could smell the remnants of the cologne on his neck, which made me even hungrier for more. I could feel his fingers continue to explore my ass, pushing the fabric of my dress higher and tracing along the hem of my lace g-string. Each touch made my skin more sensitive, and I couldn't get enough of it. I wanted his fingers all over my body. I sat up in a kneeling position, arching my back, which pushed my mound into the bulge in his pants. James let out a soft moan and massaged my ass firmly with his hands, further grinding me into his bulge. I used my hands to feel his cock through his pants and I could tell he was incredibly hard. God how I wanted to taste it.

I went to undo his belt and pants, but I was so eager that my fingers fumbled over the buckle. I giggled at my clumsiness (this all seemed a lot smoother and sexier in my head, but alas). Once I finally had his pants undone, I knelt down on the carpet in front of James. I helped his pants down past his knees while I stroked his cock through his briefs with my free hand. I loved that James' eyes were on me the whole time, enthralled by the attention I was giving to him. He continued to watch as I licked up his inner thigh and planted light kisses across his cock through his briefs. Here I thought I was the eager one, but it was James who was dying to push his briefs down for more. I helped him pull them off like I was opening a birthday present. My god, what a cock... the moment I saw it I just wanted it inside me. He let out a little chuckle as I involuntarily let out a little moan of pleasure at the sight of it.

I wet my hand with a little spit then started stroking the length of his member with long, firm movements. James moaned and lay his head back as took his cock in my mouth. I was so horny by now that I got right into it, sucking him hungrily. I took him as deeply as I could and he was so big and hard now that his cock engulfed my mouth. I could feel the tip of his cock hitting the back of my throat with each movement and I loved it. James had a hand on the back of my head, gently encouraging me to go even deeper. His quiet moans as I sucked him turned me on even more, and while I wanted to continue to taste him, at that point I became very aware of my throbbing pussy that was receiving no attention. I needed to feel that amazing cock inside me.

I got up, turned my back to him and pulled my dress up a little further. I pushed my g-string to one side as I positioned myself on the tip of his cock. James gripped my hips from both sides as his cock drove deep into me. My pussy was already wet and dripping, so I slid on relatively easily, but I was not quite expecting the size of him. I stifled a cry, mindful that we were in a public building (but who was I kidding, if anyone was still around, they would've already seen and heard plenty), but only managing so far. I slid up and down his stiff cock, trying to capture the full length of him with my movements. I continued riding him, quickening with each dip so that I was basically bouncing in his lap. He matched my pace by thrusting into me with each movement. Unfortunately I must've worked him up a little too much with my mouth and I could tell he wouldn't last much longer. I could hear his breath getting heavier, almost turning into growls, and he murmured the occasional ""fuuuck"" as he inched closer and closer to climax. I placed both my hands on the arm rests on either side of him for leverage, then further quickened my pace, my ass slapping his thighs loudly with each action.

""Fuuuck... keep going..."" he said between breaths. His thrusts grew even harder and he took control, pounding into me. Each thrust felt unbelievable, yet were so forceful they had me wincing slightly. He groaned as he came inside me and writhed in his seat until the pulses stopped. I lifted myself off him and flopped into the seat next to him.

""Ahh dammit"" I said, pointing at the now spilt glass of wine by my feet. James chuckled and after catching our breaths, he helped me up out of my seat to clean up the wine (and ourselves).

It was one of my most memorable sexual exploits to date and I often replay it in my mind in the times I have pleasured myself since then."

My biggest thing that I want to avoid is making a big financial mistake that I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. I don't want to pay back a $40,000+ loan in a degree that is essentially worthless. So, I ran into computer info systems as an Associate's degree because I thought it seemed easy, I wanted to learn to program and I assumed I could get a good paying job after I get my Bachelor's, but then I quickly realized that programming was ***hard*** so I went back to my English degree option. Writing is my passion and when basically everyone (online and in real life) said it was a dud I'm lost as to what degree to take up in its place. The only two degrees that I actually like are Biology and Psychology, but biology requires a ton of higher level math (which I absolutely **suck** at. I can barely pass lower-level math) and Psychology doesn't guarantee a high pay out unless you go to school for it for years.

The counselor suggested that I go for writing, saying *""screw it""* to the money and if I apparently have the talent and perseverance for writing then I can go out and get any job related in that field. My dad said I probably won't get any money from my English degree once I start job hunting and my sister said that it's too vague. I told her that I wanted to be a editorial writer, but then called me out saying that I knew jack shit about the career and she seriously suggested that I reevaluate my direction and goals in life, but **nothing** is coming to mind. I thought about doing an internship, but my sister said that I should've gotten started on it from the get go instead of waiting until now. I then thought about quitting school entirely to go straight into the work force, but so far I haven't found a permanent job after job hunting for two years only temporary work and a one interview and one orientation session, but no callbacks afterwords. I also thought about trade schools, but the majority of the ones in my area are related in hair care and I'm not interested. Recently I thought about joining the Coast Guard seeing as they may pay for school (or at least some of it) and I could possibly have a job there, but I'm starting to think back to what my sister said with me jumping from out rash, half-baked decisions to the next.


Ergh, I might get an aneurysm from thinking about all of this too hard.

I wanted some advice on a financial predicament i have found myself in and I think my bank is being very unreasonable. I will start from the beginning.

I had a Student account with Santander during university with a £1.5k overdraft which i rarely ever used (account was always in credit). Fast forward to me doing a Masters at University, I didn't have regular payments coming in and was starting to use my overdraft and by the end of that (September 2015) I had used up most of it. I had begun an Internship in London and was making some money but not a substantial amount. I thought i would have the overdraft for now.

Out of the blue I get a notice from Santander saying the overdraft facility will be removed and demanding all of the money back. I was quite shocked and after discussing this with them they said I can pay back about £50 a money for now and we could then discuss a more appropriate payback schedule when my finances improve. This was an informal arrangement. and suggested by them.

Fast forward to the new year, and since start of January ive started a new (higher paying) job and am living back at home, thus leaving me with more disposal income. However, before I even got my first paycheck and could start paying this back, I receive a default notice from Santander, demanding all of the money back within 28 days.

I called them up explaining that theres no need for this and I am willing to come to an arrangement with them. I said I could pay most of it this money and some of it the next month (would be hard for me, but felt I had to) and that there is no need for such hostile demands. However they didnt budge at all to negotiate or come to an agreement and simply said I will have to pay this within 28 days or my account would default and it would damage my credit rating.

I am now concerned about how Santander have approached this and am unsure what to do. Is it unreasonable of them to make such demands, and without any sort of notice. I asked them why they didnt just contact me a week or so ago so we could arrange something, but they didnt really want to hear this.

When speaking to them after receiving the notice, they mentioned that I could have made a formal arrangement of £100 in september, yet this was never offered to me at the time.

What should I do? I could pay it all back within a month, but do I have to impose such hardship on myself?"

**UPDATE:** It is now down to about 0.145s (see [here](https://github.com/jsdw/hs-anagrammer)) thanks to the submission by /r/bartavelle

Somebody at work came up with a programming challenge to give to an intern based on finding anagrams from lines of a text file. Using all of Shakespeares' works as the source text, a couple of people created PHP implementations that took about 0.8s and 1s to find and display all of the anagrams. I thought doing it in Haskell would easily be a lot faster, but alas the best I seem to be able to do so far is around 0.8-0.9s! So, the question is, can you guys do any better?

# The problem

Find all of the anagrams in the complete works of shakespeare, ignoring non-letters and casing (and treating any ignored characters as spaces between words). Ignore any cases involving only a rearrangement of the words but not of letters within the words.

## Examples of valid matches

    'Tis so, indeed.
    Is't so, indeed.
    
    A thing
    Hang it!
    
    No further, sir.
    For his return.

## Examples of invalid matches

(only re-arrangement of words rather than of letters)

    Hello there sir.
    Sir, hello there
    
    He played bagpipes.
    Bagpipes he played.

# The solution

I have posted two slightly varied implementations [HERE](https://github.com/jsdw/hs-anagrammer), along with the input text used (shakespeare.txt) and the results of running one of my implementations (result.txt) and rough timings.

I am hoping that there are still some relatively easy wins to be had, and would love to see how people approach the problem to make it faster (I still have plenty to learn!). More radical changes to the algorithm as well as smaller ones are also welcome. I'll stick the better submissions up on the repository with timings from running on my machine, and credit the author. Any takers or simply suggestions on how I might improve my attempts?"

43olkf,0,2016-02-01,Me [20F] and my summer fling [22M]. I'd like to start talking to him again.,throwinq,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43olkf/me_20f_and_my_summer_fling_22m_id_like_to_start/,"Starting from the beginning.

Colin and I met at the end of May when we both started research internships at the same college. We lived in 3-person suites across the hall from each other in a dormitory, and spent a great deal of time getting to know each other as we explored the campus. We grew pretty close over the first few weeks before transitioning into more of a FWB-type relationship. This lasted until the beginning of August, at which point our internships ended and we ceased contact. I haven't heard from or about him since, though I've thought about him often.

I should mention that I have rather severe anxiety and depression, which has given me an obsessive desire for personal perfection and a lot of self-hatred from being imperfect. The first half of this summer is one of the only times I can think of in which I felt genuinely confident in myself for an extended period of time. I think this had to do with the fact that I was (somewhat) successfully independent for the first time in my life. My anxiety worsened again later in the summer, and I convinced myself that he would be or was already disgusted by my body, personality, work ethic, etc. We had a number of awkward sexual situations over the course of the summer, and these just served to heighten my negativity. Though we discussed our regular lives a few times, and each got to know some very personal information about the other, I left out all information about my mental health history.

You might ask why I want to contact him after so much time. I didn't talk to him earlier for three reasons: 1) he mentioned once that he found it hard to keep in touch with people, which I interpreted then as ""once this is over, don't speak to me,"" 2) I had a nearly unusable phone that I've only just replaced, and 3) my confidence was at nearly an all-time low and I've just now started to build it again through counseling. I think he's a great person and I would like to keep him as a contact for both friendship and work reasons. Our field of work is connected enough that he may show up again. Also, during the time I knew him, he was intensely passionate about his research, fond of having in-depth discussions about topics that we either shared an interest in or wildly disagreed about, and very witty. Basically, I liked talking to him so much then that I'd like to start again even without the sex component.

Reddit, looking at this from an outsider's perspective, do you think I should contact Colin? I still don't have any idea how invested he was in our relationship and I don't know the standard protocol for contacting summer flings six months after the fact. And if I were to talk to him again, how could I convey that I'm only looking for friendship?

**TL;DR**: Had a summer fling with a really great guy, didn't contact him afterwards due to a number of reasons that stemmed mainly from the fact that I was/still am quite anxious. I'd like to reach out to him again but I don’t know if/how I should.

I did not really talk to Fanny again until FH’s graduation. By now she had realized my presence was going to be more or less permanent and had a cooler head around me. We were moving to his home state for the summer after FH got an internship there and Fanny was going to watch him graduate and help us pack the car. By now I was a little bit more outgoing and we actually talked. I showed her a local festival which she enjoyed. I think in her mind she realized I might not be the worst DIL. She would really come around after FH’s graduation.

There were several different graduation ceremonies on campus during that week, FH’s being the last scheduled ones. Campus housing wanted us out that day, no exceptions. Us roommates decided to do what we had done years previous; rent a storage unit and use a free truck provided by the storage facility to load our stuff up and drive it to the unit. The truck had to be arranged weeks in advance and was only available for 4 hours. Roommate 2 was in charge of making the truck arrangement, and his family emailed Fanny saying that everything was set up and ready to go.

Fast forward to graduation day. Roommate 1 (from the previous post) has already left, again with almost no notice, and asked us to transport her already packed belongings to the unit, and we agreed. FH is all dressed in his gown and silly cap, ready to walk and receive his diploma when Roommate 2’s family shows up and starts grabbing his stuff and hauling it out to the family’s minivan. WTF? What about the truck? “What truck?” they cooly reply, Roommate 2 with a smirk, and saunter out the door. Surprise! Roommate 2 is dropping out and moving back home. His family lied, they had made no preparations and were leaving us high and dry. We called the storage unit and of course the truck is booked. We had to be out of the apartment that day or we would get fined by housing.

FH is fuming. I’ve never seen him so angry. He totally blows up and I can’t blame him, getting fucked over like that on your graduation day. I try and calm him down, urge him to leave to go to his graduation and let me handle it, and prompt Fanny to get her son to the ceremony before he’s late. They leave and I swoop in to the rescue. U-haul doesn’t have much but they do have a van for cheap. I book the rental and call up my family to help load the van. FH walks the stage and we meet up after the ceremony and I tell him the plan. We pick up the van, load up all of our shit and my family helps us out (even had moving blankets and mattress covers prepped). We even get Roomate 1’s crap all loaded in (she had barely packed, everything was messily piled in boxes, not taped down or closed in and way and covered in a disgusting layer of dust). Crisis is averted and my Mom even lends us her guest room to spend the night in after we are exhausted from the ordeal.

Fanny sees me as a hero. I can put up with her son’s craziness and can be counted on when things go tits up. For once she might actually accept me. Of course, things don’t stay that way.

(Sidenote; Roommate 1 knew Roommate 2 was dropping out and hadn’t arranged a truck. She bailed and left us to take care of her shit for her on purpose.)

How do I proceed?",ano1112,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/43pas6/i_23_m_would_like_to_move_across_country_my/,"My fiance and I currently live on the east coast in a very expensive city that isn't New York. We moved here after college (graduated in May 2015) for her internship and I got a job that I dislike that is very minimally but still somewhat related to my major. We are originally from less than 3 hours away from where we are now, so it makes going home for the holidays very easy. I think overall we like the city we live in, but the job market here is all bio-tech related and is not a field I am interested in pursuing at this time. There are also many other reasons I do not want to stay here, such as the ever increasing cost of rent, the slow decline of the capabilities of the public transit, the less than average income in this city for my degree, and the desire of wanting to live somewhere else (I've basically lived in New England my whole life).

My brother lives in Seattle and constantly tells me how much fun the city is. I've been to visit and enjoyed the overall feel of the city as well as the proximity to nature. After some research and discussion with friends who also live in the area, it seems that the cost of living is somewhat lower, while the average salary for my degree is quite a bit higher. My fiance has a degree that can get a job anywhere, whereas mine is limited to areas with industry and science.

In our current situation, my fiance is working 5 days a week unpaid, and 1 day a week paid to cover the cost of her public transportation and student loan payments. I pay for all other costs which eats up all of my money and leaves $0 for savings every month. While looking for cheaper housing in my city is an option, it puts me far from work and in inconvenient locations with respect to public transportation. She finishes her internship in August, which is when I'd like to move. I think moving would be acceptable to her if we were not also planning a small wedding in our home town in 2017. 

It is my belief that we can still plan the wedding just as well from Seattle and come back for the occasion. The place we are having it does most of the work for you, and you just pick out the details like cake decoration, colors, etc.. 

Is it reasonable for me to convince her to move to Seattle, or should I just accept my situation? It seems like my fiance is slightly opposed but open to discussion on the topic, I just haven't been able to fully convince her yet. I know she likes Seattle as much as I do, she just wants to stay close to family and the wedding.

I'm not sure exactly which college I would like to attend so before you continue reading I would like to make you aware that this post will basically outline some questions I have about UW-Madison.

Anyway to begin I have three schools in which I am really intrigued by; the first is UW-Madison, the second is UW-Seattle (Washington), and the third is the University of Texas-Austin. The only one I've been accepted to thus far is UW-Madison, decisions from the other two are projected to arrive in March. Due to the fact that I don't know about the other as of right now UW-Madison is the best choice that I have so here are some of my questions about the school and campus life.

To start off I would like to do a dual major in Computer Science and a business degree of sorts. From experience how difficult is it to pursue each? Are the classes mostly lectured based? I live in rural Missouri and I have little experience in the work space with technology will I be able to compete for internships and jobs around the area in the technology industry? I want to develop software and stray aware from the hardware aspect of computers, how does this affect me in pursuing CS?

As stated I'm from the rural Missouri, is the weather really that bad? Is walking to class a dreadful experience? How's the food on campus? 

I also planned on living in the dorms and online they look pretty nice. Are they as nice as they look? Is there a lot of conflict in the dorms? Are they loud or quite most of the time?

TL;DR I'm just looking for your opinion of the campus and how I would get along being a badger."

I am currently in my third year and last year of Bachelor in Computer Science in Switzerland and I am planning on doing a 2 year Master afterwards at the same university. I want to find an internship for this summer but have no idea where to look really, other than the big companies.

I was wondering if its uncommon for internships to be done at something else than the ""big"" companies. The local job search sites do return job offers for developpement but not any internships.

The college doesn't seem to give much info either. There was a sort of a fair during the semester which I couldn't attend, and job postings on a special site for people from the school do not seem to yield any internships either.

Any advice?"

It's a super long story, but I had personal issues and also prioritized the wrong things in life.  So, I'm doing my best to just fast-track myself through a computer engineering degree as I don't have much time or funding left.  This has the unfortunate side effect of not leaving enough time for an internship during my time in school.

To note, I do have roughly two years of professional software development experience, outside of the work I've done for my degree.  I was really hoping to actually get an internship at a NASA center, but after briefly looking over things, it doesn't seem like it's going to be possible.  :(

For those that currently work, or have worked for NASA, how hard was it to gain employment?  Did you have a foot in the door?  I do know someone, but it's been years since I've talked to her and I don't know if she would be able or willing to help me out.

So my graphics card seems to be slowly dying and I need a new one. 

This is my current rig, which  i built ~3 years ago:

* Intel Core i5 3570K 4x 3.40GHz So.1155 BOX 
* 8GB Corsair Vengeance LP Black DDR3-1600 DIMM CL9 Dual Kit
* 530 Watt be quiet! Pure Power L8 CM Modular 80+ Bronze

* 	LG Electronics GH24NS95 DVD-RW SATA 1.5Gb/s intern schwarz Bulk 
* Samsung SSD Evo 500G
* 	Zalman Z9 Plus Midi Tower ohne Netzteil schwarz
* 	3072MB Gigabyte Radeon HD 7950 WindForce 3X Aktiv PCIe 3.0 x16 (Retail) 

(The SSD is only 2 months old, i replaced my old HDD with it)

As you can tell I am using the AMD Radeon HD 7900 Series which is very noisy and also was a bit overkill in hindsight.
I'd like to replace it with a cost efficient alternative (Not more than 200€ if thats possible).

I play games like ""Rust"", ""The Talos Princple"" ""CS:GO"" and I'd like to be able to play GTA V.

I'd be glad if you can help me figure something out. If you need more information about anything, feel free to PM or comment beneath. 

Thanks in advance!

BTW: I am not very experienced in building PC's and can't really tell whats important when buying a new GPU. I know much more about the Software side of things :D"

Hello friends.

Thanks to all of you who voted for me for AOTM. To those who didn't... well, at least its a short month. I once promised to be the most corrupt and incompetent to ever hold this position. I guess now we'll see if I can fulfill that promise. I've already ordered wiretaps and interns, but first, other business...

I'm going to try to go in a slightly different direction for cigars of the month. The theme for the month is going to be **Something Different.**  Look, we all know the big, ubiquitous cigar makers out there. Personally, I love Fuente, My Father, and Tatuaje, but there are plenty of other companies making great cigars that don't get the same press. This month, I encourage you to seek out those regional and local cigar makers, start-ups, small businesses, and independent rollers that you may otherwise overlook. 

To keep with this theme, there is no CCOTM this month. Rather, I want to bring your attention to a couple of cigars I have a lot of appreciation for, but that aren't typically on the list of usual suspects around here. 

**COTM is the Cabal Short Robusto**.  I got turned on to these a little over a year ago, and have found them to be incredibly tasty.  I believe Cabal is currently offering 5 vitolas, and any of them would be a great choice. I chose the short robusto for its flavor and construction, but also because I'm one of many here still trying to survive the cold winter weather.  For those of you (like me) not in an area where they have a B&amp;M presence, I know they are available at Cigar Federation, Famous, and Stogies World Class.

**Alt-COTM is the Tabanero Corona Gorda**.   Tabanero is a great little shop in Tampa I had the pleasure of visiting last year. They have a handful of rollers working in the front of the building, good coffee in the back, and excellent people throughout. If you have a chance to visit, I highly recommend this cigar and a Cafe Cubano. If you can't get there in person, try the corona gorda anyway.  This one will be a little harder to get, as I believe they're only available in their Tampa store, but they do ship. 

Will there be a monthly trade? Damn right! I'll post more about that later, but expect it to include the theme mentioned above.

What about contests, man?  There will be contests-a-plenty, starting with a simple one yet this afternoon, so stay tuned! I'm also working on a Super Bowl prop bet contest like the one we did last year and some others as well. I'll be cleaning out my humidors. Get ready!

And thanks again!"
43qra4,287,2016-02-01,Went to my prof,nugsandchugs,howtonotgiveafuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/43qra4/went_to_my_prof/,"After a rough breakup with my ex, I told myself that I was going to adopt the /r/howtonotgiveafuck philosophy in order to better my life. I've been doing my best to keep things in mind like how insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things and the like. So when faced with a crossroads of deciding between two paths, I try to have that mindset.

Anyway, my first achievement might not be big, but I'm still proud. I contacted a professor last week via email asking for a job recommendation at a company at which he used to work. I wasn't too close with him, but I figured I'd give it a shot. What was the worst that could happen? He ended up not answering, so I wasn't sure whether to email him again or just let it go. Old me would have just let it go. I was in a class with him last semester, but there were about 50 students so I wasn't sure if he even remembered me.

The new me said ""fuck it"", so I went to his office today. I asked his secretary if he was busy, then she came back and told me to wait a few minutes, a little annoyed that I didn't have an appointment. But hey, he did't email me back, so what was I gonna do? I waited for what felt like forever, not sure why I was so nervous.

He eventually came out and was super cool about it. He told me that he's gonna help me out, so hopefully I end up with an internship for this upcoming summer! Like I said, not a big accomplishment, but it could potentially impact my future in a big way. All because I said ""fuck it.""

I'm also trying to be more social. I have a class next week in which you usually have discussions, so my next goal is to try and get myself to contribute at least one thing. What's the worst that can happen? Again, I know these are little steps, but I'm trying to build my confidence little by little. "
43qtaw,4,2016-02-01,Wet paper.,keepitallin,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/43qtaw/wet_paper/,"I feel like I'm ill, but with depression, anxiety, guilt and hopelessness. I have been having some very difficult feelings lately... sadness, a crush on someone even though I'm in a relationship, and resentment toward my partner who is an alcoholic. I think he's been catching the crush vibe because he's been such a douche to me lately. I feel tremendously guilty. He should be enough for me, but his drinking makes him a pain in the ass and I feel embarrassed to be in public with him when he's drunk.

I love him when he's sober. I can't stand him when he's drunk. I have reached out to two friends for support, and I feel guilty for that. I've told them whats happening and they both told me that they feel this is an abusive relationship.

I spend the first couple of hours of my internship with a crisis counselor because my suicidal ideation has gotten worse. I've wanted to kill myself on and off for years- since I was nine. Normally I want to hang myself, because that's the way my uncle did it. Right now I feel like drinking a bottle of alcohol, taking a bunch of sleep aid, wearing heavy clothing filled with rocks and walking out into the ocean.

The only thing that keeps me from doing it is my dog. She just wouldn't understand if I killed myself. She is a rescue- we love each other like a parent and child. I can't leave her. 

If I tell my partner I'm depressed, he gets mad and takes it personally. If I tell him his drinking upsets me, he says its not his drinking that's the problem. Its my feelings about his drinking. I think the actual problem is his behavior, and how he destroys and loses things as well as the way he verbally tears me apart. 

That's how I feel. Like a wet piece of paper that will tear if you touch it."
43qxh0,3,2016-02-01,"Second week at internship at a school for at risk youth, over the weekend one of the kids was shot",Danisue7,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/43qxh0/second_week_at_internship_at_a_school_for_at_risk/,"I knew I was going way out of my comfort zone taking this internship, but it sounded like amazing experience that would be valued by any future employer, especially in the Psychology field which is my major. All the kids at this school have either been expelled from public school and/or this was the other option besides juvie. 

Many of the male students (7th-12th grade) are part of gangs. Tensions sometimes run high because they're in opposing gangs. The first week went well, but I came in this morning and found out one of the kids was shot over the weekend by another former student. He's alive, but the kids were on edge and acting up. 

After class, the staff were together talking about all the kids. The kids told them that there was no security threat to the school because there are two many witnesses and the police would come too quickly. One of the senior staff members (has been there 20 plus years) said how she can't help but think when she walks the kids outside to get on the bus if there someday might be someone waiting with a gun.

Hearing the staff members talk about this violence so casually has me a little shaken up. I know I'm safe inside the school and the school itself isn't in a bad area, but just to know I'm sitting next to kids who carry guns outside of school and some of who will likely kill someone before they're even 21 is weird.

What if I'm not cut out for this? My gut reaction was to get out of that internship, but so many students from my school have loved it and even come back for another semester. Does everyone have this sort of moment where shit gets real or is this a sign I shouldn't be working with this demographic? Quitting would make me feel horrible. 

I don't expect anyone to have any actual advice,  I just wanted to get this out there without worrying family or friends. "

43qywo,5,2016-02-01,"Job-hunt strategy. Trying to find out the most effective balance between being over-selective when looking for openings, and spamming resumes.",meldroc,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/43qywo/jobhunt_strategy_trying_to_find_out_the_most/,"One critique I seem to get from time to time, as I struggle with my job search is that I get over-selective when it comes to picking which openings to apply for.

Sure, I've got qualifications (master's degree in public administration, GIS certification, some paid, volunteer, and internship experience), but it seems like every job opening out there looks something like

&gt; REQUIRED:
&gt; 
&gt; * 15 years of experience straight out of college
&gt; * Fluent in 12 languages
&gt; * Experience writing nuclear reactor control code
&gt; * 5 years experience as an astronaut on the International Space Station
&gt; * etc.
&gt; 
&gt; UNDERQUALIFIED APPLICANTS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED...

So my friends tell me I need to be sending out five hundred resumes a week to every job opening on the boards - apply in volume.

Except I've come to the conclusion that resume-spamming doesn't get you there either.

So, what IS effective? It seems that if I go by qualifications and look for positions I actually am qualified for, there's hardly any positions out there at all, but if I just apply for everything, all I'm doing is getting spam-filtered by the resume-processing bots that HR departments love to use.

What's actually effective at getting me an offer and a paycheck?"

43rafy,2,2016-02-01,my first post - writing this to face my struggle and one day help others,supernova25,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/43rafy/my_first_post_writing_this_to_face_my_struggle/,"here goes.. I've never posted anything before, I've kept this under wraps for a long time. I feel like this addiction found me long before I ever knew I had a problem. Ive used this to cope.. to anaesthetise myself, unable to fully deal with the pain of my reality - all the trauma/ difficulty  from the age of 15 onwards. 

At college I would come home in my free periods to have lunch and Fap - I didn't see this as a cause for concern, just as horniness. 

When I was 18/19 I my friends showed me free porn videos as appose to the trailers &amp; stills  I'd been used to in the past years. By the time I was 20 I was watching about 2-3 hours a day, 'PMoing' about 2-5 times daily, I spent most of my time locked away in my dorm doing this. At 21 I was having weekly suicidal fantasies, very depressed, PMOing starting at 7am before I went to my Internship, and just PMOing so much I struggled to make it to 5pm at work, rushing to my laptop as soon as i got home. I would PMO every few hours just to literally function 7 days a week.

From my first year at uni, I was happy but felt a growing sense of depression, fear, anxiety and unease completely unaware as to why. 
Getting girls or having a girlfriend has always seemed like an alien concept to me, ‘something others did’ but something for many years in the past i have longed for. From 21-23 I felt an incredible sense of loneliness/need for intimacy but shackled due to this addiction. 
Its safe to say currently my brain is completely wired for a computer screen &amp; mind based fantasy (i can spike my dopamine very high just by fantasising) as I've not ever had a girlfriend. 

Mentally last year I hit rock bottom (despite curbing porn use to every 6 days /regular MO)my brain has been so fried, a stranger asked me where the train station was and I couldn’t process or remember. My anxiety reached a point where I was having anxiety/ panic attacks regularly, i.e.  trying on and buying jeans in an empty store just with women behind the counter – rushing out red faced and sweating.

Then as my habit escalated I finally tried to reboot hardmode after getting out of bed so full of fear and anxiety I actually couldn’t leave the sofa, just siting there trembling holding onto a cup of black coffee watching anything comforting.

I currently do not have major confidence issues (Ive worked on it to a point I can go clubbing and to bars alone - only when on a streak)  just a lingering depression, strong anxiety and bad memory recall.

After this ive managed streaks lasting 25 days, 5, 7, 5,12, and so on. I’m currently on day 13 (having failed hardmode – I edged for 3+ hours) I have reset to 102 days. I really want to put this to bed like everyone else on here does. 

Im quitting because I want to feel life actually touch me, and not be locked in mental turmoil, panic, fear and neurosis.

Thanks for reading.

The air was crisp, the blackened room illuminated with blue by a single computer monitor. The only audible sounds were the soft hum of the computer fan and the crunching of Cool Ranch Doritos™, with the soft pattering of footsteps growing in the distance. Light poured into the room followed by the face of a young man. ""Mr. Newell, Sir, a new wave of protesters are outside again, and we've received word from multiple departments about hackers stealing more information. What should we do?"" A single Dorito fell to the floor. Mr. Newell scooted his chair from his desk to the window on the other side of the room, leaning hard against the glass with his forearm as he surveyed his kingdom.
""This... Can be fixed"" He gasped out. ""We need to.... To hold Cough them off.."" His voice trailed as he rolls his chair back through the sea of Mountain Dew cans to a filing cabinet, ""Until the game is... Ready"" He opens the cabinet to pull out a family size bag of Cool Ranch Doritos™. ""Get me more Hot Pockets"" Newell moaned.
""Sir please, we need to do something quick. I can have an intern fetch you more Hot Pockets soon but we need to have a plan first!"" Newell frowns, ""Oh yeah I forgot... Heh... Uh yeah I know what to do about this. Yeah, we need... A sale!""
""Mr. Newell, the Steam Summer Sale ended a week ago, we can't have another sale!"" Newell removed his glasses, accidentally snapping one of the hinges in the process. He squinted hard and sighed a deep sigh.
""90% off everything. Do it.""
""Sir there's no way I can do that-""
""Don't.. Make me tell you twice Mark!""
""No, we can't do it!"" Said the lanky man at the doorway, flipping on the light switch causing Mr. Newell to recoil in pain. ""I know that there was a secret development team that was scheduled to have Half Life 3 completed a year ago! We both know it's here, and only you can end this. If not for the sake of your company, or employees, release the damn game for the people out there!""
Mr. Newell had a blank expression.
""I'm sorry sir, I was out of line I-""
""I want you to make... An announcement Mark"" Marks ears perked up with excitement.
""Yes sir, I'd be thrilled. What would you like for me to send to PR?""
""Tell... Them that uh... In two months we...""A smile creeps upon his face ""Will be releasing Left 4 Dead 3."" In complete shock, he shakes his head slightly, than realizes the futility in further protest. ""Yes sir.""
""Good... Good... heh"" Newell chuckled as he returns to his computer. He was just wrapping up a new trolling meme he had been working on, and the timing was impeccable. He paused briefly to open a folder titled ""Last_Will"". His Dorito covered fingers left a cool ranch trail on the screen where he dragged them, before turning away in pain. His eyes tear up, and he shuts down his computer"

So about a year back, I had gotton into an internship at a local computer shop. Ever since then the owner and I have become huge friends, he visits every other weekend for a LAN party, and I work at the shop 3-4 days a week during the summer and 2-3 days a week during the school year.

The problem is that in my mom's eyes I am a compulsive liar. Which I am. I've lied about pretty much everything and I don't even know why. Obviously my mom has had enough and told me about 2 weeks ago that I wouldn't be going back to the shop until I have almost all A's in my classes
and I stop lying. The other problem with that is that my mom knows that I have ADD/ADHD and refuses to get me medication for it because she thinks that Adderall will ""fry my brain"". Which it could, who knows.

Now that I'm done ranting, any tips as to how to reverse this fuck up? I would really appreciate it, as my boss is hilariously enough the only friend I have had in a long time. (Social Anxiety)"

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* 400-500 euro. 
&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Timing doesn't really matter to me.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* I would like to upgrade my GPU, potentially motherboard if needed and RAM. 
&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* I live in Denmark, but I have access to German and British Amazon.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I have a Geforce GTX 650. If this could be hooked up with the new GPU I'm looking to buy, that would be swell! 

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Not sure about this. Maybe? 

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* I would like a GPU that can handle 2 monitors, one being a 144 hz, the other being a pretty shitty old one. 

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Not really.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Dont need OS.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars: This is my current build:
Intel Core i5 4440 / 3.1 GHz Processor - LGA1150

While I know the last two times I failed due to a mix apathy and hecticness of uni with work, I am nervous that these two fails along with this being my last chance have created some negative mental feedback loop.

43rz8p,16,2016-02-01,My experience with online dating,IamClarkBane,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/43rz8p/my_experience_with_online_dating/,"A few years back I began messaging a girl from an online dating website - Soulsearch. Our courtship only lasted a few months, but it will undoubtedly haunt me for the rest of my life. Sometimes, often even, I lie awake and hold back a fit of screams as I ponder what difference I could have made had I only read the signs. 
I’ve just returned to my apartment after seeing my long time therapist, whom I can barely afford because I don't have any insurance. He tells me her mental condition was rare and that my PTSD is treatable, but any relief I've felt has been fleeting. 
It occurred to me that sharing my correspondence with Jenna with the rest of the world might do me some real good. What do I have to lose, right? For years now I couldn’t bear the thought of logging into Soulsearch and facing my message history, but in order to write this, I mustered my courage and logged back in.   
					
I used to work in the public library. It certainly wasn't exciting work, but it suited me, as I could often find a few hours to sneak away and do some personal reading. Typically, the women who come into libraries are mostly mothers and children. Unlike a campus library at a college, my library, being in the inner-city, was normally completely void of women in their mid-twenties. 

One particularly nice spring afternoon, I was restocking a shelf in the western section of our bookcases (one of my favorites) when the most stunning woman I'd ever laid eyes on strolled in and plopped down on the blue upholstered couch we had situated in our reading corner. She was tall, thin and had a cascade of thick brown hair flowing behind her as she sauntered through the nearly empty lobby. I nearly froze as her eyes met mine, and immediately I became a lustful shell of a man, spending the better part of an hour sneaking glances at her as she sat cross-legged with a copy of some cheesy erotica novel spread across her lap. I can't recall the name, but if you're thinking something in the vein of Fifty Shades, you're not far off the mark. 
Eventually, after realizing I was getting none of my work done, I had a moment of self-reflection and worked up the courage to approach her. The conversation was short, and probably awkward, considering my heart felt like it was climbing the walls of my throat in a desperate attempt to flee my body, but despite this my exterior remained as cool and collected as could be expected. I asked if she'd like to have coffee with me when I finished my shift in half an hour. I remember she closed her book and her eyes fluttered up to mine as an endearingly crooked smile crept across her face. She’d said she’d love to.	

Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, things turned out to be too good to be true. As my shift ended, things seemed to be going well. We strolled down the street and had a refreshingly intellectual conversation. She had recently returned from a backpacking trip through South America, and her worldliness only served to strengthen my infatuation with her. We got to the local Perk and our warm heartfelt conversation continued until a man approached our table and slid into the booth next to her. I had just finished reminiscing about a trip to Iceland I had taken the summer prior and was stopped mid-sentence as he brushed her hair from her cheek and kissed it. Her boyfriend. What is wrong with some women? The rest is just a blur of awkward floundering and some lame excuse to run for the hills, I'm sure. 

When I arrived back at my flat I was an emotional wreck, so naturally, I immediately went to the cupboard and poured myself a large glass of scotch. I downed it, then poured another, then another. Swaying back and forth, jittery and mad, an idea erupted into the forefront of my mind: Online dating. 

For the next few hours, my fingers pounded away at my keyboard. I created a profile and sifted through hundreds of potential women. Soulsearch was just like any other dating website. They ask you questions: How important is a religion to you? And you respond accordingly. Your responses are recorded and then amalgamated into a portrait of your personality. They then attempt to find local women who they deem suitable for you. As you might expect, in a typical testosterone-fueled fashion, I disabled this algorithm immediately so I might get a more superficial glimpse at what was out there. After perusing for some time, I found a couple women that I found incredibly attractive but soon realized that one was a religious zealot and the other had a disconcerting passion for all things equine. Disheartened, and convinced that no truly attractive women could possibly connect with me on a deep level of intellectual compatibility, I slowly moved my cursor up to the top right-hand corner of the screen. However, just before I managed to close the window, I received a pop-up notification explaining that I had received a personal message. Intrigued, I immediately opened it. Jenna. A picture of her perfect face filled my screen. Large brown eyes sat atop her impossibly wide cheekbones which were touched with a light dusting of brown freckles. Her lips were full, and her skin was endearingly bronzed. A plume of mocha colored hair cascaded down her face and ran across her thin shoulders. I couldn’t believe my luck -100 percent match.

Keith,
I'm relatively new to the whole internet dating scene but noticed we had nearly everything in common. Can you believe it? One big problem, though, whoops! I noticed I had forgotten to change my home address after my recent move to Chicago, so I'm no longer in Boston. I hope that isn't a deal breaker because you look really cute! Message me? 
June 6, 2011, 1:42 A.M.
Jenna,
You’re killing me, really? The one girl on Soulsearch whose favorite film is also Un Chien Andalou, and you’ve just moved? What a bummer. I suppose it isn’t necessarily a deal breaker. 
June 6, 2011, 1:52 A.M.
Keith,
Great! I just moved here and am working as a surgical intern. What do you do? 

I was still typing when a trickle of sunlight fluttered through the slit in my blinds. We had been awake all night, but I wasn’t even tired. I had never met nor talked to another human being that understood me on such a deep, intimate level. Religion? Check. Music? Check. Political policy? Check. What had I done to deserve this?

June 6, 2011, 5:52 A.M
Jenna,
Wow! I can’t believe you’ve always wanted to travel to New Zealand. I didn’t put that in my profile, but I’ve been saving to go there for the better part of this year. I don’t want to come off too forward, but I noticed your profile only has two close-up shots of your face. Here're a couple pictures of me in Iceland last summer. Think you could send me a few more pictures of yourself? 
June 6, 2011, 5:55 A.M
Keith, 
Maybe if things keep going this smoothly we can go to NZ together! I’ve attached a few more pictures of myself. Clothes on obviously, yah creep. =]

Attached to the message were two more pictures that were eerily similar to the first. Same bronzed skin, same flowing brown hair, but now the camera was slightly farther away. I could see her upturned breasts behind a pink crop top, but that was it - a face and a torso. The rest of her body was cropped out. I know it’s shallow, but I began to wonder if she didn’t have a bit of a weight problem that she was cleverly hiding. 

June 6, 2011, 5:56 A.M.
Jenna,
Any pictures that aren’t close-ups? Don’t be shy, I’m not shallow. 
June 6, 2011, 6:06 A.M. 
Keith,
I guess with as well as things are going I should probably just come clean, shouldn’t I? My arms, and well, my legs too, they’re horribly disfigured. The skin is marbled and pretty gruesome looking. I typically only wear long sleeve shirts and pants outside, because I’m pretty self-conscience about it. 
June 6, 2011, 6:10 A.M.
Jenna,
I’m really sorry to hear that. Were you born that way? I don’t think you should be self-conscience with me. I’m not in it for the looks. Plus, with that face, you could have tentacles for arms and I’d still take you out.
June 6, 2011, 6:14 A.M.
Keith, 
Lol! You would not! But seriously, though, they’ve been this way as long as I can remember. I won’t show you a picture. Like I said, it’s pretty awful, horribly terrible, actually. If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m mainly interested in online dating, because I hate the thought of anyone seeing them.
June 6, 2011, 6:19 A.M.
Jenna,
Hey now, don’t worry about it. I won’t pressure you into sending me anything you aren’t comfortable with. Consider it forgotten. I meant to ask earlier if you’re into folk music at all. I’ve been…

Things went on like that for the rest of the morning until I eventually passed out at the keyboard. As it turned out, even Jenna wasn’t perfect, and I was okay with that. I’d take a skin condition over a horse obsession any day. 
For weeks, messaging Jenna consumed my life. Our relationship had started to mature, and my day consisted of rushing home from the library to talk to Jenna about the books we were reading together. We had started our own little book club and would exchange notes and talk for hours. It was blissful, truly. The skin condition rarely came up, and if it did I was always sensitive and kind. Perhaps if I had the foresight I would have realized something was awry when she finally sent me her picture, but I don’t believe there was any way I could have known what would unfold. 

July 8th, 2011 3:42 P.M.
Jenna,
Is today the big day? I’m serious when I say you really don’t have to do this. I know this is a big deal for you.  
July 8th, 2011 3:45 P.M.
Keith,
Yes. I think today is the day. I don’t want to keep any secrets from you, but please, if it’s too wretched to look at, take it easy on me. There’s a reason I couldn’t show you before. 

Her message had two attachments with small thumbnails that didn’t reveal much at first glance, being as small as they were. I scrolled down and downloaded them both. Hovering over the files, I prepared myself for the sight I was about to see. When I double clicked the file and the image of Jenna filled my screen, I was dumbfounded. There, before me, standing in the living room of a quaint apartment in the suburbs of Chicago, was a beautiful woman attached to a completely unremarkable set of arms and legs. I couldn’t believe my eyes. 
July 6th, 2011 4:02 P.M.
Jenna, 
So, was this an elaborate scheme to make sure I wasn’t a superficial jerk? I guess I just don’t understand what the big deal was - you look great! Do you have a birthmark or something I can’t see in the pictures?
July 6th, 2011 4:04 P.M.
Keith,
Really? I open up to you and you can’t even be bothered to be sincere? Look, I know how bad it is, and I can take it. Don’t sugar coat it for me, Keith. 
July 6th, 2011 4:05 P.M.
Jenna,
I know you’re sensitive about this, but I am being sincere. You look completely normal. Let’s just move on and talk about something else. Please don’t worry about it! 

I didn’t hear from Jenna for a month after that, and it nearly killed me. I don’t think I’d been that depressed in my entire life, but I knew that pestering her with message after message was not the path to reconciliation. So I was patient and I waited, hoping that she’d message me when she was ready to move forward. Eventually, she did. 

August 2nd, 2011 2:23 P.M
Keith,
I’m sorry about the way we left things. I miss you. I miss talking to you, and I miss our little book club. I’m sorry I haven’t been able to message you sooner, but I’ve been terribly sick. Shortly after our conversation on the sixth, I started getting a terrible stomach ache and couldn’t bear to sit at the computer anymore. I tried to lie down but the pain only got worse. As it turns out, a staph infection had crept into the disfigured portions of my skin. Yikes! Luckily I have some good friends at the hospital who were able to write me a solid prescription and I’ve been recovering from home. Honestly, I’m still feeling pretty weak, but I’ve never felt happier. The treatment actually helped clear up most of the mottling, and I’ve never looked better. I even lost some weight! Can you believe it? Anyways, I know this must come as a shock, and I wish I could have contacted you sooner, but I had hoped you’d come visit me if you haven’t already moved on. I could really use a friendly face around here. 
August 2nd, 2011 2:45 P.M.
Jenna,
I can’t believe this. You’ll have to forgive me but I thought you’d just gone crazy and decided to move on. I’m so happy to hear from you! I can barely type because my hands are shaking. Of course, I’ll come see you. How soon? 
August 2nd, 2011 2:47 P.M.
Keith, 
As soon as possible. =] 

Call me desperate, naïve, pathetic, but I packed my things and booked a flight for the next day. The flight was filled with nervousness and apprehension but was over before I knew it. I was walking down my gate when I realized I had a voicemail from Jenna. She had called while the flight was underway. 
August 3rd, 2011 3:42 P.M. 
Hey, Keith, I know your flight hasn’t arrived yet, but I wanted to let you know that I can’t wait to see you. I thought I’d take you out to dinner and show you around Chi-town. I may be still getting ready when you arrive, though, so don’t be alarmed and just walk right in. My address is 514 W 22nd – Apartment 267 

I had only heard her voice a few other times, but never in a message this long. She sounded odd, faint even. Like she wasn’t fully awake, but I couldn’t tell why. Perhaps she had just awakened from a nap. When that thought crossed my mind it resonated wildly. Here I was visiting some girl I know nearly everything about, but I hadn’t ever seen her in person, nor had I ever carried out a verbal conversation lasting more than a minute. I felt sick and wanted to book a plane back to Boston. I could have told her that I had had a family emergency. My mother was in a car accident, she would understand, right? But I didn’t, I had come too far already. And frankly, I don’t think I could have justified the cost of flying to Chicago without at least meeting her. 

Her apartment was situated on the corner of her city block in a quiet middle-class neighborhood. Two children were playing soccer in a front yard next to her complex. The goal posts had been obviously hand-crafted from PVC pipe by a loving parent. Approaching the apartment, I glanced upward at its beige façade and noticed apartment 267 was visible from the Northern side. The maroon blinds had been drawn tightly shut. 
Like Jenna had explained in the voicemail, her door was unlocked. I knocked a few times to announce myself, and then slowly entered. The apartment had two floors. The bottom was a kitchen and a family room, and the top floor was a lofted bedroom. 

“Jenna?” I called up the stairs, but there was no answer. Loud EDM music flowed down from the upstairs bathroom. It was probably masking my call. I walked halfway up the carpeted stairs and could see light emanating from the crack underneath her bathroom door. Blood rushed to my head as I realized how surreal the situation was. I might as well have been a burglar.  
“Jenna?” I called again, this time, louder. I heard some rustling from the bathroom and she turned the volume down a bit. 
“Uh… He- Hey Keith! I’ll be a little while longer, help yourself to anything in the fridge, I’m so sorry you have to wait for me, just making a few touch ups. I’ll be down in a few.”
Her voice was labored, which concerned me, but I sauntered down the stairwell and made myself at home. She had stylish black granite countertops and a large flat screen TV next to a long leather couch. Sitting on the couch, I sunk in and proceeded to flip through channel after channel nervously waiting. Thirty minutes when by, which led to an hour, which led to two hours. I was frustrated but didn’t really know what to make of the situation. This level of inconsideration was not like Jenna at all, and I figured she was obsessing about her appearance. It was probably her “issues,” so I got up and walked up the stairs, stopping in front of the bathroom door. The EDM was louder now. She had turned it up. It was some new house song that had been released the day before. I recognized it from my RSS feed. Standing in front of the door, I drew in a breath to call for her again when a sound stopped me. Moaning. It was as clear as day - a low, quiet moan. Again, and again. Sex.  

She was cheating on me. I couldn’t believe it. She had invited me here, had me fly halfway across the country to see her, and I was probably one of a dozen guys she’d been corresponding with. He was probably in on it too, and would likely climb out the window when his turn was over. What a god damn joke. My vision turned red, and I couldn’t keep my composure any longer. I charged at the bathroom door and slammed my fists into the wood. 
“I know what you’re doing in there!” I said. 

“No… No… Please don’t come in. I’m, it’s fine we’re almost done.” 
“We’re!? What the fuck Jenna!” 
“It’s not what you think, I swear!”

She was right. It wasn’t. 

Fury overtook me and I kicked in the door with all of my strength. The latch buckled from the force, and the door swung open, careening into a tiled countertop. I locked eyes with Jenna whose pupils had nearly filled her eyes. I couldn’t process what laid before me. The image was there reflecting off of my retina, but some part of me, a subterranean guardian, had its hands clenched around my optic nerves. Black. 
“I wanted to be beautiful for you!” She wailed at me as floodgates opened and torrents of adrenaline rushed into my bloodstream.

I turned around and raced out of that godforsaken apartment. My heart was a V8 with open headers holding 7000 RPM. When I finally stopped running, I collapsed onto a park bench. A metallic taste filled my mouth, and I could barely see. I didn’t know how far I had gone, but that atrocity, that horror. That abysmally tragic thing in the bathroom. It nearly made my heart stop when what I had seen had sunk in. And when it did sink, it sunk deep. 

I had locked eyes with her as she had laid there. Her eyes were surprised, but they betrayed her true emotion, elation. Her skin was pale, the life had been drained out of her, but some sickness was being quelled in the deepest parts of her mind and she was happy. The man with the bone saw had looked back over his shoulder with an expression, not unlike a child being caught with his hand in a cookie jar. He had been diligently working for most of the afternoon.

On the countertop was a polystyrene cooler containing several blood bags, and hanging from the shower head was an intravenous drip. What was left of Jenna had lain in the bathtub. A large Rubbermaid bin stood in the center of the tile floor. It had been filled with all but one of Jenna’s appendages. She was little more than a torso when I saw her. Her last leg had been halfway removed by the man, who was struggling to get through the last inch of her bone. Her skin had been neatly sutured closed around her shoulders and left buttock. Her makeup was done, and a sleeveless dress had been hung from the hook on the wall.

Your long flowing blonde hair was painstakingly curled slightly for me. You spent three hours in front of the mirror doing your makeup exactly how I preferred; not too much, but just enough so that I could call you daddy's little whore. You wore that tight red dress that I bought you a month ago, the one that gripped your little round ass so tight and gave me a perfect eyeful of cleavage. Slutty but sexy. And underneath it you wore your sexiest lacy black bra and matching tiny thong. You were my plaything and you knew it.

We'd been doing this for a while now; the gorgeous young college intern who'd do anything to get ahead and the young upstart boss who was handed everything by his father. And ironically, while I was given my power from my father, you crave this job so much because of yours. You grew up wanting to work where daddy works, didn't you? This was your dream job. You've worked so hard for years to be able to even get an internship at the company and now that you're here you would do anything to land an actual full-time position.

That's how we started. It was innocent enough at first. Some light flirting here and there. Your hand would brush against my leg, a light touch on the shoulder, any chance you could find to innocently bend over to give me a peek. You started this. This was your decision and it is your fault. You wanted this.

Now we've been meeting in secret for months and we've done just about everything I can think of with you. You've loved every second of it. You convince yourself that you're doing it to get ahead, but I know there's a dirty filthy whore lurking behind every one of your innocent smiles. This is your escape.

But you're not my first pretty young play thing and you won't be my last. I'm bored and I want to use you up one last time in spectacular fashion.

You don't know that yet. All you know is that I've sent you home midday to get ready for another of our ""regular meetings"" in my office just after closing. You're to wear your hair the way I like it. You're to wear the clothes that I like. You're to do your makeup as I like it. And you're to be the eager slut I like you to be. When you meet me is when the fun will begin.

I'd like someone to RP as a submissive office intern to the young boss. This RP will be about public humiliation and shaming when you're surprised to be taken to a party with all of your coworkers instead and used and abused there. A big component of the RP will be psychological (definitely dubcon) with your job being threatened and verbal and physical humiliation. I will be RP'ing as the boss but also a narrator for the other people's involvement. If you're interested in RP'ing others' actions towards you too, that would be okay.

I have a full list of kinks here https://i.imgur.com/LCljEQA.png and would like to hear what kinks and limits you have if you are interested since it's a pretty wide open RP.

I'm looking for responses of a few paragraphs or so in a long term RP. Can't wait to hear from you!

I've been REALLY depressed lately, things were going so well six months ago but since late November it started going downhill from there. 

My love life is in gutters, I met this beautiful girl on June, it was the first time i ever had enough confidence to ACTUALLY ask a girl out on a date, but I was so awkward around her, so incompetent, so ignorant and so shy, i blew it off bad, FUCK! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUUUUUUUUUCK . 

I lost a dear family member on July, and i'm still not over it fully.

Then came, September, and i met this other girl that managed to get my mind of the first girl and lift up my spirit from the death of my family member, she wasn't as cute as the first one but had so much charisma ... Well guess what happened, i chickened out when things got a bit more serious. Now she unfriended me from Facebook and doesn't talk to me, but it's OK, I wouldn't talk to me either if i was in her shoes.

Then came the real blow, i REALLY put a lot of efforts on getting a really good internship for this winter, I fucking bled for that one, worked my ASS OFF to get a job, any job, but with the luck i have, i didn't get a single interview, NOT ONE, i rewrote my CV and letter a thousand times, and applied for hundred of places, but got no luck. I had to talk to a professor to get a joke of an internship in the R&amp;D department of my Uni and btw. this is my last semester of college.

Needless to say, I have locked myself in my room, stopped talking to anyone except my family and I feel like shit BEFORE AND AFTER watching porn. Masturbating feels like a task, i find no joy in it, yet i can't stop. I am seriously considering going to see an escort and simply loose my V card the way i'll be finishing my degree, dully and unworthy.

TL;DR : Basically, I'm graduating this winter with next to zero work experience, no girl, virgin and 24 years old. YEAY ME!!!  I feel like shit, and i'm seriously considering going to see an escort to loose my V card because PMO doesn't cut it anymore.

But, if you are fully prepared, you can easily make the transition from home to college life. Take advantage of the following 10 tips to help you get through your college years.

#Stay Organized 

If you are disorganized, you are never going to accomplish anything. The better you are at organizing, and we mean organizing everything, the easier your life, and your college career, are going to be. Keep a weekly planner and write down every important thing that you need to do, from studying for exams to keeping appointments and then some.

#Use Your Resources 

While you are in college, you will have loads of resources available to you, from tutoring to library services to clubs to counseling and more. Take advantage of as many of these resources as possible.

#Get Involved 

While it is never a good idea to take on too much, especially in your first year, you should check out some of the campus clubs and organizations to see what interests you. This is a great way to make new friends, make connections for future employment, etc.

#Get Cheap Textbooks 

Textbooks are ridiculously expensive, but there are plenty of ways to get them without having to pay full price. Check out websites like Textbooks.com, Barnes and Noble, and Amazon. Don’t forget to ask students if they are selling their old textbooks, and look for other ways to get used textbooks.

#Follow Campus Rules

While this may seem like a no-brainer, there are a lot of people who will try and push the boundaries, because they are on their own for the first time. Remember, you are paying good money for your college education. The last thing you want is to get kicked out because you weren’t following campus rules.

#Take Care of Your Pets 

Because studies show that students often perform better when they have pets in their lives, more and more campuses are allowing students to keep small pets in their dorm rooms. If you have a pet, make sure that you take care of its health by having good insurance (start with comparing pet insurance at Pet Insurance University) to pay for vet care.

#Take Advantage of Your Student Discount 

There are loads of places that will offer student discounts, and you can save a lot of money by taking advantage of these discounts. Use as many as are available to you, for everything from school supplies to meals to electronic devices and more.

#Get a Mattress Topper 

Dorm beds aren’t necessarily the most comfortable beds in the world, but you need to get plenty of sleep to do your best in college. You can make your dorm bed a lot more comfortable by investing in a good mattress topper. The more comfortable you are, the more sleep you are going to get, and the more alert you are going to be in classes and when you are studying.

#Check Out Internships – 

If you want to see if you are going to like a career path, an internship is a great way to do it. You get to meet people in the industry, and you will learn a lot. Some companies even offer paid internships. Ask the guidance counselor about internship programs in the area.

#Relax and Enjoy Yourself 

Obviously, your main goal is to graduate and go on to a great career. But, don’t let yourself become overwhelmed by study. You also need to take time out for yourself, so you can relax and do things that you enjoy. If you let yourself get burned out with study and don’t have fun, things may not go as well as you had planned.

At 13 I started having fantasys of starting my own. So my mother helped me a bit and I made slap bands and sold them at a fair each weekend. Every time I went I would get around 30 - 40 dollars.

I host a site: sterango.com and I have some brilliant ideas that I know I can execute with the right capital and team. I have assembled a team, my uncle is an IT Director, his son worked as a intern last year and we all have learn so much about technology through that. Also my great uncle was an entrepreneur and actually got bought out by Xeoxn, the printer company/made 1st mouse? So really I need some people to invest in me and my ideas.

43sy13,2,2016-02-02,Feeling Depressed,Tryn2lookup,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/43sy13/feeling_depressed/,"Hi Reddit, 

I’ve frequented reddit for quite some time now, but this is my first post. I wasn’t sure where else to vent this information so I felt like I would just go ahead and post something on here.

For a while now (more than a year?) I haven’t felt like my old self. At first I kind of thought this was just a part of growing up (currently a college senior). I figured I wouldn’t feel the same like I used to, and I’m assuming that is correct. But for the longest time I’ve just felt down. I used to be full of energy and now I spend a lot of time in my bed.

Growing up I was very active. In HS I was on the homecoming courts, near the top of my class, participated in sports, and had a wide variety of friends. Went to college on partial athletic and academic scholarship, but eventually discontinued the athletics to pursue career opportunities to help pay for school. As most people have experienced, high school came pretty easy to me but college has been pretty rough. I’m about to get an Engineering degree from a good school, but I don’t quite have a 3.0 GPA, in fact just below it. This has given me problems in finding a job/career, even though I am less that one tenth away from 3.0, and have probably about 3 years of high level work experience on my resume. I’m currently 3 months from graduation and have nothing lined up… no interviews/leads/anything.

My parents have always been great to me, a perfect support system. In fact this weekend I visited them twice, and gladly took me out to eat both times… which is what led me to where I am now. I truly care for them but I’m super worried about disappointing them with not being able to get a career and get started on my life. My dad owns a small business that my older brother works for, and it constantly worries my dad that he won’t be able to provide enough income to give my brother the salary he needs, and I don’t want to add to that by leaning on them anymore… I always have known that they essentially expected (not in a bad or demanding way) that I would be able to take care of myself after high school.

Also, in the past year I’ve had two job opportunities fall through. A company that I had long interned for and was supposed to again summer 2015, fell through because of a miscommunications of e-mails. Once I had figured out what was wrong, they said I had missed my signing date and would have to apply again in the future, but now I hear nothing from them when I apply. Then in the fall I had an internship, but the gentleman who hired me moved companies, and my “new boss” had no work for me and was frankly not interested in me so I was released after only a short time.

In addition to this I currently have a very small group of friends, many of my other friends have moved on/got married/started their lives. Meanwhile I haven’t been very able to meet new/other people, and haven’t been on a date in any fashion in probably close to three years. I believe I am a somewhat attractive looking man, I workout every day, and I usually go out to campus bars/areas essentially every weekend with three of my closest friends, have tried dating apps, but I haven’t been able to land any dates or anything.

So basically in the past year I've lost two job opportunities, had no dates, and had close friends move away who I've slowly lost close contact with. I always thought that I would get through college in one fashion or another, date on and off in college, meet many people, and be well on my way with a good paying job in which I could support myself completely by 2016. I’ve often had suicidal thoughts, but I don’t think I could ever put my parents through that. Here I am a few months away from being “out in the real world” and I’m completely terrified."

This is also a day of celebration for that very small subset of the population who has an irrational love for fax machines.

[Kliff Kingsbury](#i/kingsbury) **WHAT'S A FAX MACHINE?**

Glad you asked, Kliff. A fax machine is an archaic instrument that is somewhat like an early version of email. It let you send copies of documents all over the world, and all it took was a dedicated phone line, [the proper know-how](http://i.imgur.com/T3X0rOY.gif), and a small amount of blood magic. Sadly, with the growing use of email, fax machines are now rarely used. The exceptions are basically limited to gun shops and college athletic offices. You may also recognize the fax machine from [this scene in Office Space. NSFWorkplaceElectronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svvc47Tr0R8) Some teams have even had dedicated interns to operate the fax machine on NSD!

Anyway, here's a primer for how we'll handle the day devoted to recruiting on /r/CFB. The goal is to reduce confusion and arguing over which ranking service is better or exactly which [insert common surname here] is going to which [OSU/UT/etc.].

## FAQ

* **What is National Signing Day?** - This is a day where we all make whimsical signs about football! No, not really. This is the first day that graduating high schoolers can submit their letters of intent, which is an NCAA document that is a binding agreement between athlete and school - the athlete agrees to attend for one year, the school agrees to provide athletics scholarship to the player in return. A national letter of intent (NLI) isn't required, but is preferred by programs so that they can accurately account for scholarship slots. These must be signed by a parent and then faxed or (new!) emailed in. [Sometimes, things do *not* go smoothly.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/02/06/alex-collins-arkansas-mother-letter-of-intent-signing-day/1896357/)

* **How many recruits can my team sign?** - [It's very simple, you see...](http://i.imgur.com/sYG37nB.gif) On second thought, disregard that. Who knows how many. Probably 15-25. Maybe 12. Maybe 35. It's all rather *fluid*. There are all kinds of loopholes that can cause fluctuations, since early enrollees can be backcounted toward empty slots in previous years, some conferences limit the number counted towards a single year, plus the NCAA has a roster hard count of 85 total scholarship players.

* **Why does this matter?** - I'll let some of our own users explain it. Recruiting rankings [help predict NFL draft success,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/43gzjr/for_those_who_dont_buy_recruiting_rankings/) which can in turn help your program. Recruiting can also help serve as a predictor for a team's success, as discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/36mmow/bill_connellys_initial_2015_sampp_projections/crfjuro/?context=3). In general, better teams are built on better recruits. Unless, of course, you're a wizard. [Kansas State Ball](#i/kansasstateball) 

* **No, seriously, why does this matter?** - Fine, [read this.](http://espn.go.com/college-football/recruiting/story/_/id/14673763/guide-recruiting-hate-national-signing-day)

* **How do recruits commit?** - Most already have, usually via twitter or a press conference. No snapchat commits, yet. I think... The blue chip recruits and some who are waiting to find out if there will be enough room are waiting until Wednesday. [Here's a schedule](http://www.sbnation.com/college-football-recruiting/2016/2/1/10875760/national-signing-day-schedule-2016-tv-streaming-recruits-commitments-announcements-ceremonies) of the big name announcements.

I had interned there since I was an undergrad and continued my internship while working on my Masters. I decided to go through the thesis route in case I wanted to pursue a PhD later, and chose a professor who had close connections to the national lab, so my research is related to project at my internship. I am basically done, and my last semester is working on writing my thesis and papers.

Everything is fine and dandy except for one thing. There's a new grad student in my lab, and my professor wants him to follow my route. My professor managed to get him an internship at the same national lab I'm going to be working at. Also, my professor and the new grad student have been relying on me to act as the messenger between the company and them and are expecting me to help the new grad student start his PhD project at the company.

Honestly, I don't want to do it but I feel really terrible for not wanting to help my group member. It's just that I want to focus only on work. I don't want to be constantly relied upon especially from my professor and the new grad student. I know it's really selfish to not wanting to help, but I really just want to focus on my career. I don't mind helping here and there, but it feels like they are asking too much from me and want me to set up everything for the grad student. 

Should I just suck it up and just help out? I know science is all about collaborating and helping each other out, but I don't want to be my professor's grad student forever. I thought I had some freedom to live my life the way I wanted once I graduated.

TL;DR: I'm graduating this year and starting my fulltime position at a National Lab. Professor wants me to help new grad student start his project and collaborate with the same National Lab I'm working at. They are expecting me to help the new grad student a lot, but I just want to focus on work. Any advice?"

This is what I've figured out so far about getting a formal Comp Sci Education:

1.) You will not get a job on the merit of your degree alone. Experience goes a very long way, so supplementing your bachelor's with open source projects or internship work can distinguish you from the mass of recent graduates.

2.) It's important to seek out and secure an internship during your summer breaks while studying CS - they give important experience with real world code and may offer you a job if you're a good fit.

3.) Form study groups and social circles within your CS cohort to tackle difficult problems together.

4.) Be prepared to spend at least 10-20 hours a week coding. Maybe aim for a lighter course load if you've got multiple comp sci courses.

5.) Treat your school like a job, or a craft you intend to master. Your education doesn't stop outside the classroom, and it needs to be buttressed by lots of self-study.

Anything you'd add or amend to my list?"

2. I can take grad level CS classes next year

3. I can do really well in my internship this summer at FB and also be ready for interviews come senior fall. 

The catch: My GPA right now is 3.50. If I get C's in Operating Systems (it's graded notoriously hard) and B's in the rest of my classes, my GPA will be around 3.1.

43ur7q,2,2016-02-02,[Interview Question] How to design and implement a distributed database?,branchgit,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/43ur7q/interview_question_how_to_design_and_implement_a/,"I got ask this in an interview question from a start up as an about to be new grad. The question is to implement a distributed database with a given set of schema. Although my answer was rejected, I think this was an incredibly interesting question and I would like to know more about the topic. It would be nice if someone can point out my errors in my answers.


So first I started with the basic stuff, 1st, 2nd and 3rd normalization, but then I got stuck on the distributed part. 

So there is multiple problems to consider

1. How do you read from a database
    i. How do you read from a database if you have multiple database with the same data

2. How do you write to a database
    i. How do you split the database if a database gets too large
   ii. How do you write to a database if you have multiple database with the same info.

Here is my final (wrong/rejected by the interviewer, I have no previous database experience class or internship only web dev) answer ,  

Say that you start with one table and one database.

You continue write to a database until the database contains X rows. In this case reading and writing is trivial if you don't have duplicate servers. 

If we have duplicate servers, we should have multiple read servers as slave, and one write server as master. If the master server cannot handle the write volume (Q1. What is the metric, slowness, or perhaps the length of writing queue?) than that means that we should split the database. Here is where the tricky part comes in. Say that a client write to the master and now wants to read their data. Q2. What is the method of propagation, by row? by entire database? If by row we need to check dirty rows, and presumably we need to update multiple rows at the same time and query those rows to update it, this gets very complicated, so I answered by entire database. Now we have a synchronization issue, because if we have slave and master that is out sync we need to update the slave server. Q3. What is the frequency of this update? Imagine if the client is creating an account, ideally we would want to keep the entire write propagation under 4sec. Then the propagation frequency have to be under 4 sec. Assume we split the time cost from master to slave propagation and the entire slave duplication, this means 2 second for master to slave propagation
Lets assume it takes 1sec to write an entire database to slave (Q5. is this even a correct assumption). Then we would have to have a propagation frequency of 2 sec. 

    K
    A B  C D
    - - | - - |     
    1 2  3 4   

Master will propagate at start of second 2 and end at start of second 3. B will not be able to write to server at that time.

At the start of second 3 slave will start replicating to all the duplicate servers, the number of servers we have is 2 to the number of round of replication where number of round of replication is defined by log_2(number of round of replication) * 1 sec/per round = 2 sec, for our case 4 server is replicated, with one root server always busy. So there are 3 servers that we can read from. There are 2second of down time every two second. This also means data is inconsistent. For example if K and A write at the same, and K's input is dependent on A, then we would most likely have wrong answer if K fetch its read from slave. So this means that every write have to read from master. 

Once the database reaches X rows, you need to a key to split it, ideally you would want to split keys that will have equal write and read probability in the split database. That is, a random user that wanted to read would have a equal likelihood of hitting either of the split database. The same goes with writing. To achieve this you really have to look at the access pattern of the database, and since I wasn't given that in the question, I choose to prioritize equal write probability since you can have fast lookup with cache server. In this case I am using authentication database as my example. The main schema contains username, password, email, birthday and creation date. Among the schemas, birthday make more sense to be a variable that is equally distributed across its possible value. Lastly when we split the key we would have to set up routing logic in the load balancer. 

So the above is the theoretical part. I am not sure if its correct at all, since I didn't even design it to be fault tolerant using RAID or redundancy. (Q6. How do I design fault tolerant distributed database, I guess if master fails I can promote one of the slave to become master) But I was ask to implement this. Here is where I got really stuck. I suppose you have to write a wrapper on top of database. But I am not even sure if there is an exposed api for the common sql rdbms doing that. So here is my final question, what are some common libraries to scale sql horizontally. Maybe I can look at the source code of it to figure out what they are doing.

Thanks

Always had kind of a fragile psyche, which naturally resulted in getting constantly bullied in school(s). Suppose it was an entry point for everything else. Anyway after those darker days back in elementary and high school I supposedly freed myself from the cruelty of children and finally got into the adulthood. Was taking medication before that even happened though, taking some now also. I studied economics - public relations, just to quickly get rid off the world's facade, that this particular direction has any potential in making any sort of money or accomplishment that is worth anything. I managed to finish my bachelor and carried on. Naturally after that I tried something else, went for accounting. Wasted 2 years doing that as it turned out. This completely missed the spot, as I wasn't even remotely interested in doing any sort of accounting. It also didn't give any reasonable opportunities in life. In the meantime I tried doing my own business, many times (had a friend back then). Unfortunately we didn't succeed at any idea we tried. It was always a third party, which failed to deliver what we needed. That didn't really deter me back then. After resigning from accounting we tried one last shot and went for web development training, which we paid for. It was a turning point as World finally seemed to be giving us an opportunity. We grabbed it. My friend developed his skills quickly, even got to work for a company for 3 months, where he learned dozens of new things. I didn't have as much luck, but managed a steady process of improvement, making projects with him. We learned a lot, even though our 2 projects for browser based games ultimately ended in a pit of abandonment. We went to study IT and things were still looking good. As long as you study, you know you have time to improve and everything will get better. In the meantime we managed to get part time jobs as trainers for people who didn't know a thing about web development. We got some money, some experience and kind of a bright look at the future. Studies quickly came to an end, we both managed to get our master's degrees (I also got an engineering degree) and did another project, which had a higher chance of success. It too however failed and is to this day laying on my hard drive, gathering dust. After that there was a period of adjustment and my friend quickly started to become quite superior in programming. He managed to get an internship in another company, which again improved his skills. Then he got a proper job as a back-end web developer in yet another company, which he currently still works in. Me on the other hand... I was blissfully working as a seasonal trainer in basics of web development. Things started to look grim again as I stopped getting any sort of skill, just mowing over the same concepts again and again. Then a little light in the tunnel appeared. I met a very trustworthy person as it seems, who knew a guy that owned another firm, which was into web development. He helped me get acquainted and after some time I managed to get a job there. Of course my primary desire was to code in javascript and front-end technologies. Unfortunately they only had a position for QA specialist (handling support). I took it anyway. After I started working there I quickly came to realize how poor my skills really are. I understand the syntax of languages, but the magic some people can come up with left me flabbergasted and wildly surprised. I got thrown at with some scraps of a project to do minor coding too, but it wasn't really anything important. And then a final blow quickly came. I met my friend after 5 months of him working in the company as back-end developer and realized how huge the gap of knowledge and abilities became between us. It crushed me a little bit back then. Now I think I come to some sort of an end, because the company I work for won't need support any longer, as they are changing their database handle system. This emptiness inside of me makes me reluctant to do anything at home after work, to improve or gain some new knowledge. I feel tired and crushed, as my primary dream of creating something on my own faded away long ago. Maybe it's laziness of some sort, but I just don't feel a rush or even a remote basic need of improvement. I want it, I want to feel it and act upon it, but I can't. Now even a basic thing such as having a job in an IT company starts to be threatened. I recently started smoking and drinking much more and think my greatest fear of ending up on a street as a homeless man, without anything or anyone starts to realize itself. To any of you who are younger than me, please choose your future wisely and try to commit to it. Polish your skills and you will most certainly avoid the fate I seem to be facing now. I wish I had more time... Just a little more time..."
43vdqk,0,2016-02-02,Committing to Improvement,giwndklewe,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/43vdqk/committing_to_improvement/,"Yello Reddit. I've been playing LoL since around S3. Carried to Silver last season through duos and to gold the season before that. It hasn't been until this season that I've realized how hard I was really carried by my diamond friends. That in combination with over a year spent away from the game since the last time I was what I would call decent. I was bouncing around in S3-S4 before I rollover hoping to get my mmr, mostly solo queue but some duo, went 4-6 in placements and went straight to B4 because I'm pretty sure my MMR was a fair bit lower than the avg. S3 from over duoing to get to silver towards the start of the season and losing a lot of matches at 0 LP. I've had some time off and as I'm starting an internship full time in a little over a month, I don't have any classes this qtr., and seeing as it's the start of the season, most of my RL friends are playing whenever they can too, so I've been playing a lot league more than I ever have. I'm talking almost 200 games played. I had this idea that I needed to climb my way out of of Bronze ASAP while those that didn't belong here were still around high bronze and it wouldn't be complete ELO hell quite yet. As I played so much solo queue without my high plat/diamond friends on their smurfs, I realized how bad my fundamentals were for someone who previously considered themselves to be high silver or even gold skill level. I compared myself with other previous golds that climbed there themselves and didn't nearly have their ability to consistently carry bronze matches. My CS at times was where I thought it should be but not consistently, at times not above 150 at 25 minutes, which I figure basically leaves me useless as a carry at that point in the game. Most of these realizations came around 60~ games for me. I really anticipated climbing out into silver in less than 100, perhaps even less than 50 games. Almost 200 games later and I'm b5 0 lp, lower than I started. (After a fkn tilter of a night mind you), and I just don't know what to do. I honestly feel that I'm able to be self critical and see my mistakes much more than the average bronze and my friends that sit in skype with can attest to this. I also come down on myself for lack of cs and I've definitely seen it improve in the last 100 games along with my map awareness and death count avg.. I could state the obvious about AFK's and whatnot, and in my case I without fail seem to get my unlucky AFK games the match before series or in my series itself, but this obviously cannot be completely blamed for my rank. Around the 100 game mark I also went through and checked my brand games, who I played for a majority of those games, and saw that my win % with him was really low, especially considering I felt that was my most impactful champion/lane pick. So I decided to stop with the support for a while, even the games I did well and had that crazy brand support damage, it still didn't feel like I could carry myself out of bronze with it even if it my most comfortable pick. Decided to focus on improving ADC and top game, because it seems like the easiest to carry from, and they're my weakest positions. What are some other steps I could take to make myself silver worthy? Really any tips are appreciated, along with any tales of the climb anyone might have from their own experience. Would you advise trying to push with a small set of champions or really focusing just 1 or 2 and trying to master them as well as I can? Is a 45% win rate in b5- b3 a sign that a climb is really not a realistic goal for me? Sorry this post is all over the place, but my mind is feeling a bit that way after this tilt party and I'm just feeling lost. As someone who considers himself a decent gamer, with a pretty healthy record PVE record in all kinds of MMO's, namely a world top 5 HLK25H kill and a world top 10 KJ kill, I really don't feel like I have the reflexes or awareness of someone that should be bronze, even though with a couple really old glad titles, I'm historically not a PVPer. With a past full of so much serious gaming and relative success with hard objectives, it's killing me that I'm ending up so unsuccessful this series after putting so much of myself and my time into it.

TLDR -~- My KDA for the last 100~ is 6.5.:3:7, avg CS at 15 minutes is 104,  is this even close to where I need to be to contend at low Silver? Do I deserve a 45% win rate with a scoreline like that? What things do I need to focus on to really climb and improve my win %? How did you climb out of bronze by yourself? What are champions to learn that are perfect for the job?

I've definitely learned a lot about CS, like the SDLC and Java, and how to build programs or really, more like specific functions. But I still feel like my knowledge is incomplete even though I fulfilled all the requirements to receive a degree in Computer Science! 

I would love to be a full stack developer, but I definitely want to work on my front end development skills. We had only one class offered in the entirety of the class catalog that went over HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. Probably the most advanced thing we did in Javascript was AJAX... so we didn't learn a lot. Everything else I learned about web development was through my internship last summer. I will be starting another job at CustomInk after I graduate, and I'm sure I will learn a lot there too, but I'm still feeling really nervous. I'm scared I'll never learn the really cool stuff I want to learn and just fall into a rut doing the same boring things I know how to do. 

What I really want to do is to become a web designer/ front end developer that can make really awesome artistic websites. How can I learn more advanced CSS and Javascript? Where do I go to learn how to create animations and other sophisticated effects?

I go onto awwwards.com and see all these super cool websites that are Javascript heavy, with cool animations and different effects. How can I learn to make websites like this? Is it all through purely self-teaching? What are some good resources? Do they offer in-person classes (I would pay?) 

I'm not great at self-teaching.. I've learned the most through in-person classes or internships. So what is the best way to learn this stuff? How did you learn it? "

I'm just looking for a bit of advice/perspective on my situation. I'm a 23 year old from Ireland looking to move to New York. I graduated in November 2015 with an Msc in Finance. I got a 3.6 GPA. I have secured a working visa for mid April of this year. 

Having scoured this sub I know the importance of internships when it comes to getting a jobs as an analyst in the big investments banks. I also know that April is off cycle for recruitment, but have been told not to start applying to jobs as I do not have a US address yet. I was wondering if you could shed some light on whether or not I should be applying now, or is applying online really the ""black hole"" that I've read about. 

I have experience working in my friends start up where I did advise him on some financial matters, and he is willing to give me a good reference where I maybe slightly exaggerate my responsibilities. It is a marketing firm that is starting to gain serious traction in Ireland, and I was wondering would putting something like this on my resume be advisable. 

Since I've known that I wanted to work in New York for a while, I'm working at a global recruiting firm in data analytics. They allowed me to take up a six month contract which enabled me to save for New York. This job doesn't have much to do with finance but is extremely detail orientated and I feel like it has taught me a lot. They know that I am leaving and really like me so I will receive an extremely positive reference from here as well.

I'm extremely capable  with software such as R and Stata, as well as being proficient in Microsoft Suite and VBA. I subscribe to seeking alpha to keep up to date with the latest market opinions, as well as reading the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. I'm also in the middle of completing the Breaking into Wall Street financial modelling course, and will complete some courses related to investment banking on Coursera if it'll help my chances. I've also looked at a few books on valuation such as Damordan's and have been actively reviewing material related to Investment Banking that I obtained from during my masters. 

I was wondering if you think there's a chance that somebody like me could break into a middle market or small boutique with no real relevant experience? I'm trying to network with as many people as I know in New York but so far this hasn't turned up any leads!

Thanks for any feedback or advice on what to work on in the next two months to help me.

I am a first year undergrad student who is in CS. My school requires co-ops to graduate and I am looking to get a head start, even if an internship doesn't count as a co-op, or even if I don't get any offers - experience and practice is good. There is a career fair in a month, and while I do have a resume completed, I would like to completely redo it, as I'm not happy with it. I'm really just lost when it comes to what goes on a resume and what does not.

Anyways, I have 10 projects on my GitHub page, with languages including C, Java, HTML/CSS/JS, and Python 2.7 &amp; 3.4. I would genuinely say only three of them are 110% *complete*, and the rest are a WIP, including a personal site (not included in the 10 since it's so incredibly incomplete). Some are far more complete than others, and some I have run into roadblocks where I am not really currently sure how to approach the problem. Some are small projects, some are rather large. (As you can tell, I have a hard time sticking to one project.) Which of these do I include on my resume? Only the completed ones? Do I also include WIPs?

Languages: I have 4+ years in Java and I'm confident in Java (Android I am looking to start learning, I've only dabbled a very tiny amount into it). Python an okay amount, Git an okay amount, and JS &amp; C I have only just begun learning. Do I include JS &amp; C? How do I express my confidence levels in each language? I have seen labels like 'Most proficient', 'Familiar', etc, but that doesn't seem very descriptive of how *much* experience there is with the language.

Others: 

* I'm currently enrolled in courses for C &amp; Python/Django. Do I include that I'm enrolled in those and working on a large-scale group project for the Django class?

* In HS I was a programmer for an FRC team for four years, where we used Java, where it was basically an annual 6 week sprint (with a team of 30-45 others, including adult engineer mentors alongside other students) to build a full-fledged robot to do specific tasks, and I was the lead programmer for three of those years.. Built things like a custom subsystem state logger (ie this subsystem did this at this time with this state), and fully re-useable PID Controller (the people who have taken my position literally just copy paste the code into each new codebase). Do I include this stuff? In all honesty, that experience prepared me for college and group work moreso than anything else I've ever done.

* I am basically eager and ecstatic to learn anything at all. Learning is my absolute favorite thing to do. How can I include this, or should I not at all?

* I've only completed one semester of undergrad. Do I post my GPA still?

I go there for my shoulder and knee. Normally, I see one doctor and I'm comfortable with the physical contact, as he has to move my body around for treatment purposes. 

I didn't realize that he only worked on certain days. Last week I worked with a different doctor and while he spent much less time with me, I was nervous but still comfortable. 

This week, I worked with my original doctor but then he had their intern do some exercises with me. The intern is my age and kind of attractive. Being around him makes me nervous. As it turns out, being touched by him makes me super uncomfortable. The first exercise was he put my hand under his arm on the side of his chest and he starts moving my shoulder and shaking my arm. He later said this was to help loosen the fluids in my shoulder. So my hand is rubbing up against his chest and I am in total shock. We did some other exercises after that, then repeated everything over again, including the first one. I was going along with the other exercises, trying my best not to let the anxiety get to me (I was lying on my back too - vulnerable position when you're insecure).

He says we're done, puts ice on my knee, walks away, and I quickly sat down in full panic attack mode, silently hyperventilating, trying not to sob, and shaking. I'm pretty sure he noticed I was upset when he came to take the ice off. He said something about making another appointment but I was already walking past him to leave saying, ""Yep...I will.""

It's not his fault I'm a mess. I felt so bad because he was just doing his job. I don't know how to face him when I go back. I'm hoping he'll tell my normal doctor what happened and I won't have to work with him again. I have to take a bus and this office is the only one on my bus line without having to take more than one bus. No female doctors there."
43vnjc,1,2016-02-02,Transfer student graduating soon.,hoppang,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/43vnjc/transfer_student_graduating_soon/,"Hello. I am currently in my last semester at a University. I used to be a chemistry major coming in to college, but I decided to swap my major from chemistry to computer science by the end of my third year. Because of this, after transferring to another university to study computer science, I had to stay for another 2 years (total of 5 years in college).

Currently, I am a senior and I am in my last semester. I just feel like I was rushed throughout my studies. I have taken most of the fundamental classes for computer science (data structures, object oriented programming, algorithm analysis, discrete structures). In addition, in order to make up for not doing anything computer science-related during my freshman to junior year and my lack of experience, I decided to study up on Android development during the summer, after my first year of studying computer science. I was able to make two android games and release it on Google Playstore during that summer. I do not know if this is enough. In addition, during this winter, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and WordPress by myself using codeacademy and other materials and ended up creating a portfolio website using WordPress.

As of now, I am not sure what to focus on during my last semester and I am not sure when to start applying for jobs because of my lack of experience. I was not able to land any research opportunities and internships due to my lack of experience, so that is why I decided to self-teach web and android development. I do not know whether to study for interview tech questions or if I should work on more projects to showcase. I currently live in NY and would like to land a job in or near NYC. If you guys can give me good advice, I would be very grateful! Thanks!"

Also, if this is in the wrong subreddit I apologize.


For some background info, I am an IT Management major at a public US university in a large metropolitan city. Ultimately, my goal is to get an IT internship here, and If it matters, my GPA is 3.2. Now, at this point I'm nearly done with GERs but have had very little taste of intro IT courses. To be blunt, I don't have any knowledge on most things in IT that I should know. Although I would say I am very technologically literate and learn quickly.


My question for you guys/gals is, what are some steps that I can start taking to get ahead of the curve? I feel as though I'm at a disadvantage in the sense that I haven't had any experience in the technology field; something many internships prefer/require. 


To get to the point, I'm just looking for some guidance that could help me become better prepared/qualified for a potential internship.
Are there any programs or certifications that can help me advance my resume? Or online resources that will help me along my journey? Also looking for any other advice that has helped you or others.

 They don't let me work at all (they make my life a living hell or beat me/call me names and so on if I try to do something that I want). Just now that I finished my technician course in IT area do they let me work, but only because I need to finish my internship.

 They told me yesterday that I'll have to quit in the end of the month.

 This is pissing me off and leaving me without options to get more money before moving out of the house.

Yesterday I was let go from my job as a technical writer for an up-and-coming software company that I was a part of for 9 months.

I'm a little lost - but I'll keep it short. I have a degree in technical writing and a minor in IT. The job I was let go from left a lot to be desired. I felt ostracized by my team and was left with day-to-day busy work as a copy editor. I had little interaction with my team and my work was uninspired and overly-pedantic. The firing wasn't messy - but it boiled down to not seeing the ""performance"" they would like, despite recognizing my work and commending my improvement over the past month.

Now - the company has a positive reputation in my town and has won many accolades and rewards for their work. I feel like it would be unwise to exclude the position from my resume. Doing so would also create a 9-month gap after my graduation where I was without work.

What would you advise going forward? I obviously did not enjoy the work I did per se, but I would like to remain in the IT field. I don't want to create an image of inefficiency for myself  - and I have thought of ways to explain the termination to job prospects. 

I still have a lot of professional connections at my last job who would recommend me for work. I'm scrambling to find a balance between the positive and negative moving forward so I can avoid this same situation in the future.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I thought I should also mention I interned at this company 3 months prior to coming on as full-time. Maybe I can collect the internship and forego the full-time position in my resume. This would still leave me with a gap of ""unemployment."""

I'm currently a junior at a 4 year university getting my bachelor's in computer science. I have about $4000 to play with right now and will be doing an internship this summer paying $7k a month pre tax in San Francisco.

I've been hesitant about starting a 401(k) because my internship doesn't have any kind of match so i want to wait until i start full time before i do that. I have experience with stocks and have operated a scottrade account for ~4 years. How should I focus my investing efforts as I start my career?

I've heard conflicting things. Some people advocate starting a 401(k) as quickly as possible to maximize lifetime earnings, while some people advocate taking on riskier equity-based investments while i'm still young and haven't started a family.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**edit: forgot to mention, will be graduating without debt so that is nothing to worry about.**"

I am 5'2 1/2 weighing in at 205, age 27 female. My first goal is 150, my main goal for my height is 135.

I use to be really skinny until the summer before 3rd grade and I suddenly gained a lot of weight...I have been struggling since.

As a poor intern I don't have much money for the gym and I only have about $120 to spend on food a month.

But I am tired of being the way I am!

I have a ""slight"" addiction to Pepsi (1-2 cans daily), and Fast Food (2-4 times a week). These and snacking will be my hardest things to give up.

I started with water today, drank half of my body weight which was super hard! I drank 18oz every 2 hours.

I drank 8oz of 2% milk as well which is a huge feat for me because I don't like plane milk.

I'm considering a Gluten-Free diet because of my thyroid problem, and was also looking into possibly cutting out sugars?

MyFitnessPal has me at 1200 calories a day, I got all but 26 calories down.

Also, even though I ate all those calories, I'm still hungry!

Today I walked slowly for 20min, did 25 pushups, and 25 sit-ups.

If anyone has any ideas, tips, or support...it would be graciously accepted.

Thanks!"

I've been checking craigslist periodically and am not finding much to work with in terms of housing because of the short term I'm looking for as well as not being able to be there in person. If anyone knows of someone who has an extra room or knows certain housing complexes that I should look into for this short term situation, it would be very much appreciated.

I'm looking to pay around $800ish per month depending on how far it is from Aiea, and more if it's closer. I am quiet and clean, and I will be spending most of my time after work studying for exams if it makes any difference.

Any leads would be much appreciated. Thanks in advanced!"

I learned a ton while at this position, and my software skills made leaps and bounds. They told me it was because with the amount of work we were getting and the amount of work we were putting out that it was hard for them to find a financial balance and keep me on. I helped this company complete multiple massive rebrands. I helped with architectural renovations, as far as designing and working inside 3D software goes, and I was their peasant monkey too, completing tasks any assistant or intern would take care of. I was all over the place. But I loved the security having the job gave me. 

Now I have until the end of the month before I'm officially no longer needed, and then they'll pay me what vacation time I have. This was a huge blow to my confidence, as I was already feeling I wasn't able to be as creative as I could have been somewhere else or on my own. 

Has this ever happened to any of you before? As a young designer still brand new to the industry, I'm open to any advice anyone has to give. 

Also if anyone in or around College Station, TX has any leads, I would be super grateful. "

43xy8z,8,2016-02-02,"Middle career advice, please?",fearscriticism,teachinginjapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/teachinginjapan/comments/43xy8z/middle_career_advice_please/,"Posting on a throwaway, because I'm a worrier.  
  
**Background**  
EFL has been my career aspiration since my youth. I now find myself at the middle of my carrier and I feel woefully unprepared for what lies ahead.  
  
I have an undergrad degree in nothing, a TEFL, and just finished an M.Ed in Instructional Design/Curriculum Development. I have 3 years of EFL experience (China/Korea) and 1 year of corporate training and operations management experience (USA, Fortune 100 company.)  
  
**Why Japan?**  
I did ALT work in Japan for about five months while I gathered data for my M.Ed thesis. I adored the work that I did and found the professional environment conducive to development (I really liked the one JALT event I attended, for example.)  
  
**Why Japan, really?**  
Honestly, there is a researcher in my field who is from Japan. I have followed her career since my undergrad days and she very much helped shape my outlook on education and led me to my grad program. I dream of meeting her and working with her in some professional capacity. Towards this goal, and a few related goals, I have decided to start off in Japan this time around, rather than Korea. I hope to build my publication list and eventually move into university work/research in education and curriculum development.  I am especially excited to be around for theoretical changed MEXT wants to introduce in the run up to 2020.
  
**My dilemma**  
My US company downsized my position and have asked me to find new employment within 90 days, and today is roughly day 71 by my count. I won't have my paper diploma until later in the month, likely the third or fourth week even.  
  
This is not exactly the time to be looking for entry level university work, which would be my goal. To say I hadn't found much I was qualified for would be an understatement. The majority of positions I am seeing online require existing university experience, of which I have a 3 month summer internship teaching EFL in the U.S. Many positions also want my diploma, which I don't have yet. I worry that informing them of my diploma wait will sour them to my employment, or make them think I am unreliable/unprepared.   
  
**The present**  
The way I see it, I could either fly to Japan and try to find something on the ground, which is terribly risky. Second to that I could apply for a normal ALT position (one happens to be up for the area I would want to work in to meet up with these researchers) for 260,000 yen a month and try to supplement my income in some other legal way.  
  
**I feel like going back to the same sort of EFL work I was doing before my graduate degree is tantamount to failure, but I also feel like I might be viewing the issue in the wrong light.**  
  
I know this post is a little broad, but I am unsure how to make the appropriate career advancing decision given the context. **It should be noted that I will be transitioning to working overseas anyway at this point since my economic situation is favorable for the transition, even if I don't go to Japan ultimately.** 
  
**TLDR**  
Graduating M.Ed this month, experienced, want to work in Japan to meet mentor researcher in education and try to work with them, no university work at entry level, unsure of how to proceed, career wise.

**Specific questions related to Japan**  

1) Is it common to simply send a school your resume/cv and cover letter if you want to work with them, even if you do not see a job opening posted?  

2) In your experience, are schools willing to accept corporate experience in lieu of university level teaching experience? I assume not but one can hope.  

3) Do they want a curriculum vitae, or a ""cv"" as the American ""resume""?

4) At age 29 quickly approaching 30, would taking an ALT job just because I like the work while looking for something bigger be career hampering?  

5) What advice might you, more experienced educators, have for someone in my position in general? I am finding the transition from entry level EFL work to anything higher much harder than I imagined.  

Thank you for your time."
43xzbj,1,2016-02-02,Looking for Job Search Tools in English (American),Mr_Inspector_Norse,Norway,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/43xzbj/looking_for_job_search_tools_in_english_american/,"I am an **American university student studying math and physics** and am in the final year of my degree. I have been looking to move to Norway for quite some time now (I have some family over there that I have visited on several occasions), and am trying to find a job there. I am looking for anything involving engineering, science, or energy. 

I know a lot of people here say they are looking to move to Norway without doing any research, but I am just letting you know that I have been searching for opportunities and jobs for the past year.

Let me preface this by saying what I have done so far. Last year, I applied for summer internships with several large Norwegian companies (Norsk Hydro, Stat Oil, etc), but sadly didn't get accepted into any of them. This year I applied to graduate programs and more internships with these companies, but no success either. I then took to LinkedIn and searched for new relevant jobs every week. I applied to about ten of these, but didn't get any results (granted I didn't necessarily have all the experience they were looking for).

I talked to one of my Norwegian friends and he suggested I check out: **nav.no ,
en.academicpositions.no**, and a couple other job boards that were all in Norsk.

I wasn't able to find anything worthwhile, so then I started blind emailing researchers and scientists at labs trying to find work as an assistant researcher or for internship. I have had one potential success with a guy at IFE outside of Oslo! It isn't final yet, but he is hinting at the fact that he might want to hire me. 

**So my questions for you guys:**

* What English websites or sources should I utilize to find more job openings?
* Are there any companies you know that might be more inclined to hire an international?
* Has the energy sector been hurt from the drop in oil prices? Are they drastically cutting back hiring?
* Would I be best off coming on a skilled jobseeker visa and looking for work then?

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this long post!!!

43y27y,0,2016-02-02,Big state tourney coming up next month. What can I do within a month to improve myself?,_ASG_,smashbros,https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/43y27y/big_state_tourney_coming_up_next_month_what_can_i/,"I love smash. I'm a TO in my sub-region and I run monthly events. But I'm not great at the game. I consider myself the Raditz of our local community (better than the average joe, but outclassed by a good portion of our area). That doesn't bother me so much, as Smash is only one part of my life. But at this next, I would like to do better than I did last time I went to a big event. 

Specifically, I'd like to break out of pools. But with a month and without much time (I work, intern, and am in the final semester of grad school full time. In short, very busy). So I may only have a few hours a week to actually play and practice. A huge improvement in such a short time seems impossible. It may very well be. But I'd like to try and mark some improvement.

Unfortunately, the community in my town is pretty small and none of us have good schedules to meet and practice. Most of my tourney attendees come from out of town and I have limited opportunities to play them in person. While I will have some time at my next event and possibly other local events before the big one to play with people, I'm limited to two major options: online play (not FG) and the training room (which I have trouble focusing in, but I'm willing to try).

I recently made a list of things that I need to work on. Shortened up, here's what they are:

- Teching
- Perfect shielding
- Perfect pivoting

Some of these may get better if I straight up grind them. Others though...

- Button layout (I only turn tap jump off, but I wonder if not configuring the controller anymore is hurting me in any way. On top of that, I rarely use the left trigger for anything...)

- Patience and frustration (I tend to do worse if I lose the first stock. I've been trying to be more patient lately, but it's a struggle)

- Match Ups (I don't even know where to start with this one. There are so many match ups and I feel like I know little about them at a high level of competition. I think the character I have the most experience against is ZSS, but even she gives me a hard time.)

And then there are main specific problems (as a Yoshi player). Currently, I've been trying to make my style a little less overly-aggressive, but...

- B-reversing and turnarounds (have a hard time using these in battle, let alone appropriately)
- Basic combo strings (save a few)
- Landing the Uair (this one really stings)
- Using the egg lay appropriately outside of just B-reversing
- Using the egg toss to cover approaches
- Landing grabs 
- Missing inputs (like B-reverses or accidentally rolling into an egg instead of tossing one)
- I don't like Battlefield (even though most Yoshi players tell me I should, I just don't feel comfortable here at all)
- Effectively edgeguarding (I rarely get those off stage kills with the fair and nair, among others)

I also want to learn Rosalina, but I doubt she'll be ready anytime soon, so I'm not considering her here. I used to main Bowser Jr. months ago, but I don't see him providing any coverage against any of Yoshi's bad MUs, so I probably won't use him anyway.

For the Yoshi stuff, I may need to do some heavy Yoshi dittos (as that's an MU I struggle with). But other than that, what's the best way to go about this stuff? Some of it, I could grind in the skills, but the MUs also scare me. 

Given the limited amount of time that I have, what is the most important aspects of play to focus on? Even if I don't accomplish my goal, I'd like to say I at least gave it a shot and improve a little bit. "
43y7pf,0,2016-02-02,"Graduated with a degree in Cultural Anthropology, need advice on how best to go back to school for Computer Science!",StalwartBlarg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/43y7pf/graduated_with_a_degree_in_cultural_anthropology/,"First, thank you for taking the time to read this post any advice given is greatly appreciated. I've gone through most of the old posts and the FAQ's in the side-bar, but I've still been left with some questions. To start I'll give a little bit of information about myself. I graduated from a average state university (Northeast United States) last year with a degree in Cultural Anthropology (3.4 GPA overall, 3.5 in-major). It was never my plan to go to graduate school for Anthropology, I simply wanted that piece of paper that said I went to college. Now I realize that was a bit of a mistake as it used up four years of my life in a field I'm not very passionate about, although I do think culture is extremely interesting I never had a drive to learn about Anthropology. After coming to this realization and after experiencing trying to find a job with no desire to work in a field related to Anthropology, I've decided that I want to go back to school, but this time for something I'm actually passionate about. From what I've read and done thus far, Computer Science seems extremely intriguing. At the moment I am enrolled in an introductory Computer Science course from edX and trying to figure out if Computer Science is truly a passion or just another hobby, but I do think it is prudent to at least consider the possibility of this as a future plan. 

Going back to school for either a Master's degree or a Bachelor's degree is my real desire since I know that I get more from structured learning in a classroom rather than self-studying, granted I believe self-studying to some degree will always be required. From most of the posts that I've read on this subreddit it seems that the majority of people favor a Master's degree over a second Bachelor's for returning students. One concern I have is that since I lack a specific focus within Computer Science and it is more of a general desire for knowledge of the field and especially the programming aspect would it be better for a second Bachelors or a Masters? While I do think I can achieve a solid foundation through self-studying I'm worried it'll be lacking for a Master's program. Personally I feel as though it is better for me to go for the Master's degree because there is more financial aid available to students going for their Master's degree as opposed to a second Bachelor's degree. It may be important to mention as well that my debt from my first University isn't terrible, I commuted while going to school so it allowed me to keep costs to a minimal. Another issue that I have with going for a Master's degree is that if I had a desire to go to a well regarded school, most competitive master's programs require you to have prior research or an internship to be a serious candidate. Is there any chance of me having done no research getting into a good program or alternatively is there anyway for someone who isn't currently enrolled in school and has only minimal experience to participate in some form of research? It seems one of my best options is to try to learn as much as possible about different programming language, or at least one in-depth, then start creating things that interest me, be it apps, webpages, etc., then use those as sort of a reference of what I've learned on my own. My main concern is that I don't know the best way to go about continuing my education in Computer Science once I feel as though I've learned enough on my own, I don't have a real path right now that I can take and I would like to make some outline that I can follow. Not looking for pity, mostly wanted to express the fact that the first time I went to college I did it somewhat stupidly I rushed into it with no path. I intend to take my time with this and figure it out, but I would like to have some sort of plan in mind.

Hopefully my situation/questions are unique enough to warrant their own post, if not I'm really sorry I must have just missed some information. Once again thanks for reading and if you have any questions for me, please let me know.  

Side-note, because I was an Anthropology major and no math courses were required by my University, I haven't taken a math course in about five years and I intend to take courses at my local community college to make up for the prerequisites I may be missing for a Master's program if I continue to go forward with this plan "

Had a talk with FH and we were talking about getting married on our 5th dating anniversary (which is what my parents did, I think it's so cute) instead of the end of this month like we originally planned. With FH just starting his programming internship (which is so exciting, it's exactly what he wants to do, and his coworkers have already told him the company will most likely hire him on afterwards, *and they pay around 100k a year* :'D) and some other financial obligations we have going on, we feel like it would be better to wait a bit longer before tying the knot. (note: we're not having an actual wedding, just getting legally married, we've been engaged since Feb 2015)

So then we start talking about a honeymoon, moving into a house, and having a baby. If all goes well with FH's internship, we could have a substantial amount of money saved up and be moved into a house by the end of this year! (*cue happy dance*)

Now, this is all FH wants before we have a kid, but I'd like to go on a honeymoon/babycation before we start TTC. I've also got some personal reasons for not wanting a baby born between August-January, so we've decided to start TTC in **May 2017**! This should (with no complications) give me a babe born no earlier than February 2018!

I'm super excited to actually have a date set!!! Of course, this is all if everything goes according to plan, but I'm feeling very optimistic!! Anyone else trying in May 2017?

43y8hd,2,2016-02-02,"I've been avoiding thinking about what would happen when I ran out of money. Now that I have, old problems have already begun to resurface.",shichigatsu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/43y8hd/ive_been_avoiding_thinking_about_what_would/,"Honestly, I just need to talk. I need to say what's on my mind and have somebody respond to it. 

I was in an internship last summer. I started going to the lab in January and they started paying me to do it in June. Throughout the course of the summer I learned that I was not suited for the kind of work I was doing. It was a shock to me - I've had one single goal for the past five years, to major in physics and do research. I am a little over halfway through a double major in math and physics. Been taking as many classes as I can afford and it's been the worst experience of my life. I had finally landed an amazing opportunity at my university, working in a laser research lab connected with LIGO and funded partially by NASA. During the summer, as I said, I realized I hated everything about research. I couldn't stand the rigor of it: work six to eight hours at the lab, study four to six hours at home. I couldn't stand watching the man with the position I wanted in the future sing and dance for funding and never actually get to sit down and do what he spent his life preparing for. I couldn't stand my realization that you don't major in physics, you major in a single specialization so far removed from everything else you become part of the leading experts in the world. I couldn't stand that I was left with no time or energy for friendships or relationships, and barely any for my family. 

At the end of the summer, the Monday prior to the start of the Fall semester, my car broke down two parking lots away from my normal spot. At that point I just gave up. Something snapped inside me and every ounce of motivation was lost. The night before I couldn't sleep. I had an anxiety attack and was absolutely freaking out because I couldn't handle the fact that I've wasted five years and thousands of dollars on something that was a dead end. I eventually calmed down enough to try and make the best of the situation. I am only 21, I started college at 16 and have over 90 credit hours. Over 60 credit hours where completely free thanks to a scholarship. I realized it could be worse and managed to use that to calm down enough to sleep. That morning I paid off my general credit card with my last paycheck. The rest was earmarked to pay down the credit card for car maintenance, a few subscribed services, and gas. As I left my moms house, I was confident that I made the right decision. I learned that research was not the path I should take and I was going to cleanly break off and find another boat to jump in and see what I could do. I had spent the year networking and had a small chance at getting into something in the math department at my uni. I was falling apart inside, but had just enough to keep myself together until my clutch pedal went soft and I couldn't change gears. 

After I called the tow truck I sat in my car and realized something. I had no money, no job, and no way to pay for whatever just broke. I didn't want to charge up a credit card I had just paid off and couldn't take money away from anywhere else. I spent the money I was planning to use on my other credit card on the tow truck. I didn't break off from the internship on my best foot, I found out the next day that I was basically fired because my work was suffering due to my depression caused by the fact that I'd never succeed in accomplishing my dream.

I drove almost 50 miles a day to go to school. When my car broke down a week before school started I had to drop out of the Fall semester. Since I wasn't in school I couldn't work at the university. Without working I had no money to fix my car with, and without a car I couldn't get a job anywhere outside of three miles from my house. Two minutes in any direction of my house and you reach farmland. The biggest businesses in my town are Walmart, HEB, and various fast food joints. There are no sidewalks and public transportation is an absolute joke. 

Since August I've pulled every trick I know, tried to make as much money as possible without being able to work, and applied everywhere that's hiring within the bubble that I can walk to and from. I was able to fix the problem with my car last month, but in the time it took me to make enough money and learn how to replace the part, my battery died. Not in the ""out of charge"" sense, in the ""only way it could be more dead is if it literally exploded"" sense. 

I've just given up. As of right now the credit card I had paid off is maxed again, the other credit card is one month past due, my savings account has less than $1, and my checking account is negative. My car is still sitting in my mothers back yard, useless unless I want to push start it every single time and risk actually blowing up the currently dead battery. I haven't heard back from a single place yet. The only job I know for a fact I could get since I have a friend working there is a delivery driver at Dominoes, but there is a certain irony there. In one month my student loan provider will begin asking for payments since the six month grace period is almost over. I have medical bills from a car accident from over a year and a half ago. That one is good - some fuckhead wasn't paying attention and lost control of their car after rear-ending the person in front of them. My options where swerve into the car to my right, swerve into the concrete wall to my left, or slam on my brakes and hope for the best. Supposedly an open and shut case where I'd have no problem getting a settlement, the other driver admitted to being at fault and the other person she hit supported that fact. One year and two months later I'm still waiting on that. 

I quit smoking three times in this period. The most recent reason is because I spent the last of my money buying a pack cigarettes and ran out yesterday. I tried drinking, but found out that my distaste for alcohol outweighed my desire to get drunk. I started taking medicine to control my depression and anxiety, at the beginning of September I just stayed locked in my room as often as possible. Now I'm medicated and cannot even feel bad about myself. I can get angry, which I am doing as often as possible. I can control my anxiety only so much when my day consists of spending as much time distracting myself from reality as possible. I don't talk to any of my friends anymore. One of them is an ex-heroin addict that spends all his time and money smoking weed to control the urge to shoot up. One of them is my ex-girlfriend, if you could call her that. She's texted or called about once or twice a month since I stopped trying to get her to care. She was too worried about what could happen to actually try and actually commit and tried fixing it way too late. One of them is a very sad man who has difficult making and maintaining friendships and relationships due to an extreme anxiety disorder and matching depression. I've stopped talking to most of my family as well. Aside from my mother and brother who I live with I only really talk with my step-father, who is divorced from my mother and lives several states away.

I can't even cry right now. I told myself that I wanted to die and it had no effect. I'm not motivated enough to kill myself. I've reached the bottom at this point. I was in a better position when I dropped out of school for a year to drink and smoke weed and drop acid, at least then I could buy something that made me feel better. I play solitaire and sudoku so much that I dream about them and hallucinate the games when I close my eyes. The only reason I am able to get up and do things is because of the medication I'm taking. It's starting to prove to not be enough, I'm heading towards another major depressive episode and there's no real way to stop it. It's not a hardcore anti-depressant. Honestly I'm not even sure if it is actually effecting me, it's very possible that I just stopped giving a shit at some point and didn't realize it. 

So I've come here and written up this ridiculous rant. I've read back and it doesn't really make sense to me. Part of me feels like this is more than depression. I've felt completely detached for almost a year now. Just kind of watching things happening to me and not really caring. Part of me is in a complete daze of nicotine withdrawal and exhaustion staring at the screen while my ears ring with tinnitus. Part of me is fighting against getting a fourth cup of coffee and misspelling every other word. I hope that I forget about this. That I take my anti-depressant, four melatonin tablets, and two benedryl tablets with chamomile and lemon grass tea with honey and hope it's enough to knock me out. Even on days when I don't spend two hours writing a rant on reddit, when I tell my mother and brother that I feel amazing and halfway convince myself of the same, I have to take that cocktail to sleep. If it stops working I'm worried I'll start drinking. I have a single bottle of whiskey that I got on a whim a while back so I won't do too much damage, but I don't like the idea of it at all. 

I don't really know where and when to stop right now, so I'll choose here. I apologise if you actually read this. It's pathetic and narcissistic to the point where I'm embarrassed to read it myself. Goodnight. "

I make $9.00 an hour, which is above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 (the same as my home state of New Hampshire). Even working 40 hours a week, my gross monthly income would be 1,440. This is simply not enough to cover the bare minimum needs of an individual. Consider the costs of housing, utilities, electricity, food, health care, transportation, laundry, and necessary cleaning and hygiene products. And let’s not forget the growing epidemic of student loan debt. Never mind a cellphone, or internet, or anything fun that might make life worthwhile. For background purposes I will say I graduated college with a Bachelor’s degree and have been working retail since graduating high school. I started at my current job at $7.75 and over almost 3.5 years I managed to get raised up to $8.50 with the company’s standard annual raise of a quarter and another $.50 to bring me up to the company’s new starting pay. That’s right, after 3.5 years I now make the same as the new hires I am helping to train. This makes the previous so-called “merit based” raises moot. The very least they could have done is bring it up to the new $9.00 base and then given me my annul raise on top of it so I would at least be making a quarter more than the new hires. The whole system is unacceptable and needs to change. 

So, for the uninitiated, I want you to take a journey through my day. I wake up to the phone ringing, loud and disruptive as any alarm clock. It’s work. An opener just called out and we’re already short-staffed as it is. Could I come in several hours early (or maybe on my day off)? Never mind that it’s 7:30 am and I stayed up until 2 am reading because I wasn’t supposed to go in until 4 pm (or at all) and now you want me in at noon. Never mind that this is the third such call I’ve received this week. Never mind whatever it was I was planning on doing with my free time today. None of it matters because I need every penny, every hour I can get. I’m desperate and they know it. I know they know because I once had a manager say “I knew you would take the hours. You’re always desperate for hours”. They use this to their advantage. And I let them, because what is the alternative? 
	
Well, the alternative is to get a better job, I hear you say. As if we don’t need people doing the work I do. Well, we do. We need people to receive, sort, and shelve shipments. We need people to answer the phone, keep things in place on the sales floor, and ring up transactions. Most of all, we need people to help customers find exactly what it is they are looking for. As long as there are brick-and-mortar stores, these are all functions that will need to be performed by actual human beings. Why shouldn’t those human beings be paid a living wage? Why shouldn’t they get the benefits that come with “real” jobs? Why can’t these jobs be some of the good jobs? Why shouldn’t they be? After all, they are some of the more widely available jobs in our faded economy, even though they offer few full time positions.

Also, you suggest this as if good jobs are as easy to come by as a blade of grass. And anyways, I am looking, almost all of us are. But, it’s not that easy. There are, after all, a finite number of decent jobs. With my hours and pay, I can’t afford a car and live in an area without good public transportation. This pretty much limits my job search to an area within walking distance of my apartment. Let’s just say the options are not good. Besides, the job market is flooded with plenty of other qualified, educated individuals. In fact, the competition is probably better qualified because they are older and therefore have more experience. It creates a vicious cycle where you need experience to get a job, and yet need a job to get experience. We don’t all have the connections to just make things happen. We can’t all afford to take an unpaid internship to get our foot in the door somewhere. It’s not that cut and dry, is what I’m saying. 

So anyhow, I agree to take the extra hours, of course. I snag a couple more hours of shut eye, prepare a lunch since now I’m working long enough to get a lunch break, eat breakfast, take a shower, and generally get prepared to head in to work. I show up about ten minutes early to get my stuff put away. In this time, I also look at the Daily Assignment Sheet (DAS) to see which department of the store I am reporting to and check the meeting notes for any new information being passed down the wire. These are technically work related tasks for which I am not being paid. After this is done I leave the backroom in time to get about halfway to the other end of the store to clock in. Once this is done, I head to wherever in the store I am working first. I happen to be trained to work practically anywhere in the store. I may be ringing at the cash wrap, helping customers and answering phones at customer service, working the music department, working the kids department, helping out over in my store’s cafe, receiving product, pulling old product to be returned to the vendor, shelving, or even doing projects to set up new displays. Most days are spent bouncing around to some combination of the above. Now they are even scheduling me without warning to do new things like help close the cafe and the cash office. 

I have been praised by management for my ability to work in so many different areas of the store, wide-open availability,and willingness to change hours on short notice. Usually, you’d think new skills would earn a wage increase and that someone who has become so versatile and has been a loyal employee for over three years would be making more then $9.00 an hour, especially when the new guy is making the exact same amount. The math just doesn’t seem right, it’s infuriating, actually. If you supposedly get what you pay for, this store is getting all of us for a bargain. After all if you are paying barely minimum wage, you should expect a barely minimal effort. But that isn’t what they get. They get flexible, and educated, and hard working. And it’s not just me, it’s practically all of my coworkers. I work with people with Master’s degrees and PhD’s and who speak multiple languages, and this is how that education is paying off.

Ultimately, it all comes down to hours. Within the store scheduling structure there is a massive catch-22 situation. The amount of payroll hours that the store receives is in part dictated by how much money the store is taking in. When sales are down, hours are cut. There comes a tipping point, however, where the lack of staffing costs the store sales.  When you don’t have the hours to properly staff the store, product doesn’t get shelved and languishes in the stockroom, merchandising and other projects don’t get completed, the store appears messy because less time can be spent cleaning and straightening product so it is easily found, phone calls get missed, customers abandon their items rather then wait in long lines, and they can’t find anyone to help them find those items in the first place. The lost sales from cut hours results in cuts payroll and therefore more cuts to employee hours. And around and around we go in another vicious cycle. Our only counter to this is to work harder, faster, be more flexible when those extra hours do crop up (typically due to someone calling out and then they are only available on short notice). These days we call ourselves a “skeletal crew” and joke we are each doing the work of three people for the same low price of one. Do you see what I mean when I say they get us for a bargain? All that we manage to do under such conditions is surely worth more than $9 an hour.

Customers aren’t happy with these inconveniences and they are not afraid to let us know it. They often have no qualm yelling and arguing over the length of a checkout line, price of an item, coupon requirements or the store’s return policy. Recently a coworker had a customer complain that having to print and sign his name for a return was a “hardship”. They are quick to condescend as if they know more about our store’s policies and procedures then the employees do. They leave half-filled coffee cups on shelves and I wonder what it must be like to be able to afford to abandon Starbucks. They let their children run around while they peruse. They leave piles of discarded items in their wake. They use us for our Wi-Fi and comfy chairs and don’t spend a dime. They will hit on you and engage you in uncomfortable personal conversations. Some are so regular in their awfulness that they have earned both reputations and nicknames. I am told the customer is always right, but they are not customers if they aren’t spending money; they are leeches. And we have no means of recourse.

On top of all this, they actually expect me to care about the amount of new memberships I sell. Frankly, I am too busy thinking about what it’s going to cost to pay the bills on time and pick up some more food for myself and my mom to really be concerned about memberships. Maybe at first I cared, and I’ll still put in a small effort to try to push them, but it hardly seems worth it to stress if I don’t get the sales. I am already too busy stressing out about making ends meet. I don’t get paid enough to put my mental and emotional health at risk for it. They already mess with my physical health as it is. There are many issues that effect health. For example, having to wait to get coverage to go to the bathroom or not being able to eat when necessary. Speaking of eating, there is also the expense of healthy food to contend with. Lifting boxes and lugging carts around take a toll on the body. However, there is no retail pain like standing trapped at cash wrap for hours on end. It effects feet, legs and back. Of course the most appropriate shoes for this are way out of budget and sneakers, the next most comfortable thing, are not allowed. There is also the dry throat from all the talking that is done there. And of course there is the sleep deprivation and all it’s side effects that comes with “clopens” or “turn and burns” (when you close the store one night and turn around to open it the next morning), and overnight shifts. The variability of schedules makes it virtually impossible to to create a consistent sleep schedule. 

In fact, the variability of schedules makes in nearly impossible to create any kind of consistency at all. Whether it’s classes, childcare, a second job, passion projects, or even the gym, it can be hard to balance them consistently from week to week. Especially when you can be called in for extra hours on such short notice. The only way around this is to limit your availability to work, but most employers want a wide open availability. They want you to have the ability to come in on a minutes notice when someone calls out, the delivery is larger then projected, or the store is busy enough to justify another body on the sales floor. When the hours are available for it, anyway. It’s also why picking up a second job to supplement your income or attempting to take classes to better your situation is so hard: it cuts in to the much desired availability. This suites the needs of the business, being able to best match employees to peak periods of customer activity as well as accomplishing projects and tasks. It does not, however, match the employee need for consistency and balance. The unknowable schedule also makes the financial aspect of the job more difficult. When you work different hours each week, you can’t predict how much you will make each month, therefore creating a monthly expense budget is absolutely out of the question. Sure, you can track how much you need to make, but ultimately, you have to hope you wrangle enough hours to match it. Despite the uncertainty they create, employers will demand up to a one month notice to request specific time off while only giving you your schedule one week in advance. They will do things like schedule you to work six days in one week and there will be nothing you can do because if you say anything, the hours from one of those days goes out of your paycheck. You can be scheduled to work ten days in a row over the course of two weeks and there is nothing that you can do about it. 

I wish I had a solution to offer, but I don’t. These are issues that need to be addressed on a larger scale than I able to reach on my own. All I can do is share my struggle and hope to shed some light. May that light help spark a conversation that will lead to the solutions that so many of us are looking for."
43yibk,2,2016-02-03,I [22F] is on the edge with my mother [60F] who recently recovered from some surgeries last year. Our relationship is confusing and frankly tiring. How do I fix it?,coco_moonbabe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43yibk/i_22f_is_on_the_edge_with_my_mother_60f_who/,"My mother is a single parent and we always turned to each other for emotional support and we were each other's companion [especially since I didn't have many friends].  Everyone always said I was shy and had social anxiety. It always annoyed me that I basically didn't have an identity for a while because my mom was always around and I felt like an extension of her. We did everything together. I loved it at times, but knew it went too far. It got complicated when I went to college. Very complicated. 



Over the last three years, I've become more aware of my mother's mental issues. On top of that, I wanted to do things myself and not have to ask her whether I should or not. She cracked when I had started my relationship with my first boyfriend[M 24 and still with him].  While I was in college, she hated I spent the night at his apartment. At this time I lived on campus, and she worked at the college. She hallucinated that my boyfriend and I was going to kill her because we spend a lot of time together.  Although we never really involved her in much, she hallucinated that we were looking on how to get rid of her... So that created some mistrust on my end.  Especially since she would go yelling and screaming in the car about how evil he and his mom were for coming 10 minutes late. Even though we were a half hour late.



It took me a long time to recover from her insanity.  I still struggle with it. But now my whole family went crazy when she got her kidney removed early November because of a very large tumor. Luckily it wasn't cancerous. But it just took a toll on all of us, especially her.  


A lot of stuff happened...My family ate each other alive. They ate me alive. I failed a class of my last semester because I drove 45 minutes every day after class, work and internship to visit her. That's why I had to stay an extra semester, and I paid for it out of my pocket. I wanted to do it, but knew everyday was too much. She was there for two weeks.  My boyfriend and I cleaned the house for her [because she is a hoarder and wanted to make it easy for her to recover in]...

No one liked I visited my boyfriend. They still don't..

Anyways...basically fast forward a lot of crazy stuff. I skipped holidays...blah...blah...because everyone hated me. ...The doctor said she needs to have a normal life again so she can gain her strength. It took her a while to do that, and sometimes walked just once a day. She didn't eat and hated it when I tried to convince her to eat. 


She gets mad when people don't treat her like she just had surgery [3 months after] but gets mad when people treat her like she needs help. Its exactly the way I'm saying it. 

She is saying I'm unreliable.  I get so angry when she says that.  I almost failed school to take care of her and I got depressed because I was so stressed out taking care of her all alone.  I cleaned all of her clothes, reorganized her room, I did almost everything by myself and because I spend the weekend with my boyfriend, she believes I am ungrateful, selfish and spoiled.  He lives an hour away.


She hates I offer to shop for groceries by myself. She doesn't want to shop by herself because she believes she isn't capable of anything even though the doctor told her to stop laying around and do normal things.  I don't understand any of this.


I love her so much, but this confusing relationship we have is tiring. Every time we argue she reminds me how she got an organ taken out of her. At this point I am looking for a job to move out.  But I found out that she has another health condition. And my family basically wants me to sacrifice my whole life for her. On the other hand she says to me she wants me to be independent and doesn't want her condition to hold me back. She says this but contradicts her words the next day. The next day, she'll say she needs my help with everything and its a crime if she washes the dishes once, take out the garbage, or clean the fridge. I'm just so fed up and unimpressed.

I feel so trapped and questioning how I should proceed. 

I love her, but this is terribly exhausting.


Sorry if my grammar isn't the best here. 


   
**tl;dr**:
My mother got very sick and uses it as a guilt trip and continuing a very unhealthy relationship between us. I realize she is incapable of figuring out how to fix our relationship on her side.  I am asking for suggestions on how to proceed.  

edit**I see it looks crammed and tried enter a couple of times...

43yj31,1,2016-02-03,"I was invited to an all expense paid event that would be fantastic for me professionally, but ethically disgusts me, and voicing that disgust would potentially risk me being ostracized in a profession I otherwise love",wellfucme,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/43yj31/i_was_invited_to_an_all_expense_paid_event_that/,"I'm not going to say the name of the event, but what I'm about to say will probably reveal enough to those who know what to look for.

I'm a college student about to graduate, I'm active at both the campus and state level in organizations that are usually seen as a major stepping stone to professional careers in the area of my interest (honestly, this alone will probably out me). In fact I've already done a few internships in my sector, and I'm about to start a new one that will set me up perfectly for a job post-graduation. So suffice it to say, I am a fairly active student. 

This has made me an attractive target for a very MAJOR event in my field. Not necessarily the biggest, but one that usually sees attendance by major former and current leaders within the field. At every level, from mid-level managers to chief executive officers. It's big. It's really fantastic, it's a weekend of rubbing shoulders with my peers and the very people I want to work with for the rest of my life. And the best part is it's all free. Free travel, free accommodations, free registration. It's a great deal, right?

Wrong. I'm passionate about my field in no small part because I'm passionate about my personal beliefs and ethics. This conference is the living embodiment of everything I hate in the industry. It's ostensibly a non-profit, but in actuality it's the mouth piece for a group with a vested interest in holding sway over this sector. That's why everything is free, they actively want to continue to hold sway over the field. That's why it's held in literally the industry capital, that's why so many important leaders both present and future are invited, and that's why the end of the invitation makes sure to note that at the end of the conference attending students are ""encouraged"" to meet with industry leaders to discuss how valuable the conference's subject is to our trade and what our trade is responsible for.

Aside from opposing the subject on deep rooted ideological grounds, I'm also deeply unsettled by the ethicallity of it all. My trade is **supposed** to be one above corruption, but obviously it exists. I should say, famously it exists. But this is just so obvious. It's so egregious. It... It verges of felonious. It is so wrong what they're doing, and yet every one of my peers (with the exception of those I trust well enough to talk to openly about this, who all agree with me) is hopping on board without a care in the world. People I know who are just as committed and involved as I am, and yet they can't see the event for what it is. It makes me question if I'm missing something, or if they're all just that willing to forgo critical thinking in the face of such a great opportunity. They're actively using the double whammy allure of a free trip and the opportunity to network with and meet our idols to sway our opinion, they're blatantly pre-purchasing our support. It's disturbing.

Finally, the worst part is I can't voice these opinions very loudly. There's a vocal group opposed to this cause, but this opposition is split and some... some of it is very unsavory. There are some groups who I simply disagree with due to means, but there are others who have let an old way of thinking prevent them from joining the twenty first century. My beliefs are perfectly rooted in a mature, ethical, and I would say forward thinking mindset, but voicing any dissent opens one up to being called a member of the reactionary faction of opposition. This accusation isn't unfounded, I understand that, I mean it's startling how every anti-event article you can find online comes from this group. But it sucks, because people that are close to me know I don't think like that. Future employers don't, though, and that means I have to keep this close to my heart for fear it will permanently damage my future.

I really want to publicly voice my opposition at the next state-wide association meeting, but I'm afraid even there I'll be ostracized. We keep minutes that are a matter of public record, so it's not like it would be a secret. Any employer worth their salt **will** find the record, and they **will** be fine with throwing out my CV because of it. While I know I will not go, I'm still in the end potentially opting to remain silent about this issue. At the end of the day isn't that just as bad? I've never been in a position before where I've been faced with speaking up even at the risk of hurting myself, this really is a difficult choice. I know right, how cheesy is this? I'm pretty much one small step away from quoting Martin Niemöller at this point... But, I mean, it really does kind of feel like that.

I don't know if I'm looking for help or not, I think I'm just venting. My close group of personal friends aren't as involved as me, so they don't really understand what the stakes are. One suggested I say fuck it and take advantage of the free trip, but that's not really good either. This is the sort of thing where numbers matter almost as much as the quality, and being party to that is just as bad as actively endorsing it. My presence only furthers the longevity of this sort of thing. I don't think they fully understand how difficult it is to remain silent, but how imperative it is to do so for my future. Seriously, I went so far as to make a puppet to post this because even this could hurt me. Fuck, this specifically would. Some of what I've said here, if taken out of context, would sound like the ravings of a conspiracy theory lunatic, but I sincerely believe vocally opposing this will hurt me. In fact I know it will, because one very famous leader in the industry went so far as to imply he was opposed, and was so soundly harassed he had to apologize almost immediately. This could kill my career. It's really tough."

Does this career require any travel? 

Does this career require continuing education? 

What is the work environment like?

How long are the hours?

Are there opportunities for advancement?




&gt; A little background: The senior project at my highschool is for students to build a product with people in a field of their interest.

I have a mediocre part-time office job that I work at for 10 hours while I continue my pointless and fruitless career as a full-time student. My job is somewhat connected to the field that I am studying (environmental studies) but only because the institution is a museum of natural history. 

I have nothing to show for my dedication to my field other than working at that museum during my high school career, and having just returned about a year ago. (I grew up in the same area that I am now attending college in.)

I can't juggle two internships while simultaneously succeeding in my classes like the rest of my amazing peers. I don't stand out, much less excel in anything.

I have been rejected by the only opportunity that allows me to study abroad in Washington D.C., effectively crushing my ambitions of interning at the various agencies and firms I wish to be a part of.

I am a failure, and I do not believe anyone who tells me otherwise because they are not in this situation that I am in, and they can say that. They're not going through it. But I am a failure to myself and that’s what everyone’s saying, right? That it doesn’t matter what anyone else says, what matters is only what you think of yourself.

In my eyes, I am a crying, red-eyed and lonely failure who can shed as many tears as she wants but it won't change anything. I am ugly and a heinous sight to see and am undeserving my successful, studious, and overall beautiful human who is my boyfriend. I am a mediocre person that can’t achieve the overly-ambitious dreams she has because she doesn’t have the brains to back it up.

It’s what matters, right? I’m finally self-aware of my place in life. Maybe I should not have aspired to be anything that was beyond my reach in the first place. I should drop out while I can and save my parents the money that would be better spent on my two younger siblings. That would be the noble thing to do. 

I often write letters to my younger self in times of hardship, and this is what I have to say.

I was just wondering, how true is this? Will US employers acknowledge my BS Clinical Pharm degree? or do I start off as a pharmacy technician? And do I still have to work for at least 2 years in a hospital here in the Philippines even if I have taken the BS Clinical Pharm program?

I am also quite confused how different the BS Pharmacy program is in the Philippines, which is usually just 4 years, compared to the 6-year PharmD program in the US.

Any info would be helpful. I plan to work and live in the US as soon as possible with my relatives who are already there."

[Kliff Kingsbury](#i/kingsbury) **WHAT'S A FAX MACHINE?**

Glad you asked, Kliff. A fax machine is an archaic instrument that is somewhat like an early version of email. It let you send copies of documents all over the world, and all it took was a dedicated phone line, [the proper know-how](http://i.imgur.com/T3X0rOY.gif), and a small amount of blood magic. Sadly, with the growing use of email, fax machines are now rarely used. The exceptions are basically limited to gun shops and college athletic offices. You may also recognize the fax machine from [this scene in Office Space. NSFWorkplaceElectronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svvc47Tr0R8) Some teams have even had dedicated interns to operate the fax machine on NSD!

Anyway, here's a primer for how we'll handle the day devoted to recruiting on /r/CFB. The goal is to reduce confusion and arguing over which ranking service is better or exactly which [insert common surname here] is going to which [OSU/UT/etc.].

## FAQ

* **What is National Signing Day?** - This is a day where we all make whimsical signs about football! No, not really. This is the first day that graduating high schoolers can submit their letters of intent, which is an NCAA document that is a binding agreement between athlete and school - the athlete agrees to attend for one year, the school agrees to provide athletics scholarship to the player in return. A national letter of intent (NLI) isn't required, but is preferred by programs so that they can accurately account for scholarship slots. These must be signed by a parent and then faxed or (new!) emailed in. [Sometimes, things do *not* go smoothly.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/02/06/alex-collins-arkansas-mother-letter-of-intent-signing-day/1896357/)

* **How many recruits can my team sign?** - [It's very simple, you see...](http://i.imgur.com/sYG37nB.gif) On second thought, disregard that. Who knows how many. Probably 15-25. Maybe 12. Maybe 35. It's all rather *fluid*. There are all kinds of loopholes that can cause fluctuations, since early enrollees can be backcounted toward empty slots in previous years, some conferences limit the number counted towards a single year, plus the NCAA has a roster hard count of 85 total scholarship players.

* **Why does this matter?** - I'll let some of our own users explain it. Recruiting rankings [help predict NFL draft success,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/43gzjr/for_those_who_dont_buy_recruiting_rankings/) which can in turn help your program. Recruiting can also help serve as a predictor for a team's success, as discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/36mmow/bill_connellys_initial_2015_sampp_projections/crfjuro/?context=3). In general, better teams are built on better recruits. Unless, of course, you're a wizard. [Kansas State Ball](#i/kansasstateball)

* **How do recruits commit?** - Most already have, usually via twitter or a press conference. No snapchat commits, yet. I think... The blue chip recruits and some who are waiting to find out if there will be enough room are waiting until Wednesday.

440cqg,80,2016-02-03,This Cover Letter Got Me Flown From London To Hollywood For A Job Interview,petezbro,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/440cqg/this_cover_letter_got_me_flown_from_london_to/,"This article is about connecting with your fellow human. Your cover letter is your shot at doing that and getting hired.

When you email your CV to a company to apply for a job there's a person reading your email on the other end. A real PERSON. I feel like people forget that.

I used to be a senior business developer at a food-tech startup in London and I often got cover letters like these (these are actual cover letters I got):

*With a strong analytical background, as well as vast client-facing experience, I am now looking to move into a business development or account management role. With a skill set fully aligned to managing the day-to-day relationship with clients, developing long and short-term strategies and tactics to maximise product success, in addition to co-ordinating and performing product demonstrations.*

That’s nice. I don’t really care. It’s also painful to read because no one speaks like that.

Who are you as a person and how are you different to the other 50 people who wrote similar BS-generic emails?

This was for a sales role too. If you can’t spark my interest when you introduce yourself you’re not going to be able to get new clients interested in our product.

Here’s another cover letter I got:

*Dear Sir/Madam,*
*I'd love to discuss your business, I'm currently interviewing with a number of start-ups and am interested in meeting as many as possible before the new year. I'm a multidisciplinary Sales candidate with a background of target delivery.*

Oh, your a target deliverer? You’re interviewing with other startups? So is every other applicant. I’m not even going to open your attached CV because your cover letter is boring as hell.

Unless your experience is both rare and exactly what the company is looking for your CV is pretty much useless anyway. Even if your CV’s contents are the perfect fit, it might get skimmed over or simply not read if your cover letter sucks.

So talk to me. Write some words TO me. Connect with me. Use your cover letter to stand out from the crowd and tell me **who you are**.

**Here’s the cover letter that got me flown from London to Hollywood**

I applied for a business development role at Jumpcut Studios, the guys behind the YouTube channel Simple Pickup. They’re developing a new platform to help YouTube creators monetise their audiences.

My cover letter below cut through the pile of applications they received.

I ended up being the only applicant (out of 100s) that they actually considered, so they flew me cross-Atlantic to their office in Hollywood, LA. There were 2 Skype interviews before that happened, and I used some of the conversation hacks in [this guide](http://beardstrokings.com/conversation-hacks-guide/) to build a connection with them in those interviews and convince them I was legit.

Here’s the cover letter I sent:

*This idea is genius. The opportunity here is huge.*

*There are so many YouTubers out there who know how to get thousands, or even millions, of eyeballs on their content. They've built their own audiences, and YouTube takes a 45% cut out of what is already a pittance that they receive. Those eyeballs have the potential to be worth far more, but most content creators mainly know how to be content creators and engage people. They understand that side of things… the hard part, and while they might have a few business ideas too they don’t have the chops to know what will work and what won’t. They have to waste time and money experimenting to work it out.*

*You guys have done the hard yards by hacking together a Wordpress site, creating products to sell and experimenting &amp; optimizing everything along the way. You’ve worked out what works for you and now you’re thinking bigger to turn your knowledge into a system that works for content creators at large. That shit gets me excited.*

*My passion is creating. What fuels me is giving shape and form to something that previously didn’t exist, then making it better continuously. It gets me in Flow. Whether it’s a better sales process, a YouTube video, a website, a business idea or this cover letter.*

*NOT creating for too long drains my energy.*

*I love startup environments. I’m comfortable embracing shifting priorities, throwing plans out and flying by the seat of my pants. You need flexibility to constantly iterate products and processes in the hunt for market fit and customer love. I’m passionate about learning what makes customers tick and incorporating that insight into the product.*

*Breaking things down and identifying patterns with significant meaning come naturally to me. I’ve always been an analytical problem solver (hence the Civil Engineering background). At my previous startup, dinein.co.uk, I uncovered that 60% of our registered users had never placed an order. There was no dashboard to track these metrics so I did it manually on my own initiative, even though it wasn’t part of my job, because no one else had bothered to do it. Turned out there were 3 pretty obvious (in hindsight) reasons for our high attrition rate, which I also uncovered through user interviews.*

*I value clear communication very highly. I believe that if you applied the 80/20 rule to the list of things that make a business successful, and then applied the 80/20 rule to THAT 20%, you’d be left with ""clear communication"" as the 4% that’s responsible for 64% of the results. If you can get your head around that ;) Part of that means having a culture of openness where everyone is comfortable giving and receiving critical feedback &amp; learning from mistakes. I know how to foster that sort of culture. The interns I managed at my last startup will back that claim.*

*I would very much love to help you guys explore and hopefully find the answer to the ""Big Hairy problems of monetization, community-building, and discovery”.*

*Looking forward to hearing from you.*

*Cheers,*
*Pete*

In the end the job wasn’t a good fit for either side. They didn’t end up hiring anyone. But hey, I got to meet some cool people and hang out in LA for a few days.

**Are you putting ""who you are"" in your cover letters?**

A friend of mine took this cover letter approach a step further when she applied for a Corporate Law role at Deloitte (… a pretty serious job at a massive company). Her cover letter brought up the deeply personal story of how she left Japan when she was 12 to follow Johnny Cash on tour around the United States.

She didn’t hold back, without going overboard, and spattered her charming personality throughout. Have a read:

*Subject: Gradiator in suits*

(note that she’s making fun of her Japanese background and their difficulty in pronouncing the letter ‘L’)

*Dear Sir,*

*My name is Jo XYZ. I am an English and Japanese bilingual who has been working as a corporate lawyer at a consultancy in the City of London. I apologise for suddenly getting in touch, but I would very much appreciate it if you could find the time in your busy schedule to consider me for a role at your Japanese Services Group.*

*I left Japan when I was 12 to study abroad in America. I spent the initial two years following Johnny Cash and travelled down south. My family stayed in Japan and the experience of figuring my way alone has made me very resilient. There were some moments where I very nearly chose the comfort of home, but curiosity is what drove me forward during the enduring days and this now forms the basis of my unshakable confidence. I have since graduated from the University of Manchester with a 2:1 in Law and completed a Master’s degree in corporate governance. I chose the discipline because I wanted what is challenging. This meant that my choice was between law and medicine, and I chose law because there were less blood involved.*

*As a lawyer, I have conducted many comparative analysis of national codes and tracked the development of various regulations applicable to the financial industry. I have also worked on providing board-level governance services, such as board training, evaluation, governance assessments and peer benchmarking. Furthermore, having trained in company secretariat practices, I have supplied extensive administrative support both internally and externally.*

*I am now in search of an opportunity where I could combine my linguistic skill and the experience of working for the financial industry. Although I value the experience gained at the current firm, I now crave working for a larger organisation with the chance to be involved with Japan. Combining my linguistic skill, legal expertise and 'bring it on' attitude, I believe I can be of an asset to your Japanese Services Group given the opportunity.*

*I would like an opportunity that is much more than simply being able to speak Japanese. Rather, I would like to discover what I can do with it, which is the reason for my reaching out to you today. I tried to keep this as brief as possible, though I cannot help but feel I have left so much out. If there is a slightest chance that you would like to find out more about me, please refer to the CV I took the liberty to attach to his email.*

*Thank you very much for taking the time to read this far. It is my sincere hope that I hear from you in the near future.*

*Rock 'n' roll,*
*Jo*

Jo is about as “rock ’n’ roll"" as it gets, and actually speaks this way in real life, which is why her cover letter feels authentic.

Does it surprise you that she built a close relationship with the Senior VP who opened that cover letter? He ended up bringing 6 department heads together to create a new role just for her.

The important thing to consider here is this:

Are you putting **who you are** into your cover letter? Are you writing your cover letter to a real person?

If you aren’t, why not give it a try? Because there's a real person on the other end reading it, and they’re giving your job to the people they connect with.

440m8d,0,2016-02-03,[20 M] Recently broke up with my gf [21 F] to deal with personal issues and just found out she's been hooking up with other people. I'm really hurting,loganbull,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/440m8d/20_m_recently_broke_up_with_my_gf_21_f_to_deal/,"I met my now ex-gf (Laura) on Tinder at the beginning of my sophomore year of college (September 2015).  Contrary to most people who meet on Tinder, we hit it off and ended up dating for around a year and a half. I have not had an incredibly large number of relationships or been with many people and this has been my longest and most 'real' relationship. I was very happy in the relationship as a whole,but there were some issues.  Laura was very insecure and would regularly get very upset that I had female friends (some of which I had known and been platonic friends with longer than Laura).  Her insecurity was by far the biggest issue I had in our relationship.  Additionally, when we drank, she occasionally had the tendency to, for lack of better words, go full crazy bitch to the point of physically assaulting me on multiple occasions (I'm a pretty in-shape guy and she's fairly petite so I was never seriously injured or in danger).  We also spent almost all of our free time together; partially due to the fact that neither of us had many good friends.


Fast forward to December 2015.  After finals, Laura was going to Charleston to spend some time with her mother and stepfather who she hadn't seen in many years.  She wanted me to go with her and spend some time with her family and enjoy Charleston.  The first night there, it became apparent that her mother and mother's family (all of whom were estranged for most of Laura's life) were incredibly dysfunctional and to top it off, rampant alcoholics.  The situation spiraled out of control and ended with me calling an uber and staying with family friends who were near strangers to me.  


After this incident, I told her that we needed to take a break because the situation wasn't healthy for either of us.  I started an full time internship the week after the Charleston incident and was also working to complete PTI (pre-trial intervention) for some stupid decisions I had made.  My fall semester had been incredibly taxing and I was burned out from my course load and lifestyle.  I broke up with Laura shortly after New Years because I needed to get my life back together and figure out some personal issues I had been struggling with.  I told her this and explained to her that it wasn't fair to her for me to continue this relationship while I was going through this.  We still talked hung out and hooked up a few times as we were still close.  During the national championship game, she had too much to drink and hit me which led to me calling the police in order mediate the situation and ensure she got a ride back to her apartment.  After this we stopped talking and seeing each other as often, but we still kept in touch.


The next few weeks were absolute hell for me.  I was working full time at my new job and doing community service as soon as I got off work.  I came home to an empty house at night and no friends to talk to, see, or anything.  I quickly became severely depressed and found no joy from anything in my life.  This was made even more painful when I saw Laura's snapchat stories of her going to bars downtown with her roommate and friends and hearing how much fun she had.  


This past week we hung out a couple of times and she slept over.  It was good to just have someone to talk to and be around.  I went over to her apartment last night and she fell asleep while we were watching a movie on netflix.  I went and plugged her phone in before I woke her up so that we could just go straight to bed.  When I plugged it in, I noticed that she had re-downloaded and had been using Tinder again.  I knew that she had re-downloaded it previously and after we had initially broke up I had downloaded it with no intention of using it to try and meet people.  I enjoyed just going through the people and as a mild confidence boost when I matched with people.


For whatever fucking reason, probably morbid curiosity, I pulled up her matches and saw that she had matched and was talking to a lot of guys.  Many of the conversations were fairly sexually explicit and there were many planned meet ups.  Even though we weren't together (and I know that she has every right to talk to other people), I felt like I had a knife sticking out of my chest.  I'm not proud of it, but I broke down and sobbed.  She ended up waking up and I admitted I had seen the messages and I asked her if she had hooked up with other people (again I have no fucking clue why, but I felt like I needed to know instead of just wondering).  She said she had hooked up with another guy and had seen a few other people. I completely broke down and she told me that she still wanted to be with me and hadn't wanted to break up in the first place.


I apologize for the length.  I initially intended this to be a short post, but it helped to write everything down.  

 
TL;DR - Broke up with my gf of a year and a half in order to sort out some personal issues I was facing.  Kept in contact with her and found out last night while I was staying at her place that she has been meeting and hooking up with other people.  I feel completely crushed.  

I don't have any single question, but I would appreciate any thoughts, advice or opinions on how I should move forward.  "
440tod,1,2016-02-03,Which job offer should I take?,2ManyVariables,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/440tod/which_job_offer_should_i_take/,"I'm at a real standstill on this decision.  I currently intern for an international software company.  They mentioned they may have a full time position for me when I graduate, but after I announced I was accepting a co-op offer from a different company, they really vamped up the offer.  Here are some details:

International Software Company:

* Guaranteed full time position

* Chance to live and work in Berlin (which would be cool, and the move is on their dime)

* I don't know German

* Competitive salary already specified

* They'd be grateful if I stayed (for a student, I took on a lot of responsibility)

* I feel completely stalled out at this company, and I'm not emotionally invested

* Despite my junior level, I'm learning from no one

* The team I work on here is disorganized, and I can't stand it, but it's not in me to attempt to organize it (too inexperienced, too introverted)

Domestic Software Company:

* Full time position if I am a good fit upon graduation

* Not sure about salary, but I'm sure it will be as good or better

* The co-op pays a little better than my current internship

* Live where I live now, near family and friends

* Work with some current friends and people I know I'll get along with

* I know work there will be fun, and I can get a change of pace

* I can stand to learn a lot from the people I'll be working under

* I get to learn to work in an organized team where work is actually planned out and divided

Where should I work?

tl;dr  Should I work where I'm guaranteed a well-paying job and a chance to live abroad, but where I'll probably be miserable, or take a chance and work where I'm not guaranteed a full time job, but I'll probably enjoy myself and get to work with friends?"

Results of current cycle: interviewed at my state school 12/11 but have not hear back. The school is inconsistent when they extend offers. I have a friend who is a current M1 and heard 2mo after interviewing in Oct; I also have a friend from the same interview group as me who heard 1wk after our interviews. Interviewed at USUHS but since it was late in interview cycle I interviewed for position on the waitlist. 2 schools haven’t sent II or rejections. All other schools sent rejections. 

What I think went wrong: I applied somewhat late finishing first secondary apps in late Sept/earl Oct. I applied to OOS state schools. Postponed DO apps to hear from MD in attempt to save money, now I think it’s too late to submit those secondary apps.

NOW for the many questions:
1)	Is it worth it to re-take the MCAT, I can try and register for a May date
2)	I am looking at an SMP program, would this benefit me? Also, If I enter an SMP, is it useful to apply when I begin classes or will schools not consider it until after I complete the masters?
3)	What appears to be my weakness?
4)	Am I crazy to be thinking I might have to re-apply 
5)	To those accepted, how long did it take after interviewing to get an offer
6)	To those waitlisted, how long did it take to get your notification
7)	To those rejected post interview, how long did it take to hear back
8)	If it were you, how would you prepare for next year in the mean time?

**Calais: The manifestation of anti-migrant group Pegida forbidden.**

While the French branch of the islamophobic group Pegida was expecting to march this week end in Calais (Region: Pas-de-Calais), the minister in charge of intern affairs Bernard Cazeneuve announced wednesday the prohibition of all demonstrations that could lead to ""disturbance of public order"".

""I asked the prefect of the Pas-De-Calais to proceed to the prohibition of all manifestations, whoever are the organisers, which could lead to public disturbance."" Indicated Bernard Cazeneuve, precising the prohibition targetted ""all groups which called for tensions, division and violence"" and that this prohibition would last ""as long as the current atmosphere will last"".

Last November, a hundred of protester protested against the presence of migrants in the town. Town which is subject to many incident notably around migrant camps and with the police. 

**A recent German Movement**

A declaration of protest emanating from Pegida France was received on the 1st of February 2016 in the sub-prefecture of Calais. Pegida, ""European Patriots against the islamisation of occident"" is a far right movement born in Germany in autumn of 2014.

The founder of this far right movement, Lutz Bachmann , was posing, smiling in the beginning of the year on his twitter account with a tee shirt proclaiming ""Rapefugees Not Welcome"" diverting the message of welcome to migrants.

At least 4000 migrants, who came in majority from Eastern Africa, Middle East and Afghanistan, live in the ""Calais Jungle"" *(Note of the translator : Name given to the migrant camps in Calais)* biggest french slum, in hopes of reaching England considered by migrants as an Eldorado.

I've participated in programming for ""gifted"" kids, who were nearly all &gt;99th percentile for intelligence.  I've been beaten by 11yo chess masters.  I know that children are capable of amazing things, and that being around other equally capable minds is important to their development.

Here is why I think that, despite their considerable intelligence and aptitude, child prodigies should not be *prematurely sent to college.


^*gonna ^arbitrarily ^say ^that ^would ^be ^before ^they ^can ^legally ^drive ^a ^car

**1.  It's bad for their social development.**

Stripping a child from their social context essentializes them as a brilliant mind while ignoring or even undermining all the other stuff that makes them a person.

Putting kids in college removes them from an environment with kids their own age.  This is going to have a negative impact on their social development.  As adults, they will not have had the same sort of formative experiences as their peers.  This is all the more important because child prodigies don't always grow up to be exceptional adults.  After all, many prodigies are precocious but not exceptional- that is to say, they aren't better than everyone else, they just did it earlier.  They might eventually end up as a normal-ass adult with an interesting background but no relatable life experiences.

One might argue that the kid is gonna be alienated from their peers anyway because they're so much smarter, ect.  There is some merit to that, as gifted children are often better conversant with adults than kids their own age.  However, in the case of a prodigy, we can't assume the exceptional skill of a child in one area carries over to any others.  Further, learning how to interact with others, understand them, and appreciate their experiences and what they have to offer is an important part of maturing as a person.  You won't stay surrounded by your intellectual peers forever.  That is, unless you turn out to be an ordinary adult after an exceptional childhood, but then you won't be well equipped to relate to them.

**2. They will miss many important parts of the college experience.**

College, for many people, is the first time you experience real freedom and independence.  It's a place where you learn, but also where you socialize, organize, join clubs and discover hobbies.  You drink, experiment, meet interesting people, try to get laid, and many other equally important parts of the college experience.  It's more than school, it's an environment where you develop in many non-academic ways as well, and have experiences and interactions that will guide you through your working life.  If you're in college, and you're an 8yo, you're missing out on a really substantial portion of what college is about for most people.  Academics are important, but everything else is important, too.

Even in terms of intellectual development, children will be hampered by their lack of life experience.  There's likely a reason why so many prodigies are in mathematics, chess, and other rigid, empirical areas.  They can be engaged and understood without any life experiences.  Even within these fields, though, an age-typical college student isn't just going to be learning about their field, they're going to be networking, making connections, developing professionally, seeking internships, and otherwise advancing themselves as both an intellectual and a professional.  If you go to college when you're a kid, you're only getting part of the experience.

So I recently got myself an itty bitty virus on my pc...yay.
Harddrives will be whiped, new OS and new Components (CPU, etc...) so it isn't as horribly outdated anymore.  
Now as I'm allready updating my PC, I want to upgrade my recording options. So far I've only recorded my music using Guitar Pro (as to have sheets and not forget lol) and/or using a shitty USB-Headset microphone which... obviously doesn't cut it, let's be honest.  
  
What do I want to record: Mostly my electric guitar, my voice and I'd like to utilize my Keyboard. I have an SM58 for vocals, tough I think that if I want to record Acoustic guitar I'd have to invest in a better/ better suited mic. Any suggestions?    
  
My PC will have a new Motherboard; a 3,6 Quadcore CPU; an SSD for the OS and a second harddrive with enough Storage for an eternity (or so I hope haha...). There is an onboard Soundcard which I doubt will be very useful. So my question is; will I have to buy a better Soundcard to process what I'm recording, or will an audio-interface and the right software suffice? I'd rather buy an extern interface, so I'd be able to take it with me or smth. Maybe use it with my laptop if that thing can handle it haha.  
Or would it be a better option to get an intern one and just take the whole tower with me? Opinions? Will my setup suffice so far? 

Now from what I've looked at (and read in other posts) I'm leaning strongly towards the scarlett 2i4; as it not only features the XLR/Clinche inputs but also a midi in/out which I'd want to use for my keyboard.  
  
I have literally Zero experience with DAW's so I think I'd use the Ableton that comes with the 2i4, but I'd like to try out Reaper, is one better suited for beginners?  
Anything else I might be missing?  
  
**TL;DR**: Will buy new PC; extern/intern AI ? Scarlett 2i4 good for beginners? Any Alternatives worth considering? DAW; Ableton or Reaper? "

I graduate from college this May and he graduates in December. This summer he is required to complete an unpaid internship in order to graduate, so he will be living in another state from May to August. We are very concerned about if we can survive the summer financially with him being gone.  

I currently make around $1,000 a month which should increase to around $1,500 after I graduate. I am planning to stay at this job until my boyfriend graduates in December as we are planning to leave the state.

My expenses are:

$300 Rent, $100 utilities, $150 for car payment, and $125 for student loans each month.   

My boyfriend makes around $700 per month and pays $500 total for rent, utilities, internet, tv, etc. His cell phone is $50.  Since we are both still in school we utilize a meal plan from our college which has been paid for already, so our food expenses are extremely low.  

My lease goes up at the end of May, so our plan was for me to move into his apartment while he is away at his internship. He will be finding a place to stay there, so we are hoping that I can cover the $500 rent payment for June, July, and part of August. When he is back we would split the rent 50/50.  

I have about $500 in my checking account, and $6,000 in my savings. I also have around $1,000 in a retirement account. I am concerned about whether I can afford this situation that we will be in. I know it will be just for a short period of time, but I really don't want this to screw either of us financially. I'm not sure that I can afford to pay the $500 in rent, but since he will have a short term lease, and other expenses at his temporary residence he can't really afford to help me pay for rent.   

I was hoping you guys may be able to help me with how to survive the summer financially. Thanks!

I did this last semester and it seemed to be well received.  I exported the career fair map PDF into Excel and added filtering to all the columns.  I also added a couple additional columns to make searching easier.

* Columns added for companies hiring international students for full time or internship positions.
* You can sort by which building the booths are in to roughly group the companies by proximity.

I recommend typing the exact results you want in the open text field of the filter dropdowns.  It's a pain to manually select every box that has your major or class level.

Let me know if there are any other features you'd like me to throw in.

441uds,4,2016-02-03,Soon to be graduate with BS in Statistics. I need career/ graduate school advice.,lolatlogan,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/441uds/soon_to_be_graduate_with_bs_in_statistics_i_need/,"In May I will be graduating with my BS in statistics with a minor/specialization in Math and Actuarial Science from a relatively small state school. I am also currently working on an undergraduate thesis, “Forecasting the Market Value of Consumer Goods using Google Trends” which will get me the ""Highest Honors"" designation upon graduation. 

Sadly, I didn’t get the chance to apply for any graduate programs before deadlines. Luckily I can still apply to my schools programs. I’ll probably apply for both the MBA and Stats program and get the ball rolling and then start looking for jobs.  The reason I want to apply to the MBA program is because I am entrepreneurial at heart. So much so, I have a legitimate business where I sell things on Amazon.  I sell anything I can find a decent markdown, that also has a margin for resell on Amazon. I’ve been lucky to have 10-15k in sales per month with roughly a 20% ROI. That’s beside the point……  

I was lucky enough to sign up for a programming/ big data course utilizing R so I am somewhat familiar with the language. Our program also has us utilized a handful of other statistical packages such as SAS (EG and Base), SPSS, Minitab, and Excel (of course). 

I should also mention that I work full-time as a research chef. I plan to completely get out of cooking once I graduate. I could possibly stay in the industry but I don’t want to continue to be a chef because I know other positions I am capable of pay more. I don’t have any interest in doing an internship to get my foot in the door. I already have valid work experience, yes, unrelated work experience, but experience. 

**My main questions are:** 

* Should I bother with graduate school at the moment? I have an interest in moving into management down the line and I want a degree that will assist in getting me there. 

* How should I go about finding a job after graduation? Do I just shotgun applications and hope I get an interview? 
* Which MBA and Statistics programs should I be looking at? I’m located in Texas and would like to stay local. UT-Austin seems to have decent programs. Does anyone else have any personal recommendations?  
Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Logan

Last summer, 2015 she started to get letters from our university's student accounts office about a debt that she owed.  She told me that the issue had been taken care of and that she was all set to attend classes in Aug. 2015.

First day of the semester I came home from class and she had not gone to class.  She told me that she had decided that she doesn't know what she wants to do with her life and has decided that she doesn't want to go to school any more.  After talking, she has decided to enroll in TWO online classes as the tuition has already been paid, or so I thought, and she needs to take credits so student loans do not start.  She has also decided to quit her paid internship and said that she has turned in a 2 week notice.

Early September her former boss from the internship calls my phone as I am her emergency contact and says that she has not seen her in several weeks and would like to know what is going on. I asked my fiance what was really going on and she tells me that she never actually quit but instead just stopped going.

Mid October, new letters from the student accounts office arrive in the mail.  I don't open her mail and just give them to her.  Letters also start coming in from her student loan company.  She says that they are not a big deal and she is handling it.

December, fiance has decided that she is going to the community college for the spring 2016 semester, and says that she has enrolled in 2 classes both of which on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  states that she will be enrolling in a payment plan.

January, I was cleaning our room and found a stack of 25 unopened letters from the University Student Accounts office, her loan company, and a collections agency hidden under our bed in our room.  Turns out she never paid the debt from the summer which means that she couldn't register for classes in Fall 2015.

Also found a letter from the Department of Education stating that her account is in forbearance because her income is too low to make payments.  This letter was dated after the start of the Spring 2016 Semester, meaning she is not enrolled in school as this would let her account go into deferment. I asked her why it wasn't in deferment and she said because she was only enrolled in ONE class last semester.

Upon further research the classes she has said she is in this semester are not offered Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I also offered to make her payment due next week for her ""classes"" and she told me know and that it will be taken care of. I don't have 100% proof that she isn't going this semester, but I'm very suspicious.

I don't know what to do. I haven't been able to eat or sleep very well since I put all the pieces together that she has been lying to me for the past 6 months. Do I call her out on it?  Do I just pretend its okay? Do I ask her to seek professional help? Do I involve her parents? Or do I end it, not give a reason, and try to move on? I don't trust her at all and I don't even want to talk to her, yet she just goes on like everything is perfectly fine.

   
**tl;dr**: Fiance lying to me over the past 6 months about money and college attendance.  what do I do?"

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/442gmi/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

No, I cannot move out on my own right now with four pets, that if I leave behind, will get abused by my NP's.
I shouldn't even have to say this, especially here. but there's going to be someone trying to redirect some blame onto me, in regards to having two jobs and somehow not being able to magically support myself in full, along with four animals.
nope, not leaving them behind because they're my kids. I will never have real kids, so my pets are my children, period.

My Np's are horribly abusive. From the time I was born, my NF labeled me a delinquent, ignored me and demeaned me any chance he got. He also physically abused me. Mocks me to this day, does everything he can to try to set me up to fail. It's sad, on his end.
NM throws tantrums, several times a day, every day. Was physically abusive. Tries to manipulate me in various, fun ways and enjoys stalking me. Everything is a battle, everything is an endless mind game. She use to starve me out in high school. Threatened to kill me on countless occasions. The police didn't believe me and never would write a report. I use to call the cops on her weekly for months in high school.

Recently, as a way to try to control *something*, she's been throwing tantrums whenever I turn the AC on. It's been warmer and muggy, especially in the house. Nope, doesn't matter, since I want it one way, she just has to have it the other way. Who the hell has to battle with someone to turn on the AC? It's just insane.

I can't do it anymore. I don't meet local shelter requirements.
I'm hoping for my internship to become a permanent job, as it's been hinted at. It would make life easier.

i'm so over it all.
i'm not safe here. I can't support myself on my own, yet. My mind keeps going in circles.

This situation will never get better. As time goes on, it gets worse.

I bit off somewhat more than I could chew with respect to my coursework, and I told myself this afternoon that if I finished it tonight, I would reward myself with one of the better sticks that I had been saving. I finished at around 1:30 AM, but, having a significant amount of caffeine in my system, I decided to smoke anyway.

The stick in question is a Bolivar Coronas Junior, from a box with an early 2013 code, that I was given as a gift from a friend that had just  completed a semester abroad at the history faculty at the University of Havana. I usually like full and spicy cigars, and I thought that the small stick would be relatively mild, but I knew that it would be a good stogie, so my hopes were fairly high. 

The construction was very good, with a rather oily wrapper and a well-applied head. I cut the cigar in the light of my dorm room, and it drew reasonably well. I then headed outside to smoke, walking over to my usual picnic table the required hundred feet from the nearest building, in a wood. It was unseasonably warm, around 65F, and I sat down to light up. However, I didn't have anything to drink, and I didn't want to just simply sit there, perhaps browsing Reddit on my phone or something, and it was a truly beautiful day, with an extremely mild drizzle and sweet air. I decided to take a walk, risking polluting the footpath for unsuspecting passerby; however, I resolved to take a side street. On a Wednesday night, I figured, there'd be nobody out this late anyway.

As I wandered out of the wood towards the main drag of the town, Franklin St., I took my first few puffs. There was a good amount of spice, mostly black pepper with a touch of fuller red, complimented with sweetness. It smoked like a brazier, constantly full but never overpacked. It drew well and burned well as I decided to get a small cup of coffee, just to quench my thirst. 

The streets were empty, and I set my stick down on the windowsill outside Waffle House, one of the few establishments still open, to get a small cup of coffee to go. It was freshly brewed, and it complemented the stick well as I drifted onto a residential side street. Unlike some other small sticks I've had, like the H. Upmann Petit Corona, there wasn't that much in the way of a coffee flavor, and I appreciated the pairing. Towards the second third, the sweetness intensified, with a bit more earth. The ash held beautifully as I walked. The light drizzle, along with the Death Cab for Cutie I was listening to on headphones, served as the perfect compliment. As I do most of my work in the library or in my room, two places where I can't smoke, cigars, for me, inspire reflection, as they are exclusively had during rare downtime, and the taste of the Bolivar, sweet and spicy with emergent notes of cocoa, led me to dwell on the beauty of the moment, the release from what sometimes seems like excessive and useless work. A hundred years ago, there was probably an evening where a student, or perhaps a professor, smoked a similar cigar here while thinking of similar things -- their life, their dreams, and their ambitions. 

As the stick moved into the final third, I began to make my way back towards my room. The stick picked up in intensity, the spice moving to the forefront, with the sweetness not far behind. I could have gone to sleep (I have a class early tomorrow morning), but the campus was so beautiful at night. I walk across it every day, but in the night, with a good stick, it transcended towards the sublime. It's been a tough couple of weeks for me; I've been rejected for summer internships by recruiter after recruiter, my difficulties with classwork hurt my self-esteem, and my difficulties in justifying to my parents my choice of majors had all conspired to drag me down. However, the Bolivar made that all OK, if only for about an hour. No matter what problems I face, no matter where I am in my life, I'll always have an hour, somewhere in the week, where I can just truly relax with a fine cigar. For that, the Bolivar was exceptional. Nothing else does it for me; I can get drunk at some party, or get lost in conversation, but nothing other than a good cigar will actually make me feel, deep down inside, that it will all be alright in the end. I smoked it till it burned my fingers. It, perhaps, is comforting to know that there are always nice things in the world for us to enjoy; we truly are lucky to be able to enjoy them.

The Bolivar Coronas Junior is an excellent cigar. I would highly recommend it, especially at what I've been told is its entirely reasonable price. It's not the objectively best cigar I've ever had, with others surpassing it in complexity, flavor, and construction, but I, personally, know that, whenever I chance upon an opportunity to smoke one again, wherever I am in life, I'll remember this night for its simple beauty. It's now 4 AM, and in five hours, I'll have to learn about networking protocols, but the Bolivar made that a happier thought, and for that, I can't recommend it highly enough."

I am currently a second year student studying chemical engineering in one of the well respected university in US. I have been looking for an internship or co-op recently but I have no luck in finding one. I had a great GPA (&gt;3.9) and an exciting research experience in a process optimization group. However, the problem here is that: **I am an international student**. 

I am also trying to get a minor in computer science. I know that I can potentially be a great student too if I study computer science. I have been doing very well in those computer science class that I have taken. Moreover, it seems that there are far more computer science-based company that are willing to accept international student. I know this fact because most of my international peers who majored in computer science have already had their job lined up in the United States before graduation while those who majored in chemical engineering and is an international student are struggling to find a full-time job right now (even though they had a great GPA and a plentiful internship opportunity).

I know that I am **VERY** passionate in what chemical engineers study. Right now, I am taking Transport and Thermodynamics classes and I am **LOVING** it. However, I am really concerned about the job prospect after graduation. I can find a job back home, but to tell you the truth, engineers in my home country are treated like a trash. I find that the average salary for chemical engineers there are just above the minimum wages. (FYI: I came from a country in Southeast Asia). And you know, this is a problem since I have already spent a significant amount of money paying tuition. 

I am really nervous about my chemical engineering degree right now. So, convince me to not switch track from ChemE to Computer Science for a better job prospect in the US."

It has been a 2 months and I have had 0 calls for an interview despite applying to many positions. I tried to mostly stick to ones requiring little to no experience but still i will apply for jobs that require no more than 5 years. I have talked to recruiters about positions I might be suitable for, I have submitted my resume 5 websites (indeed, careerbuilder, monster, simplyhired, ziprecruiter). And despite all of this I have only received emails telling me I was not chosen based on my credentials, or heard nothing at all. I did just have my resume looked over by someone from TopResume, and I am in the process of changing it to match their suggestions. It is starting to become very frustrating to do all of this work and fill out the same questionnaire for every application and still not be able to land an interview, especially since my university boasted a 2.5 average job offering for all recent engineering graduates at the time. I do have an internship right now that had kept me on full time once my classes were done in December, but for almost 2 months now they have been telling me they are going to offer me a real position with them. The pay as an intern is not something that I can really make a living off of with loans and other bills and I am preparing for the worst in that the salary they offer me will not be much of a raise since the internship pay is so low. Also they are out in the suburbs and I am more interested in working in the city.  So I am wondering what helped you the most when landing your first job as an engineer. "

I really hate having to take medication and so I always seem to drag my feet as long as possible. I should probably stop doing that. 

Other than that, I'm doing pretty good. Still actively job searching, but since my current full time job (which was my internship) says that they will have work for me until *at least* the end of June and want me to stay here as long as I can I am not too stressed out by that. I am very glad for this because not only do I not have to worry about money between both my job and my husband's job but I also don't have to feel like I need to apply to every job I would be qualified for and end up taking a job I don't want just to have a job. It makes this whole process a lot easier to deal with. I finally got my diploma at the end of last month so that makes me feel all official. 

There is also oddly, a small part of me that kind of misses doing security work like I had done mostly from May 2012 until May of 2015. Which was unexpected.

The human body was an amazing wonder to me. I excelled in Biology throughout school, effortlessly; certificates and awards in Biology and Chemistry became an annual occurrence.

I knew that it was medical school for me the minute I graduated high school; I couldn't imagine studying anything else.  No one asked me or enforced it upon me. It was my choice.

It was hard work. Really hard. For 6 years I read large, heavy books about Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I went on clinical rounds to learn how to examine patients and how to treat them. I had to be accept dealing with sleepless nights, dead bodies, weird odors, and angry patients.

In 2008, I  graduated the 3rd of my class with Distinctions.

I returned back to my home and began my Internship year. It was one of the toughest years of my life. After that I was forced to stay at home for about a year while I was looking for a job.

My big break finally came, and I joined a large teaching hospital as a resident in Internal Medicine. I was excited, eager, and loved my work.


Today, I no longer want to be in Medicine. 

It's not that I don't to be in Medicine per say, I still want a career in Healthcare, I just don't want to be in clinical practice anymore. The continuous high levels of stress, inhumane long working hours, lack of sleep and under appreciation has left me burnt out, anxious and depressed.

This is not what I signed up for. The bureaucracy, the insane amount of monotonous paperwork and signing forms, the overbooked clinics where you're never satisfied that you've given the patient the time they deserve, the late night on calls, the stress affecting who you are as a person. The complete chaos of my sleep pattern with the stress of high expectations destroyed me mentally.

It's like they're running a fast food joint; get in as many customers as possible, quality comes second.

I only began to realize all this after being diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It was the worst feeling I had ever experienced in my life. It affected every aspect of my life. My work, my family life, my sleep .I cannot  think of a worse feeling than waking up in the morning feeling your heart pounding and you feel so vulnerable and worried.

I know , in my mind that what I was feeling were irrational thoughts. I kept trying to tell myself its ok, you know its going to be fine. but i just can't shake that feeling off.

Some days were better than others, some days I could control it, and go through my daily routine, but I could still feel it suppressed in the background.

Other days , I felt like I wanted to die, that I can't face the world, that I can't do it, that I want to quit my job . its a horrible horrible feeling. its like you're tied down and can't do anything about it.



I finally began to understand the root cause of my anxiety. It was directly related to my work.

It reached a point where I had a mental breakdown at work. I had a panic attack, I was sobbing in my on call room talking to my fiance, telling her I can't do this anymore.
The next day I asked for an emergency leave, followed by a 2 month leave.

I needed time to sort myself out, to get just step back and get away from it all, to figure out how I can get better. This job was definitely affecting me in a serious way. All I knew at that point is that I can't continue doing what I'm doing. Something had to change, because I can't continue living my life with this anxiety and depression, something was wrong with me and I had to fix it.

I thought about what I'm doing with my life. I asked myself if this what I want do for the rest of my life, the answer was no. That was the easy part. The hard part was “so what do you want to do?” 

It was difficult.. there were so many factors involved:

Finance: I had to be able to make at least the same amount of money I do now

Family &amp; Friends: The minute you tell them you want to quit medicine for anything else, they think you've lost your mind. 

Myself: What is it that I would enjoy doing, that I can see being really good at
what I can use the skills I've acquired for.. something with regular working hours, no every other weekend and over nights.

I wanted to do something along the lines of healthcare management/ Healthcare IT/Technology, maybe get an MBA in Healthcare or a healthcare MSc in a few years.. That was the general idea.

But where do I start? who do I talk to? do I just tell my job that I want to quit? do I look for a job first? where do I even look? How do I continue to support myself while I try to make this transition?

I thought maybe i could ask to be transferred to the hospital administration, start out there , and see what I can do from there. I know another dr who did the same. I talked to my hospital about and they made it clear that this was not going to happen. Looking back in retrospect, Im glad that didnt work out.


Then i thought of doing a MSc, .. but who would fund it, how would I support myself and my newly wed wife for a year or 2 ? Impossible..

All I knew was that whatever happens there's no way I can go back to doing calls. I can't go back to being in that fragile anxious depressed state again. Even if I have to continue working as a Dr I have to change something.


A few months later, something amazing happened. I came across a job post that was looking for Doctors to work for a large Health IT company, to implement EHRs. I liked the sound of it. I had experience in implementing an EHR in my last hospital, I love technology, and the hours were amazing.

Its now been 1 year since Ive embarked on this new career. I have to say when I accepted their offer, I decided to take a ""leap of faith"" and see where it takes me. I have no regrets today.

I dont know if anyone out there has been through or knows someone thats been through something similar, but I thought I would share my journey.

I was an engineering student, but 1.5 years into it just didn't seem to be the right fit for me. (Also, took me a while to switch because I was hesitant whether or not I would do well in CS).

So now I'm a third year here at Rutgers, and struggling trying to find an internship for CS (mostly due to the fact that I don't have any technical or relevant work experience). In terms of CS credits, I finished CS111 (A), CS112 (B, due to pledging..), Discrete I (Math300 A), and Discrete II Honors (B pledging). I am currently enrolled in Algorithms and Computer Architecture this semester. 

Do any of you guys have advice on what I should do, in the case I do not get an internship opportunity this summer? I will obviously attend the career fairs (today and tomorrow) and continue to apply to internships online. 

Will working on a personal project justify lack of summer opportunity? Should I do research to better my chances next time around? Willing to all criticism, advice, etc. :)

The pay is the same between the two (6K + 2.5K housing). The HFT has small perks like meals and the typical get-you-to-stay-at-work amenities. Ultimately, my main considerations are how this summer will make me a better problem solver and how the internship will factor in when I am looking for full-time positions in the Fall. I'm leaning towards the HFT company, but does anyone think I'll be at a disadvantage coming from a company that is basically unknown (big enough to have a good glassdoor reputation, but not a household name)."

She mentioned there's a chance we could get back together in the future, but we both agreed to not to promise anything.

I did talk to her about one week after the breakup. Not begging for her back or anything but just to talk. It was kind of awkward talking to her and it ended with us agreeing we needed more no contact time. 

During this no contact I've made several changes in my life such as working harder in school, applying for internships, working out, and even signing up for a 5K.

I'm wondering if I should contact her soon. I feel like if I don't say anything I will lose her. Although I also take into account that she should be the one who should contact me first since she broke up with me. It's very frustrating to me. I still have very strong feelings for her but I don't know what to do next.

I should also mention that she lives about 20 minutes away from me and we only get to see each other once or twice a week. I still enjoyed the relationship despite this."

second, i really hope this is the right subreddit for this question (i looked at posting guidelines and faq and i THINK its an ok question for here?)

anyways--

i want help choosing an internship for this summer. i've received offers from both of these companies, and am honestly very lost. i am a freshman, so this is my first internship and i have very little experience with this stuff. here are my ""pros and cons""-- (basically idk how i should weight the pros or cons and need help)

Square--
$36/hr + 2000/month housing stipend

Seems like a bigger company than Indeed so maybe more prestigious?

Indeed--
$28/hr + is in Austin (this is kind of big for me b/c I live in Austin and would love to not have to leave my home for the summer).

Which of these would be a better work experience for me? Which of these would look better on a resume for future years? I hope to intern with Google/Facebook/Bloomberg next year.

I'm a junior CS major at an average state school. I've been doing pretty well and I believe I'm likely closer to the top of my class in the major.

I applied to tons of internships last semester, and even got to the final rounds with some top companies. Unfortunately nothing big ever came through. I did, however, receive an offer from a local tech company that's seen a great deal of growth over the past few years. They don't pay a whole lot, though, and their internship program isn't very exciting. It doesn't sound very well structured and seems like it might be mostly testing/boring stuff.

This company, however, would not extend the deadline for my decision past about a week and a half. I knew I would have other interviews, though I was scared I might be left with nothing else on the table. So I decided to accept the offer.

I continued to interview with other companies. This week, I received an offer from another company about an hour away with an amazing offer. The company itself seems really great, the work is much more interesting to me, and the pay is literally double the other offer. I could definitely see myself working at this company after I graduate.

I want to and intend to accept this offer. I'm waiting on one final company next week that I don't have high hopes for, and then I'm going to give my answer to this company. I just need to know what the proper course of action is.

My intention is to sign everything and get that squared away before contacting the first company. When I contact the first company, do I say I can no longer intern with them because I accepted another offer? Or do I simply leave it at I can no longer work for them due to personal reasons? I don't want to have to mention the company name. Would/could they ask for it, and would I be required to tell them? I've read online about companies calling up other companies to let them know a candidate reneged. I don't know if this is true or not, but I'd rather it not happen. So what's the proper thing to say?

**TL;DR**: What exactly do you say to a company you want to renege? Do you mention the new offer? Do you just state personal reasons? Can they ask about the other company? Can they find out on their own? Will a company really contact another company over a reneged intern?"

Here's the deal, I have an opportunity to get an internship this summer, which will obviously be great. It isn't directly tied to system administration as far as I can tell; but it's valuable experience to say the least. From the description and conversations I've had with HR it will be more of a development position where I'll be tasked with improving a business process. It's good to have a wide range of skills and experiences, right?

While software development is a hobby at the moment, my primary focus is system administration. Right now I have a server at my house where I've just started working on my home lab. I also have a 6 month sub to Microsoft Azure (and allotted $100 a month) so I have some really good opportunities to setup a wide range of systems (and I take advantage of these things on the weekend when I have time.)

So I'm apprehensive to follow through with the internship because I'm slightly behind credit-wise. If I take this internship I won't be able to take summer classes which means I'll be going to school for another semester. (I'm a junior so this would be the Fall of 2017 as opposed to graduating that spring)
In your experience, how important is that internship? I'll be 27 when I graduate, so the extra semester feels like a lot more than if I was 22 or so.

One last note: When I graduate I'll have 3 to 3 1/2 years of help desk experience. I know that Help Desk != System Administration, but it's experience none the less.

What would you do, given my situation?

Thank you."

They sent me to boarding school for safety reasons when I was around 15. It was the best thing that could have happened to me, I learned to socialize, and be in a normal environment that actually gave me appropriate reactions to my behavior (rather than constant overreactions). 

it's 12 years later, I'm going to graduate school. I have done amazing for myself because I have been given the space to find the way I need to do things, rather than my parents screaming at me to do it their way and if I don't I'm stupid. I do commercials, model, graduated top of my undergraduate class and now am doing well in grad school but of course it's not enough, it's never good enough. 

My parents still help me financially, not everything but a lot. I am gearing to get a real job and start paying for everything on my own so they stop using it to guilt me. 

They've now decided to move to the city that I live in (I know they're doing this because I lived somewhere else a few years ago and they were looking at houses there) and are making plans to do so later this year. They're already starting to guilt me into moving back home with them to ""save money"" to ""spend time"" with my little sisters and ""don't you love us? you're such an ingrate"" 

I am having nightmares about their moving. I can't tell them that their behavior is incredibly toxic, and that spending time with them means I have to take time to ""recover"" from spending time with them (usually they make me come visit them for a month at a time twice a year and have lost their fucking minds when I didn't come last xmas due to my great internship) 

Everything is going to come crashing down and I just know it. I feel pathetic, an adult that wants to run the fuck away, I hate to admit how much I resent them, because even that makes me feel guilty. 

I am their well trained dog :-\ trained to feel guilty and awful every time I try to do or say or even th ink of something for myself instead of them. "

So, currently I am a junior getting a degree in Information Technology. I like my degree, but I am also really interested in Computer Science (mostly software development). I have added a software track to my IT degree, this allows me to take some helpful programming/software engineering classes. I am doing well in them and I am really enjoying them. I am pretty much done with my IT degree, just need a couple more classes. I also have taken quite a few Computer Science classes. So, if I fill up my schedule this for summer and next year with Computer Science classes, I should have around 14 more classes to take to get my degree in Computer Science.  

Now, I don't if that is my best option. My other option would be try to get a Masters in computer science. I've done my research and I've satisfied most of the pre-requisites classes you need to get accepted. Obviously there are other requirements I need to complete, but I believe that I can accomplish that, especially if I begin to focus on that now. So.....my question is should I go for a degree or a masters in computer science? I believe a masters will be better choice, but I need some advice. I also wanted to ask how likely is it for me to be able to get a software development job with my IT degree and programming/software engineering classes I've taken? Also, wanted to mention that I am looking for an internship for software development and/or cybersecurity. So, I believe that will be beneficial. 


Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I know it's all over the place.

I feel like 40k is pretty low for a fresh CS grad, even though I don't have too much prior experience.

My question is: is 40k enough to live comfortably in a city like Boston? I feel like it's pretty iffy. I've checked Glassdoor and it seems like most QA positions pay at least 50k + in Boston. I just wanted to get a few second opinions on whether or not this salary seems reasonable, and if not what a good target would be for negotiating.

I'm 25 years old and have a bachelors in accounting. I also have good experience (I've done customer service and project managing in my late teens/early twenties), interning in the accounting field in my mid twenties, interning in audit and had a full time accountant position for about 6 months. That accounting position was my most recent job and it just didn't turn out well. I didn't get along well with my team, had more work than I could handle and any time I would voice this concern, my manager would just give the old ""ask your team for help"" type line (which didn't work because they were also bogged down with work). Long story short, I was tasked with the year end accruals and I missed a good bunch because of the time crunch. The external auditors were coming soon afterwards and I got scared and just didn't show up to be yelled at and likely fired once the external auditors found the missed year end accruals. Looking back, it wasn't the best decision, but at this point it's a sunk cost unless someone here has a time machine. 

So that reference is trashed now and now I have about the last year of my work experience evaporated into thin air (6 months as an accountant and I also did 6 months of audit internship at the same company) and am not sure what to do now. 

Should I keep them on my resume and hope my old employer only verifies that I worked there? Or will they bad mouth me if a new perspective employee calls them? Should I test it out myself (call the HR department and pretend I'm looking for a reference for myself to see what they say)? Should I leave them off my resume completely, but then how should I explain a year long gap? Should I leave them on my resume, lie about not giving two-weeks notice and hope they don't contact me last employer? Should I just man up and admit what I did to the perspective employee and how I learned from it (or will that get my resume trashed).

I'm applying to corporate like accounting jobs if that wasn't clear in the text blobs up there.

I had anticipated many of the questions and kind of thought out what my responses would be to them in the preceding days so that I could give a decent answer.

It started with some introductions, some questions about me, my interests, passions, why I want to work here, etc. In the middle I was given technical questions, perhaps about 20-25? It covered a wiiiide range of things from time complexity to the function of a CPU cache, to data structures, math, etc. Then I asked them questions, and at the very end the interviewer has some more questions for me and I gave a really great answer.

So basically I started off strong, and I finished even stronger. The middle part is where I'm concerned though. I answered most of the questions just fine, but given that there was a lot, there were maybe 6-7 that I simply didn't know or simply got wrong. Some I tried to take an educated guess at or just show my thought process, one or two questions seemed outside the scope of what I learned in my undergrad classes.

Overall I think it went well. I think they got a feel for the fact that I'm a reliable person, but I'm worried if I botches the tech part too much. How well do you typically need to hold up on technical questions like these?"

I was a fuck-up, and I own that.

By the time I was twenty I would have been lucky to be on the trajectory my mother had warned me about. I had been evicted three times for not paying rent, couldn't hold down a job to save my life and oh yeah it was the height of the great recession.

So one day I flipped a coin, and left the small town I grew up in and left for a major city to stay with my mom for a while (she had moved away before I turned 18 in part, I think, to get away from me) and get my shit back together. Since changing venue doesn't change who you are I promptly did nothing for a few months, got a job, was fired from the job, never paid my mother a dime of rent and was kicked out, as I rightly deserved.

I proceeded to move into a park. I had no options and felt I deserved no better.

I lived on the streets of a city I barely knew for a year.

I grew the fuck up.

I saw a lot of things, I participated in a lot of things, was victim and victimizer both, learned that black people are people (grew up in a small entirely white town, was very ignorant, didn't have any good role models in the not-being-racist department), stole to sate my hunger--not that bullshit I-skipped-lunch hunger, that empty it's-Friday-and-I-haven't-eaten-since-Monday, sole priority hunger.

I never once begged. Ever. I was done with handouts and sympathy and pity and for some reason every handout I had ever taken before just FILLED me with such anger, this bottomless pit of self directed rage and shame. All that stupid, worthless, unearned entitlement.

What I ended up doing was researching job opportunities with small barriers to entry--certification, short term schooling, that kind of thing. I realized part of my issue aside from the no phone, no address, no basic amenities homeless tri-fucked-a was that the jobs I was qualified to do were being mobbed by 50 other people just as unskilled as I was. Hard to compete with 50 other people.

I settled on IT administration, holed up in the library for a few hours a day and studied to get my A+ and N+ certs, which are very basic and entry level. Then I figured out how to get them paid for, which was its own bizarre misadventure. Then I figured out how to get a free voicemail, worked on my resume, applied to a slew of jobs and worked with recruiters. Somehow I ended up with an internship at a Fortune 500 tech company. This whole process took six months once I settled on it as THE PLAN.

Bear in mind, I slept in the greenbelt on the side of a major roadway the whole time. Slight digression: to get into most transitional housing (halfway houses for homeless) in my area you have to hold a job for three months. Let that sink in for a minute (please refer to no regular showers, no regular clothes washing, being robbed by tweakers, having to hide just so you can sleep, constant and imminent threat of jail, etc., etc.).

So I'm three months down this internship at this company, finally get into transitional housing, and things more or less worked themselves out from there. I didn't end up getting transitioned over to an FTE at that company like I wanted, but did get an FT contract gig with another less well known tech company that went very well for a few years.

My dream, though, was to take everything my mother, my friends, my teachers had ever said or thought about me and turn it on its head. To be so fucking successful they shit themselves. However, it's hard to get into that kind of role when you never went to college. Real glass ceiling without at least a bachelor's degree.

Luckily, a friend of mine got a job at a major tech company you've definitely heard of and submitted my resume to an opening on a whim. In this crazy whirlwind I got the job, outside of my field, working on a product launch at this company I never thought I had a snowball's chance in hell of working for. Helping launch a product was an aspiration of mine, as well, something I never thought I'd get to do since I was on a tech side, support role career path.

It's been an amazing ride. My income's nearly doubled, I have the kind of stock options that mean I could put the down payment on a house in a couple years, and working for the company I do people get a little round eyed and pepper me with questions when they find out. My mother, for the first time in my life, is actually proud of me. My friends from back home didn't believe me at first until I provided picture based evidence--when I visit, girls who would never look at me twice five years ago, women who had turned me down on several occasions back in the day, are all about catching up with me and laughing at my shitty jokes and think I'm amazing.

I have never been unhappier.

There are things I have done at this job that make me uncomfortable. I've been lauded for making business decisions I personally regard as immoral, for misleading people external to the company as a representative of the org. Some people have lost real income because of decisions I have made and been rewarded for.

When I lived on the streets, I once beat someone literally senseless for stealing my sleeping bag in the middle of winter. It took me three cold, wet, sleepless days but I found that man and taught him a lesson he will never forget. Got the sleeping bag back while I was at it. While I regret resorting to violence in that instance I had no trouble looking at myself in the mirror then or afterwards, but now I can't even look at my own reflection without feeling such deep disappointment and shame and guilt.

I hurt someone then because it was about survival, now I'm hurting people so I can buy a fucking house before I'm thirty.

At my very best, I am kind. Mostly I'm not what you would call a nice person. Or a good man, frankly.

I have no free time. 70-80 hour work weeks are a given. I'm incredibly out of touch with what's going on in society--for instance, I recently realized I cannot articulate the differences between Clinton and Saunders' platforms. I'm frankly not even sure who Ted Cruz is or why he's running for president. I've stopped going out on dates because the only thing I can talk about is work which, wait, NDA and it casts me in a negative light if I'm not careful about what I say and how I frame it.

It's only been a year and I can feel myself changing into someone I don't want to be, I am being a kind of person I don't want to be. I've dreamed about this kind of fuck-you success for so long, I never even thought I could get where I am today and I'm not even thirty and I never went to college.

I've hung out with my friends a handful of times in the past year. The first six months went by like... Nothing. It was so immersive and challenging and exciting and cool! Then I realized, all I do is work. The most nonwork social interaction I have is standing silently in the elevator with someone in my apartment building.

I don't know what to do.

I've been working towards this since I slept outdoors in a sleeping bag and ran from the police, and I hate it so fucking much, and I'm starting to hate myself for becoming this fake, awful human being.

**tl;dr After being a colossal failure I have achieved a modicum of unexpected success and have never been unhappier**

- SKIP THIS IF YOU WANT 


Just some background... I got super into coding in 8th grade when my parents decided to move to Jerusalem, Israel for a semester and I was mostly locked up in an apartment. During this time, I wrote over 100 pages to a medieval fantasy book, coded some projects using Scratch (an MIT, drag and drop blocks of code type thing), and got into Python. In general I just felt super creative. I did not go to school during this semester whatsoever. With barely any technology, and a super spotty internet connection, I naturally filled my time with doing some pretty creative things. 


I fell in love with sports in high school and even played college football for a year which completely took over my life. I did not have a ton of time for things like reading, writing, coding, and being creative in general. My parents forced me to work so I held jobs over the summers and during the school year, unless I was playing sports (all the more reason to play sports right?)... I was very social and just did not have a ton of free time from my freshman year of high school through my sophomore year of college.  



- IMPORTANT PART 


Fast forward to now: I decided to transfer. I'm currently a second semester sophomore. I'm closer to home. The new college is way cheaper (D3 football players don't get scholarships). I also snagged an awesome internship for this semester. So, my problem is this: I am delving pretty deep into the programming world. I absolutely love it and there are so many things I want to dive deeper into. Lately I've been learning a lot of server and web development stuff, as well as Swift/iOS app programming. I learn best on my own, and its not even close. I don't pay attention in class ever. I'm just not interested in someone making what I love into something boring. I do have a ton of drive, but I have to FEEL it in my gut. I can't stare at a whiteboard all day. I want to have a goal, maybe even an insurmountable goal, and I want to just go for it. I want to feel a burning passion for it. I can't do this when school sucks the time and life out of me. I honestly feel like I'm playing a game. I'm filling my quota of multiple choice and true/false questions before I can move to the next phase of my life.


My internship is great, but its making me realize that the classes I'm taking are even less applicable than I originally thought them to be. I hate that I have to jump through a hoop (an expensive, creativity-killing one) and honestly I just want to run with some of my ideas. But.. between 15 credit hours and 20+ hours at my internship, I just don't have the time to build any of the things I want to build. 


I still want to have a social life. I don't want to miss that aspect of college, but I feel like I'm not getting anything out of the learning part of college which is actually what I'm paying for? Beyond this, I feel like I'm losing my creative edge. A huge part of me wants to just be like some sort of renaissance guy who travels the world for a while and just creates, learns, and soaks in as much as he can, but school doesn't allow for that. Honestly in CS, after the first few programming classes, they should just ask the students what they wanted to do, and the students should just build something from the ground up, in groups or by themselves, and they should build something that they are passionate about. Why do schools constrain the languages that students can use to code in? Why restrain the IDE? Why restrain the specific area? Web development? Mobile? Any sort of software? It's just pathetic and I'm over how less creative school makes me. "

It's my 3rd year in community college as a Comp Sci major and I'm barely hanging on. I have a 2.8 GPA and I applied for transfer this fall, but it seems to be so out of reach. I spent $800 on college apps to colleges I don't even think I'll get in to. My motivation for school is slowly dropping with every C I get. The only thing keeping me standing upright is my confidence in my skills. I'm not a master in programming, but I know I'm dedicated enough to learn what I don't know. In a transcript buried in Cs, my As in CS classes wave ""hi"" to me. Don't get me wrong, I love school. I learn something new everyday, but it kills me that my low GPA is always in the back of my head constantly berating me about that C in calculus. 

I've considered going to trade school or maybe even taking a gap year, but I'm more afraid about keeping myself busy and just afraid, in general, to go a different route than the traditional 4-year university. And I want to get a degree so badly, not just for me, but also for the rest of my family who are not here with me.

I've applied to many internships and summer programs, and I've gotten into some in the past 3 years, but that was when my grades were above a 3.0. Now, because many programs depend so much on GPAs that it's even getting harder for me to get into those. So now, I'm stuck. I'm sure there'll be more opportunities for me. I'm keeping my head up for those. But for right now, I'm just trying to get myself un...stuck.

TL;DR: I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. "

I've been lucky to have my first two internship interviews with companies I like (one small start up and another Big N) and both were bombed before I could even reach a technical screening. All I do is study and practice coding questions in preparation but when asked questions outside of that realm I feel sort of unprepared even though it should logically be the easiest part. I'm not really an anti-social person (though I am mildly on the autism spectrum and definitely introverted) but when thinking about answering questions related to my resume I think ""Oh I used X technology to do Y and achieve result Z"" not ""How did you and your partners overcome disagreements on this project"". It just seems like an extremely obvious answer and thus a trick question and I start stuttering and pausing through my answer to get the ""right"" answer (I do answer the question but I can see how someone would think I may be lying or exaggerating). 

To make it worse, long pauses kill me internally which specifically happened during the Big N interview. The interviewer seemed uncaring and bored from the get go and after I answered their questions there were constant 5 - 10 second pauses which definitely didn't help with anxiety. 

I've got another interview for the number one company on my list next week and although I feel much more prepared thanks to these past two bad experiences, I really want to do my best to avoid getting a ""We're so competitive right now!"" letter again.

449uob,5,2016-02-05,"Me [20M] with my g/f [20 F] 3 years, her 17 year old sister is now a problem",itcameup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/449uob/me_20m_with_my_gf_20_f_3_years_her_17_year_old/,"This is embarrassing as fuck.  I have been with my g/f since we were both 17 years old.  I've known her little sister since she was 14 years old.  She has never been an issue, I have no feelings for her other than that she is my g/f younger sister and that is it.  She looks a lot like my g/f, in fact she really looks like my g/f did at 17 so that may be part of the problem.
BTW, I don't believe she has any feelings for me so that isn't a problem either.

I have been gone for 4 weeks doing a field intern ship and I just got back on Wednesday and got in so late that I my g/f just told me to come over Thursday and we would go to a giant indoor water park that her family has season passes to.  I had to just check in with my professor for the internship in the morning so we agreed to meet after she got out of her last class after 2.

I get there and go change in the locker room into my swimming trunks.  Remember its been 4 weeks so I'm already pretty much at half staff just thinking about seeing my g/f in her swimsuit.

I go out of the locker room and head to the cabana that they have reserved.  

I round the corner looking to see my g/f only to be met by her little sister wearing a two piece and she decides that this would be  a good time to give me a hug since she hasn't seen me since Christmas (busy with school).

Way to much skin on skin contact and half staff went to raging in about 0.000000000000000001 milliseconds.

I do my very best to move my hips back so I'm not jabbing her in the stomach.  

The real problem though is my g/f is right behind her and if she couldn't tell what was wrong by the way I was trying to twist out of our embrace it became very obvious when I got away from her walked to my g/f.

I hug my g/f and she say's ""oh is that for me or would you rather I go get Holly back here for you"".  I try and play it off but it is now obvious to me that she is pretty pissed.  I go sit down and kind of cover up with a towel hoping that both the situation and my erection will all go away.  I try and make small talk but she is now giving me short one word answers.  

Finally I convince her that we should go ride the water slides and just try and lighten the mood altogether.

The afternoon goes on and finally we get to leave and go back to my place and as I said it has been 4 weeks and I was hoping that we could spend the evening breaking my bed and couch down.  But no, we spent the whole evening with recriminations and accusations.  I got grilled on how long have I had feelings for her sister, do I think she is prettier than she is, did it happen because she has larger breast, yadda yadda yadda.

It took everything I had to try and explain to her that I was already very aroused before I got there just thinking about seeing my g/f in her bikini.  It sort of worked, she called me a pig and scolded me for thinking of as a sex object, but at least she finally believed that.

With all of that I'm thinking I'm good now and tried to initiate sexy times only to be told that she wasn't curing an erection that her sister created.  I begged (I'm not proud) trying to explain that the erection was hours ago and my new one was all about her.  That didn't work either and she just told me she wasn't in the mood.  Defeated I agreed to watch TV but since I was somewhat pissed I made her watch all of my missed episodes of Arrow which didn't thrill her.

So she goes home and after being home for almost 2 hours I get a text thanking me for causing so much drama in her life with her sister.  I guess when she got home Holly came to her to apologize for hugging me and giving me an erection. (I guess I did not hide it very well)

I guess they went at it till Holly finally went bed.

Now I'm left here frustrated beyond belief (blue balled like you can't believe) and I have a snippy g/f who honestly thinks I want to bang her younger sister.  I have my g/f younger sister now thinking that she has some magic power over me by the mere fact that I got full blown when she ambushed me.

I'm thinking the best thing I can do about this is to stay out of it between the two of them.  I do see the little sister often when my school work isn't so much so its not like I can avoid her.  If it comes up for whatever reason I am going to tell her it is because I saw my g/f and that is what happened.  It's a lie but I think I can swing it.
   
**tl;dr**: been away for a month and was ambush hugged by my g/f younger sister wearing a two piece bikini at a waterpark, I'm wearing only my swimming trunks as well and the skin on skin contact created issues"
44a4mx,470,2016-02-05,FatSnowWhite gets herself a 'boyfriend.,snowwhitehatesapples,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/44a4mx/fatsnowwhite_gets_herself_a_boyfriend/,"Hello everyone. I'm back with another tale about FatSnowWhite. Special thanks to /u/leonides1775 for coming up with a name for me (that fits perfectly). 

**The cast:** 

Apples: yay, that's me (I really love my new name!) student, currently living with my dad’s family while the bf is doing an internship abroad. Pretty normal overall (I hope?).

FatSnowWhite: my stepsister, a 250lbs butterball who loves Disney, make-up and being loud and annoying. Daughter of Monica, my dad's new wife. 

**Background**: 

From the day I moved in in December, FatSnowWhite was pretty hostile towards me for no obvious reasons. As I was aware of the fact that I was kinda invading her home and space, I was extra nice for the first few weeks, but she often made jabs and jokes, digging at my mom, my looks and my eating habits. The quintessence being that I would benefit from some make-up tips and various surgical procedures and that I eat 'rabbit food'. Whenever I'm eating carrot sticks, FatSnowWhite makes her favourite joke of all time and says: 'Ohh, look, sticks for a stick!' (I'm 5'3 and 130lbs btw, and in my personal unbiased opinion I don't resemble a stick at all!) Anyway, at first I let it all go because I thought it would just take her some time to get accustomed to my presence. 

**On to the story:** 

The weeks went by and it was nearly Christmas. Monica was super excited for Christmas,  decorated the whole house like crazy and could talk of nothing else. One day at breakfast I asked Monica if my bf, who came to visit over Christmas for three days, could stay with us. FatSnowWhite was there during this conversation and seemed completely in disbelief about the fact that I had a boyfriend. 

FatSnowWhite: “Wait, you’re still together?” 

Apples: “What do you mean?”

FatSnowWhite: “I thought the only reason you moved in here was that the two of you broke up. Didn’t you tell me that?” She often says I told her this and that, which is really ridiculous because we hardly talk about anything alone, other than the bathroom schedule. 

Apples: “Umm, no, he just has to spend a year abroad. He’s doing an internship there!”

FatSnowWhite: “*Has to*? Who *has to* go away from his girlfriend for a year? If that would happen to me, I’d certainly break up with that douche.”

Apples: “Of course he doesn’t *have to*, but it’s a great opportunity for him and I’m not going to stand in the way of that. Also, he’s actually just a three-hour-flight away so it’s not like we’re not gonna see each other for a year.”

FatSnowWhite: “Well, to each their own. I wouldn’t wanna be a placeholder though.”

Monica: “Oh, FatSnowWhite. I’m sure Apples isn’t just a placeholder. They’ve been together for nearly 5 years. What’s 1 year in the grand scheme of things?”

FatSnowWhite: “Just saying… You don’t expect him to be a monk for a year, do you?”

Apples (through gritted teeth): “As I just said, it’s not like we’re not gonna see each other for a year.” 

FatSnowWhite: “Oh, so you’re gonna bang when he stays here?” Did she just say that? In front of her mother? I was so perplexed I just went bright red. Thankfully, Monica chimed in. She’s always trying to avoid conflict so she often pretends that things are a joke.

Monica: “Haha, now that’s enough, FatSnowWhite! Stop it with your silly jokes and help me clear the table.”

FatSnowWhite: “Can’t, gotta go.” Did I mention she never does anything around the house? Well, anyway, she was off and I shared an awkward silence with Monica. From that point on FatSnowWhite added my boyfriend to the list of stuff she could make fun of, saying he looked ""too young"" or that we were ""an odd couple"". 

FatSnowWhite also didn't go out so much any more, she was just laying around the house eating Christmas cookies all day. I also ate a lot of Christmas cookies, because they’re delicious, so I’m not gonna judge her on that. But at least I was writing on my thesis. She watched one TV show after the next saying she would do her assignments ""tomorrow"". When she’s not leaving the house all day, she actually doesn’t put on make-up (or deodorant or fresh clothes!), but my ponytail is still the worst thing that happened to humanity according to her. 

It was the weekend before Christmas, my bf would be coming on the 24th, and I was already super excited. At dinner, FatSnowWhite suddenly announced that she would probably  bring a guy for Christmas dinner. 

Monica is getting all excited: “Who is he? Why haven’t I heard of him before? Is he your boyfriend?”

FatSnowWhite: “Ugh, please, mom. Don’t be so nosy. He’s kinda my boyfriend, but I didn’t think it was appropriate to bring him, because you know… family time and all. But now that everyone’s doing it…”

Monica: “Oh, how exciting. I’m so glad, what’s his name?” 

FatSnowWhite: “Chill, mom, you’re gonna meet him soon enough. Oh, by the way, Apples, would you like to go out with me and some friends tonight?” Umm, what? She never wanted to do anything with me. But I’m not really in the mood for partying. 

Apples: “That’s really nice of you to ask, but I really need to focus on my thesis and finish my second chapter.”

FatSnowWhite: “Come ooooon, how boring is your life? You’re always writing on that thing. You need a break once in a while. Isn’t that right, mom, you can’t always concentrate 15 hours a day. You need a break once in a while, right?”   

Monica: “I guess. But that’s for Apples to decide.”

FatSnowWhite: “You know, I’m always telling my friends about you and they want to get to know you! Also, maybe you’ll meet my boyfriend, then you can tell mom all about him tomorrow!”

Monica: “Oh yes, please. I want to know everything!”

I was honestly overwhelmed in this situation, with both of them trying to get me to say yes, so I agreed. In the evening, FatSnowWhite and I got ready for the night. The plan was to go to a club and meet her friends there. I agreed to be the driver, because I didn’t feel like drinking anyway. I also warned her that I would like to head home at around 1am because I couldn’t afford sleeping in too long the next day. She said that’s ok, she would take a cab later but she was sure that I would have so much fun I wouldn’t wanna leave. She was really nice, until we got into the car. On the whole drive to the club, the comments about my outfit didn’t end. 

“Who would have thought you could look this good with a little make-up? Now, if you would use a little more eyeshadow, you might just look as good as me.”

“I really like your hair tonight. It’s normally so greasy all the time…” My hair IS NOT greasy. 

“I wonder if that dress would suit me. I mean the color. The cut is obviously only for sticks, and I don’t want to look like a sack of potatoes so I need something with a feminine cut.” I was wearing a drop waist dress [like this](http://imgur.com/zHbbkkx). 

By the way, did I mention FatSnowWhite was wearing a very tight yellow skirt (not very flattering colour for anyone IMO!), a blue top with a lot of cleavage and a red cardigan. Think about it. It took me some time to recognize the colour combo and I'm 99% sure it was not unintended.

Anyway, we get to the club, her friends are nowhere to be seen. FatSnowWhite starts drinking one cocktail after the other. After an hour, one of her friends arrives. She’s a little less wide than FatSnowWhite but also fat. Also a lot of make-up, very loud and gesturing a lot around, and wearing something extremely tight. She introduces herself shortly and then she and FatSnowWhite talk without involving me whatsoever. It’s also really loud so you can’t really have a group discussion anyway. I keep looking at my watch constantly. It’s 11.30 and I decide to head home at midnight. FatSnowWhite and her friend go to the dancefloor for a while and I stay at the bar babysitting their purses. When they come back after one song, looking completely exhausted like they just ran a half marathon, I say that I’m going to leave now. 

FatSnowWhite: “You can’t, my boyfriend is going to be here any minute.”

Apples: “Ok, fine, but I’m gonna go at midnight.”

FatSnowWhite (rolls eyes): “Oh, how Cinderella of you.” Now suddenly she says it like it's a bad thing to be compared to a Disney princess. 

FatFriend: “Haha, you’re so funny. Except she’s not like Cinderella at all. You know, there’s something about brown hair, it’s so… Idk…”

FatSnowWhite: “…unexciting?”

FatFriend: “Yes, omg, exactly.” 

Apples: “Ok, guys, I’ll call it a night and head home.”

FatSnowWhite: “No, you have to stay until my boyfriend shows up. He’ll be here in 5 minutes, I swear.”

Alright, I say I’m gonna stay for ten more minutes. FatSnowWhite and FatFriend are telling me which hair colours would look good (= a little less unexciting) on me. Finally, “the boyfriend” arrives. ""He's the hot one."", FatSnowWhite murmurs to me when two guys approach us. And he is actually not what I imagined at all, because he’s apparently a real human being and also, he’s very buff. But, it’s also hard not to notice that he’s actually not FatSnowWhite’s boyfriend. He hugs both her and FatFriend exactly the same way and there’s no real affection between them. He also brought a friend, NormalDude. Literally a second after he introduces himself to me, FatSnowWhite and her FatFriend go to the bar and drag BuffGuy along with them. NormalDude comes over to me. 

NormalDude: “Sooo, FatSnowWhite has been telling me a lot about you. I wasn’t so sure about this at first to be honest.”

Apples: “What do you mean?”

NormalDude: “Oh my God, please tell me she did tell you I was coming over tonight to meet you.”

Apples: “Meet me? What are you talking about?”

NormalDude: ""Well, she said you saw my facebook and were all crazy to meet me so she arranged it.""

Apples: “I’m sorry, that’s not what happened. I actually have a boyfriend.”

NormalDude: “Oh, she said you recently broke up.”

Apples: “I’m sorry. I have to go.""

NormalDude: ""You don't have to leave because of me. We can still just hang out!""

Apples: ""I actually wanted to leave half an hour ago. I was just staying because FatSnowWhite wanted me to meet her boyfriend.""

NormalDude: ""Since when does she have a boyfriend?""

Apples (asking super innocently, even though I already knew the answer): ""Well, isn't BuffGuy her boyfriend?"" 

NormalDude: ""Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat? No way she told you that! He's just here because I didn't wanna go alone. I think they hooked up once but he was really drunk that night."" Poor FatSnowWhite. 

Well, I went home after that, I was so angry at FatSnowWhite that I didn't even tell her I was leaving. I was also super confused, thinking that maybe it was all just a misunderstanding. The next day made everything a little clearer and FatSnowWhite is actually crazier than I thought, but I think this story has been long enough for today. :)

**tl;dr**: FatSnowWhite finds out I have a boyfriend that will stay with us for Christmas, suddenly she also has a boyfriend, but when I meet him I find out they only hooked up once. Also, she tries to set me up with a friend of hers and thinks guys are gonna like her when she dresses in real Snow White's colors.

We both were more career focused than relationship hunting so (for now at least) were purely satisfying each other’s sexual desires on an irregular basis. You’d think I’d be going into the story of the first time she accidently fell onto my upright rod, but that’s probably too vanilla for this sub.

No, this story takes place at the end of the first week of my colleague getting a freshly graduated college intern. She was Steph, a shy and reserved Asian who was probably brought up under a tiger mum and never allowed to drink let alone party. Friday night drinks are a ritual at our workplace, and since it was Steph’s first week Trace and I offered to shout all her drinks.

Not that she drank much though. It wasn’t too late at this stage but I was getting to that stage where I needed my fix. I gave Trace the look and she was game. I gave Trace a nod towards Steph and she got the hint. With a little convincing we found ourselves on a train ride back to my apartment across the city.

We cracked out some drinks and nibbles, dimmed the lights and sat down to Netflix on a romcom I can’t remember the name of. The girls had left a space in the middle of the couch and I planted myself there after a quick clean in the bathroom. Not very long in my hands were wandering over Trace’s body and she had shifted up nice and close to me. Steph finally clicked and knew what was going on and scooted a little away from us, only to be caught in the act by Trace.

A little convincing from Trace got Steph back close to us on the condition she could tell us to stop anytime. Obviously she was curious. I directed my attention at Steph and once she started letting out little moans, Trace and I knew we had her roped in. 

It wasn’t long before Trace got on her knees and pulled my pants down. She was a master at polishing the rod but what I really wanted tonight was to see Steph’s cute face with my cock down her throat. Ever being the gentleman I gave her body a tour with my fingers first prior to even attempting to get her on her knees.

It wasn’t too long until we were all naked. Steph took a bathroom break, to clean up I presume, and in the short time I had alone with Trace I gave her a little teaser of what was to come by burying my cock in her dripping pussy for a few seconds before propping her back on the couch and working my tongue on her sweet nectar.

Steph came back in and I finally got the chance to see her small lips wrap around my throbbing john. Trace joined in, then Trace kicked Steph off my cock as she lay me down and started riding. She came within minutes; if she had gone any longer I would have nutted in her as well.

I turned my attention to Steph as Trace caught her breath. She wasn’t on the pill, but I had some rubber. Which probably helped me last longer as her near-virgin pussy was tight, and it only got tighter the more I pounded. 

I wanted to make Steph cum but I also badly wanted to coat her pretty face with my ropes. At this stage it would be one or the other as I didn’t think I could hold myself back from exploding when her pussy clamps around my rod. I tried the last trick in my book, planting myself deep in her and giving her short strokes to avoid overstimulating myself. It worked. So much so it sounded like Steph enjoyed it more than the pounding I gave her earlier.

Steph crescendo-ed into incoherent mumbles. I had sweat dripping off my forehead. I pulled out, ripped the latex off and roped her face even though I was attempting to shoot into her open mouth. Ok, I kind of wanted to make a mess.

Trace crawled over and helped lick ropes of cum off Steph’s face. We cleaned up, tossed Steph’s phone aside (after she assured her mum she was safe spending the night at a friend’s) and fell asleep on the same bed.

44afjn,4,2016-02-05,[Casual conversation] My SO is really busy nowadays. I feel a bit lonely.,Charmingly_Conniving,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/44afjn/casual_conversation_my_so_is_really_busy_nowadays/,"Hey guys.

myself and my SO have started as Long distance around this time last year. To cut the long story short, i live in the UK where we met, and she now lives in Brussels temporarily for a job at the European commission.


It started as a 6 month internship, now she's landed another placement at Brussels for a further 9 months.


I was initially taken aback as the plan was always do the 6 months, then try to land a job back here in the UK. However when the new placement came up, i told her she'd be silly not to take it. 


Anyway, the distance isnt too much of a problem for me, what my problem is that she's really busy with life nowadays, and i feel like im just constantly trying to squeeze myself in her life- which isnt something i normally do, nor what i used to do.

It feels like im almost begging her to talk to me, which takes a lot of pride swallowing, then also begs the question of whether there's something else going on behind the scenes.


Its been quite rocky recently due to that, but i've arranged to see her on Valentines weekend and we're off to do some couple-ey stuff.


I guess im just really worried about the state of our relationship. I'm not a big fan of causing or entertaining drama, but i do take conflict head on.


 What do you guys think?"

44aw6f,2,2016-02-05,"[URGENT][INTERVIEW TOMORROW] HELP! I DO NOT want companies to reference a certain company, but it's my only reference. What do I do?",iwishforstrength,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/44aw6f/urgentinterview_tomorrow_help_i_do_not_want/,"Country: USA

Hi guys, I'm hoping to get some genuine insight here - I have been fired by a job before for reasons that I **am** responsible for. Reason in letter of firing: I wasn't experienced enough and I kept making mistakes - very small (on rough drafts, could have sworn I typed a period or comma but I really didn't, being too slow - however, never crossed any deadlines), but supervisor had a really short fuse. So she fired me. I admit and accept these faults, and I do think these are reasonable grounds for firing.

Thing is, there is a second, more subtle reason. 
The supervisor had a strange hostility towards me, which grew inordinately intense over time. I feel it may have been because I didn't fit in to their culture, which made my presence visibly awkward, and she no longer wanted a ""sore thumb sticking out"" around. 

This is the only professional reference I have. And now I'm scared this will create a very bad image of me.

At this point, if you don't want to know details, you can skip to the TLDR.

-----------------------

Actually, both the coworkers and I knew the whole office really did not like me because I did not fit their culture. What kind of culture is so hard to fit, you ask? When we all ate together in the lunchroom, they would commonly say ""cum"" and ""jizz"" and yell disabled people jokes. Including the CEO. Whenever someone made a joke that was the most offensive, they'd all clap and cheer loudly. When I was quiet, they'd comment, ""hey, when are YOU gonna start being offensive?"" Exact words. This was a regular thing. Guys, I can't make this shit up. The cherry on top: it was a small town known for being pretty racist, one where you almost never see asians around. I'm a quiet, shy asian girl, I'm polite towards everyone. They would ""poke fun"" at my race. Very. Very. Often. It would escalate. One time, when I finally got home, I actually found myself crying. 

I'd assert myself sometimes. But it always happened all over again the next day.

I honestly didn't know what the hell to do anymore, because this is the first time I'd ever worked, and I was faced with something weird: the HR manager was often sitting there laughing as well.

I was very thankful to land this job. So I tried for a bit to play along. Vaguely tried some ""offensive humor"".
But I'm not like that. I'm sorry, I know you have to try to ""fit in a little"" when it's work related, but this time, I couldn't. So over time, I tried to fade myself out of all their convos, just kept quiet. Smiled and chuckled when I had to. But that only made me stick out more like a sore thumb there. I'm assuming the cued smiling made me look ""fake"". So by the time I got fired, whenever we had to look at each other, you could see on EVERY coworker's face an expression that just screams ""she doesn't fit in here"", thinly veiled by required politeness. 

But with the supervisor, her looks came off very transparently as **hostile**. 

With her, I can understand. Yes, I did make real mistakes. And that's why I got fired.

But I do think her hostility was aggravated towards me inordinately, heightened only by how I ""didn't fit in"". Thus, I fear if she ever gets asked to reference me, she'll talk about me in an unbalanced and spiteful way. 

Why do I think this? She also expressed very clear signs of suspicion towards me. I have a really weird hunch she may have thought my silence meant I resented them, so I was making mistakes on purpose to spite them. We got off on a very friendly foot, even having free-flowing, casual conversation about music and vacation spots. But over time, she started speaking in VERY short sentences with me, and walk away very very fast, almost like she was running sometimes. Sometimes, when she found out I was doing a task unknown to her given to me by someone else, she'd ask ""why?"" in a very hostile tone.

I know, the past is the past - I move on. So what's the problem now? The last time I did an interview, they told me they ESPECIALLY want reference from this company.

This is because I work in the design field. 
*This is the only design job I've ever had.*

I have nothing else to reference.

If I take that off my reference list, there'll only be 2 references that most recruiters don't want - my college professor, and 2 internships from more than 4 years ago.

HELP. My interview is tomorrow.
I am terrified they will ask for this place's reference. But I can't take that reference off, or I'll have almost nothing.

I also know a reference is different from a recommendation, and those are different from a referral. With references, do they ask how I did? Or is that when you only ask ""did she really work there"", then the company's not allowed to comment on how you actually did?

Please, still comment even after tomorrow, because I want to know for the future.

What do I do?

------------------------

**TLDR**

Help me - I have an interview tomorrow, and there is a terrifying impasse.

I was fired from the first job I've ever had - for a partially unfair reason linked to bias. The company environment was very hostile and judgmental there, and had an extreme culture that was hard to conform to. There was a bit of racism involved that made me feel uncomfortable (and distrustful) there as well. I have put it behind me as an atypical experience, but new companies I've applied to have wanted to, and will consistently want references from THAT COMPANY SPECIFICALLY - because it's the only job I've ever had.

I don't have any other references that companies are interested in.

I am terrified of what they'll say of me.

I can't take it off my reference list or I'll have nothing left. 

*Then I'll never be hired.*

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes!

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

The main focus is on gaming. I want to play games like Fallout 4, The Witcher 3, and Starcraft 2. I'm also a Computer Science major (graduating in May!!) and I do a lot of programming, specifically I want my computer to be able to run things like Android Studio comfortably - my current laptop just can't handle it.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I'm aiming for 1440p at 60fps, though I realize that this may vary between games. I'm not worried if I can't get that at Ultra settings, but would like to be able to at least get a step or two below that.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Trying not to go over $1500 - $1600, the cheaper the better. If there's a compelling reason to go over, I might be able to swing it, but it will just take a little longer to save up the dough. I have $550 saved right now and my roommate owes me another $716. The rest will come from what's left over in my paychecks after bills (I have a good internship working almost 40 hours a week).

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I opted for a liquid cooler because I'd like to overclock my CPU. I know this may be a little beyond a beginner build, but I feel fairly competent with my abilities being a CS major and because I worked in tech support at my University up until December and did a lot of repair and swapping out parts so I know my way around a computer.

I'm definitely open to suggestions on the case, because I had trouble finding one that I felt confident about. I'm worried that the one I picked might not be spacious enough to fit all the components, especially since I'm going for an optical drive. I'm willing to shell out more for a higher quality case, one that will last me a while and possibly be used in future builds.

Also, this is probably a noob question, but I wasn't able to find an answer on Google. Will the optical drive be compatible with my motherboard? The motherboard only lists SATA 6Gb/s but the optical drive is for SATA 1.5Gb/s. Can the 1.5Gb/s go in the 6Gb/s, and just be limited to the 1.5Gb/s?

If you make changes/suggestions, I'd really appreciate a little bit of reasoning behind those so I can learn more. I've been working on this build for awhile and I'm astounded by how much I don't know.

From the description and conversations I've had with HR it will be more of a development position where I'll be tasked with improving a business process. It's good to have a wide range of skills and experiences, right?
While software development is a hobby at the moment, my primary focus is system administration. Right now I have a server at my house where I've just started working on my home lab. I also have a 6 month sub to Microsoft Azure (and allotted $100 a month) so I have some really good opportunities to setup a wide range of systems (and I take advantage of these things on the weekend when I have time.)
So I'm apprehensive to follow through with the internship because I'm slightly behind credit-wise. If I take this internship I won't be able to take summer classes which means I'll be going to school for another semester. (I'm a junior so this would be the Fall of 2017 as opposed to graduating that spring) In your experience, how important is that internship? I'll be 27 when I graduate, so the extra semester feels like a lot more than if I was 22 or so.
One last note: When I graduate I'll have 3 to 3 1/2 years of help desk experience. I know that Help Desk != System Administration, but it's experience none the less.
What would you do, given my situation?
Thank you.

Quick addon: I recieved an email yesterday about an internship working in a sysadmin role. Specifically a Windows Server environment."

Throughtout my college years, I have only done web-development projects / internships, but never mobile development. Over the winter break, I started playing around with iOS Development in Swift, and I love it. Initially I wanted to a web developer, but now I want to change my focus into mobile development. Since I have no experience in mobile development at all, I was thinking of applying for an internship position for the summer, but by that time, I will already have graduated from college. Is it possible for me to land an internship in mobile development despite already graduating from college? Or should I just focus on self-studying, and applying for junior mobile developer roles?"

A semiconductor company in my area offers a scholarship to final year EE undergrads, I'm applying for it and I'm in a bit of a dilemma about including some future experience on my CV.

I was accepted into a 3-month research internship at MIT this summer, which is obviously a huge thing to be able to put on a CV and would hopefully help my chances at getting the scholarship, I'm just not sure how listing future experience might be viewed by the company. I've also got a short co-op internship at another local semiconductor company at the start of the summer, obviously the same question applies in this case too.

The scholarship application says candidates will be chosen for interview. Should I leave out the internships for the coming summer and bring them up if I get called to interview?

There's also a cover letter with the application, I was thinking of including the internships there instead of on my CV but in that case it won't be as prominent and someone getting a lot of applications could easily skim over it, easier than they would if it were on my CV at least.

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on this!"
44bpfy,2,2016-02-05,"23, Brazilian, Chemical Engineer. Would like country recommendations and immigration advice.",BRladier,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/44bpfy/23_brazilian_chemical_engineer_would_like_country/,"Hi everyone.

I'm a 23 years old chemical engineering student on my last year of college in Brazil, in a respected university that often ranks top 5 in LA and number 1 in my country. I had an international experience last year in California where I studied for one year and that just made my existing desire of leaving to another country grow exponentially. I really want to do things right so I'm trying to plan my immigration before I finish college.

Now that I have introduced myself, I would like some recommendations of countries that would be willing to accept me or some immigration advice. A few points to look at:

- For my personal options I'm more of a generalist than a specialist. I currently work as an intern in business intelligence for an american global company (that unfortunately is really hard to give you an expat package). That being said I would prefer not to got to a master's program and get into the technical field just so I can emigrate, but I can consider this option if all others are unavailable.

- If I were to take a master's I would prefer something related to biochemical engineering (industrial biotechnology) or Oil &amp; Gas. If someone can suggest me good places to study in these areas that would be great, but

- Another problem with going for a master's program is money. My family is humble and we don't have any significant savings or income to pay for a loan. Scholarships are the only way to go unfortunately. Any program recommendations are welcome!

- Going back to the US would be the perfect scenario, I loved the country and identified myself with the culture pretty well, but I know it's hard if not impossible for a Brazilian just out of college to get a working visa there.

- Australia is a close second, I find the country amazing and there are lots of opportunities and stability there. But I have no link with the country whatsoever to help me with visa.

- My grandparent was Portuguese and came to Brazil in his mid twenties. My father always had the dream to go back to Portugal (even though he never lived or visited there) and we love the country as well (I proudly declare my Portuguese origins whenever I can). Unfortunately both my father and my grandfather have passed away and that makes getting a PT passport really hard.

- Another important point: are there any countries that accept parents as dependents? I lost my father recently (one year approx) and my mom is not dealing well with the new family situation (we all aren't but she's been having it worse).

That's basically it, I am a hard working guy that dreams about leaving Brazil to work and raise a family, but I find myself quite lost because I don't want a specialist and technical career. If anyone has any advice I would be really appreciated and if you need any more details just let me know! Thank you very much for the support.

For the past 3 weeks, I have been teaching myself Batch/CMD scripting to make a batch script that asks the user for a .TXT file of bunch of hostnames, and then proceeds to copy the Installer folder on their root/temp and then runs a silent installer. I am using Batch because we don't have the capability of pushing this silent installer using SCCM at the moment, so Batch is the simplest method to go.

I used ROBOCOPY command to copy the contents of one folder onto anther folder that I create with the MKDIR command on a remote host.

I keep running onto an error when the remote host is not online (say, the user went off to lunch of something, either turned off their machine, or is offline). How do I put in a condition that will skip to the next host (next item) in a .TXT file and continue on with the script?

lets say, check if host is online, and if they are, continue with script, if not, skip this host and go to next host in .TXT file, then continue with installation script?

This is what I have so far (Also, if you have suggestions for improvement, or a great resource to learn more, I would love to hear it):

    @ECHO OFF
    SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS

    :: script global variables
    SET log=c$\BulkInstall_log.txt

This is how far I have gotten. I have a while to go but I am enjoying the simplicity of Batch Scripting, having come from PowerShell world (I learned PowerShell first through an internship). Batch is simpler for our teams to use since there are less version issues and all you really need is the elevated privileges to do the installation.

I'm posting here because I was looking for advice from people that have been in a similar situation

I'm a Political Science student at a prestigious Canadian university, with one more school year until I'm finished my degree. I enjoy the content, but do not plan on pursuing social sciences further after my degree. I also have experience with Computer Science/programming (Python, Java; mainly do web dev stuff)--which I really enjoy, but do not see myself pursuing a related (e.g., dev) career. I've really been thinking about where I want to be after graduation, and only find myself getting anxious because I really don't know. Over the past year or two, I started taking myself and my future more seriously by putting myself 'out there' more. I.e., recognizing where I excel, volunteering, talking with professionals, and just developing a broader network, I recently landed a director position with a charity (got promoted from a ""specialist"" after 2 months), which I'm enjoying so far. 

Anyways, to make this short, I procrastinated on looking for summer internships (never have had one) and finally started but realized I have no idea what to look for. I have no idea where or what to look for, I don't know what kind of jobs are out there, or what industry to look at. What I tell people (and myself) when asked where I want to be, I say I could see myself in the tech industry--but I truly don't know what that means. I don't want to be a lawyer, or a professional programmer, and I really don't want to work in retail for the rest of my life. The broad implications of my degree and skills just make everything more confusing.

What I'm asking for is some guidance: based on what I’ve written, what direction do you think I should take? What advice do you have for me? Thanks! :D

I had a couple of questions what I should be doing with my TFSA while I am going to school/interning. I'm 23 and I'm planning to max out (or nearly max out) my TFSA each year. 

I currently have 9600 invested with CIBC's mutual funds in the following accounts:

1,969.81 in Managed Income Plus Portfolio (A bond focused mutual fund)
7,284.45 in Managed Balanced Growth Portfolio (Stock focused)

I'm currently doing an internship at PwC in New York making roughly 27.50 USD/Hr 50-60 hour work weeks. I want to use this money in 5-10 years to purchase a home. In your opinion(s) what would have the highest ROI? I was thinking about investing in an energy based ETF or investing in REITs that hold properties in oil producing areas (NVU.TSE seems to be a pretty good stock, its dividend yields ~10% annually and its price should rebound as it is linked with oil as well.)

Again, I'm new to investing and I just want some ideas as to what I should do!

So here's my problem: On my first day, someone sneezed and I noticed nobody said ""Bless you"". So when that same person sneezed again later, I reacted and said ""Bless you"". That's when shit started spiraling out of control. This coworker has some kinds of allergies or some shit because he is sneezing VERY often. Like once every 10 minutes. I'm now saying ""Bless you"" every time this dude sneezes. Here's the worst part, people are getting sick and sneezing more and shit and it seems like nobody has tried to come to my rescue by helping me out. There are partners and senior managers in the room as well and I'm in too deep to stop now. I think over the past month I've cemented my reputation as the one who says ""Bless you""


WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?? It's getting exhausting and it's been 4 weeks. Please help. If I just stop it'll be too awkward like I'm giving up. Should I pull the first-year aside and ask her to help me out? I'm already in charge of coffee and meals, but this is insane. I have 1 more month to go. Anyone have this kind of issue?

First of all, I'm very glad to see this community sprouting up. There's no reason to spend time discussing why it's needed when everyone here already knows... So, hi, hello. Nice to see you.

I've done an AMA before but /u/humblesalesman has been a great sounding board for me in redesigning my site and discussing strategies, so I'd like to return that favor by offering whatever insights I may be able to offer here. This community is still quite small and I get that, so I'll keep checking back and giving responses to questions as long as you keep posting them, in the coming days, weeks, months, whatever.

My background is included below but it's a bit of a long story and some of you may want to skip it. So, before getting into that, here are the topics I expect to be able to speak on with authority:

1. Digital Marketing
1. Social Media Strategy
1. Copywriting
1. Outbound PR
1. Doing shit even though you have no idea what you're doing
1. Maximizing return on viral attention
1. Admitting I don't know something, which is often
1. Pivoting a.k.a. letting a course of action dictate itself, rather than trying to hold fast to a rigid gameplan

It should be obvious that an AMA held in a sub with so few subscribers isn't being done for self-promotional purposes. However, this is still Reddit, so I'd like to point out that any links included in this post are not included for promotional purposes but only to establish credibility, as well as facilitate the conversation.

**About Me**

* I dropped out of high school when I was 15 and became a touring musician for roughly 13 years. (It's irrelevant to this discussion but my father is David Allan Coe. I only mention this because, unlike most other affiliate sites, I've made it relatively easy to discover my identity and Redditors love to play detective.)

* When that abruptly came to an end, I was left with nothing but a G.E.D., no work that any employer would view as an employment history, one hell of a jobstopper tattoo and one hell of a felony (Class A or Class B, don't remember). When people talk about how difficult it is to find a job in today's market, it's difficult to not roll my eyes. I'll never forget those interviews.

* These roadblocks to employment left me no choice but to assess my skills and find a way to turn them into money. I've always been a writer, keeping journals and what have you. Since joining social media, it was readily apparent that the status updates I posted consistently gained more engagement than those of other people. This, along with my comprehensive knowledge of the music/concert industry, led to a freelance position as a publicist with an independent music label. 

* Another ""skill"" I had was my good health. Specifically, clean blood plasma. Donating twice a week paid for groceries and giving myself a crash course in music theory (I'd never learned) allowed me to give guitar lessons for extra income to cover rent on my lease.

* When I dropped out of high school, the city I left was Nashville, Music City USA. When my lease was up, I returned, hoping that decade-old friendships and recent PR gigs would be enough to gloss over the unsavory bits of my history, in one of the few industries that pretty much doesn't give a fuck unless you murdered someone: concerts

* A very well-established music venue complex accepted me into their ""intern"" program. (A bit funny, at nearly 30 years of age.) Within a few months, I was running the paid and organic social media strategies and campaigns for all three venues in the building.

* Seven months into that, the General Manager, who'd interviewed me and with whom I worked most closely, put in his two weeks notice to focus on a wildly ambitious tech/music startup. He offered a position to me, if I wanted it. I took it.

* The tech half didn't work out and we became an independent concert promoter. This was never a goal of mine but it freed up more time for me to resume freelance work. With all of my new connections from working at the venues, freelance work had become a priority again.

* My first freelance PR client was a local band, How I Became the Bomb. They had a music video that wasn't doing anything on YouTube and they wanted someone to make something happen with it. I can not claim sole responsibility for what happened next but I can honestly say that it's exactly what I hoped would happen and I had taken specific actions to make it happen. You may have seen the video. It has nearly 26 million views on YouTube: [""Ulay, Oh""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAID_2iKO5Y)

* My second freelance PR client was a television pilot for a reality show about restoring older Nashville homes and selling them for more money. (As opposed to demolishing them and building cheap condos, which is currently the common practice in Nashville.) Their pilot had aired on HGTV but did not get the level of ratings necessary to be picked up for series, which was the goal. There was to be a second and final airing of the pilot and I was brought in to promote this event, in the hopes of generating a bigger audience and getting the show picked up. [Nashville Flipped](http://nashvilleflipped.com/) will air on HGTV this year.

* These two solo successes, along with several high-profile achievements on the small teams mentioned above, were enough to put my services in pretty high demand in the local market. Unfortunately, many of the potential clients contacting me were under the impression that I could get the same results with any ""product"" sent my way. That just isn't the case. Even though I'd often want those paychecks, I found myself turning down a lot of work in order to protect my reputation and ability to sleep at night.

* Turning down that money was frustrating. I spent a lot of time thinking about how much easier things would be if I didn't have a conscience. Now, it's possible that I have a mild and undiagnosed dissociative identity disorder. (It's fine.) To give voice to the characters I have in my head without incorporating them into my own personality, I create novelty Twitter accounts. (I have far, far too many. It's literally an addiction.) A soulless marketing account called Shut Up and Buy It was made. It was vicious. Posting the absolute dumbest shit for sale online and berating people for being stupid enough to buy it even though the person telling them to buy it was literally telling them they'd have to be an idiot to buy it. You get the idea. It was very negative and I decided I didn't like it. But I knew there had to be a way to make it more positive, inclusive and, ultimately, more funny. This is what lead to the idea of drunk shopping.

* From here on out, the creation and success of drunkMall ([Press Page](http://www.drunkmall.com/press)) has been pretty well-documented. In addition to the aforementioned AMA, there is this blog post I wrote about my exact approach to the publicity campaign for the site -&gt; [drunkMall: A PR Recap](http://blog.theemedeacomplex.com/post/133076643897/drunkmall-pr-recap)

* My goals for drunkMall are much different than the goals of an average affiliate site. Without giving my plans away, my interest here is in building a brand. This is why I'm able to openly discuss the URL, the niche and, ultimately, why I feel able to be of assistance to you - by offering a specific example of a website you can see and ask the person who made the site why I've done things the way I've done them. This has lead to some (hilariously bad) ripoffs of my site. That doesn't bother me and it ultimately only serves to strengthen drunkMall's brand when people call them out for being a copycat.

Okay, that is definitely enough about me. What can I help you with? What are your current problems? If I can't help you, somebody else reading this probably can. Talk to me."

What does this mean? I write my programs in eclipse, but after I finish it, I'm not sure how to export it to my hard drive and turn it in in a way that will allow it to run. I assume that is what gradle will do, however I am not sure if I need to write my code in gradle? Use gradle after my code is finished? I just don't want to start this project until I know I am doing it in a way that I can successfully submit. Thanks in advance!!"

Microsoft used to have a network essentials certification that focused on TCP/IP in a Windows environment.  That seems to be his weak spot.  Is there anything out there like that now?  The Network+ training really seems to suck; I hope that's not the best alternative.

For background, I'm 22/F/5'5.5""/140lb. Some say I'm 5'6"". Some say 5'5"". I'm calling it 5'5.5"", haha. 

Anyway, I'm struggling a bit right now because of the darn number on the scale. Due to a history with restricted dieting and other mental health issues (totally in treatment for them, do not worry!), I spent most of my adolescence believing I was too big at 115lb. In college, I began working out as a way to cope with stress. That was fine and dandy until I realized I went from 120lb to 125lb. Retrospectively, those were certainly muscle gains as I look at old photos and miss my abs!

Flash forward to now. Years of college, working throughout that time, stress due to family health issues, and continuing to maintain some semblance of a work out routine, I ended up weighing in last February at 138-140lb. I trained for a 5k, then a 10k, then took a hiatus. Came back, started lifting with dumbbells and machines (holler planet fitness!), steady cardio...and it is February once more. Here we are again - 140lb.

For reference, I am a vegetarian. I have never had trouble having a healthy diet, although I definitely bulked on froyo this past autumn. While I indulge in treats, I limit myself to once a week and the rest of the time I eat intuitively. I tracked for a week a few months ago and came in between 1400 and 1600 cals per day eating my normal diet. This is combined with a regular work out routine (gym 3-4x week, cardio x30min each session and 45m-1hr of lifting a session). I am a full time graduate student, intern, and part time employee, so I am also juggling my other obligations. Yet the scale ain't budging!

Looking at pictures from a year ago, I am much more comfortable in my body than I was then. Part of me misses what I looked like at 120-125, but I'm unsure that this is a realistic weight for me.

I guess my questions for you lovely ladies are: 
-When the scale isn't budging, is that a sign to listen to your body?
-How do you ladies balance losing weight and maintaining good mental health?
-At the end of the day, what drives YOU to continue on your fitness journey?

On a positive note, I have learned the value of exercise for calming my super busy mind. This past year I tried to teach myself to work towards goals that I can accomplish (the 5k, the 10k, etc) rather than aesthetic goals. Still, the mind is an everlasting work in progress :-)"

44e2d4,3,2016-02-05,Everything was going so well,Dreadpr123,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/44e2d4/everything_was_going_so_well/,"I have been depressed on and off for most of my adolescence and early adulthood. I always told myself and others that I had a storybook childhood. In retrospect, although I recognize that I have been luckier than most in this fucked up sorry excuse of a world, I just haven't wanted to admit the shit I've been through. I was molested at age 4 by some older playmates, and since then I have been addicted to masturbation. I am female. I was born in the US but my parents never taught me English and I am naturally shy so I shit my pants a lot in preschool. People picked on me but I never really had a bully because I never took anyone's shit. I learned how to make myself invisible. I am also objectively in the  top 1% IQ level but have never been satisfied with my achievements. I made no friends until I went to a STEM oriented highschool. Before that I went through a period of anorexia because some infinitely stupid part of me though that if I could fit into the type of clothes the popular kids wore, regardless of the fact that I could never have afforded them, I would magically make friends. Throughout my childhood I studied human behavior but never understood it. Yet I am not capable of fitting the definition of sociopath or high functioning autistic because I am empathetic and good at reading emotions and recognizing other's perspective. Also I'm a natural politician, though I have always hated that side of me. I almost died at age 12 because I got appendicitis and didn't have health insurance and am Hispanic so my parents never took me to the hospital even when I puked for a week straight and had a fever of 104. Eventually they took me to a clinic and they rushed me to the hospital, days after my appendix had burst ( I knew when it happened because the stabbing pain disappeared). I hated myself intensely for the monetary debt my 10 day hospitalization caused my parents. In highschool I excelled at everything from clubs to classes to flattering the right teachers and getting into the right summer camps. However I was constantly stressed and sleep deprived, and also for the first time realized that even there I didn't fit in because I wasn't rich and my parents weren't educated. Meanwhile in my family I was ostracized for being ""too white"" and a nerd. During the recession my dad went into business with my aunts and uncles which eventually resulted in a giant argument that tore my family apart. Soon after a SWAT team raided my house because of some stupid shit my older brother had gotten involved in. I had an assault rifle pointed to my chest but was explicitly told by my parents never to tell anybody what had happened. I got into my dream school and earned myself some scholarships and worked through my senior year for money and by 18 I was financially independent. I had a lot of fun my first few months in college and was happy to be far enough away from my family that it was impractical to ever visit. Soon though the imposters syndrome set in. I got myself a shiny ass internship 3k miles away from home for the summer and repeated the process sophomore year. However everything went to shit sophomore spring when I developed a severe anxiety disorder. That combined with the strongest bout of depression I had ever experienced, a growing feeling of incompetence, and a number of suicides amongst my broad social circle made me decide to take some time off. I quickly got promised a year long internship in the same city as my school so I didn't bother to job hunt during the summer. I completed my summer internship and was soon informed that I did not in fact have a job. Even though I had some cash in my bank accounts I agreed to move back in with my parents because they were offering free room and board while I searched for a job. I thought it would be extremely temporary, but while back home my depression intensified to the point where I was spending entire days just staring off into space. I couldn't get help because I didn't know my city of residence yet. I became suicidal. I got committed. I spent over a month in intensive therapy. I briefly improved but then it became apparent my meds weren't working and my psych was an incompetent asshat and I decided to off myself out of frustration. I got committed again. I missed many interviews and job opportunities this way. I was too ashamed to tell my friends what I was going through. I finally found a good psych and shrink in my network and after months of work I began to improve. I hung out with my friends from high school, I responded to job offers and regained my confidence as I kicked ass in interviews. I took up skateboarding and busted my face and managed to respond to the situation calmly and rationally. I began to feel like my old self. Then my 5 year old niece suddenly died from a cold induced asthma attack. My family came together in a way I hadn't experienced in many years and thought would never experience again. As sick as it made me feel, I was perversely happy to be reunited with my cousins and brother. We grew up together and they were my only and best friends. Then the panic attacks returned, but only at night so I can't sleep. I adopted a kitten. These past few weeks have been the happiest in a very long time, just as they've been fucked up. I have some very promising job offers and a chance to return to school and still have some money in my bank account. My family is close and I am reconnecting with my friends. I love my cat and she shows affection towards me and comforts me when I lose control. I don't know why I did it but I told my father about my previously repressed memory of my molestation and all the years I suffered hating myself because at first I didn't know what masturbation was, just that the big people said it was wrong, and later because our misogynistic society lead me to believe it was only natural for males to do it. He responded simply with ""I know and so does your mom"". I went about my day's activities unbothered, but when I woke up from an exhausted nap I was inexplicably angry. I attempted to have dinner with my parents but couldn't stop myself from insulting them at every opportunity they gave me. I have thought about it and now realize why I am angry. I feel nothing now except an intense desire to hurt them. I know the most effective way to do so is to kill myself and leave a note telling them that I hate them. They didn't give me a second's glance while I figured out everything from boyfriends to small business tax documents on my own during adolescence because they were always too busy helping my brother. Now I realize that it was a mistake to make myself their dependant once again. I am an adult and a human and it is my fundamental right to decide how I live and how I did. Fuck them, I didn't need them as a child and I sure as hell don't need them now as an adult. I choose to die. Let them deal with the Fucking consequences for one goddamed time."
44ec2u,8,2016-02-05,Would love some advice from fellow pharmacists/pharmacy employees/owners,OOTPDA,TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/44ec2u/would_love_some_advice_from_fellow/,"Hey there, hello there!
 
I'm a newly registered pharmacist who has posted on here before about how [I'm starting to love pharmacy again after a rough year](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/3zm0uy/starting_to_love_pharmacy_again_been_a_rough_year/).
 
Anyhow, it seems that the rough year isn't quite over and **I'd love some advice/some steeling of my nerves/some reassurance before I do what I'm about to do**.
 
Let me just preface this by saying that I'm generally very good at making my own decisions and sorting my own life out. But, I feel like some outside perspective from people in my field of work or who have experience with situations like this would be wonderful at the moment.
 
**Summary of previous post:**
After an acquaintance from my previous work (who left to run his own pharmacy) offered me a full time job for after my internship then told me he didn't have anything any more, when I'd all but finished up my internship job, I found 3 days/week at a sole pharmacist pharmacy and got placed as back up for another pharmacy plus got 1 day a week as medical reception. So I had enough to pay the bills.
 
Since then I've also been offered a few days in another pharmacy (which clash with the days I'm doing now, but could be handy later).
 
Once this all happened, **the first guy (who offered me a job, then changed his mind)** - we'll call him Slim (for Slim Shady, cos he's kinda shady)- **calls me and says, ""we've got full time work for you now""**. So, silly me, all for giving people second chances, decided to have coffee with him and hear him out.
Turns out a lot of his pharmacists are leaving the pharmacy and he has ""worked really hard"" to get me ""almost full time work"" (his words, not mine).
 
 
**So the conversation when we had coffee went something like this:**

Me: I have work now, Slim. I had to find something once you told me you didn't have anything.

Slim: But I have some now and it's **almost full time**. I need you. You're like a daughter to me. (bear in mind he says this a lot, but has also said to me, ""if I were 20 years younger, I'd marry you."" Super professional.)
 
Me: But I can't just turn my back on the other guys. (frankly, I just didn't really trust him and the pay he offered me wasn't worth what I'd be doing there). If you get me a contract. I'll read it and think about it.
 
 
So I left with the promise that I'd get a contract to read over. **And here is what he offered wage-wise at the meeting**:
 
* $30/hr Monday-Saturday inclusive (should be time and a half on Saturdays). ($30/hr is about the standard for someone just registered in my town. I know it's probably less than some countries, too, but Australia pays less for pharmacists than say, the US or Canada.)
 
* $45/hr on Sundays
 
* $60/hr to be on call once every 4 weeks (the pharmacists all rotate)- this means if a nursing home (that pharmacy looks after over 1000 patients in nursing homes) calls in the middle of the night with a phone order I would have to get up, go to the pharmacy (which is in a super dodgy area) and open, dispense and take the med out to the home. I'm 5ft 2in and that area is known for addicts, theft and worse.

 
So before I even got the contract, I was thinking I wouldn't do it. I could live off what I have at present with much less stress.
 
The, Slim calls me a few days later, a Monday:
 
Slim: I sent you a contract, why haven't you signed it?
 
Me: I haven't received anything from you and I'll need time to look it over when I do.
 
Slim: Ok, I'll send it again (:/ again)
 
So about 12 hours later, at 8pm, I receive another call:
 
Slim: I have your contract here, I'm sending it now. I've had it for a few days. We'd really like it back by Wednesday
 
Me: Look, I'll need to read over it and it will take a few days
 
Slim: There's not much to it. We can offer you full time. But your contract won't say full time.
 
Me: ... (he's just trying to get out of paying me holiday and sick leave)
 
Slim: **And, I know you were worried about telling your other employer you're leaving, so I called them for you this afternoon and told them you're gonna come and work with me**
 
Me: YOU WHAT?!
 
Slim: Now you don't have to worry!
 
Me: Slim. I do not even have a contract from you! I haven't told my other employer I'm considering leaving! You've backed me into a wall.
 
Slim: I'm just doing what's best for you. Anyway, read the contract and let me know. I'll send it now.
 
So naturally I called my employer straight away (by then it'd been at least 4 hours since Slim called them) and told them that under no condition would I be leaving them to work for Slim and that I hope they didn't think badly of me for the whole incident, and that I hadn't even considered Slim's offer.
 
They were really cool about it, saying they didn't think I would ask someone to do their dirty work and that they didn't trust him and they think I'm fantastic (shucks). But **then they dropped another bomb**:
They're either selling their pharmacy or closing it's doors, so I have a few months with them guaranteed but they can't promise what will happen afterwards. FUUUUUUUUUUU. So I should take a better offer if I get one, but hold out for better than what Slim offered me.
 
Then I went into panic mode and got into contact with a pharmacist who had offered me full time at a pharmacy an hour away from home (I'm in Australia, so taking that job means a long drive on a wide open road with lots of kangaroos to hit, especially in winter- it would be a dangerous drive). He said the position is still open and to come and see him the following Tuesday (Tuesday before last), in one of his pharmacies 2 hrs away. So I did, and it went well (I think). **A summary of the outcomes:**
 
* He said he's interviewing a few other people but I'm ""well ahead of them""
 
* He asked me to come down to the pharmacy I'd be working at, so he could show me around it, the next Saturday (today)
 
* He then messaged me a few days ago to say, ""Hi, I'm not going down to [town with pharmacy in it] this Saturday now, [business partner] can meet you there the following weekend if that suits you."" (I'm like, sh*t, another week of not knowing, but at least they didn't cancel)
 
* I replied, ""That's not a problem, I will come down the following weekend. I'm extremely interested in the position.""
I'm hoping that this means he genuinely can't meet up and not him fobbing me off. I'd like to think he wouldn't chuck a Slim and lead me on when I'm not getting the job. Perhaps he just wants me to meet his business partner and/or is busy?
 
So now I have a week from today to wait before I can go see the pharmacy/hopefully get a yes or no.
 
I haven't officially turned down the job with Slim, cos I wanted something lined up before I do. But now, that will be at least a week away, if I'm offered one at all. And Slim has called me twice in the past 2 days, which I haven't answered cos I've been working. But I really should call him back and give him ~~what for~~ an answer.
 
**Ok, so what I'm wondering:**

* Should I turn down the Slim job? I honestly don't think working with him is a good idea. He can't be trusted and aside from that, he makes a lot of mistakes as a pharmacist (I worked with him in my intern job). I feel like I'd put my registration in danger by working for/with him. On the other hand, it's a job in my home town and it'd be close to full time.
 
* (Since I'm fairly sure you'd all agree that working for Slim is a bad idea) How do I turn down this job professionally, whilst stating why I'm turning it down (him being unethical, bad job offer etc). Bearing in mind that I may find a job in the same town as him in the future and have to liaise with him and his wife, who is a GP in the town.
 
* Would you say I still have a chance with the other job 1 hour away, considering they didn't cancel the meeting at the pharmacy, just rescheduled it? They've already met me and are wanting me to come see the pharmacy, that's a good sign right? Even if it has been rescheduled.

Sorry to bug y'all, I'd just really appreciate a fresh perspective. I also don't like burning bridges (Slim's offer), especially when I don't have anything to go to yet, but in this case it doesn't seem like a bridge I'd want to have.

**Thank you for reading- I'm sorry it's so long-, I'd love some advice!**

Once this all happened, **the first guy (who offered me a job, then changed his mind)** - we'll call him Slim (for Slim Shady, cos he's kinda shady)- **calls me and says, ""we've got full time work for you now""**. So, silly me, all for giving people second chances, decided to have coffee with him and hear him out.
Turns out a lot of his pharmacists are leaving the pharmacy and he has ""worked really hard"" to get me ""almost full time work"" (his words, not mine).
 
 
**So the conversation when we had coffee went something like this:**

Me: I have work now, Slim. I had to find something once you told me you didn't have anything.

Slim: But I have some now and it's **almost full time**. I need you. You're like a daughter to me. (bear in mind he says this a lot, but has also said to me, ""if I were 20 years younger, I'd marry you."" Super professional.)
 
Me: But I can't just turn my back on the other guys. (frankly, I just didn't really trust him and the pay he offered me wasn't worth what I'd be doing there). If you get me a contract. I'll read it and think about it.
 
 
So I left with the promise that I'd get a contract to read over. **And here is what he offered wage-wise at the meeting**:
 
* $30/hr Monday-Saturday inclusive (should be time and a half on Saturdays). ($30/hr is about the standard for someone just registered in my town. I know it's probably less than some countries, too, but Australia pays less for pharmacists than say, the US or Canada.)
 
* $45/hr on Sundays
 
* $60/hr to be on call once every 4 weeks (the pharmacists all rotate)- this means if a nursing home (that pharmacy looks after over 1000 patients in nursing homes) calls in the middle of the night with a phone order I would have to get up, go to the pharmacy (which is in a super dodgy area) and open, dispense and take the med out to the home. I'm 5ft 2in and that area is known for addicts, theft and worse.

 
So before I even got the contract, I was thinking I wouldn't do it. I could live off what I have at present with much less stress.
 
The, Slim calls me a few days later, a Monday:
 
Slim: I sent you a contract, why haven't you signed it?
 
Me: I haven't received anything from you and I'll need time to look it over when I do.
 
Slim: Ok, I'll send it again (:/ again)
 
So about 12 hours later, at 8pm, I receive another call:
 
Slim: I have your contract here, I'm sending it now. I've had it for a few days. We'd really like it back by Wednesday
 
Me: Look, I'll need to read over it and it will take a few days
 
Slim: There's not much to it. We can offer you full time. But your contract won't say full time.
 
Me: ... (he's just trying to get out of paying me holiday and sick leave)
 
Slim: **And, I know you were worried about telling your other employer you're leaving, so I called them for you this afternoon and told them you're gonna come and work with me**
 
Me: YOU WHAT?!
 
Slim: Now you don't have to worry!
 
Me: Slim. I do not even have a contract from you! I haven't told my other employer I'm considering leaving! You've backed me into a wall.
 
Slim: I'm just doing what's best for you. Anyway, read the contract and let me know. I'll send it now.
 
So naturally I called my employer straight away (by then it'd been at least 4 hours since Slim called them) and told them that under no condition would I be leaving them to work for Slim and that I hope they didn't think badly of me for the whole incident, and that I hadn't even considered Slim's offer.
 
They were really cool about it, saying they didn't think I would ask someone to do their dirty work and that they didn't trust him and they think I'm fantastic (shucks). But **then they dropped another bomb**:
They're either selling their pharmacy or closing it's doors, so I have a few months with them guaranteed but they can't promise what will happen afterwards. FUUUUUUUUUUU. So I should take a better offer if I get one, but hold out for better than what Slim offered me.
 
Then I went into panic mode and got into contact with a pharmacist who had offered me full time at a pharmacy an hour away from home (I'm in Australia, so taking that job means a long drive on a wide open road with lots of kangaroos to hit, especially in winter- it would be a dangerous drive). He said the position is still open and to come and see him the following Tuesday (Tuesday before last), in one of his pharmacies 2 hrs away. So I did, and it went well (I think). **A summary of the outcomes:**
 
* He said he's interviewing a few other people but I'm ""well ahead of them""
 
* He asked me to come down to the pharmacy I'd be working at, so he could show me around it, the next Saturday (today)
 
* He then messaged me a few days ago to say, ""Hi, I'm not going down to [town with pharmacy in it] this Saturday now, [business partner] can meet you there the following weekend if that suits you."" (I'm like, sh*t, another week of not knowing, but at least they didn't cancel)
 
* I replied, ""That's not a problem, I will come down the following weekend. I'm extremely interested in the position.""
I'm hoping that this means he genuinely can't meet up and not him fobbing me off. I'd like to think he wouldn't chuck a Slim and lead me on when I'm not getting the job. Perhaps he just wants me to meet his business partner and/or is busy?
 
So now I have a week from today to wait before I can go see the pharmacy/hopefully get a yes or no.
 
I haven't officially turned down the job with Slim, cos I wanted something lined up before I do. But now, that will be at least a week away, if I'm offered one at all. And Slim has called me twice in the past 2 days, which I haven't answered cos I've been working. But I really should call him back and give him ~~what for~~ an answer.
 
**Ok, so what I'm wondering:**

* Should I turn down the Slim job? I honestly don't think working with him is a good idea. He can't be trusted and aside from that, he makes a lot of mistakes as a pharmacist (I worked with him in my intern job). I feel like I'd put my registration in danger by working for/with him. On the other hand, it's a job in my home town and it'd be close to full time.
 
* (Since I'm fairly sure you'd all agree that working for Slim is a bad idea) How do I turn down this job professionally, whilst stating why I'm turning it down (him being unethical, bad job offer etc). Bearing in mind that I may find a job in the same town as him in the future and have to liaise with him and his wife, who is a GP in the town.
 
* Would you say I still have a chance with the other job 1 hour away, considering they didn't cancel the meeting at the pharmacy, just rescheduled it? They've already met me and are wanting me to come see the pharmacy, that's a good sign right? Even if it has been rescheduled.

Sorry to bug y'all, I'd just really appreciate a fresh perspective. I also don't like burning bridges (Slim's offer), especially when I don't have anything to go to yet, but in this case it doesn't seem like a bridge I'd want to have.

**Thank you for reading (I'm sory it's so long), I'd love some advice!**"
44elix,1,2016-02-05,First job - budgeting and savings guidance needed,pf_throw_1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/44elix/first_job_budgeting_and_savings_guidance_needed/,"Throw account because my regular is identifiable.

The opening might sound defensive, but yes, I have read pretty much everything in the wiki that is relevant and I'm still at a loss about how to go about this since I find my situation and needs a little different, so here it is. 

Just finished college (I'm 23) and will start my first job in about a month. It's going to pay $120K/yr and there's some bonus at the end of the year but I'm gonna count my income as this and the bonus is all going to be saved. The next part is that I plan to go back to graduate school in the next 3 years and I would like to save for that. My current situation is to save as much as possible, with the worst case being that I don't get a fellowship to study. I'd ideally like to finance it myself as much as possible and then take out a loan or borrow from my parents. The main goal is to have as much liquid savings as possible by the summer of 2019. 

So the gross income is going to be $10k/mo. There's a fairly decent employer match to the 401(k) and before we go down this, I'd like to point out that I'm an international student and I plan to leave the US in about 8-10 years time i.e after I finish my graduate school and work for a bit after that. Nevertheless, I plan to max out the contribution there to ensure I get the 50% match.

QUESTION - Do you think I should go down the 401(k) route or would you suggest something else? Since I haven't started work yet I don't know the full details of the plan but the broad idea I'm looking for is whether this in itself is a good idea because I may have to either withdraw this amount or get a loan off it to fund my education in the future. Also, if I should be contributing, then do I start right away or build an emergency fund and then start contributing? 

The 401k looks promising because I understood that I won't be taxed right now and if I withdraw from it during later years of grad school, I won't have any other income and hence will be in a lower tax bracket. HOwever, the 10% penalty worries me. I see that I can use an IRA to avoid the penalty if I use the money for higher education and not pay taxes on it but I didn't fully understand that process. 


Here's where I stand right now:
$10K gross

After 401k contribution - $8500 ($1500/mo x 12 = $18K/year which is the max)

After tax (I'm assuming SS and medicare deductions though I don't think I'm liable for them - I'm yet to file the return on my summer internship to know if I should be getting them back and reading the tax code has been a nightmare) - $5900/mo

Rent - $2000 (this is about 10% higher than I originally intended but I can't change it now and I'm happy spending it since I'm comfortable) 
Public transport - $200
Utilities - $200

The above three are the essentials and I live fairly frugally so I think I should be able to set aside $2000/mo (at least), which leaves me $1500/mo for other expenses (I am going to do my best to stay within this budget).   

I would really appreciate it if you guys could improve my plan or trash it entirely if you see fit. 

TL;DR:
Is maximizing 401(k) (or alternatives) the best way forward if I want to cash that out to go to college again in the short term (3 years)?

If there's money leftover at the end of the month, should I push it to an IRA or keep it in liquid savings since I would want it out pretty soon?"

I was wondering about the chance of perhaps doing a very basic CS internship with just having done this Python course. Preferably, I would do a Mechanical Engineering internship, but I don't really think that will happen this summer(not enough Project experience and other things). My idea is that if I were to get a CS internship, I could use that along with other CS courses that I might take and integrate it with something that wish to go into for Mechanical Engineering as well as to see what CS work might be like. In the end, I just want to know more about possibilities of actually doing a simple programming internship (if those even exist).

In addition, I would also like to ask, how would I go about advertising my Python knowledge on my resume other than just putting it under skills?"

I'm currently a sophomore undergrad in college majoring in CS. I was wondering if I have any other options (other than taking classes) for the summer if I don't get into a summer internship.

If you guys think a coding bootcamp or similar is a good option, are there any you would recommend (there's so many options)? Thanks very much!

Edit: Oh yeah, if a bootcamp, I would prefer something intensive/full-time.

Just the idea of having to invent some story makes me nervous. The description also said stuff about being present information and key findings to internal and external audiences. Like just that intimidates the hell out of me because I don't have many good experiences with public speaking. I keep feeling discouraged by how important social skills and being comfortable with public speaking seems to be to hold down a job.

44fegq,18,2016-02-06,Best friend [28 M] of about 7 years suddenly stopped all contact with me [27 F],naniazalea,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44fegq/best_friend_28_m_of_about_7_years_suddenly/,"Hello friends. First time posting here, hope I’m doing it right. I’m having issues with my best friend and it’s kind of breaking my heart.

My closest friend has basically been the only constant person in my life since college. We met at interns at a company we both worked at. He’s seen me through all life changes since then, graduation, losing jobs and getting new ones, moves, a big breakup, a new relationship, getting married, etc. I know we were always very different in terms of communication. He thrives on alone time and I always benefited from company. He’s very introverted whereas I generally need more time with people, but we always had a great time together. We have a lot of shared interests, and both work in the same industry - our biggest shared passion, and our careers. We've had many late night playing video games, stupid laughs, drunken shenanigans, and nice long talks over many pots of tea, but both of us have dealt with a lot of depression and spent a lot of late nights talking about it. He was always hard to get a hold of. Our friendship has definitely been 98% initiated by me and I was always pretty okay with that. I think that’s who he is. He never reaches out to anyone, they have to reach out to him, but when they do he seems to like getting out.

As time goes on he just wants to talk less and less, and hang out less and less. Lately when I've reached out and said I needed someone to talk to, he said “Unless it's urgent, I'm not feeling it.” He's dealing with fairly complicated emotional weight of his own, and seeing a therapist. He used to need to talk about his problems a lot, but as time goes on, he feels more and more like keeping to himself, and doesn’t want to hear as much about mine either. I think about him almost every day and worry about how he’s doing, but I refrain from writing him because I know he’s less talkative than I am. I sent him a care package a while back with toys, candy, tea, and treats when he was going through a bad time, and a note telling him I was there for him. He told me it was the most thoughtful thing anyone had done for him. So I think he appreciates knowing someone thinks about him… he just doesn’t communicate it.

Recently, I felt pretty insecure recently about the fact he was rejecting a lot of invitations to talk and hang out. We made plans for a little weekend trip, but he bailed a few days before, and while I was off for the weekend, I saw a picture on Facebook of him out at the bar with other friends. I felt like maybe he bailed because he just didn't want to be around me. I started worrying that maybe he doesn’t like me anymore; my husband told me not to start making assumptions before talking to my friend and setting it straight. He was right. As I went to send my friend a text to ask him to talk, I scrolled a bit through our text history and saw just how one sided it was. It made me feel stupid, like after these years maybe I just haven't taken a hint, maybe he just doesn't want to deal with me. I considered just leaving him alone and waiting to see if he would reach out to me on his own. My husband said “Don't do that, he's depressed and he might not have the energy to reach out to people, he may rely on people reaching out to him for social contact.”

So I wrote him a long, honest letter. I said I was a little worried that he wasn’t doing okay since I’ve seen him so little lately. I told him he's my best friend and one of the people I love most, even though we communicate differently, and I'll be there for him at the drop of a hat no matter what. I told him I'm feeling insecure and worrying that he doesn't really want to spend time with me, that I worry this friendship is one-sided; that I have the sinking feeling that I'm not important to him. I said I would love for him to tell me this is all an overreaction, but but I promised I would give him space if I was overwhelming him and he didn’t want to be around me, and wouldn’t hold it against him. I told him that no matter what he says to me, he’ll always have a friend on-call whenever he needs me. I told him he is irreplaceable and extremely important to me, and that if there was anything I could do to help him through his depression, I would do it in a heartbeat.

Weeks have passed since I sent it. Not a word. I haven't said anything to him since sending him the letter, aside from a group invite to an anniversary dinner for my husband and I, which he ignored for two weeks and then declined last minute. I don’t think anything really horrible has happened to him, because I haven’t heard bad news from mutual friends who work with him. I see him log on skype every week still for a scheduled weekly video game session with other friends. I saw a couple photos tagged on facebook, but other than that not much social media activity.

I'm trying to remember not to take it personally. I'm almost 99% sure he's not thinking ill of me, he just has too much on his mind, and there's no room for me. It's just a shame that after our years of adventures, shenanigans, bonding and laughs, there doesn't seem to be room left for me there. I really wanted to be important to him. I really wanted to make his life better and impact him positively, but I feel like I'm just fading out of it, and I'll just be in his past.

I’m a little heartbroken that there’s no response. I assume he’s going through a lot and can’t deal with my drama now, but I still wish he just acknowledged that he even got it (I sent it both via email and IM, I’ve seen him online since, but he says nothing.) I’m going to leave him alone until he reaches out to me. If he never contacts me again… I guess I’ll take a hint and leave him be.

Is that the right thing to do? Am I giving him space he needs, or am I abandoning him? I don’t know how to tell. I wish he would tell me. I want to do the best thing for him but I don’t know what it is. My heart is also breaking about the idea of my best friend just fading from my life quietly, without a goodbye. Maybe I was draining his energy; I need closer friendships with more time and attention, he needs alone time, and maybe me requesting to hang out every week was too much for him. Maybe we were just never really compatible friends.

   
**tl;dr**: Best friend was starting to communicate less. I wrote a letter to ask if he’s okay, told him I’m there for him, told him I’m feeling insecure, like maybe he doesn’t want me around. Asked him if he wants space, or if I should keep reaching out to him. Haven’t heard a single word from him since (about 4 weeks), he ignored my letter and an invite to me/my husband’s anniversary dinner. I'm assuming he doesn't want to talk to me, so I haven’t written him since then, and I won’t write him until he writes me. Am I doing the right thing by giving him the space he might need, or am I abandoning a friend?

44fj1l,1,2016-02-06,Should I risk my internship to get a better internship?,kayla56,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/44fj1l/should_i_risk_my_internship_to_get_a_better/,"Sorry, this is kind of a dumb question.

I applied to a bunch of different internships and I had a phone interview. Two months later the phone interview boss A calls me for an in-person interview at internship A.

I had a sudden interview invitation a couple of days ago and the boss asked me to start on Monday at internship A. But since I hadn't heard from them in so long I'd already been invited for an interview on Tuesday, at Internship B. They scheduled it for 11:30 so I was thinking of taking an early lunch break and going to Internship B, but do you guys think this is too risky?

Internship A is full time. That's good because I need at least 120 hours work experience. But it's a problem because my boss was trying to convince me to commit to continuing to work unpaid after the first three weeks (which I don't want to do). Internship B has a small salary. They're both start ups-- A is a photo sharing app (which I'm not really behind as a concept since there is nothing different about it) and B is a health juice brand.

I'm not 100% sure Job A is the right cultural fit for me. Especially since the boss of Internship A is trying to convince me to do web design things when I'm not as interested/skilled/competent in that area and it was advertised as graphic design. One of my friends works downstairs though so that is a plus.

Internship A seems really disorganised. But it's in an office with lots of different companies so I guess it might be good for networking.

The risk I'm taking is leaving Internship A early for my interview at B, getting in trouble/fired, and then maybe not getting internship B.

The thing is since these internships are unpaid(A)/low paid(B) (I need to do intern/professional experienc eto complete my degree for uni) I'm still keeping my casual job at the movies working night hours to make ends meet. So on Tuesday I have to leave early at 4pm anyway to get to my night shift. I feel awkward since I already agreed to the time at Internship B in advance.

What would you do in this situation?"

Na het aftreden van voorzitter /u/Vylander lijkt het erop dat links de Staten-Generaal van alle kanten gaat domineren. Eerst de Secretaris-Generaal, nu ook de nieuwe Voorzitter die zonder enige twijfel /u/Keijeman zal zijn. /u/Vylander, voormalig leider van de PVV en fractievoorzitter van de VVD, liet zich positief uit over zijn vervanger maar liet ook doorschemeren dat de linkse overmacht hem  “lichtelijk zorgen gaven”. Toch zijn er een aantal andere ontwikkelingen die uiteindelijk voor de terugkeer van de LPF hebben gezorgd.**

Sinds het aantreden van het ‘Kameleon Kabinet’ zitten de rechtse partijen niet echt lekker in de Kamer. Het rechtse geluid van de PVV zijn ze kwijt, die hebben hun ziel verkocht aan een linkse koers met af en toe een rechts sausje. Het gedwongen oppositie voeren met D66 ligt bij velen ook niet lekker, en enige tijd was er zelfs sprake van een cordon sanitaire jegens de Democraten over een aantal vermeende uitspraken van partijleider /u/MTFD. Toch bleef het rommelen bij de rechtse partijen, het CDA had lang last van interne problemen en partijleider /u/Roenmane kwam zelfs terug van zijn pensioen om weer actieve taken op zich te nemen ondanks zijn persoonlijke situatie. Het blijkt maar weer dat de echte rechtse Nederlandse politici toch wel goed begaan zijn met ons land. De Piraten Partij, voorheen een voornamelijk linkse partij, ging na de laatste verkiezingen een rechtse koers varen en is tegenwoordig een bijna libertarische fractie. Toch was het daar intern ook een rommeltje, met massale leegloop door de nieuwe partijkoers. De grootste rechtse partij, de VVD, had intern ook wat problemen maar leek zich altijd stevig te houden. Maar zelfs daar bleken de scheuren groter dan zij op het oppervlakte leken, zo leek de fractievoorzitter het vaak oneens met de meningen van zijn collega’s. Van buiten werd hier weinig van gemerkt maar /u/Vylander liet zich er vaak over uit hoe hij een meer “liberale koers” wilde varen.

Een halve maand geleden kwam opeens de terugkeer van de voormalige leider van de VVD, /u/Jekkert. Hij riep op tot een nieuw geluid in de Nederlandse politiek en wist al snel de aandacht te krijgen van /u/Vylander. De twee oude bekenden gingen in het diepste geheim om tafel zitten en maakten al snel een plan op voor een nieuwe partij. Op dat moment verscheen ook de beruchte zetelroofwet en zo werden de heren het er al snel over eens dat het tijd werd om een oud liberaal en uniek politiek geluid terug te brengen: de Lijst Pim Fortuyn. Waar voorheen deze partij getergd werd door interne conflicten, een gebrek aan structuur en het ontbreken van sterk visionair leiderschap leek het nu voorspoediger te gaan. /u/Jekkert nam de rol van partijleider op zich terwijl /u/Vylander zijn traditionele rol als tweede man aannam, achter de schermen ging hij hard werken om de partij alvast te laten groeien.

Zo gebeurde het dat /u/Vylander om tafel kwam met de leider van het CDA, /u/Roenmane, de twee hadden al vaak contact gehad en uitgebreid samen gewerkt. Het werd dan ook snel duidelijk dat het CDA op zou gaan in de nieuwe LPF. Daarna ging de toekomstige fractievoorzitter om tafel met /u/xx253xx. Ook /u/xx253xx was wel warm te maken voor een wederkering van Fortuyn’s gedachtegoed. Als laatste wist de nieuwe LPF achter de schermen nog het fiscale brein van de VVD aan te trekken als een ‘waarnemend lid’, /u/SprUtch gaat zich samen met de echte partijleden storten op een rechts fiscaal beleid in lijn met het gedachtegoed van Fortuyn.

Toen de zetelroofwet dan eindelijk door de Eerste Kamer kwam met maar liefst 100% van de stemmen voor werd nog een laatste plan opgezet. De Piraten Partij gaat zich hernoemen naar Lijst Pim Fortuyn en /u/Vylander en /u/Roenmane gaan zich samen bij de nieuwe LPF aansluiten. Het is nog niet bekend of /u/Jekkert op de achtergrond blijft of een zetel gaat innemen in de Eerste Kamer. Wat wel duidelijk blijkt is dat de LPF terug is in de Nederlandse politiek en in één klap de één na grootste oppositie partij is. Met drie zetels én een senaatszetel zullen weinig partijen nog om de Lijst Pim Fortuyn heen kunnen. Toen we /u/Vylander vroegen naar het nieuwe partijprogramma wilde hij alleen zeggen dat “dit er spoedig zal aankomen”. Of de LPF een succes gaat worden moet nog blijken, maar er is in ieder geval een nieuw rechts geluid in de Nederlandse politiek.

It is extremely disheartening, and I am looking for ways to gain some real world programming experience so that I am better equipped when I graduate. I'm in the middle of an internship hunt, since that is probably the best way, but I'm looking for something I can do right now to get started.

I know the traditional advice is to look into open source contributions, but I am struggling to make sense of most of the projects that I find. My programming knowledge is pretty much just theoretical (data structures, polymorphism, etc.), and all of the different files and dependencies make very little sense to me. Is there any source that I could look to to learn about all of the different files and parts that generally make up a system? (My internet searches haven't turned up anything useful)

Thanks!"

I hesitated to open this thread, but I think that your advice would greatly help me here. I will give you as much info as I can.

I don't know where to begin. I'm from Spain and looking for a job. So far I rejected 2 offers that sucked (a while ago, when I still hadn't been demoralized by 2 months of fruitless job hunt) and now I'm in a bind with this one.

I don't intend to discuss personal issues in here since it's just not the place to do so, but let's say for context that I have trouble at home, more serious than you might imagine, and I'm heavily pressured to leave my parents house.

I've been preparing for this job hunt for years now while on my last 2 college years, doing internships (1yr), a personal portfolio of mobile and web apps, Open Source contributions to a large well known project, and Stack Overflow contributions. I know there are more people like this but I actually expected this effort to make things easy and I'm really disappointed.

I have a 6 months gap on my resume after graduating due to a medical issue which is probably a dead weight.

Our field is known to be lucrative, I've worked my ass off in order to be a strong candidate, and I wish for a job that allows me to rent a tiny flat of my own with a company that sounds legit, that's all.

Now to this offer I got now: from a vc funded startup, 17,000€ a year before taxes in Valencia, a relatively low COL city, with the promise of 21,000€ a year in 6 months. I think it's an insult, and probably wouldn't even allow me to live on my own. But man I'm so pressured to take something. For more info, in the interview the guys sounded like they think they are hot shit for offering a job in a city with a shitty scene, and I don't trust them. I have to respond next Monday maximum or they call someone else instead. A friend says to just tell them the minimum amount of money I'm willing to take since I don't want the job anyway, another friend says to accept it and keep looking even if I leave within a month.

For more context, I'm getting 1-3 calls a week, but in the end, only 3 shitty offers so far. The 'good' ones won't make me an offer. I'm mainly applying to startups if that matters. I'm through 4 hiring processes, 2 of which probably went silent.

The question here is, what do you think are my chances of it ending up well if I reject this, and what would you do?"

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hinting at the curves of my breasts, the thin white blouse beneath it visible at the top.

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I'm known for being strict and controlling to those under me, and I enjoy it.

You're going to put my in my place. Make me your bitch.

Maybe you're the head of the company that just bought mine, maybe you're my secretary who's had enough of my bitching at her, maybe you're a competitor who seduces me into giving you control.

Maybe you're the young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage, only to have the tables turned on me.

Will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question?

Or maybe you'll make me the company slut - spreading my legs to help close business deals.

Or maybe you just make me your secretary, responsible for keeping the whole office happy.

I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, most other things are welcome.

I am currently in a PhD program in the psychological sciences, but I have a BS in computer science. My plan is to leave my program at the end of this semester with an MA, then try to get a job in software development. The problem is that I've been in academia for my entire adult life, and I'm not sure how make my skillset and experience appeal to potential employers. 

I have a BS in computer science and won a number of academic awards as an undergrad, and I have a couple years experience in a non-CS, but still fairly technical, subfield of psychology (computational modeling). The big problem, however, is that my non-academic experience amounts to a single summer internship in software development a few years ago. (I liked it but thought my calling was in academia.) Sure, I've programmed in Java, C#, C++, R, MATLAB, and Python, but (almost) always in a small-scale, academic setting, and my lack of experience makes me pretty nervous not only about how my resume will look to employers, but also about any interviews that I may land down the road. 

Any tips on what I should include or highlight on my resume? Other general advice for someone in my situation? "

I am just graduated and before starting all kinds of long term commitments I'd love to make a solo trip to the USA.
I am 22 years old, and I have my driving license, but hiring a car for 3 months is very expensive. This kind of limits the distances I can travel, but it also poses a interesting challenge.


Some general information:

- I have 3 months to spend (limit of the Visa Waiver Programme)
- My budget is around 7500/8000 dollars
- Have experience with solo travel (internship europe, solo trip to Detroit)

I think I like to see the East Coast the most, especially Boston, NYC, Washington, Philly, Pittsburg.. But I am not really sure where to start or what would be a good itinerary. I don't really want to have a set-out plan, just more go with the flow and see these cities, but I am not sure if that is a smart approach in the USA.

I'd like to hear your thoughts!

Advice/Help Appreciated!!,Cyberfighter03,cyber_security,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyber_security/comments/44itps/new_to_the_field_of_cybersecurity_completely_lost/,"So, I am completely new to the field of cyber/information security. I understand that it is a very vague term. I graduated with a BA in History and minors in Biology and Chemistry. I was enrolled in a medical school in the caribbeans but realized that my chances are slim to none if I am going to continue pursuing medicine. I want to switch tracks before it is too late. I love technology, love messing around with my computers yadda yadda yadda.. I have experience of coding in C++ and VB and A+ ages ago but need a fresher.. I am 27 y/o and I know its a bit late but I have currently enrolled in UMUC's cybersecurity BS program. Since I don't really have any clue of how the field operates, I figured that a BS would be more effective than an MS. I am specifically interested in doing penetration testing and working my way up to becoming a Information Security Analyst from where I can expand on my horizon years down the road. I plan on gaining Net+, Sec+ and A+ certs about 6 months down the road with my BS.

What would be some advice you would give this noob on how to get my foot in and what jobs should I be looking for. I've heard an array of people suggest help desk jobs and working your way up but are there any other alternatives? I've been looking for internships, but it seems I might be too old for that as they want undergrads more than often and not career switchers like me. What do I do to self-educate myself (coursera, udemy, etc) and get a foot into an IT job?? Any advice would be completely appreciated... I am so lost"

* She laughs at almost everything I say. I'm not talking chuckles, I'm talking red face, tears.
* She notices and comments on my clothes or haircut
* On mondays she makes a note to tell me how her weekend was and can't wait to show me something (today it was a picture of a dog she is sitting and a movie ticket she found that fell out of my pocket into her car).
* She doesn't talk to anyone else really but me. Speaking of that she IMs me all day at work. When not talking in person, we hold conversations through the IM all day about w/e. Usually picking on eachother. Mostly on how picky of an eater I am, and she says to stick with her and I'll learn to like all sorts of foods. Like she loves werthers originals, and I make fun that they're old people candy, but she tosses me one every couple of hours. Today I saw she had a note saying ""get more old people candy"". She told me to try some sort of food and then she brought it in for me.
* She remembers EVERYTHING I say. Like I mentioned something in passing weeks ago and she remembered it today. She also puts a lot of stock in what I say, I mentioned my favorite movie once and she instantly wrote it down to watch it/look it up. Which I thought was a little strange, but a few days prior we were out to lunch and a song came on and of course shazam wouldn't work. Bugged me the whole rest of the day that I couldn't think of the name of it. Next day I came in and a note was on my keyboard saying the name of the song. I asked about and she goes ""I was laying down to go to bed and it came to me, so I googled the lyrics and set a reminder in my phone to tell you"". I tell her girls painting their nails is a waste of $, days later she asks me, ""so it would be silly to paint my nails? Or what color do you think I should get?""
* I mentioned that I went to a fancy restaurant and her immediate response was with who, gf? I said no she keeps asking over and over who then, not even like she knows anyone I know.
* I mention my 2 favortie songs and she wrote them down to listen to them.
* We were at happy hour with some coworkers and someone mentioned did you see what x said on facebook? And I go no, no offense but i'd never add any of you guys on facebook I like to keep work and personal separate. 2 days letter she IMs me and goes ""so if I added you on facebook you wouldn't accept me?""
* She is very open and honest with me. Tells me a lot of stuff, which idk if thats just her or not, but when I do hear her talking to other people its strictly work or very basic personal stuff. But to me I could pretty much write a rough outline of her life. Her hobbies, her insecurities, her friends, her childhood etc... 

Here is the issue though. I'm not 100%, but I'm 99.9% sure she has a bf. She has never mentioned it to me, but someone else told me she does of 5 years.......


Yes I know don't shit where you eat, but she only has 3 more weeks at my work.

So what's going on here?


At the end of the day, I'm not sure I would date her even if she didn't have a BF. My main goal in initially talking to her was to make new friends as I just moved to the city and my closest friends are 200 miles away. I'm not sure how I would even go into the close friend zone where she could introduce me to others without sending the wrong message and/or angering a possible bf. Making friends is a much bigger priority for me right now. If I ask her out and she does have a BF that's gonna kill everything I feel.
   
**tl;dr**: I think this girl likes me, but I think she has a bf. I may  just want to be friend"

I am first year student in Software Engineering (maybe that's the problem?) but I already did an associate degree in Computer Science so I am able to technically code. I've been comparing myself to second year students in University, just because I don't have any Software Engineering classes until my 4th semester (for now it's just Math courses and Engineering courses like ethics and stuff like that).

Anyways, right now I am working in a restaurant to pay tuition fees and expenses, so my plan is to get an internship during summer, quit the restaurant and live my whole school year out of those summer savings... Somehow, my plan isn't work out well so far (so I can stop working during my academic year and concentrate in my classes, GPA and stuff).

I've got only one interview but they didn't contact me afterwards. I felt it went good but I didn't have enough time to solve the technical question (I did it verbally but trying to code it made me run out of time). Other than that, nobody has called. 

I will post my Resume here so you can judge.

44j8n0,3,2016-02-06,"Me [24F] with my boyfriend [27M] of 18 months, I'm running out of ideas on dealing with our 2 body problem",Ash_Fire,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44j8n0/me_24f_with_my_boyfriend_27m_of_18_months_im/,"Hi, I'm too lazy to make a throwaway, but I'll do what I can to keep it vague. This did briefly appear on another sub, but has since been deleted. Also usual lurker, sometimes commenter, etc.

**Background:**
My boyfriend, Z, is my best friend. Without him, it feels like I've lost my right arm. We met when we worked for the same company in the city of M (I was interning). When the internship ended, I went to my next job until October, where I got another job lined up in M (or so I thought) so I could move in with  Z. The move in happened, the job did not. I went several weeks unemployed before I got something right after Halloween. 

So the issue began when he started telling me about his recruitment process with a different company in city S, which is all the way across the country. I was not the partner I should've been. Mostly, I was angry that I finally felt like I was getting back on my feet again, with a new job I really enjoy, a new project that helps my career in the way I want it go, and that it was all being tossed aside. I regret not being more supportive, because he really needed to leave the company in M.

So he got the job in S. Despite my earlier feelings, I am proud of him. With the industry we work in, it's hard to find permanent work. When he went to S for his recruitment visit, one of the top manager, A, told him they would help me find a job in S.

**The Problem:**
Z started his new job a few weeks ago, with the mutual understanding that I would follow once I got my own job lined up. (I insisted on this, because I don't want to repeat the unemployed stint I had in October.) Ideally, I'd like a job that makes a cross-country move worth it for me too, but for what I do, I'm finding largely part-time positions. I've sent out my cover letters and resumes, and have heard either nothing or they get turned off by the fact that I'm still in M. I've also reached out to A to see if they have any suggestions as to where else I should look or if they have any connections with companies that haven't returned my emails. All radio silent.

I'll admit, my feelings on the situation are being magnetized by a few things:

* There's a major job conference in M this weekend. I would attend, but there aren't any companies from the S area that I could talk to.

* One of my friends from the company I worked for over the summer keeps asking if I'm coming back this summer. I really liked working for this company, and it's in my field, but it's across the country in a different direction and would add at least 6 months to mine and Z's LDR. However, I don't want the opportunity to pass me by and have the gap in my resume bite me in the ass later.

* I *really* like my current job. It's part of why I don't want to move from M until I get the next gig lined up.

* Was A's offer to help me find work a negotiation tactic? I find their lack of communication disturbing.
   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend, Z, got a new job! I'm struggling to find my next job so I can join him. Halp!

Edit: After a very brief phone call, apparently A is also super busy at the moment, and I have been recommended to keep waiting (because what the hell else can I do at the moment). I'm so frustrated about being told to wait when there are answers to other jobs pending that might pass me by before what I say matters anymore. Is it too much to ask for a time frame of when we can have these conversations, or something acknowledging my email even if it's just to say yes, this is on our plate and we'll get to it after x,y, and z?"

44jnbz,2,2016-02-06,Can someone help me figure out what I should be doing in the coming year? (CS Major),Yearbookthrowaway1,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/44jnbz/can_someone_help_me_figure_out_what_i_should_be/,"So I'm currently a sophomore CS major, I came into UMD planning on majoring in Bio but switched to CS last semester. This has made me fall pretty far behind the curve in terms of when I will finish all my classes. I'll need to take a bunch of summer and winter classes to graduate on time. This is annoying, but I'm up for the challenge because I'm really excited about moving forward with CS. 

However, I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about the rest of my track. To stay on track I'm *supposed* to take CMSC132 and Math 141 over the summer, so I can do CMSC 216 and 250 in the fall. However, there are a few concerns that I had with doing this. The first is that my home is back in Baltimore County, not down here. Taking classes on campus would mean me taking an hour and a half drive up and down every day all summer. Obviously this is something I'd like to avoid, so I thought of the following plan. CCBC offers Calculus 2 credit that is transferable to UMD, but CMSC credits can't transfer from anywhere into UMD. Would it be a viable plan to take the Calc 2 class at CCBC alongside an equivalent CMSC course to CMSC 132, and then take the UMD placement test, or would I be dooming myself to fail the placement test this way. 

My second concern is that I was hoping to do some kind of internship this summer. But since I have basically zero coding experience besides the 2 weeks of CMSC 131 that I've had, I don't know if it's even realistic to try and do a CompSci internship so early. Do companies even want interns with so little experience? In a field with so many coding wunderkids that have been building apps since they were in diapers, I'm worried that I won't be a competitive candidate for a long time. 

What should I do? "
44jqxq,1,2016-02-06,Should I leave my current internship for one that I want more?,ltommy,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/44jqxq/should_i_leave_my_current_internship_for_one_that/,"Im currently on my first internship, its only been a month and things are going well, I enjoy it here. Im signed for 8 months ending in fall.

I went to a career fair session and got my resume in to one of my dream companies and they called me but they said they were looking for summer interns only. Since I told them I was not available for the summer, the screening was cut short and I was told to look out for opportunities in the future if im still interested. 

Of course im interested! But I risk ruining relationships with my current company, upheaving my progress in my school's co op program, and its back to square one. This is just my first internship so I feel like I shouldnt take it for granted, but theres always that pressure to ""chase your dreams"". Now that I have the opportunity to live my dreams the risk is too high, its just bad timing for me.

What would you do?"
44k1ug,9,2016-02-06,Is it possible to get a decent internship working on Android programming without having too much Android experience?,Blitzcranker77,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44k1ug/is_it_possible_to_get_a_decent_internship_working/,Many of my friends have had internships where their projects consisted of working with languages and technology they've never really used before. It seems very rewarding though because by the end of their internship they have learned A LOT more than if they were just using technology they already knew. Is it possible to get an Android Development Internship without having much Android experience (but of course having a pretty strong background in Java and a strong background in overall computer science and engineering)?

I heard that the other big companies like Microsoft and Google mostly have fall internships just based on a case by case need. I've heard of other smaller tech companies with many Fall Co/Op and internship opportunities. Are there any tech companies offering great internships (such as Facebook) for the fall? For any of these companies, would it be easier to get an internship in the fall than in the summer, since the number of applicants would be much smaller?"
44k63o,0,2016-02-07,I'm terrified I'm not good enough for this,bobthrowmcshame,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44k63o/im_terrified_im_not_good_enough_for_this/,"I'm absolutely terrified. Long story short, I had a rough 3 years in University. Very rough. I originally studied Physics and failed 9 courses in the course of 3 years and currently am trying to transition into programming.


I have one shot at this, I need good grades so I can fully switch my major over but I'm struggling so hard... the assignments are so difficult for me besides being an introductory course. I google, stackoverflow, tutorialspoint, youtube everything and can't fathom or grasp any of the concepts. 


I'm terrified, stressed and am at the edge and can't help but ask if I'm really good at anything. If I'm really suited for coding. I can't handle introductory level code and here I set an internship as my goal in the summer.


Please, help me get to where I want to be. What should I do?"
44k7lb,15,2016-02-07,"Graduate this May, having rejections on resume coming left and right. No internship experience(had to run a family business)",Ani10,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44k7lb/graduate_this_may_having_rejections_on_resume/,"A little summary about myself ! I’m a computer science student who graduates this May and has always been interested in business. It’s one of the reasons I got an Associates in Business Management but now I feel I should have just gone into CS and then got a MBA but anyways! My knowledge from my associates has helped so much with my current job.

My goal in life has always been to become a project manager. Ever since I was 18 I have been aiming for this position and have studied this and prepared for graduation to try to obtain this position. I currently work for a small business(my family business) and have developed it from a small taco truck into a 2,000 square foot restaurant. It took me 3 years, when the owners have been trying to achieve that for 10 years. I was able to obtain over 500k loan for the business expansion. I did it by using data mining, and web development and social media marketing to reach the customer base that i felt the City restaurants weren’t aiming at. I have tripled the daily sales since I took over. The restaurant building is currently in the building process. 

As a computer Science student I have worked with clients and have developed applications based to their needs. I love working with customers and showing them what I came up with to fulfill their needs. I love developing a website by just wire framing it first, and talking to the customer what I envisioned for their project and get their input. I’m currently doing this for my senior project. I deal with the client and also developing. I’m working in a team of 5.

Anyways, I want to show my potential employers that I have always been goal oriented. That I really, really want to obtain an entry level position for project management so I began studying for the CAPM exam. I have completed the course hours but my certification exam isn’t until Spring break due to taking 22 credit hours.


The following are below:


[Resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/7gweouhd650)

What is going to happen with the business:


My sister is now going to college and plans on going into business. I have automated most of hte data mining, and just plan on getting out of it. I had a few internship offers but it was during the time of obtaining the loan. I had to put the business before the internship. Now that I have achieved the task of building it into a restaurant. I plan on getting out of it.

I am still a sophomore without significant personal projects so internships are not exactly falling out of trees (although not totally out of the question) but I thought this looked like it would be a generally good program, even though there is a fee.

She was the first girl that I trusted as much as I trusted my family and my best friends. And looking back, sure, it was an unhealthy relationship that I'm glad ended, but one thing she did was shatter that armor and left me to try and mend it.

If it makes any sense, I disarmed myself so quickly that the armor broke, and now I feel off balance in my day-to-day interactions. I never used to have a problem compartmentalizing my feelings and separating emotions from decisions, but now I seem to be in a haze. In certain aspects I still don't give a fuck and am protected, but on the other cracks where I'm exposed, I am quick to display vulnerability.

The one thing that shows that the whole thing fucked me up is that, with any girl after her, when things started out all right, I'd be fine and I'd be very happy with the way things are going. But the moment that there's any uncertainty, I am quick to start and wean myself from them, almost a natural gut reaction to never wanting to feel hurt again.

I'm currently three dates into one of the coolest women I've ever met. Great conversation, slow romance, nothing like the quick flare flings I've been having for the past few years. Someone that I currently think may be great for long-term potential. Half of me craves something like that, and wants to be vulnerable and have a true healthy relationship.

So I may have been too eager. I already helped her get an internship in her field for this summer, and took her on three amazing, long dates where I really pulled out the stops. When I had to unexpectedly go overseas for two weeks between date one and two, we still were talking really well. That's how good the chemistry is. We even made plans for Valentine's Day two weeks in advance.

But I'm used to faster romance; we've only shared some kisses, nothing even that deep. I tried to escalate and she stopped me, though she's still shown affection. But it's triggered something inside me: does she only see me as a more platonic companion, or is she just conservative? Am I fucking up and putting myself into that position? And so on and so forth.

This weekend, she said she had some stuff coming up and that she would be too busy to meet up, but had an hour or two to grab a coffee. I told her that I was also busy and we could hang out next week instead. She said that it sounded good. I texted her today in the morning hoping that she got through the day well and whether she knew how the beginning of her week was looking. She didn't text back all day.

I know I'm overthinking everything. I know that she'll probably text me back tomorrow and tell me she was busy. I know that I'm overreacting and being super clingy. I know that even if she doesn't text me back, whatever, it's only three dates in and I'll find another super awesome chick in this big city that I live in.

But what I'm more worried about is my gut reaction. Why am I so quick to protect myself with faulty armor? Should I just take it all off, or wait until it's fully repaired? Why am I so scared to get hurt? Why do I put myself in this position? Is there anything I can do?

So now I'm in my head again. Help."
44l4rh,4,2016-02-07,"I've been invited to a lunch meeting with a company that had accepted me for summer internship 2 months ago. Is there anything I should be careful of, or remember to do during the meeting?",McFiddlyWiddly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44l4rh/ive_been_invited_to_a_lunch_meeting_with_a/,"It's part funny, part creepy. They initially asked me to come over for the meeting with the partners on the same day/time as the career fair at my college. Which is strange because I met this company at the same career fair last fall, and they're sending some people to the career fair this time too. They had to know that I'd go to the career fair. 

Over around 10 emails, I rescheduled the time of the meeting, so we're now going to meet in the morning and finish barely in time for the career fair. Which is ok.

Despite the fact that they said that they had accepted me for the internship in December, I have not yet received any details concerning the internship. I guess this is what the meeting is about. But the meeting scheduling was a very uncomfortable experience for me, and leaves me wary about the company (despite the fact that it's a big company).

I'm scared that I'll feel so uncomfortable that I'd say yes on the spot, even though I need more time to decide. The partners are flying in for a single day to do other stuff, but also meet with me. Which was a weird thing to mention to me in the emails, but whatever.

Any advice on how to handle the meeting? How to phrase things like needing more time to decide, or how to react at good/bad details?

I'll probably end up saying no anyways to the offer, but I need to maintain good relations because I'll definitely consider them for full-time position next year, and want them to still like me.

Over these 2 years, I've become a less confident stress ball all of the time. I don't really know what I should do to fix this. Part of this may be that I'm too hard on myself or that I just don't want to disappoint anyone with my code or its delivery.

My sister is in her 1st year of law school and is upset that she feels ""under dressed"" when it comes to makeup and appearance of her peers. She will have her first law internship this summer and has asked me for help with some basic makeup for work. 

She basically has no makeup at all other than a NARS Audacious Lipstick in Charlotte (a gift), and a mascara. On a daily basis she prefers no makeup, and doesn't like to wear it, except for the fact that she needs to wear it for work (she feels).


About her:

* Question/Concern: Makeup need for 'professional' setting for a total beginner looking for simple makeup kit
* Skin Type: Dry
* Skin Color: NC40 - 45 (Medium/Dark Complexion Warm Undertones)
* Budget: $200 - $250
* Her Makeup Experience (1 - 10): 1 

I was thinking:

* Maybelline the Falsies in Brown-Black (it's waterproof and brown is more natural)
* A nude lipstick (MAC Creme in your Coffee?? MAC Twig??)
* A red lipstick (Urban Decay Revolution Sheer F-bomb? or something classic instead??)
* ABH Tinted Brow Gel
* An under eye concealer (she gets dark under eye circles -- Maybe YSL Le Teint Touch Eclat Concealer Pen or some other easily applied product)

Any products you would suggest?

What you guys recommend?

44n7bt,7,2016-02-07,First tech interview next week; whiteboarding involved help!,Caitlinmitcheem,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44n7bt/first_tech_interview_next_week_whiteboarding/,"Hi, I'm having my first in-person CS interview at Goldman Sachs next week (YAY) and I'm incredibly nervous. I woke up fairly confident since I rocked the phone interview two weeks ago, but I cracked open ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" and attempted some of the problems spurring some nervousness. 

I was wondering how much ""coding"" is actually involved during whiteboarding? Would the interviewer expect me to write out the entire code or just bits and pieces? Should I start out with a list of the steps I would undergo to solve the problem and then jump into coding? This also leads into my next couple questions. 

I'm in the beginning of my second year of CS and I took Algorithms and Data Structures last semester, but I don't quite remember all of the code for these structures. I know how I would go about solving a problem, say a determine if there's a palindrome in a linkedlist problem and could explain it fairly well. I also remember the time/space complexities of these structures, but I cannot remember how to write the code for these structures.  

I also learned these structures in Java, but my current course load is working with C. I'm terrified that along the line I'll end up switching up the code (for example,  accidentally make pointers if I'm writing in java.  I know I'm probably freaking out for no reason, but I was wondering if anyone had any tips for me to recall these structures and prepare for my whiteboarding interview.

44nbka,2,2016-02-07,"Me [18 M] with my Girlfriend[18 F] of two years, LDR possible long term compatibility issues",throwoshit1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44nbka/me_18_m_with_my_girlfriend18_f_of_two_years_ldr/,"Just a little background to start out. She is going to school 7 hours away from me and we are both Freshmen in college. I live two hour from our hometown and we visit about once a month to see each other with our one long stay being winter break of one month. I'm doing internships during the summer, so we don't have that.

Background on her and I (personality). She is a very caring person, who loves volunteering and playing tennis. She doesn't have too many hobbies outside of hanging out with friends. Her major is Speech and hearing. I am a more active person, who likes powerlifting, tricking (a type of gymnastics), gaming, and I love learning. I don't have too many hobbies outside of lifting and gaming. My major is Mechanical Engineering.

I was very weary of going into a long distance relationship, but I'm now 6 months into one. We still get to keep up fairly well, but I see no end in sight until she's done with her Masters program. Due to my financial status, I can't move near her and she has been adamant that she will not move closer under any circumstance. Being away for that long with hardly anytime of seeing her for 5 years... That's my first and main worry.

Next, as I've stressed I'm very serious about my health and powerlifting, while I don't think everyone needs to lift or anything; I think everyone should be healthy. Here's where the problems come. She loves eating unhealthy food and doesn't want to cut back at all or go to the gym to counteract her habits of eating badly. In life I really don't want someone who is overweight and constantly eating horrible. Should this be a deal breaker? I love her for her personality, but between the long distance for 5 years and her not wanting a similar life style to me I don't know if it's worth it. 

Also something I hate admitting; I'm not sexually attracted to her much if at all. If it's like that at 18 how will it be at 25 or 30 or even 50. Obviously intercourse isn't everything and it's about the connection, but I don't know. That's definitely not a big priority. I just figured I would add the information.

Just as a side note. I'm not saying all women need to be skinny or the pinnacle of beauty, but I greatly value health and physical fitness. It's just my preference and I understand most people will gain weight with age, but people should at least try.

Just tell me if you need anymore information. I really don't know what to do.

   
**tl;dr**: 2 year relationship with LDR for 5 years more and no less. She does not want the same healthy lifestyle as me and hasn't taken any steps to try. Is it worth continuing? Am I wasting time?"

44nf0h,1,2016-02-07,"Me [25 M] 3 months out from getting broken up with by my exGF [22 F] after a 2 year relationship, still can't get over it, I feel like the issues that came up were just temporary hurdles. Really just ranting.",whatamidoing11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44nf0h/me_25_m_3_months_out_from_getting_broken_up_with/,"We had an absolutely amazing relationship for two years in my opinion, and even when it ended it was not because of any dishonesty or cheating or lying or ""the passion dying"" or any of that.  Really just one thing - she felt that I wasn't spending enough time with her and sometimes was prioritizing family events over doing things with her.

I had never really been in a relationship before her, and it took some life-restructuring to kind of wrap my head around what it meant to have a girlfriend.  I simply was not used to hanging out with anyone really more than once a week.  Personality wise I'm a stereotypical reddit kind of guy - video games, engineering, alternative rock, etc... I kind of grew up liking my alone time.

To add a little more stress to see this, I come from a family that's almost a clone of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"".  I have a giant immigrant family that is always in each others lives.  I have things to do every other weekend, whether it's this cousin's communion or helping this uncle with a home improvement project.  We're the kind of people that have family dinners every day, no exceptions.

She comes from what I guess is a pretty normal American family that is still close, but not to the maybe suffocating degree that mine is.  To add to that, her previous relationships were with people from her high school, one of them being 5 years long.  She is very much used to the ""drive over all the time and pop in and say hi"" type of relationship from that, except she lives a little over half an hour away from me.

After the whirlwind first few months, these ""attention"" issues did come up.  I was really not enjoying my job at the time and feeling that sort of existential despair of wanting to do something with my life, so I was using all my free time to patent my side invention, or get a band together to play in some local bars, things along that line.  I was becoming obsessed with being productive, and I started feeling bogged down by seeing her even 3-4 days a week.  The way I looked at it was that if I go see her after work on a weekday and hang out with her until 11 or so, that was a day wasted in pursuing my dream, which almost every motivational ""follow your dreams"" thing tells you to avoid.  It really was a sick way of looking at life and made her start to feel like a chore.

The thing was, through all this I still loved the time I spent with her.  I'd usually grumble as I'd drive to see her, and grumble when I checked the time on the way out, but while we were together, I really was having the time of life, experiencing love for the first time ever, laughing and having good times that I can't imagine ever having with anyone ever again.  I don't have to go into details because it'll sound cliche anyway, but inside jokes and cuddling, it was just amazing.  But I guess she felt threatened that I had these other priorities I was trying to do and kept trying to make me stay later when we were together to make up for it, getting upset if I was falling asleep or trying to leave before 2 AM on a weekend.

She went straight from her undergrad to grad school, and at the same time I started grad school, with an amazing internship at a great company.  Now we were both poor busy grad students, living at home.  Because her part time job that she was supporting herself with was at odd hours, sometimes at night, she missed out on a lot of my random family events, like if my grandma invited us all over for dinner or something.  Eventually this happened enough that she started feeling like I was putting my family before her, culminating in a bizarre point where I was invited to a family wedding with no plus one.  I offered to call to ask about it but she had to work that night anyway, so I went, feeling very guilty and knowing that it caused another issue between us, since there was a night I lost of doing homework that would then have to come out of ""us"" time.  That sort of thing happened too often, just by the nature of my big family and our schedules.  

The family thing probably contributed a bit too, as my family is very adamant about having to all go to church together or having to be together for this or that event.  I definitely stood up a little to my parents in missing family things to hang out with my girlfriend, but coming from her completely different background, it probably looked like it wasn't much.  I'm really not the type of person to rock the boat too much, and I honestly believe, and told her many times, that I was just trying to keep to peace while I lived at home, and when I did move out, I would become more independent.

I guess in terms of personality, our main difference was that she was very much a cute romantic dreamer while I was the realistic numbers crunching engineer.  This girl was an absolute 10 and unabashedly girly, feminine, innocent and sweet in every way.  She loved Pinterest and Facebook and Twitter quotes about being in love and falling in love and romance movies and flowers and crying and everything related to love.  It was really hard seeing all our friends go on cruises and vacations and stuff while we couldn't even coordinate our schedules to do something like that with how busy we were.

In the end it was just a continuation of these issues which led her to start becoming spiteful towards my family.  We started counting the days of the week we were hanging out.  She kept saying that she didn't feel like I was giving her enough attention, etc...  I felt bad.  From my end, literally never having had something like this, texting someone 50 times a day, phone calls, hanging out (to me) all the time, making her little crafts, writing letters, buying flowers, I honestly think I was a pretty attentive boyfriend.  I mean, I had months go by where I didn't do anything besides see her and do schoolwork.  I mean no video games, no reading or playing music or anything.  On the other hand, this girl who, for basically all of high school had a boyfriend over every day, and in any period of being single, has become inundated with being hit on, she felt a little lonely and bored when I was doing my things.

It's just so frustrating, I tried hard, she tried hard, but I felt like it was the circumstances that did us in.  I know eventually when I move out, I'll be much more free and available.  I am looking forward to doing that and being more independent and not having a social schedule dictated by my huge family.  I really hope that I can one day get in a groove with my life and hobbies and settle down with a family.  But I just feel so broken now.  Objectively, everything else is going great.  I'm acing my masters studies, doing very well at my internship, my invention is in the process of being patented, and I'm spending my weekends preparing it to be manufactured, and playing music with my friends.  It's literally everything I thought I wanted when I was in a relationship, except now I just miss her so much.  Whenever I hit a milestone, I can't believe I can't tell her about it.  Even if she felt I was too focused on that sort of stuff, she always supported and rooted for me.  I feel like I'd give it all up now to go back to my boring job and just hang out with her everyday after work and have one of those ""inseparable relationships"".

But since things didn't really end for a nasty reason, and more with crying than yelling, I'm hoping that one day we can get back together.  I really feel like breaking up gave me more perspective on what's important in life.  I really don't want to be one of these successful yet depressed guys with a broken family life and no one to love.  I'd rather be a schlub with a boring job and a loving relationship.  I know by reading this you can probably tell things I was wrong with or things she was wrong with.  I'm just curious at what people think.

**tl;dr**: Just ranting about loving my ex girlfriend."

44ntiq,3,2016-02-07,"Moving to LA in 6~12 months, looking to build resume. What certs should I get?",TheNoLifeKing,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/44ntiq/moving_to_la_in_612_months_looking_to_build/,"I've been working in computers for the last 4 years at places like staples, geek squad and other companies for internships for about 4 months at a time during the summer season of every year, and would stop when I would go back to school.

I just graduated with an associates degree and I was able to land a spot as the IT administrator at a small company with 30ish employees. 

This has really showed me how much I don't know and what school or working in on consumer level computers didn't prepare me for. 

At this job I've had to learn everything on the fly about Networking, VMware’s ESXi and Windows Server 2012 among other things. It's been difficult, and I might even go as far as to say I am under qualified, but I've been learning a lot quickly and the experience I'm getting is amazing.

Even though at this point I feel like I have a strong resume, I do feel like I am lacking in knowledge and certifications to backup my experience. What are some important skills that have certification courses that any employer would be looking for in a job market like LA?


I was looking at this link
http://blog.pluralsight.com/computer-networking-certification-paths

How reasonable would people say getting ""the stack"" is?


What kind of salary should I expect with an associates in Information Technology a resume with being employees at 4+ different IT roles and now as an IT administrator + any suggested certifications? 

As of now I don't feel like I make a lot of money (Around 35k) ... but I feel like it's reasonable considering how much I'm able to learn here. The experience is worth more then the money to me at this point. But I feel as after around a year I will be very skilled, and if I continue my education by following some courses I should at least be making 50k+."
44o1ui,1,2016-02-07,CompE Questions,MrPyromaniac,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/44o1ui/compe_questions/,"So like a lot of the other posts in the past couple days, I just got accepted for CompE, and I have a crapload of questions. Most importantly, I'm wondering what I could do between now and this fall to prepare or ""get ahead"". I've knocked out every campus wide gen ed, and best case scenario with this year's AP tests, I will get credit for mechanics, E&amp;M, and calc I &amp; II. 

1. Assuming I do get a 5 on E&amp;M, do you think I would have a good enough understanding of the material to not retake it at UIUC, or is it so fundamentally important that I should retake it?

2. Do you have any suggestions for first year courses? Ideally I'd like to learn enough so that I'm not idle the following summer, that I could either get an internship (unlikely), or do research, or really anything that will potentially look good to a future employer.

3. Any other tips for ECE or just UIUC in general?

Thanks, I know I'm asking a lot, and any insight would be appreciated."
44ofzm,1,2016-02-07,27M4F In an RP'ing mood; four prompts!,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/44ofzm/27m4f_in_an_rping_mood_four_prompts/,"Hi everyone! I'd really like a good RP tonight, and I think I've got a couple of solid ideas. I'm very flexible with these, and if you're interested in a few tweaks, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

About me: 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build. My kinks and dislikes are below the prompts, so scroll down for those!

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks: Dirty talk (an absolute must), big breasts/titfucking, bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking/smoking, oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you tonight!"

Hi there.

My name is Leeland and this is going to be quite a story. I will be hyper linking things here and there- so you may want to read through once before getting distracted on these tangents. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________
As stated in the title- things at home were rough:

 * No running water till I left home- A lot of people will ask if I am American at this point, but you'd be surprised at how often families in the south have a [well they can't afford to fix.] (http://imgur.com/LZwuFs5) My childhood went by in blissful ignorance. We bathed one-two-three times a month in the Lake Shower stalls, washed our clothes by hand, and bought water or filled empty milk jugs in bathrooms at Walmart.
  * I like to interject humor in dark places so the reading isn't dry and hopeless- so if you just want the meat of the story skip the next two paragraphs- 

*My most embarrassing moment was my 10th grade year in high school. Like most impoverished families- we had an absurd amount of dogs and cats. The cats are outside cats. One morning before school as I was about to run up the long rocky path to my bus stop, I saw a tom cat marking his territory on my bike. Indignant, I kicked at him. (not violently mind you) Little did I know I'd taken the bike's place. The bus stop, being outdoors meant plenty of air circulation, which meant I didn't know I was doomed until I got onto the bus. The moment I sat down, the most pungent smell hit my nose. I realized within a few minutes of blowing it away from me and it returning that it was my pants that smelled of cat piss. Although I was not sitting with the other children, the smell filled the entire bus and it was't hard, I imagine to determine its source given the few students we picked up after me.*

*I managed to bluff my way through 3 periods that day. In between each class I went to the bathroom trying to wash out the acrid smell. It ofcourse didn't work. I only managed to draw curious stares from people at the wet mark on my pants in the halls. Some may ask why I didn't bother to call family and ask for new pants, but you must remember- we are poor. When I turned 16 we didn't even use gas to teach me how to drive- much less would we be willing to spend gas on bringing someone pants. Plus my step dad......well. We'll get back to that. It was in 4th period, just after lunch that my teacher walked into the classroom. I was sitting toward the back, at a table shared with 3 others. The very moment he crossed the threshold he stopped, wrinkled his nose and proclaimed loudly: ""Ugh. What's that smell? It smells....like a cat's liter box.."" And pray tell, does my dear sweet Arts and Humanities teacher stop there? Oh no. He literally follows his nose to my table- where he stands in front of me and my 3 classmates, looking out past us.*

*""it's coming from here....""*

*It must have been at that point that he realized he was about the end someone's social life, because he dropped it quite promptly there. It was the most awkward moment I have ever had.*


**Now let us continue**

 * I had an abusive life. Let me first state here that my mother is a good woman- with unfortunately poor taste in men. My biological father is a dead beat I've only ever met once. My first step father turned out to be a liar and a child molester. Though we got rid of him early on- it messed my little brother (his real father) up psychologically- and he had to go to counselling for 3 years. Apparently I was molested as well, but I have no memory of it. Thank God. I got 1 brother and 1 sister in that short marriage. The 3rd and final 'father figure' in our home was a man who lived with his mother well into his 30's. We moved in with them, as my mother had no place to go. So realize here and now before you judge her too harshly- that if we left this place- finding a new place to live we could afford would be very difficult. Especially as a single mother who has 3 children.

The first few years were OK. But something changed as I turned 9 and then on, to this day I don't really understand it. Maybe he was always this way, but my innocent years shielded me from his ignorance.

Being the spiteful man that he was- my step father would often accuse me of this or that. And truthfully- I was 95% of the time innocent of these accusations. Ofcourse I would deny them, but it's his word against mine. Often I would be given an ultimatum; **""I'm not going to tell you what you did, because you always lie about it anyways, if you admit to what you did wrong, I will not punish you as badly, but if you lie I will make your punishment worse""**

Ofcourse I proclaimed innocence. And I paid for it dearly. He would practice 3 types of punishment. All of them included me being out of [sight and mind for hours:] (http://www.wellspringchildandfamily.com/blog/is-time-outs-time-up)

   * pull your pants down, remain bent over the couch (living room where everyone who walks by will see you) until I come to spank you. Sometimes I would be there for hours, scared of the lashes I didn't deserve. It was terror at first, humiliation hours later.

   * Stand in the corner of the cabinet that hasn't been dusted behind in literally 10 years where you can hardly breathe without getting dust in your lungs until I conveniently forget your there. I once stood in the corner for 6 hours.

   * You're grounded. This was the punishment I received most often. Being grounded at my home is basically a death sentence. You literally have less rights than a prisoner on death row. I lay in my bed (if you can call it that, thing was so old the fabric had been worn away years ago and I either choose to use the blanket for warmth or use it to protect my side against the springs that stuck out painfully.) until told my time was up. I cannot speak. I cannot read. I cannot even *turn over* because my 'room' was actually the living room where the TV was and by turning over I would be watching TV so if caught doing so I would be smacked in the face. I had to stay on my side, looking at the same peeling wall paper.....for up to two weeks at a time. I would be grounded so often that I began to notice patterns. If I was not told to get up the morning following my sentence, then I was going to spend at least 2 days, if not 2 than 4, if not 4 then 7. If I ever made it to an 8th day- I gave way to despair knowing that it would be another 6 days.

**I tell you the truth, there is nothing in this world more depressing than knowing you've wasted your entire day, and that no matter what, when you wake up the next day, there is NOTHING to look forward to**

This was the closest I ever came to depression as a child and teen.


 * Have you ever seen [hoarders?] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarders) My step father's mother was the last surviving member of her 9 brothers and sisters. She couldn't bare to part with anything, and I can't really blame her, but being as poor as we were, it was cheaper to keep all of these things in the house, rather than put them in storage. Trying to make a 2 person home accommodate 7 people was bad enough. Imagine curtains crusted over with years of neglect and dust, boxes pile to ceiling tiles, which by the way were constantly falling and in need of repair. No matter my age I was very seldom ever allowed to leave the yard or house. We were never given any independence. Never allowed to cook our own food, to call friends, to visit friends or have friends over. These terrible circumstances created in me a very curious cocktail of Social Awkwardness. More on that soon.


&gt;Thankyou for the private messages and the comments on this post. The feedback affirms my decision to share, in hopes that my story will help someone out there struggling.

 * In addition to an aggressive step father, claustrophobic living conditions, a yearning for independence as I grew and a lack of basic resources that most people take for granted, our family also did without often.

For me- three meals a day was a [foreign concept.] (http://imgur.com/gallery/IENwqZp) I had 1 bowl of cereal for breakfast, and a bologna sandwich with a handful of lays chips for dinner. Without exaggeration that was almost entirely my diet growing up. Even when I entered my teens, a time for males where a lot of important growing occurs, I was severely underweight.

Up until last year in fact, at the age of 24, I was 140 pounds....at 6'2. Money was rough not only because of the size of our family, (*step father, Mother, step grandmother, 2 sisters and 1 brother + me + numerous animals that we had no business keeping the first place*) money was an issue because my step father refused to work. My mother ended up becoming a truck driver so we could afford to pay for life's many needs, and this meant she was home rarely.

This also meant that I had to endure more hardship without my mother who was often my only shield against the injustices I had to suffer. 

One of my most cherished memories of this time was at 15 years old. Grounded. Mom came home after two weeks on the road in the middle of the day. It had been dark in the living room all day. When she opened the door light flooded in and for a brief moment I felt free. Seeing me in the bed she knew immediately that I got into trouble again, but whether it was my fault or not, she knelt beside me, wiping the tears from my eyes.

She told me; ""*One day we'll leave this place Leeland, just put up with it a [little longer I promise you.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB1NMf9Qe-Y)""

One day turned into years though, because when you're poor and have always been poor, and your parents before you and those before them were poor, life like this becomes a cycle.

At 17 I was becoming a man. I was beginning to open my eyes and see the way other people my age lived. I was consumed with bitterness. **SIDENOTE** *I also masked that bitterness quite well. I was President of the Writing club and Vice President of the Arts Honors Society, not a single friend at school knew what I suffered at home.*

*Why do I have to deal with this?*

*How do I escape?*

The truth is I had been offered a way out two years ago. (15)

Let me tell you about Miss Billy Sue Kibbons.

The following is an excerpt from a Facebook note I made a few years ago:

&gt;*""I want to be an artist""
 
&gt;The boy had decided this with absolute certainty and naivety at the tender age of 8.
 
&gt;It would be many years before he realized that 'artist' was too broad a term, that he still had much to learn, and that he had no idea what he was getting himself into.
 
&gt;All he knew about the world of art at that time was Bob Ross and the [Cabin] (http://imgur.com/kssQ48E) that an ancient woman taught [him in once a week.] (http://imgur.com/k52DhVm)
 
&gt;[Billy Sue] (http://imgur.com/h7G3vZc) was her name and Leeland, even at his young age, thought that to be an odd name for a woman. It might have been a stroke of luck, fate, destiny or whatever you believe in that brought the two of them together, but Billy Sue would say it was God, in His infinite wisdom.
 
&gt;That might have been the intention of the Teacher from Leeland's Elementary school who anonymously sponsored him to take these after school art lessons with Billy Sue.
 
&gt;Even 14 years later to the time that Leeland was writing these words he never knew the Teacher's identity. This left him with no one to thank and he worked all the harder in hopes that this Teacher would one day hear of his success and know that she had made a difference.
 
&gt;Years down the road Leeland would speculate just why he had been sponsored, knowing that while he was talented, he was no prodigy.
 
&gt;Billy Sue taught Leeland many things about art, but none of that would have saved him the way only she and her husband, [Jerry] (http://imgur.com/F0ZitcE) could. When Leeland had spent 5 months with Billy Sue she began taking him to church with her. Leeland found Christ not long afterward. (I do apologize is the C word offends anyone, this is not me shoving religion down your throat, this is just part of my journey)
 
&gt;When Leeland was 10 years old he got his first allowance ever, working in Jerry's yard. Over the next 7 years he would learn neat landscaping techniques, the names of flowers and how to care for a lawnmower. These things are not meaningful to a normal child, but for Leeland, who grew up in a home that stifled independence and most learning, any excuse to get out of the house was treasured.
 
&gt;Jerry and Billy Sue Kibbons provided Leeland with 2 days out of the week that he could leave the house. 
During Summer and Winter breaks this was most always the only time he would have outside his home.*

As you can see- these two people made an exceptional change in my life, and of all her students, I was the only one Mrs. Kibbons took such a special interest in.

My tutor was very aware of my circumstances at home. I begged her not to call child services. I loved my mother, though she would constantly disprove of the way my mom raised me and the poor choices she sometimes made.

When I was 15, she and her husband sat me down after a long day of landscaping and let me know- that if I were willing- they would allow me to move in with them. They just wanted to give me a stable environment at this crucial part of my high school life.

I should have accepted. But when you are poor, and suddenly very aware of how poor you are- sometimes there is guilt associated with accepting help, even from those you know love you.

And so I endured another 2 years of consistent abuse at home.

My mother had been arguing with my step father a lot around this time. Mostly about me and how to appropriately deal with me. She had convinced him to at least put me to work doing chores, instead of wasting my time away in a bed for weeks at a time.

I should have been grateful for such a break through, but wouldn't you know, he intended to take full advantage of this new rule.

There are two examples of this type of punishment:

 * Many parts of our large yard were overgrown with baby Chestnut Oak trees. They have very long roots. Most of our soil was comprised of clay. My job? Pull up over 1,000 baby trees, bare handed, without tools until I was allowed to go to sleep. This punishment lasted the entire evening. I wept with anger that night at the injustice. I screamed at the top of my lungs at God, the fates, whatever. I was getting sick of my circumstances and my long long long long oh so long fuse was nearing it's end.

 * One day my step father walks into the house. Over many years of bad experiences with him coming home- I'd learned to shrink away into non existence in his presence in hopes that I would go unnoticed and unprovoked. I was not so lucky this day:

He came home. The first thing he says as I turn to my name being called: ""You're being punished. I don't need to tell you why, you already know what you did. You know all that [trash] (http://imgur.com/GP7sJrw) (*please note this is a picture taken several years after the fact, the trash you're about to learn about was much much MUCH more*) that's been piling up outside? The recycle center is giving everyone 3 days to throw out their trash for free. Get to work.""

Since we're poor, we burn our trash. Many things cannot be burned or are unsafe to burn. Examples include air freshener cans, glass, tin, copper, aluminum cans, etc etc. Ever since I could remember we'd never moved those trash piles. Easily 12+ years of garbage was piled at the burn pile and behind/beside the [milkhouse] (http://imgur.com/7ABdWEy) (*this picture shows what it looked like after I cleared all the trash. The rusty freezer was full of mosquito infested water and broken glass and rusty metals, imagine 6 of those full, that's how much garbage was piled around the milkhouse, and that was not even half of the total garbage.*)

My job was to bare handed, and with no help or tools, sort through all our accumulated garbage, sort it into 3 piles and then bag it (*not double bag, safer for me and more expensive for him*). After I bagged the extremely sharp glass and various other items, I had to wrap my hands around each bag for fear that it would split and then I'd be in trouble for wasting bags- and waddle the bag across the yard, up a hill, and up the long rocky drive way to a single care trailer.

We all know how long one of those is [right?] (http://imgur.com/Eh9ax69) I had to pile big black trash bags from end to end, 3 stacks high before I finally finished.

Keep in mind it's the middle of the summer in the South. Snakes, venomous spiders, wasp and yellow jacket nests are very very real dangers when going through so much garbage that has been undisturbed for years.  

The entire time I am working, from morning to after it got too dark to see, he was verbally abusing me for 'taking my sweet time' as he saw it in his eyes. He assumed I wanted him to be late for the deadline. Paranoid, this guy.

When I finally finished my work, more than 8 hours before the deadline, he was not home. He was at a friend's house, helping them with THEIR garbage. He comes home 6 hours later, takes the garbage off without a word, and when he returns later that night....

He still has the garbage. So what does he say to me?

""I know you were taking your time with this punishment. Because of you I was late and couldn't take the trash off. Later I'm going to make you unload all the garbage off the trailer. For now I have to think of an appropriate way to punish you for making me late. Until I think of a punishment, you're going to lay in bed.""

These thoughts passed through my mind very quickly, please pardon the language:


 * Not only did I work my ass off for 3 fucking days. I did it all on the made up accusation that I did something wrong. 

 * Not only did I do time for something I was likely innocent of, but this bastard harassed me the entire time I worked and then when I finally finish my job **on time** he has the nerve to blame me for his poor time management. 

 * On top of ALL this- he's not only going to punish me for his mistakes, he's going to make me lay in the bed, suffering more, all the while looking forward to yet another punishment.

......

.....


....

**""No.""**

Step father turns around, after walking off expecting me to blindly obey as I always have.

""**What did you say??**""

I stand up.

""**I have the right to know what I did wrong in the first place to earn all of these punishments. This isn't fair.**""

By this time my voice is shaking. I'm a very thin [kid*] (http://imgur.com/unBMSMZ) (* I'm the one in blue.*) He's not quite as tall as me, but he is much stronger and better fed than me. For those interested, this is me [today*] (http://imgur.com/f5HFfRn)

But I'd had enough. So many years of injustice. I felt like Harry Potty finally giving the Dursely's a piece of my mind.

He walked toward me. I held my ground. I'm 17. Nearly a man grown. It's time to make myself heard right?

**""You will do as your told. I do not have to explain myself to you. You always deny the things you do, it's a waste of my time!""**

-


**""Well what about my time? Why should I give you so many days of my life for something I didn't even do? If I actually did something wrong then you can explain it to me. I won't budge from this spot until you TELL ME.""** 

I said those last two words forcefully. Not out of disrespect, but as a testament to my resolve.

My step father has always been a hothead. He grabbed me by the shoulder and forced me outside. I wasn't wearing anything except gym shorts and my glasses.

He shoves me outside. Every step he took put his face within inches of mine as he yelled at me:

**""I can't ever trust you, you're always lying...""** etc etc (multiple curse words, but there's little point in elaborating.)

&gt;*It's important to note that to this day I am unsure of what to make of the man. Part of me believes he was actually stupid enough to believe he was in the right. That's doesn't make it OK- but it makes it harder to loath him.*

Up the side walk we go, he finally let's his rage come to a boil and instead of just yelling, now he's screaming at me to hit him. He wants an excuse to 'defend himself'- but I'm not quite that stupid. Even if I wanted to hit him, I don't have a violent bone in my body. I hate confrontation. I try to solve my problems with passionate speech, because I believe in the power of words.

They held no power for me this day.

Eventually he tries to goad me by attacking my beliefs. At this time he does not believe in a god, and while he's never said anything about my Sunday school lessons, this time he makes it known what a hypocrite he takes me for.

**""YOU CALL YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN, BUT YOU ALWAYS LIE, I CAN'T EVER TRUST A SINGLE WORD YOU SA-""**

For the first time in my life, I pulled a [Gohan] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_lgwedINx8) and yelled at him.

**""YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME""**

I leaned forward as I yelled this. I made sure he could see the frustration and pent up rage in my eyes.

He smacked my face. Hard. Glasses came off. They lay on the gravel mangled.

Without even a brief pause, I turned from him, and from that life. Without shoes, or a shirt or even decent eye sight I walked away.

Hot tears fell down my cheeks, and I don't even remember what he said. It was particularly offensive and I yell at him again without turning around: 

**""FUCK YOU!""**

_________________________________________________________________________________________

**Things start to get better**

Knowing that if I didn't get off the road soon he was going to try to force me to come back home, I walked to the Youth Pastors house which was close by. I knocked on the door.

He opened it to see a skinny, bare backed, barefoot teen crying uncontrollably that he'd sometimes played basketball with, with a huge red welt on his face.

I looked at him through teary eyes hardly daring to think about the life altering decision I was making and asked to make a call.

Mrs. Kibbons was there to pick me up within the hour.

My mother was very upset for a few weeks after that. But she eventually came to terms with my moving out.

Mr. and Mrs. Kibbons helped prepare me for College. I got into Campbellsville University where I got to meet and become friends with people from all over the world. (CU offers big scholarships for international students) 

For the first time in my life I was able to socialize with people freely, and I was able to commit to events, knowing that if I could get there myself- no one could tell me no. The independence was beautiful.

Life was looking up for once. I thought.

I was wrong.

Sometimes the road to success is riddled with potholes.

After 2 years and Campbellsville University I decided to transfer to IADT in Chicago. I intended to major in Animation, &amp; CU only offered Fine Art.

It was my first time in the big city. I enjoyed the city itself very very [much] (http://imgur.com/a/0SFdz)

When I transferred to IADT, I was told that with my 2 years of gen ed courses, I would be able to finish my Associates in Animation within 2 more years at IADT.

After an entire year at IADT I had still not taken a single course for animation. Here I am, 3 years into my degree, and I don't know a thing about what I want to do for the rest of my life. I spoke to my program director out of frustration and concern. I was told then what I should have been told before enrolling at IADT:

&gt;Enrollment is at an all time low. The core classes you need to be in are not filling up. Until we can fill the classes &gt;you need to take- you can't take them. 

That's fine I guess, but here's the worm in my apple: My financial aid, scholarships and grants were not enough to cover tuition AND my student housing. If I wanted to use the student housing provided by the school (much cheaper than anything else) I would have to take out a parent plus loan. Fine. Do what you gotta do right?

It gets worse. I need class X, Y and Z. They are not available this semester, so if I am to remain a full time student, aka, still qualify for the parent plus loan, which is the only way I am able to survive at this point, then I have to take more classes.

I ended up enrolling in Drawing I. I already had this credit from my time at CU. I sat through an entire semester of remedial drawing for the chance to do their amateur animation final. 

It was styled in the way of [William Kentridge] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kentridge), where you animate using charcoal and a camera and one sheet of paper. Our requirements were 50 frames, 2 objects needed to move, at least 2.5 seconds in duration and could be of anything.

I decided to take this project seriously. This was going to be my first experience with animation, if I didn't give it everything- how would I know if I was going to enjoy it?

We were given two weeks. We had a cramped classroom where we were expected to work shoulder to shoulder with other students, where the possibility of our tripods being budged, thus making the animation shakey and low quality was too common. I rejected this. 

I took my work to the [cafeteria] (http://imgur.com/WSnkcsw) and worked all day and into the night. I marked my place with tape and continued everyday to learn this style. I didn't make my goal. My animation ended several hundred frames short of my goal. I expected everyone to go above and beyond the 50 frame limit. When I came to the final to present, I was astounded to see stick man animations crudely done. I do not mean to make my classmates sound bad- but you could tell, this is not what they wanted to do for the rest of their lives.

I submitted an animation roughly 8-14 seconds long, with around 500 frames: 

&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLqaWse_H0E

I knew then that this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I was ready to commit many more years if it meant I could learn to be great.

My mother's credit took a hit. Suddenly she could no longer take out the Parent Plus loan for me. I was evicted from student housing. An illegal Mexican family took me in. (I went to school with their son)

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RupGqS7oFqY

I lived in 3 different places that last year of college. I wish I could say I rose above these challenges and graduated. But suddenly I had rent to pay and I had to do it on minimum part time wage- Suddenly I was forced to commute 90 minutes in extreme weather to school and to work. The stress began to pile up, my grades crumbled under the weight. I was placed on academic probation for a semester. 

Then my grandmother fell terminally ill. She'd kept it a secret. Suddenly I find out she's road tripping from her home in Arizona to be with her daughter and grandchildren before the end.

I was faced with a difficult decision. 

Finish my degree and miss my chance to be with my grandmother who could die any week, or take a semester off?

I was with her when she died. I do not regret it. She like my mother made many mistakes in her life, but she always loved me, and I her.

While I was away from school, my institute announced that they would be merging with [Sanford Brown] (http://www.sanfordbrown.edu/About-Us/New-Sanford-Brown)

Not only did they lose accreditation, and would be dropping animation as a major, but they would also be closing their Chicago location once their current students graduated. 

I could finish my degree and graduate from a school that no longer exists.... or I could cut my losses.

**A Year to Think**

When I left for Chicago my mother finally worked up the courage to leave her relationship. She once said to me over the phone that it was not until I left for Chicago that she realized I had grown up. She had always reasoned with herself that by staying with him, she could save up enough money to give us the childhood we deserved. She decided to save what was left of her two daughters childhoods.

And so it was that I decided to stay in Tennessee with my mom for a year, to work a few jobs, save some money and help out where I could.

I was very concerned with my art practice and worried that this year off from school would come back to bite me.

I looked for internships, but everything that had to do with animation requires that I be enrolled in school, even though I was willing to work for free if it meant finally learning.

 * I took to sitting at bus stops next to stop lights and practicing speed drawing by attempting to draw as much of a car or cars as I could before the lights turned green.

 * I did [fan art and portraits] (http://imgur.com/a/OxspG) for commission.

 * I also networked a lot. Working the drive through of a McDonalds and the carry out of a Papa Murphy's I met hundreds of people every week. I was amiable and looked for opportunities to let important facts about myself slip in hopes that someone, sometime would bite. One day a lady found out how much I loved art and recommended me to a tutor she went to weekly.  

*An art tutor? Heh, I have not had one of those for a long time, this could be a real treat.*

Understatement of the year.

Turned out my Art tutor was none other than [Marion Cook] (http://www.marionbcook.com/) the father of [Barry Cook] (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0176905/) who co-directed Walt Disney's Mulan in 1998.

As you read these words I cannot begin to guess at what each of you are passionate about, but for me, pen on paper is my outlet. Be it words or lines- the ability to communicate is my greatest treasure. When I studied under Mr. Cook I saw dexterity of the hand, the likes of which you will rarely see in life and only when you know to look for it. He was so incredible it moved me to tears.

Finally. I had a Master to teach me. I felt like Ang from Avatar, the Last Airbender. I can finally become GREAT.

I was wrong. Again.
__________________________________________________________________________________________


I love my mother, as I have told you a few times, but she often makes decisions I disagree with. She was never very strict with my sisters, and much less so the youngest, as it is often the case with the babies of the family.

My little sister was caught selling weed to the landlord's son.....by the landlord. (Please note I do not judge anyone that smokes, it's your life, I simply choose to not do such things)

We were evicted. We had 30 days to find a new place to live. My other sister was in college and my brother was married a while ago and lives with his wife. So My mom found a place for herself and my youngest sister, but wouldn't you know it? There was no room for me. (new Boyfriend)

I had to come up with a plan. I've always been a person to dream big and when I dream big I put my mind to it.

I decided I was going to California. The animation Capital of the United States.

I started a gofundme, told my predicament and included a short animation. *No I will not link it, I did not create this post to panhandle* 

I raised $2,000 in 1 month. Through a game called League of Legends I hit up a friend of mine in the Marines I'd known online for several years, though never in real life. He gave me the keys to his empty apartment and gave me 6 months of a rent free, bill free existence to get myself set up until he was deployed to Okinawa.

I worked all sorts of jobs in my first year here. (San Diego)

From Target to 7-11, from Telemarketer to Inrest Marketer, from Art tutor on a Military base to King of the Carryout at a Dominos.

No job I came to learn, was too humble for me to work. Income is income. There's never an excuse to not be making money.

I even got the balls to design a fancy resume in Ai, custom business cards and drew up a nice cover letter, and took myself door to door trying to find more work. The goal here was not to find a great job, that would have been an unexpected bonus. The goal was to build self confidence and build up a resistance to rejection.

As a telemarketer I came up with a unique formula for networking. Most people told me to go die in a hole. Understandable, but once every few hundred calls a person would be astoundingly polite- I would ofcourse, without even being asked, place them on the DNC (national do not call list)

Then after hours, I would call them back, inform them that I took the liberty of making sure my company could never disturb then again, then I coached them on how to avoid these calls in the future. Only then, if they were willing, did I venture to introduce myself and talk about my goals in California. 

I had very many interesting conversations with complete strangers. Most of them ended in empty hands but a heart full of affirmations.

One call ended up changing my life.

I had the fortune of grabbing the ear of someone who once owned a decently sized tech company in SoCal. He sold it ages ago, and now makes apps in his spare time.

He discerned a bit about me in our phone call and asked me to lunch. Being the very trusting person I am thanks to a childhood of false accusations I agreed.

The subject of competitive gaming came up during our conversation and he asked me why I didn't stream for additional revenue. I confessed I'd always wanted to, but with my background I'd never had that kind of chance.

He asked me to send him a list of what I would need to stream. I sent him the cheapest list I could. He upgraded everything and Amazon'd me the parts. The only catch he said, was that I had to put my computer together myself.

I learned a **lot** about computers that night. I began my stream with the knowledge that the average streamer gets 1,000-3,000 unique views and 100-250 follows in their first 12 months.

I set my 12 month goal for 100,000 views and 2,000 follows.

Today marks day 212 (month 7) and [my stream is at 57,000 views and 2,400 follows.] (http://imgur.com/Rk1HDO2)

I do not use those number to brag, but to make a point. People put a lot of stock into averages.

What are averages guys? It's the culmination of many many people's stats. Many people, but not you. Who you are, and what you can do is dependent only upon the amount effort you're willing to give. How BAD do you want it?

When I worked my summer job on base as an art tutor, I worked 40 hour weeks there. I would walk 4 miles home in the Cali sun, shower, and walk to Dominos to work. When I got home I streamed for 5 hours every night with the goal of obtaining 10 follows a day. I treated my stream like a 3rd job.

You've got to become obsessed with the idea of being successful.  [Pic Related] (http://imgur.com/Y8fILwl)

**What am I doing today?**

Currently I am looking for a second job.

I am *just* barely self sustaining. This means I make enough money monthly to stay caught up on bills and pay for food. Never be satisfied for such things. I certainly am not.

I'm working on my very first short film in spare time. Literally working on storyboards every week: 

&gt;http://imgur.com/VhbHOFf

These are the words: 

&gt; My mother was 17 when she held me in her arms thinking

&gt;That this is the only one in the world that loves me.


 
&gt;Oh My mother was young once too

&gt;But her dreams did not come true


 
&gt;and now as she watches me grow
 
&gt;she sits and thinks on the things she hopes I will know


 
&gt;""Oh son"" she sighed, ""your father never knew..
 
&gt;though living in the moment is never hard to do, 

&gt;after taking a chance you've got to follow through...
 


&gt;cuz' Love is so much more than a heart that just won't mind,

&gt;Every line being redrawn and crossed everytime..""


 
&gt;Oh mother you've taught me so many things

&gt;I've listened to your heart and the sad song it sings
 
 
&gt;Fall far, far from the tree, that's what my mother

&gt;Sang to me..

My fervent desire is to finish this in time for mother's day, or father's day if a devious mood takes me.

There is a lot, that I do not know about Animation. I am able to teach myself some things, but I learned early on, that I learn best with a patient teacher with whom I can constantly ask questions.

I need one of those the most. I'm currently trying to learn to drive. Transportation has been a major problem in my life, and at 25, I can no longer blame circumstance for having put it off for so long.

The point of this post wasn't to give you the underdog story of how I magically became super successful, it was to show you that despite so **many** setbacks, and I only told you about half of them- I keep moving forward.

Remember Rocky. 

&gt;It's not about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can **get** hit, and keep moving forward, how &gt;much you can **take**, and *keep moving forward*, that's how winning is done!

What can be more inspirational than a story about someone's life struggles, and how despite it all they still have the balls to look life in the eye and ask for more? I'm right there with you guys, never quit, never give up.

Some people have pm'd me to ask what I'm good at- So I will shamelessly plug myself for a moment:

 * Graphic Design

 * Art tutoring

 * English Tutoring

 * Writing (creatively)

 * Public Speaking

 * Customer Relation/Service (even at the carryout of a Dominos, I average $5-$20 in tips a day because I own it. I know how to make the customer smile, and I reject the overused jargon my coworkers spout. I even take the time to learn conversational Hindi, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Spanish and Tagalog in an effort to connect with the many different cultures represented here in Mira Mesa.

Dating my boss (self.AskReddit)
submitted 4 minutes ago by Mas12224
Looking for some feedback on this situation. A few months ago, I was completing an internship, and I was working with mainly older males, who I didn't have much in common with. However, there was one guy who was 5 years older than me, and we started to form a friendly relationship because of similar age, similar interests, etc...
Well, during my internship., this guy...let's call him Alex, asked me over to ""hang out"". At that point, I clearly knew what was going to happen, as it was pretty obvious to me (and him) that the flirting was fairly intense. We were just going to hang out for a few hours, and ended up spending the entire day together. Of course, as the night grew later...then the alcohol came...and we ended up hooking up. Honestly at first, I wasn't sure how to react. I tried to react like the ""cool"" girl, and just be like...""whatever! No strings!"". And actually that worked for me. But he became super interested. He wanted to hang out all the time, and soon I found myself actually really interested in this guy. We obviously agreed to keep our relationship private, as it would be considered a big no-no by the company if they found out.
3-4 weeks after hooking up, the company offered me a position. I had really mixed feelings regarding this because even though I loved the company and co-workers, I felt 1. Weird for accepting a position where this new flame had been started and 2. Afraid I would only be accepting bc of ""Alex"". However, because bills must be paid, and they needed an answer within a short period of time, I decided to take it.
I felt myself starting to back away from ""Alex"" as that I was afraid of getting too close, and the potential pain that would cause. But he was all for continuing the relationship. The company gave me a month to take off of work before starting, and Alex and I kept seeing each other. It was nice because we got a ton of time to spend together that wasn't related to work.
At this point, I do need to stop and explain one thing...Alex is going through a divorce. It's been a 2 year, dragged out, ordeal. Now before you start judging him because he's legally still married, there is literally NOTHING between the two of them, as I have personally witnessed one or two fighting phone calls. He also has two small kids *2 year old and 4 year old, and he is an awesome dad. However, he has a ton of stress over the divorce and getting time with his kids...its almost a daily issue for him. He is on the phone with his lawyer at least once daily.
Okay, jump forward! So I went in to sign paperwork, and found out that ""Alex"" was going to be my supervisor..aka my boss. I would report to him for all work related things. We both had no idea this was going to happen until that day. Personally, I had a momentary...is this going to be bad? Type of thought. But I realized, I know how to handle myself and I know what's appropriate work conduct. I asked Alex if he was going to have a problem being my supervisor given our situation, and he said no.
I started work about three weeks ago, and over the last 2 weeks...our communication has lessened and lessened. At work, he was stil so friendly and flirtatious and we would talk about all kinds of stuff. But then when I would text him after work to see if he wanted to hang out, he always had an excuse. Finally, on Friday he texted me ""I feel weird about this work-personal situation. It's very stressful for me to mix the two with everything else I've got going on right now."". I don't like being in the ""gray zone"" with stuff, so I just came out and asked him if he still wanted to have a relationship. He said he felt it would be easier to end it.

So basically, that was the last communication. I mean, I am a little pissed it was over text message, but I did ask for a response right away. I guess I just want to know people's opinions on whether or not they think it is actually that he has a problem/too much stress being my boss and my boyfriend, or if he's just a lame shit who couldn't give me a real reason for wanting to end it. Also, obviously I'm upset, but I told him I understood. But do you think I should ask for a new supervisor? I can't switch departments, and neither can he. I realize that I got myself into this situation, but what do I do now?? Also, I never got to tell him that it irritated me he kept this to himself and let me sign on the dotted line 3 weeks ago. Maybe he didn't know it would be as hard for him as it was. Any experience with this?? Should I let him go?

   
**tl;dr**: Started dating a co-worker who wound up turning into my boss, now he says it's too stressful to manage being boyfriend and boss. "
44owt2,1,2016-02-07,"[22F] already feeling uninterested and overwhelmed after month of LDR with [23M], feel obligated to stay together",MermaidZombie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44owt2/22f_already_feeling_uninterested_and_overwhelmed/,"**Backstory**

I [22f] have been dating my boyfriend, Sam, for a little over 3 months, but we have been friends for about a year and a half. I met him through our mutual friend group at college and it faded into a relationship. Initially only physical things were happening and I wanted it to just be casual as I knew I was graduating and moving away, permanently, to another state following graduation, but we came to really like each other and it turned into what it was. 

I also initially did not intend to do long distance whatsoever. I have never liked the idea of long distance for a long period of time. I have worked for a certain company in the past doing an internship twice before, and knew I would be returning to the company to do it one more time in order to stay and permanently work for them, following my final semester. We began dating knowing from the very, very beginning that I would be leaving for this internship in two months and not coming back.

I had zero intentions of doing long distance until he brought up the fact that he wanted to do the same internship after he graduates this May. This changed everything, because if we were going to end up in the same place after a set date, there would be an end in sight to the LDR and I was very excited and wanted to do it and so did he. However, I made sure 7-8 times that he was entirely sure that he was doing the internship because he wanted to (which he had, for years prior) and not just because of me. However, he really likes me and I know I'm a major reason for doing it.

I've been gone for a month and a half. I spent a month at home waiting for my internship to start, so had tons of spare time. However, we still did not talk particularly much and I started to realize how hard it would be to keep in touch well enough to maintain a relationship once I would be on my internship and working all of the time. Also, my interest started naturally waning more and more. There's only so much you can do sexually over the phone, but more importantly, he's not the type to really communicate much through texting, messaging, Skype, etc. but I'm not blaming anything on him or his habits. It's just that we've only been dating for 3 months and the expected time of our LDR is about 6 more months. One month of the three we've been together has already been long distance. So in total it would be 7 months of long distance after only 2 months of dating in person.

Obviously that's a lot to take on. That's a very long time to maintain a long distance relationship, especially after not having been together long at all. However, I feel very obligated to stay in this relationship because we are waiting to hear if he got into the internship (which would begin in around 6 months if he gets in) but chances are VERY good that he gets accepted. If he does not get accepted, we'll break up because I'm not willing to do a long distance relationship if there's no end in sight, whatsoever, which is something we've agreed on previously. 

If he does get accepted, however, I'll feel obligated to stay with him because I know I'm a big reason he wants to do the internship, I've talked it up a lot and helped him majorly with the application and interviewing process, and I've hinted toward the relationship being more set in stone once he got in because I would then be able to confirm there being an end in sight. So I feel like it would be very uncool to break up with him if he gets accepted.

However, I'm beginning to feel extremely overwhelmed by this commitment. 6 more months of this doesn't sound fun to me at all. LDRs are hard, and I'm VERY busy here. Now that I'm actually here, doing my internship, it's hitting me just how busy I am - I knew I would be busy, but now I'm seeing in reality how hard it is to keep in contact, especially since he's really just not the type to talk a lot through any type of internet or phone methods. I am also seeing how different of a person I am here - my needs and lifestyle are very different and I think the type of person I'm attracted to changes based on that. He fit my student life very, very well and we were really happy, but now that I'm here I'm just not really interested anymore, even though he's almost graduated with a good degree and I've seen that we're compatible in the past. 

A whole separate topic is that there's a guy here in the place I do this internship at, Kyle, that I almost dated before and we were both mentally planning on dating once I got back here, but then my relationship with Sam started and that killed Kyle's and my relationship. I'm even getting feelings back for Kyle now that I'm back here and have seen him a few times, and I'm in a place where we made a lot of memories together before I left, so it's bringing the unresolved feelings back. I would never EVER cheat on Sam, I'm just bringing up the fact that not only am I no longer feeling like I can be invested or involved or even interested in my current relationship, but my unresolved feelings for another guy are coming back.
   
I just don't want to break up or take a break and then regret it later because maybe when I'm back in a place with Sam in person again, I'll feel the same again. I have no way of knowing how I'll feel when we're together in person again, but that's not for 6 months, and I'm really overwhelmed by the idea of staying tied down while simultaneously making zero progress in this relationship for that long.

**tl;dr**: Have been in LDR for 1 mo with guy I have been dating for 3 mo total, expected LDR to last 6 mo more until we're reuinted IF he gets into the internship that will bring him to where I moved to. Very overwhelmed by the idea of maintaining the long distance since I'm starting to see all of the obstacles, and just not feeling as into it anymore, but also feel obligated to stay with him if he is accepted into the internship."

Spent 5 years on improving every aspect of myself to become the best man I could be. I worked on my social skills, my intelligence, lost weight, got a sense of style and fashion, improved my grooming and got great internships.

But all in all, I still can't accomplish the ONE thing I really want. And that is to be desired by a woman. I stopped being a push over and started having values and standing up for myself i.e stopped being a beta chump and started acting like an alpha male.

And here I am still alone wishing just once I would have a woman check me out or say yes when I ask her out.

I have been working on my ""game"" and talking to as many girls as I can and it always ends with the same answer. ""I have a boyfriend"". And It doesn't matter if she is lying or not, I am not going for a girl that has a boyfriend.

I keep the conversation flirty and engaging. I have a great social life, great friends and interesting stories to tell. I am working towards what I have always been passionate about and if I am at home I am composing music [I have been playing the guitar for 6 years now]. But still nothing. Nada

I have achieved everything that anybody told me is attractive to women; I got fit, got a much more flattering wardrobe, became more confident, more social, travelled, and did cool stuff with my friends to  be an all round interesting person. And you know what - IT STILL DIDN'T MATTER. 

I have lost my rejection count because it is so high now. 

I GET IT! I AM NOT ATTRACTIVE! I AM NOT YOUR 6'4, BLONDE HAIR, BLUE EYED, WHITE MALE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER! 

I am just close to bursting out in tears; because of how lonely i feel right now. How unwanted i feel right now. "

I'm an MHA intern in Montreal.

I don’t know if you’re aware of the current restructuring of the healthcare system in Quebec, Canada, but it’s one of the most major changes the province has ever gone through. With this major change, the administration doesn’t know what is currently being done to clinically support their professionals that work in various health care organizations on their territory.

As such, I’ve been given the mandate of surveying the clinical support needs of the healthcare professionals in our sector (approx. 2500 professionals other than doctors and nurses) in order to be able to support their professional development and ensure the highest quality of services provided to our population.

I’m interested in any surveys that you may have access to that has to do with **surveying professionals about their satisfaction with their current clinical support/clinical supervision, and/or surveys to evaluate their clinical support/clinical supervision needs.** 

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for taking the time to read this!

How am I doing?",Kayabis,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/44p553/23_just_graduated_considering_an_fha_mortgage/,"I graduated last August, found a job in my career field as an intern making ~$16 an hour in September. When I get my unrestricted license, I should be able to command a significant raise to somewhere around $22 an hour. 

Finances:

income $2400-2700 a month

insurance- $205 

rent- $250 in my parents house.

Car loan started in November, Unsecured cash loan $4400 remaining. $158 a month, I have been paying an additional $350 a month to pay this off. It's at 6.5% interest.

Savings- I just started a new savings account saving a minimum of $350 a month, doubling this when I no longer have the loan to pay off. 

Assets- $4500 in mutual funds

Credit Cards- I have an AMEX and discover I use for rewards and pay off each month. 

Debt- $1900 in medical collections, I just disputed with the credit bureaus, awaiting results. 

Credit rating- was ~740 but this medical collections hit this month and it dipped to ~675.

Now I am considering an FHA mortgage, I can take advantage of a first time home buyer program giving me $7500 down payment assistance at 0%. I want to buy a small 2 bedroom townhouse or single family home with a fence for my dog in the neighborhood of $80k-$120K. I need to move out of my parents within a year or so, and I don't want to pay rent. Is this a crazy option, should I just buckle down and save for a few years until I can afford a conventional mortgage?  "
44p81q,1,2016-02-07,"Already feeling uninterested and overwhelmed after month of LDR with boyfriend, but feel obligated to stay together. Need advice.",MermaidZombie,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/44p81q/already_feeling_uninterested_and_overwhelmed/,"I, a college-aged female, have been dating my boyfriend, Sam, college senior male, for a little over 3 months, but we have been friends for about a year and a half. I met him through our mutual friend group at college and it faded into a relationship. Initially only physical things were happening and I wanted it to just be casual as I knew I was graduating and moving away, permanently, to another state following graduation, but we came to really like each other and it turned into what it was.

I also initially did not intend to do long distance whatsoever. I have never liked the idea of long distance for a long period of time. I have worked for a certain company in the past doing an internship twice before, and knew I would be returning to the company to do it one more time in order to stay and permanently work for them, following my final semester. We began dating knowing from the very, very beginning that I would be leaving for this internship in two months and not coming back.

I had zero intentions of doing long distance until he brought up the fact that he wanted to do the same internship after he graduates this May. This changed everything, because if we were going to end up in the same place after a set date, there would be an end in sight to the LDR and I was very excited and wanted to do it and so did he. However, I made sure 7-8 times that he was entirely sure that he was doing the internship because he wanted to (which he had, for years prior) and not just because of me. However, he really likes me and I know I'm a major reason for doing it.

I've been gone for a month and a half. I spent a month at home waiting for my internship to start, so had tons of spare time. However, we still did not talk particularly much and I started to realize how hard it would be to keep in touch well enough to maintain a relationship once I would be on my internship and working all of the time. Also, my interest started naturally waning more and more. There's only so much you can do sexually over the phone, but more importantly, he's not the type to really communicate much through texting, messaging, Skype, etc. but I'm not blaming anything on him or his habits. It's just that we've only been dating for 3 months and the expected time of our LDR is about 6 more months. One month of the three we've been together has already been long distance. So in total it would be 7 months of long distance after only 2 months of dating in person.

Obviously that's a lot to take on. That's a very long time to maintain a long distance relationship, especially after not having been together long at all. However, I feel very obligated to stay in this relationship because we are waiting to hear if he got into the internship (which would begin in around 6 months if he gets in) but chances are VERY good that he gets accepted. If he does not get accepted, we'll break up because I'm not willing to do a long distance relationship if there's no end in sight, whatsoever, which is something we've agreed on previously.

44pivg,1,2016-02-08,Foreign Intern (malaysia) did not file taxes (1) month worth. more info inside,travelknives,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/44pivg/foreign_intern_malaysia_did_not_file_taxes_1/,"Hi!
A little info about me, I was an intern in Florida a couple years back
but moved back home to Asia after a year when my contract ended.
I filled my taxes W2 for that year but since my contract was February
to January, the month of January was considered to be filled for the next year by the time I have already went home. The goverment sent me Mail for doing the taxes for that 1 month, but was not able to do it, since I lost my papers to a natural calamity in my country. The problem now is that I will be back in the U.S. to intern again, does this affect me in anyway? and how do I fix it?

TL.DR:

-Intern 1 year J1 visa Intern Feb. to Jan

-Filled taxes for Feb to Dec. (then went home to own country)

-U.S. Goverment sent docs to file January income tax (not employed anymore) Lost documents to natural calamity

-Going back to U.S. this year, as Intern again. 

-How to fix and and how this affects me?"
44pojo,2,2016-02-08,I [22M] naively thought I could solve my partner's [23F] professional and personal problems.,manuscripts,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44pojo/i_22m_naively_thought_i_could_solve_my_partners/,"My [22M] girlfriend [23F] and I have been together for two years. For the first year and a half, we were both undergraduate students and lived about 1,000 miles apart. This past May we both graduated, and I started graduate school about 50 miles from her. We're best friends; we share obscure hobbies and intellectual interests and really enjoy each others' company. She's interesting, hilarious, brilliant and loving. I found an amazing paid internship in her city, and our work schedules usually allow us to spend one day and 2-3 nights together per week.

Since graduating, she has stayed at a job where her bosses systematically mistreat and yell at her without cause. She's worked there for over 2 years, but for about 7 months it's been tolerable at best and emotionally abusive at worst. She's applied to other jobs, mostly unrelated to her field of academic study, but isn't getting called for interviews. A job related to her degree would likely require a pay cut she just can't afford.

It frustrates me that her life is like this, and I feel like it puts a damper on our day-to-day relationship. It's obviously harder on her than on me, but I'm getting frustrated, hearing about her struggles multiple times a week with no end in sight.

Despite this, we've been talking about moving in together. I've had this idea that we could move to a town just outside her city but a little closer to my school. We'd see each other more often, and the cheaper rent would allow her to take a lesser-paying but more tolerable job, maybe one related to her long-term career interests. But she absolutely loves her current apartment, neighborhood, and proximity to friends, and no longer intends to leave. I understand and respect this.

This is one symptom of a larger issue: I feel like her personal issues have become our relationship issues, and I've assumed that she can solve them - either by herself or with my help. But that's naive of me. I can encourage her do things she *wants* to do, but it's not my business to meddle in her life, decide what her problems are, or treat her like a ""project."" The trajectory of her life is not up to me.

But after 2 years together, I'm not sure if I'm happy with things as they are, and worry that they could get worse over time. I wish my partner had a healthy and fulfilling work life, a happier day-to-day mood, a better self-image, a higher sex drive. Some of these things may change, but others won't, even with a new job. We still love each other and have fun together, but if I'm unsatisfied without these things changing, maybe we just aren't cut out for each other. What do you all think?

**tl;dr**: My happiness in our relationship seems to depend on my partner making major life changes that seem out of her power. I was naive to think that I could solve her problems, or that they would all just disappear one day. Are we just not right for each other?"

So sorry if there is anything wrong with it. Please tell me if there is and I will try to fix it.

I have been applying to jobs since a few months before graduation. I have gotten some interviews and calls and did one day's demo work as well. I also tried to intern(free) at a completely unrelated job,tech support at a hotel, which I knew nothing about but left to start a graduate degree(MS-CS).
I should mention that at the internship I felt like I knew nothing at all and no one was willing to teach me or tell me what to do and that I was useless and a huge burden on my employers. I should also mention that I was only given the internship because the owners are my father's friends.
My last interview about ASP.NET went very well but I think I got rejected as they feared I could not balance work and my graduate education, which I am willing to leave as I want to finish it in the US and only needed 3 subjects to transfer credits to reduce costs there.NOTE: I live in Pakistan, a large part of my family is in the US.

My communication skills especially verbal, and I am beginning to suspect, also written are horrible and I suspect I have some psychological disorder. In particular, I am unable to maintain eye contact, my voice is terrible and I have been told many times that I talk too fast to understand. I will also mention that I have no friends and don't really talk much to people outside my family or even in my family and generally have difficulty talking about anything except computers.

I was the group leader in my Final Year Project at my university and received my project received the highest score awarded that semester(unfortunately, it was still 3.33 and no one got above that in my final BSCS semester). I should also mention that I graduated from one of the top Computer Science universities in my country and and a final GPA of 2.82, with a CGPA above 3.0 for the last two semesters. 
Unfortunately, due to the mentioned communication problems I have, I did not participate in any extra curricular activities or competitions.
My preferred languages are Python or C# and I have used C, C++, Java, a little bit of Scala and Prolog but I don't use them often so I am not as proficient in them. I also did some game development in Unity for a Coursera course, and I am currently also learning Django using a book called Test Driven Development with Python. I know how to use Git as well as some Github, and I am completing a Udacity course to fill any gaps in that subject. I have deployed websites on both Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. I have completed many courses on Coursera, including some paid ones.
I am also willing to learn anything else required for a job.
I feel like I don't have enough deep knowledge in any one topic because I have never worked on a full scale professional project.
I also don't know what I should focus on in terms of language or technology, I had a lot of AI related courses in my BS and am doing a Neural Networks course in my MS right.
I am willing to work for free and tried to volunteer for online work but was rejected as they only accept volunteers in person(the country the organization is located in is the UK). 

I don't know what to do and how to get a job. I have tried everything I can think of. Can someone help me and tell me what I can do to fix this?"

Do you guys think that based on what i told you can i land a job in Switerzland? After some research i found out that UBS and Credit Suisse offered summer internships with the possibility to employment. Are any of you guys familiar with this ? 
Please help. 
I don't have anybody else to ask and help me. "

44qhjj,1,2016-02-08,How do I (F/22) make the best of going on a business trip with my coworker?,throwaway08022016,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/44qhjj/how_do_i_f22_make_the_best_of_going_on_a_business/,"Hi /r/advice, I hope you can help me with this one :)


Last year, I started working full time in a company I had worked before as intern and working student. Exactly the same week I started my internship, my coworker also started his full time job. We are a small company, so everyone has to work and talk with one another over time. We didn’t get along very well from the start, maybe because our characters are so extremely different, but I thought that we could nonetheless maintain a professional business relationship. He is around 15 years older than me and he likes to remind everyone of that (“Oh she can’t know this TV series, she’s way too young.”). I’m of course no psychologist, but I think he maybe only acts self-confident to cover up his own deficits. 
Because I started as an intern, he always treated me less respectful than he treated our other coworkers, even though they treated me just like a normal colleague. I always feared that this would stay the same even when I start working full time and of course it did. He still sees me as inferior which has now even increased because he got promoted. He says unflattering things about my work behind my back (“What is she even doing all day long?”), degrades me in front of my boss and I simply don’t have the balls to revolt against this behavior, because I'm more defensive and shy. Funnily, he is not the biggest workaholic the world has ever seen, but he is charismatic and good with words and I guess that’s how he finds his way through life. I however am still young and trying to find my way into the business. All my colleagues confirm that I’m working hard enough and that I shouldn’t take his words to heart, but I think they can’t really relate because he is always nice and friendly to them. That and the fact that he got promoted recently is why nobody stands up to me or helps me, even though they all think it’s unfair.
During the normal day to day working life, I have learned to deal with it. It’s not great, but well, *I don’t have to marry him* as my mother would say. But now, our boss sends us on a business trip together for three days. I don’t suffer from travel anxiety or anything, I already went on a day trip on my own to another country and went on a 2-day trip with another coworker I like, but this is different. I will have to spend a huge amount of time with someone I don’t like and from whom I know also can’t stand me and I will have no possibility to leave at 5pm and just go home to relax. Also, I fear that he will continue to belittle me in front of potential business partners and I obviously don't want that. I tried to talk to my boss but he said that I couldn’t predict how it’s going to be and if I didn’t even try, I would never know. Because I can’t possibly cancel all this, I am now looking for advice and ways to make the best of this unholy trip. I am grateful for any story you might want to share!


Thank you and all the best!"

Furthermore the battery has started to act up.

I am very pleased however, with how it has served me up until now, and I don't want to switch to a Windows machine.

The thing is my laptop is vital for school work and an internship that I will start in March. I could probably survive with this computer to mid March but I do want to upgrade ASAP (for the slimmer model and better screen).

How worth would it be for me to wait for the new rMBP models?

44qvua,0,2016-02-08,Ottawa hospitals,Cromwellity,ottawa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/44qvua/ottawa_hospitals/,"The first Hospital was the Ottawa general The second the civic and there is more to come.

I was hurt at work. Fell from ladder.

Brought by another employee to nearest hospital emergency room. (Yay free health care)

Told no prob it’s just a slight fracture. ( No X-rays) Here’s Splint ( I wanna say, Zimmerman?) and a 2 minute explanation on how it works, crutches and a 2 minute explanation on how it works, Script, for Meds (something with codeine), referred or advised to make follow up with another Doc.. 

I been off work and it’s about two weeks or so later go back see different non-emergency Doc in Orth department at different hospital. Visual exam seems fine according to new Doc. Given the A.O.K. for light duty at work and start rehab. Make follow up with Same Doc. For “2 Months” later. ( Those quote marks are what ya call foreshadowing.)

The back my calf is cramping on my injured leg right where the splint  ends below the knee about mid calf. I also had started rehab at some point around here. My family Doc office was also a physio center, Which makes sense for him $$$ and is convenient for me. His practice is mostly geriatric and I got him through a referral from my mother. Family Dos are in short supply in Canada. 

I started to go to the physiotherapist at some point around here. and mentioned about the cramping that I was feeling in my calf. In the course of the conversation, I ask if it’s ok to take off the splint.

You see my wife and I had be discussing it and she had said maybe I should be wearing it less. I was of the opinion that if I was supposed to do that  they would have told me when they gave it to me. I had been sleeping with it on.

Physiotherapist tells me, wife is right it’s not like a cast I can sleep without it and feel free to take it off when sitting around but keep leg elevated. He also recommends I should follow up with family doc.

Make appointment with Family doc about cramp.

Have started modified duty at work. It’s Hell won’t give details but it’s akin to copying a phonebook. But! it’s gotten better just started a company paid course in my field. (H.V.A.C.) It’s given by the local major energy supplier and includes certification.

See family Doc he says cancel everything and go to hospital right away. “But, It’s only my 4th or 5th day on new course Doc. Maybe I can address this on the weekend or something” I said. Doc then explains to me what the concepts of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are. My wife (who has been very supportive throughout this ordeal).( Insert some kind of foreshadowing here.) and I go to the emergency center after Doctors appointment.

Family Doc might have saved my life. 

I should note here that the emergency center that I went to for this was. A different emergency center then the one that I had been brought to after my accident at work. (I was brought to the nearest one at the time.) So Docs (please note the use of the plural use of the noun DOCS.) at Emerg after visual exam and oral history tell me given my age,38 at the time (WOW 38,,,tens and yet literally a universal transdimensional distance in the past as I type these words.) and the type of injury. Which if you recall had been diagnosed at the other emergency room. They tell me “NO WORRIES” get out a here! an intern will see to your discharge.

My wife asks the intern (when he got there) if nothing's wrong, why is my husband in pain? He consults my chart as my wife continues to explain the situation, He tells us to wait. A blood sample is drawn by a nurse and sent for tests. Hey! guess what? go on guess. I wait….

Ya turns out it is thrombosis and I get a shot of a blood thinner in the gut and a appointment for first thing next morning at the hospitals thrombosis clinic with a specialist. Intern one at least a couple of doc Docs zip. Next morning given prescription for injectable blood thinners and coumadin. Wife will inject blood thinners for 2 weeks and the the rat poison orally till given the all clear. After follow ups, ultrasounds and misc Given all clear and told will now be susceptible to this condition developing in the future. So watch out.

In the meantime It’s been 8 week and it’s time to follow up with orthotics. ( don’t forget about that foreshadowing earlier.) So I go to my follow up and and have now been x-rayed. Doc says “looking good that’s about what it should be after 2 weeks”. “Ummm Doc” I said “It’s been over 10 weeks since the accident”. See, I guess he had written down 2 weeks. Instead of 2 months in his notes as the time between this appointment and the last.  I remember in some way he referenced a vacation he had just been on as being in some way related this mistake, He then went to consult the head of his department. 

The Head Doc enters with the other Doc and both look closely at the x-ray. After some whispering between the two of them, I’m brought to another room. After removing my pants and lying down the head Doc moves my knee around. He questions me about my pain as he does this as he also is instructing the other Doc on what to look for. After this I am told the ACL is damaged and I’ll need an MRI. Fast Forward to MRI result. Turns out it’s not just damaged it been ripped from the bone and torn a big chunk/chunks of bone with it.

Whee! and we’re just getting started. But let’s leave me and my work now and check in on the family.

In and around this time. My wife and I got a call from our 18 yr old sons (my step-son) High School. They wanted us to come to the school for a meeting concerning him. It seems our son wrote a pro Hitler paper and handed it in. This came as a surprise to my wife and myself. We are against racism, and more importantly are a mixed race couple. The “white pride movement” as he called it, would never accept him! He’s half Canadian mutt and half Lebanese first generation immigrant (His mother came to Canada as  preteen) and looked it. Something to say the least, was wrong.  

Now we get to see how the Canadian Mental health system works. Spoiler alert! It's about as good as the the part of the system that misdiagnosed my leg. Just to recap I was seen by at least 3 Docs that thought my ACL tearing apart was a fracture. Two emergency room Docs, that thought a thrombosis, wasn’t. And that part of the story, as is this one, is just starting."

I'm at a complete loss as to why I choke on the phone screens. It's not my resume, or else I wouldn't be getting interviews, and I don't think it's the way that I answer questions because I normally excel at the first interview and am able to provide working solutions in my final round interviews while communicating my approach fairly clearly. 


Anybody else who was in a similar position and found out what they were doing wrong? It's getting pretty late in the recruiting season and I'm frustrated that I can't close even after studying CTCI and doing LeetCode problems for hours every week. Any advice would be much appreciated.

44rptk,9,2016-02-08,"ugth, continued unemployment",MelodyofEmily,MtF,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/44rptk/ugth_continued_unemployment/,"So I was talking with the woman that runs the salon I go to regularly and I was saying how it was one of the few places I get to feel like I belong lately. She said if you really like it maybe you should consider a career change, and I said I'd actually been looking at school costs a few weeks ago because I'd already had that thought. She said she had some ideas and she'd love to talk later. 

Anyway, she apologized that she couldn't talk the next day because she was swamped and it'd have to be later on her weekend. I replied I wish I could help out! Because  I'm unemployed and bored out of my friggin' mind. She replied that actually that's what she wanted to talk about when she had time. 

So, much like JD in Scrubs my imagination got carried away while I had a few days to wait before we talked again. I mean I figured it'd probably be some recommendations if I wanted to pursue schooling, but on the other hand I knew she could use some help since they don't have a dedicated receptionist, especially on super busy days, and part of me really hoped it'd be a job. I'd sooner work there for minimum wage than somewhere else for more. 

Alas, she finally messaged me today and said she did need help but couldn't afford it currently. I did my best to really not believe my own stupid fantasy but I still feel so broken hearted today. I told her I'd love to work as needed, for anything, just a good recommendation! Something pretty for my resume! I just feel so fucking useless being unemployed. Some days it's like you don't even exist or why should you bother existing. I can't even properly describe how hopeless and lost I feel. I just want something to do to feel like a person again and stop being so fucking depressed.

My own damn fault of course, but I really was hoping this would be the end of my unemployment that's been going on since August. And that on top of that it'd end with me actually getting to be somewhere I really wanted to be. Nothing like a bit of a panic attack when you realize you're completely fucked and your unemployment benefits have come to an end. I've got about 500 dollars to get me until  I find something. 

Although she did have some advice on the programs around here, who to speak with, and that if I got in I could intern there if I wanted, which is nice. And after how much I was wanting that this weekend, and being in a situation where it seemed like a distinct possibility that I was going to find myself on that particular path I really do think it's something I want to pursue... when I find a job and can afford it. Of course I'm afraid I'd suck at it and be completely awful, but on the other hand I guess I should know better than anyone the importance of chasing your dreams considering this whole transition thing.

So sad right now though, I thought I was going to die for a moment with how badly that disappointment hit me. I don't know how I'm going to make it. "
44rxip,2,2016-02-08,I feel like I have no future and I just disappoint everyone,PositronCannon,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/44rxip/i_feel_like_i_have_no_future_and_i_just/,"I lurk here rarely, during particularly low times, never posted before. I even considered using a throwaway so this doesn't show up in my history but you know what, who even cares. I don't even seek or expect help since I don't trust myself to be able to do anything to improve things, I guess I just want to rant. Sorry in advance. This will probably come out disjointed as hell too, I'm not that good at organizing my thoughts and writing.

I'm afraid of pretty much everything in life. But mostly afraid of failure. The possibility of failure is enough to make me not even want to try, and considering how useless and inferior I feel about basically everything, that possibility always seems high.

Not that I have any particular aspirations or goals anyway. But I don't know if that's what causes a lack of motivation or the other way around. Or if it even matters. I finished my studies (tech course in telecommunication and computer systems, somewhere between high school and university level, basically ""technician"" qualification, and before that a similar but lower-level course in consumer electronics) before last summer and I've just been sitting at home since. Not that I was much better while studying, I still woke up everyday thinking how much of a drag everything is and that's while studying something I'm actually somewhat interested in. I'd miss classes sometimes just because I couldn't be fucked to get out of bed, even if I knew I'd be feeling like shit about it for the rest of the day and spend that time worrying about what kind of excuse I'd come up with if anyone asked why I was absent. Can only be sick so often. And it's not like I found the course to be hard or anything, I finished with the overall best grades in the class while probably studying less than some others did, so I guess I am decent at something - too bad book smarts are next to useless in the real world and I usually need help with anything involving actual practical work (say, I can know how to assemble something by the letter but be clumsy as fuck when actually doing it - yet I have zero interest in more academic fields that might actually be more suitable for me given that). Even that was still far better than middle school, especially when I started it, where I would have anxiety every other day for no real reason beyond just the fear of fucking something up (which very rarely materialized). It wasn't until high school that I actually stopped caring so much.

Competition in the job market is fierce because of the utter shit economy (Spain, 50% youth unemployment, 25% overall) and I'm scared to death of it to the point I find it hard to even apply to jobs (the very few that actually pop up anyway) because I don't want to face rejection. Except the prospect of actually getting an interview, as unlikely as that is (with zero job experience aside of two 3-month ""unpaid intern"" periods as part of the tech courses I've done), feels even worse, because I have zero ability to sell myself as a product and pull the bullshit needed for it. Nevermind that any kind of interaction with strangers makes me anxious, even if I know that once I actually do it, nothing really happens. But just the possibility of something going wrong, the ""what will they think"", is always there in my mind. This is probably the main reason I haven't seeked professional help and find the concept itself to be really hard, even if, again, I understand that a lot of people do and it's nothing to be ashamed of. This split between rationality and irrationality in my head is a common factor in pretty much everything.

To add to that, I also have body image issues which definitely don't help. I'm 25 years old and look 15, at best. I have an extremely thin build (about 45 kg or 100 pounds) and I'm somewhat on the short side (about 169 cm or 5'6"") though my height doesn't bother me so much as my childish build and facial features. I even leave some hair on my chin unshaved partly out of convenience when shaving and also to look a bit older. I'm always afraid that I won't be taken seriously because of my looks, and first impressions are unfortunately powerful. Funnily enough, my appearance actually fits my mental state: a 25 year old who feels like a kid who can't cope with the adult world.

I don't even think I have a problem with staying home in pajamas and playing videogames, browsing the internet, chatting with friends and watching anime/TV shows all day, but obviously people expect differently, and who can blame them. Besides, it's an obviously unsustainable lifestyle that I can only get away with because of a supportive family (so many stories of people getting kicked out by their parents, I'm aware of how extremely lucky I am). My family doesn't really know about how I feel aside of ""some self-esteem issues and mild social anxiety"", though I wouldn't be surprised if they figured something else was up, but I try to hide things and put on a poker face. Otherwise they'd hear me bawling away more than one night, for starters.

Added to self-consciousness, I also have serious issues with criticism and take everything beyond personally. If it comes from someone particularly close to me, I either snap at them and feel horrible about it instantly (at least I can apologize, but what worth is it), or I bottle it up and even cry about it - talk about pathetic. Case in point, most times I have anything remotely close to an argument or discussion with my girlfriend (long distance relationship, going on 3 years now) I just go into absolute silence, walk aimlessly around my room, and occassionally cry. She's becoming increasingly frustrated with me and my refusal to try to improve myself, and with very good reason. I don't even know why she hasn't given up on me long ago already, and the fact that I'm making things shit for her as well kills me. I think she's by far the biggest motivator for me to change, but even that doesn't seem to be enough and it makes me feel all sorts of guilty. I think she'd be far better off without me, but at the same time, the thought of losing her is unbearable.

Just last night we had the biggest argument yet over the same thing as always and even though it ended up fine and I thought I really have no other way to go but to change myself, today I wake up again (at 2PM which is actually relatively early for me these days, my sleep schedule is all sorts of fucked up) not feeling like getting out of bed and with part of my mind even considering not getting online either for my girlfriend or my friends (I still did in the end, I'm thankfully not at that point yet, but I feel shitty just for even considering it). Also part of my mind considering what would really be affected if I died, but that happens more often (I'd never do it because a) I don't want to feel pain, and b) even if I had a painless way, I know some people care about me for whatever the fuck reason and they'd be devastated, and that's the last thing I want).

The main reason for me to even consider seeking professional help would actually be out of curiosity more than anything, to answer the question of ""Do I really have a mental health issue, or am I just a lazy fucking scumbag who doesn't want to put any effort into things and gets sad when the real world doesn't work like that?"". I don't believe therapy would help me, because I already know I'm making no sense if I think rationally. My feelings just never agree with that. Maybe pills would help more, chemical imbalances in brain and what not, but I'm not sure I want to go that path either.

Yeah that came out sorta longer than I expected, and I'm sure there's lots more I could say if I gave it more time. Sorry again about the rant and thanks to anyone crazy enough to have read all that. I feel a bit better getting things out of my chest, at least. Most of the time I'm still ""fine"" when I'm distracted with something, but that's basically just running away from things which is something I love doing, and even then the bad thoughts are still in the back of my head."

My CS professor says that now is the time to really start throwing my name out there in front of these companies but most don't accept sophomore internships. 

What can I be doing at this point of college to really get on the right path to landing a good CS job out of college? How can I make my resume more appealing to CS recruiters? I was able to find a few websites where I can search for jobs/internships, but what are the ones that y'all would recommend?

44sd7b,1,2016-02-08,Need help in coping up with Emotional blackmail from Parents,skjaadu,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/44sd7b/need_help_in_coping_up_with_emotional_blackmail/,"Hi,

I am one of billions from India. I am currently doing my engineering degree from one of best college available in country (IIT ?). I worked all my life in hope of getting better (if it exist :/ ) future. But, now after more than 2 years, I feel broken. 

Everything went perfect in my life, except I made one choice of listening to heart instead of brain, and fall in love for a Muslim girl. (I belong to Hindu family). I love her almost equal to my love for my parents, and I understand my different type of responsibility toward all. (keep it separate, it will be in context after few paragraphs)

Now coming back to the blackmail part, this started from the end of my first year only. I was good with technologies, which landed me into winter internship with ? (say Company). I decided to go for it, and worked with them instead of going to home back. From that event in my life only, the differences b/w me and my family started. They behaved fine in starting.

Soon, the next semester ended and the Company again offered my internship in summer which I couldn't deny. (for those who think why, it was because the company is one of best option in country, package ~18Lakh/year). Thus I went from 1-2 week home in summer, and then rest internship. After this, the differences increased, and I started feeling them. It was first time the emotional blackmail start coming into picture. They made me feel like I have forgotten them, or as if... Well, I don't know, I did everything in life to fulfill their expectations. And, I feel I did well.

Overall, I got pissed by these all events, and then spent this winters with them only. (with some another decent internship/work)

But what happened at last?
They now have started showing this every day I call to them in night. They behave like small kids, seeking if I am coming home these holidays and all. Even when I made it clear when all I am coming. Just for example, I told them I am coming, and even shared reservations for Holi holidays, Summers, etc.

I am sick of this attitude now. I feel like quitting everything at once. What was the use of working in order to get job, when it had to end like this?
Even, they in today's date don't know about my relationship, which I think will just add up more events. I feel tired, should this be the end to everything I am doing?
I wonder if she, and parents will work together. Should I remain in relationship with person who actually care and understand me more than parents, or, I should leave her even, just because they are *parents* ? 

Should I leave engineering, and give a new start to life sitting at hometown?
Any help/advice/suggestion would be really helpful.. :)"

Thanks in advance for any advice the community might be able to offer!)

After I graduated high school I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, so I tried a semester at community college. I took 9 units and got a C, a D, and an F, and then I dropped out. 

Six years and a lot of moving around later, I'm four semesters into community college in a different state, with mostly A's and a 4.0 computer science GPA. My cumulative GPA is 3.179 right now because of a failed math course, but once I repeat it this semester it'll be like 3.7. 

So my question is: should I go for complete honesty and include the grades from six years ago in my current GPA? When applying for internships it'll be easy enough to just leave it out, but when I try to transfer to a university I know a lower GPA will limit my options. Has anyone else had any experience with this kind of situation? "

Companies stopped replying to me after the phone screen/coding challenge for some reason, and I've only had one real interview. There don't seem to be many jobs with low skill requirements.

I know these are all totally first world problems as well but they are important to me and I don't know what to do so here I am.

So some background, I'm in my very early twenties, just out of college a year ago, was lucky enough to have a great job straight away in the suburbs, about 5-10 min away from where I grew up, so I still live at home.  Now my company had a great internship program where I met a lot of other cool people my age who now also work full time with me at the same company. I have a great living situation at home, my parents enjoy having me around and my commute to work is next to nothing.  Most of my friends that I work with (which are like 99 percent of the people I hang out with in the area) live in the city, and commute to work. They all go out alot downtown and just seem to have alot of fun on weekends, meet alot of new people, have more opportunities to meet SOs etc (this may be where my FOMO may just be coming in to play). On the other hand thier commute is like an hour to an hour and a half every day. I have two friends in particular who currently live in the suburbs near me who I have talked to about rooming together. They don't seem to go out really much at all, and they don't want to live in the city and want to look mostly in the suburbs. I feel like I may not be gaining much of anything if I move out of home and in with them in the suburbs as I'll be living in the same area and the same commute, now I'll just be paying way more rent. I don't think I want to live in the city alone or with a random roommate. I guess I have some other friends I could talk to and see if they would be interested at all, but at the same time I don't know that the city is worth it either with the added 2-3 hours a day of driving for the possible added social benefits. Then there is the possibility of just staying put at home, continuing to save money, take the safe route. But then I feel like I might be screwing over my two friends by not living with them, or missing out. Basically I feel like I might be unhappy with all of these options, and I've sort of just moved all these thoughts to the back of my head because I can't find a decision I feel happy with and almost wish I never had to think about it at times which I know is super immature and not the right way to go about this, so I just wanted to see if I could get some thoughts from the community, sorry for the massive wall of text.

My parents tried there best to stop me and I said no I want to. But my recruiter said asthma was a disqualifier and did not even want to take me to meps because it would waste time. I graduate senior year with hopes to join soon but then I get an animal infection in my intestine and was in the hospital for a while.

My parents took advantage of the situation and said that I should try out out college for one semester and just try it and if you do not like it, you can try to enlist again. One semester later I did well but was not happy, they tell me just finish your associates, you already started it. Me listening to them, I try to push the marine corps out of my head and force myself to finish.

I graduate my associates in engineering. I am now in a university but I think about joining the Marines everyday. Not a day goes by. I have been forcing myself everyday to go to school and study and question why I keep doing this. Is it for my own good or for my parents good knowing ill be safe getting a degree instead of doing military work and following the path I wanted to go.

I am in a university now and am getting frustrated and depressed. I hate school and every-time I see military posters, people, veterans, I always get upset thinking why i never joined. I have an internship in the summer for engineering project manager and I still have 2-3 years to left to graduate. I did not qualify for plc or anything because not many school sin NJ offer NROTC. I hear officers route is very competitive and my aunt has been in the navy for 22 years and she said yeah it really is especially today.

I never really wanted the officers route and I only intended of doing one contract of enlistment. Now I am in debt (college loans) and am pissed off about my path since i listened to everyones advice instead of going with my gut. I thought the thought of joining would fade and be a phase I was going through but it still has not left. Sites like ihatetheusmc.com said I would be a retard to join but alot of people who I have met said it love and hate and I would never trade it for anything. 


What do you guys personaly think I should do. I recently had just turned 21 last month and have about 70 credits left to graduate.(program is 130). I really am frustrated. And everyone keeps telling me different things."

On top of that I like to lift weights/exercise, pursue various hobbies, and have an active social life. Alcohol and getting drunk is something I very much look forward to because it helps me unwind as well as connect to people during parties. What are some tips to help me avoid drinking? 
Here are some more specifics:
* Since I am very busy, alcohol helps me unwind at the end of a long day/week.
* All of my roommates like to drink, party and go to the bar.
* I have a girlfriend who likes drinking and going out (with me) and it is sort of a part of our relationship (wine nights and such).
*I love the taste of beer and I very much often look forward to being drunk. 

The reason why I want to quit is because I drink quite often and when I do it's quite a lot. During my past winter break I went to bed with a buzz at least 5 days a week for 4 weeks. My friends often say that it's just a college thing, a phase, but even when I am doing internships over the summer I look forward to coming home and getting drunk by myself. It's not just a social activity anymore, and I want to cut it out completely since it will only get worse once I graduate. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

This is my first time posting, and I figured you might be a great resource to find some advice.

My question. I'm currently working full time for the university (ASU) I attend, making decent pay for my area ($42,000 in PHX), as well as getting benefits (free school, healthcare, PTO etc). I am studying computer science, and will be graduating this December. 

I was recently offered a summer software developer internship in Redlands, CA with Esri, which is going to pay $25/hr, with no living stipend. 

I know taking this job would greatly improve my chances of finding a full time upon graduation, and also possibly offer the chance of going full time with Esri at the end of the internship. 

I just don't know if it's worth it to leave my full time job to work for the summer, and not have any job for my final semester at school.

If I leave my current job, I'm going to have to take out at least $10k in loans to finish school, which I normally wouldn't have to do with my current job, but I'd also gain the internship experience at Esri. 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated in helping me make the right choice. "

I was young and stupid and took an entire package of otc back pain medication. I worried that my boyfriend at the time would feel guilty so I confided in him what I had done and told him I was sorry and that it wasn't his fault. Of course he freaked and told my mom who insisted that I make myself throw up (I couldn't) and then sent me up to my room.

I'm 25 now, I ended up dropping out of highschool and getting my ged. Since then I've married and am now in my junior year of university. Amazingly I turned everything around. I have someone that I love that loves me back (something my mother said would never happen) and this last summer I was offered a long term internship with a company that I've always dreamed of working for. I thought that everything back then was behind me.

Then shortly after starting the internship shit got the fan. My sister stole a large amount of money from my parents.  My husband and I have known about her drug use for a long time, but no one would believe us until my mother started finding syringes in the bathroom. Now my family is very divided about how to handle the situation.

To make matters worse my mother has decided that now is a good time to come clean about what went on between my sister and I. She his it from the easy of the family, but now they're asking about it and I feel like I'm back in the middle again reliving it. It's all I can think about. I think about the things she did to me and how my mother just let it happen. I think about how much easier things would have been if I could have had a normal life and how much further ahead I would be now. 

I ended up quitting my internship. Some days I just can't get out of bed. My husband is amazingly supportive and I don't know what I would do without him, but I am not winning this battle. Even with quitting my job my grades are sliding. I've had depression on and off for as long as I can remember, but this time I can't seem to pull myself out of it. 

I feel like I should have died 10 years ago when I was worth nothing. I don't want to leave my husband alone, but I also don't know when I'll ever feel better.

44tkrn,1,2016-02-08,Marcus Brandy Smith,TwilitKing,TwilitKing,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwilitKing/comments/44tkrn/marcus_brandy_smith/,"**Name/Aliases:**  Marcus Brandy Smith

**Age:** 29

**Species/Race:** White Human of Mixed European Descent

**Physical Description:**  Marcus is a bit of an enigma when it comes to his appearance, meant in like one of the least literal ways of course. To be less terribly vague, imagine the CEO of a company, make that man look more like a jerk, give him a bit of stubborn/drunken stubble to line his straightlined jaw of a face. Then give him some thick black-brown hair that is gelled to stay in a bit of roll back around his nape and make his hair line a bit on the lower end, though with his bangs separated in such a way that the right side has just enough extra to make his hair look extra nice a lush. Then take a look into his eye sockets and put in two bright green eyes, with the type of look to make it how obviously he doesn't care about you and also coming with a fair bit of reckless incompetence. 

Then picture him in a suit, in a bathrobe, and then also in a Hawaiian shirt. He's got a bit of tone to his muscles and is a bit closer to the buff side than the lean side, though it probably doesn't help that he is almost 6' 2"" and weighs about 230 lbs. He also wears shoes sometimes, though other times he also wears sandals to go banister surfing. Okay, we're nearly there with the description, picture him in your brain space really really hard and you can see him, but he's missing one thing, right? No wait, I think that's all, well that's what he looks like at the very least.

**Mentality:**  Marcus Brandy Smith is an asshole. He really only cares about making things better off for himself, which most of the time means trying to generate more power for his company and having the time of his life while doing so. He's the guy you'd be more likely to see lounging in his company chair and popping a variety of illicit drugs to make watching Netflix reruns more amusing instead of presenting the image of a capable man to his company or the public. Of course he also enjoys playing Foosball while drunk with his incredibly sober interns. Speaking about his interns, Marcus has literally no value for human lives beyond his own, willing to send interns to their deaths if it means he could stand a chance to benefit from it. He has a few favorite employees that work for him and he might show a bit of mourning if they were to perhaps perish by chance, but he wouldn't let it weigh him down way too long.

This isn't to say he isn't a brilliant man, because he totally is, but he is a slave to his impulses, always willing to take the easy way out instead of following through to do something correctly. If he learns how to make exceptional amounts of power by pulling off the whiskers of a new born kitten, you can be sure that he will send his interns to go ahead to pluck those whiskers. He also has a hard time taking troubles seriously, or at least on a surface level, which leads to him coming off as more than a bit incompetent. When he's motivated though, Marcus is able to get people swooning for him and forgiving him for his many transgressions, or at the very least probably able to pay off people who wouldn't be taken by words alone. He also refers to everyone by nicknames instead of their actual names, and has made it a policy to only call his interns Jimmy and Janie when he refers to them.

**Backstory:** Marcus Brandy Smith was born to the Smith family in the year that his age would allow him to be born, his father was already in charge of the Smith Power Company in Chicago and made a quite a good deal of money. But it probably helped quite a bit that Marcus was a bit on the genius side, he got the best education his parent could provide, and by the time he 16 he was graduating from CIT at the top of his class.

He was living the life that boy was, well if you count not having any friends and barely having any exposure outside of familial and scholarly. I guess no one can really be surprised that as soon as he touched alcohol he was hooked, it really helped him wind down from the giant stress ball that his life had become. Though one thing leads to another and Marcus was doing all sorts of drugs, many that likely should have killed him.

Lucky for him, right? Being killed by drugs would totally suck for most people, wouldn't it? Almost as much as having your parents murdered by some random loonie one the way to a ribbon cutting ceremony. Oh wait, that second thing actually did happen to Marcus, welp. At least by this point he was 19 years old, and thereby able to have his father's entire company shoved onto his shoulders. 

Most people forecasted that the little Smith was going to end up screwing over Smith Power, which is funny because that's actually what was happening. The board was beginning to make their moves to get rid of Marcus from the CEO position so that someone more competent than a genius druggie could be put in charge. Poor little Marcus was being pushed to his breaking point, he couldn't handle all the pressure and could barely bring himself to speak at board meetings. There was one thing he could do though, and that was think and work on ways to earn the company a more efficient form of energy generation to beat out the competitors and get their power stations installed everywhere.

Maybe he was pushed just a little too hard though, cause it made something snap in the adult-child's mind. He made his breakthrough thankfully just in time for the next meeting, though when he was a bit late the board started to make their motions to remove him from his seat and begin putting someone else in charge. Then those guys were interrupted by Marcus rolling a cart into the board room and unveiling a generator and opened with a confidence that they had never seen before and the words, ""Gentleman! I've made a breakthrough!"" to accompany it. More surprised were they when the generator, when hooked to a Multimeter was able to produce wattage than they had hardly imagined was possible the display was able to secure Marcus' spot as CEO.

What the board didn't know was what was powering the generator, though one of the janitor's never did report back to their station after checking up on the genius. Marcus was merely happy to have himself in what he saw as his rightful place, though if someone could watch his mind during those pressured hours, they would notice that something had to have snapped inside of him, and of course they would be correct since Marcus had basically trapped a janitor inside of a generator to basically drain him to death for his energy. Our protagonist was also a bit more confident following his ordeal, no longer caring about the thoughts of those around him, in fact he could hardly care about anything about those people, just as long as he succeeded.

And those were catalysts that got the ball rolling for the Marcus Brandy Smith of today, and in the years since he has used his sheer amounts of persuasive potential and complete and utter lack of morals to bring Smith Power into prominence, providing power for Chicago in anyway he can find from the lives of criminals on death row to opening other dimensions to yank power out of.

**Resources/Assets:**   Man oh man, this guy has a lot of stuff, I mean he's in charge of a very major power company in the United States, who's profits average on $15 Billion in recent years. The man himself could easily live anywhere in the world, but he is rather fond of his lushly furnished executive office, which has also been converted into what could [easily](http://cdn.unilad.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-03-at-11.56.18.png) [count](http://storage.ubertor.com/juliedempsey.myubertor.com/content/image/13543.jpg) [as](http://images.pxlpartner.ch.s3.amazonaws.com/n28475/images/detailluzernbig/penthouse_1.jpg) [a](http://www.boracaypenthouse.com/files/6712/4948/8316/bath1%20035.jpg) [penthouse](http://gaycitynews.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PRICE-uws-One-Riverside-Park-Penthouse-IS.jpg) in its own right.

Speaking on Smith Power some more, it generally operates under the policy that any intern able to stay with the company and its strict and competitive environment would essentially be given a free ride into any university of the intern's choosing or just a large paypacket and addition to fulltime staff. Employees and interns are treated fairly shittily as noted in Marcus' personality, but the pay averages on $50 per hour and enough loopholes and bribes were made to allow Marcus to continue his highly unethical practices.

**In-Character Reputation:** Marcus Brandy Smith's reputation lives in a strange dichotomy, as he's easily one of the most terrible people in the public eye, but the sheer amounts of power that his company is able to put out and the sheer amount of persuasive personality oozing from Marcus are able to let him sway the public into not putting him on trial for his many crimes against humanity. Well that and he keeps his employees quiet on some of the more inhumane practices that his company is responsible for or able to deflect evidence as being a sort of ploy by his company rivals instead of anything that any sort of real weight. His employees are basically dead inside though, with many just trying to survive long enough to get paid and many more being envious of the R&amp;D Group that gets to avoid most of the dangers of working in Smith Power. Granted, there are a couple of employees that are fanatically loyal to Marcus himself, but it is what it is.

#Powers, Abilities, and Equipment

**Proposed Physical Tier:**  Low Tier Three

**Powers:**  

* Enhanced Vitality
  * Marcus has been gifted with the ability to survive the things that should be able to kill him or otherwise generally throw off his ability to live correctly. This makes him quite a bit more durable than your average Joe-Shcmoe. He's survived drunken falls from his penthouse office and being tossed around like a ragdoll by forces he should not have been tampering with. To be fair though, his limit would probably be the equivalent of several military strikes, at the very least putting him in the hospital and maybe killing him.
  * Even the things that have hurt him tend to get healed fairly quickly, with broken bones resetting in a couple days instead of weeks.  It is a bit slow compared to other people with healing powers, but eh, what can you do?
  * He can actually turn off this power when he really wants to, which is generally when he's wanting to feel what it's like to be drunk or high. 

* Enhanced Intuition 
  * This is more a highlight of Marcus' acute case of having no empathy for anyone and his prosopagnosia than it being an actual superpower, but Marcus is able to spin most people in the world link a string around his finger, even while treating them like utter shit. Granted, this might not work when he's in one of his more impulsive or reckless moods, but when he's calm, he's more than a force to reckoned with his force of self.
  * What is much more of a superpower is his intelligence and knack for plan making, having the ability to spark an idea from the literal abyss to come up with some sort of solution to his problem. Of course it might not be the best solution for the situation, but it will likely be enough to get whatever he wants done. Generally this involves him thinking of new sources for power that might be better than what he's doing now.

**Resources /Equipment:**  This man is bound to either be completely and utterly without preparation for the situation or he'll have everything he needs and then something he probably doesn't. His favorite thing to just casually carry around is probably his surfboard though, which he's not afraid to use as a weapon if he feels like hitting someone.

**Miscellaneous Skills:** Marcus is very good at surfing and playing the tamborine. He's also a college educated physics major. He also knows Spanish from watching far too much Mexican broadcasting while drunk or high.

**Strength:** Marcus is stronger than your average man, but he's still well inside of human limits, still needing help with the really heavy and awkward to carry stuff. He could probably carry something about 160ish kg with some difficulty. He shines here in being able to continuously lift things though, since his vitality gives him quite a bit of endurance, which bleeds into the other categories as well and won't be restated.

**Movement:**  On foot, Marcus can run a bit faster than the average guy and is able to just rely on his dead sprinting speed for running if he really needs to get moving, topping out at about 9 m/s. Generally he's just going to go and get in his car or on his motorcycle if he needs to be somewhere.

**Defense:** Here is Marcus' shining category, he's able to take a ton of punishment without going down anytime fast. This man is able to be thrown through a couple buildings and still be able to get up and be in walking shape. In general his ability to resist things is pretty damn impressive, being able to go far and beyond the human limits when it comes to just ignoring things like heat, cold, and pain. Also under defense is probably ~~deground~~ his healing ability, which is higher than most people's but still lower than someone with superhealing, he's able to get back to walking after breaking a spine in a couple days when most would be paralyzed.

**Perception/Awareness:** Because of his good deal of durability, Marcus generally isn't paying attention to things and this extends to serious situations, where he'll just not really be focusing on his opponents or surroundings unless he's actually trying to think of a solution. He suffers from face blindness though, so he is not actually able to remember what people look like, and has to rely on their body language if he is going to put forward any effort into learning who a person is. When he is trying, his perception is a bit above the human norm so that he can actually accomplish what he wants. He's also aware enough to be able to drive a motorcycle at speeds most would consider insanely reckless.

**Fighting Ability:** This man knows how to shoot a pistol and knows how to swing a punch, but if a person were to force him to fight then he's going to fight dirty as all hell and he's going to be putting himself as close to his opponent as possible since he can probably take most of what they can put out.

**Danger:** As an individual, Marcus is a bit more dangerous than the average human, but that is because of his pure and utter lack of humanity instead of anything special. With his power company, he's likely able to cause bad things to happen, but generally on accident from a generation plan going terribly wrong and endangering Chicago (which is thankfully large enough to have plans for such disasters though the nanobots take a lot of energy to rebuild on such a large scale). 

**Weaknesses:** He's really only super tough and clever, given enough time, most bruisers should be able to put him down for good. He also still needs to breath air.

I have known our roommate since I was 8 and for sake of ease I will call him Kevin. I have known our other male friend in the mix since I was 15 and we will call him Carl. Jay and Kevin have known each other since we were 11. Kevin, Jay and Carl have known each other since Kevin, Jay, and I were 15 and Carl was 14. 


I apologize in advance for how convoluted this situation gets. 


Alright- so Jay and I have always had a crazy relationship. He lived in another state for a few years and came home right after I graduated college/went through a rough breakup. We kind of dated for a while- decided to move in together into a 2 bedroom apt. 

Kevin was over at least 2 nights a week which always got on my nerves. 


Fast forward to the end of that lease the boys talk me into having Kevin move in with us at our new place- fine. 


Jay and I broke up this summer briefly. During this time I became friends with Rose (roommates gf). I introduced Rose and Kevin and they started dating. When they first started dating I had some boundary issues (they kept going into my room when I wasn't home type things).


Jay had even bigger issues with Rose because Rose would be left at the house for a few hours alone when Kevin went to work (Rose had an internship, just got a job) and Rose has made zero effort to get to know Jay. 


Jay and I got back together around Thanksgiving and he wanted to talk to Kevin about how much time Rose was over at the house- Rose uses our shower(sometimes with Kevin even though they know that is a boundary I have-and she never cleans her hair off the hair catch and leaves her razor in there), she uses the electricity ect- pays ZERO towards our rent, thinks its aokay because she does Kevins's chores(big dishes (pots/pans), sweep/mop, and bathrooms)and occasionally buys kevin stuff and is over all the time. When they started dating we had initially put a limit on how often she was over (2-3 days a week) so that we would all feel okay with the situation. She regularly stayed over 4-5 nights a week and the other 2-3 they would go else where but it made communicating with Kevin a big issue.


So fast forward- Kevin and Jay had a blow up after Jay and I sat down and asked Kevin if Rose would be willing to get to know Jay, move in, have a key, pay equal to everybody else ect bc it was the easiest solution we saw. Rose said no and sent a nasty fb message basically saying she did all this stuff for the house already and how dare I stoop so low as to ask her for money (mind you the stuff she does for the house is stuff Kevin is supposed to do on a regular basis- we all have our chores) so we sat back down to talk about it and the boys blew up at each other adn there was really no resolution except that our lease is up and we'll probably go separate ways. 


Anyhow to the issue at hand- our buddy Carl needed a place to crash for a couple weeks which is fine with everybody involved. Everybody knows and likes Carl


Carl came in knowing Jay and Kevin were on the outs and had mostly been talking to Jay and is better friends with Jay then Kevin (Jay and carl have lived together before). Jay wanted Carl to just be on his side of the fight and not talk to them. Jay also gets mad if I interact with kevin and Rose but sometimes interaction is necessary.-he thinks that if we communicate with them it reinforces that we are okay with how they are treating us and our home by her consistently disregarding us saying shes over to often. Well Carl has been with us since Saturday and last night while Jay was at work decided he wanted to spend at least a little time with Kevin and Rose so he, Kevin and Rose had a movie/food night in Kevin's room. Carl asked if I would just let him know around when Jay was supposed to be home so he wouldnt get bitched at. So I went to Kevins's room at 9 and warned Carl it was time- we all kind of got wrapped up in the movie for a minute and I had been carrying my own coffee mug I drink out of around. As I walked out of the room, Jay was walking in the door way to turn the corner to go up to our room and definitely saw me come out of Kevin's room and hasn't spoken to Carl or I since. 


I don't know how to deal with getting the silent treatment- its predominately what led to our break up this summer was me pushing him to talk when he was giving the silent treatment so I guess I'm looking for advice on how to deal with the silent treatment and any advice on how to deal with our living situation currently- I don't hate Kevin or Rose. I just don't like the fact that shes mooching off of us and makes zero effort to be on good terms with Jay and i don't agree with Jay or Kevin on the issue of Rose. Neither of them is right and I feel stuck in the middle. Carl just kind of got himself thrown into this mess and got stuck in the middle




   
**tl;dr**: My messy living situation has lead my bf to give both me and our friend the silent treatment and I am looking at positive ways to deal with the silent treatment and move forward from this situation"
44tp6t,6,2016-02-08,Don't know what to do,Mira113,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/44tp6t/dont_know_what_to_do/,"I'm tired of trying so hard everyday. There's nobody who would care if I died, they'd either be relieved to finally be rid of me or annoyed at the troubles I cause them. 

I had been wanting to die for years, only thing that kept me from it is my cowardice. I suck at everything I do, so I'm too afraid to fuck up trying to kill myself to do it. It had been ok for a few months, I mean, I didn't want to live, but I didn't want to die either, I was more in a state of whatever happens happens, if I get run over and die that's fine. I had been getting along alright with others in my class, I was even thinking that maybe I could consider them friends, which I was surprised to end up thinking since I've been betrayed by every friends I've ever had and didn't think I'd ever be up for it again. However, I started thinking and, they only ever deal with me when they want my help, never for any reason. I sometimes go to talk to them just for the hell of it and they're polite enough to continue the conversation, but always try to end it so they can do something else. I guess that's still better than how most other people treat me, but I know that's going to change once our big team project is going to be finished since they won't have any uses for me afterwards.

A few months ago I started a transition because I found out I was transgender. I do feel a bit better about myself, which doesn't mean much considering how much I hated myself before. I had figured that if I didn't hate myself I could deal with having a bit more difficulty with other people, but it's proving to be harder than I thought. I expected people to treat me like crap because of what I am, I've been bullied pretty much all my life, so I could have handled that I guess. Turns out nobody does that, instead they all avoid me. I lost the few friends I had shortly after telling them about it since they started ignoring me and because of that we haven't talked or had any form of contact in the past 6 months, the people I was going to school with try to avoid having to deal with me. It just feels so hard being avoided like this. I wouldn't go back to before my transition even if I could, because I know I wouldn't be any better since I'd just hate myself to the point of making myself sick so instead I'm stuck with having everybody act like I don't exist unless I can be useful.

I'm also broke, no money to myself, though I still live with my parents, so I guess that's fine for now, but I can't manage to get a part time job, either because of my bad personality, ugly appearance, how much I suck at everything or because I'm trans, or maybe a bit of everything. I had applied for an internship at a video game company a few summers back, because I got denied being told I would be ""a waste of ressources"". I guess they're not wrong, there's nothing good about me, so no matter what I do, I'm still just wasting everything that's spent on me.

I sort of hate my parents. My dad keeps bringing up that it's thanks to him that I'm alive whenever I do anything that offends him, but it makes me furious every time he says it. I never asked to be born, and I'd rather be dead, and he'd rather never have had me too. After all, my parents cleared told me that they wanted to have a child, but that they regret having had me, and they told me that long ago, before they knew I was trans, or before I because a useless loser who can't get a job and is still living with their parents even though I'm 22 years old.

Honestly, I don't know what to do. I want to die, but I know I'm too much of a coward to actually go through with it and I feel like I'm not going to die anytime soon if I don't do it myself."
44tqw7,2,2016-02-08,"I'm sick of not having friends or connecting to others, and am ready to change my life",throwdatassinacircle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/44tqw7/im_sick_of_not_having_friends_or_connecting_to/,"21, F here.  Sorry for the long post or jarbled ranting nonsense.  To preface, I was always a quiet kid, not because I was afraid to talk, but because I felt like I never had anything to say.  I didn't feel uncomfortable about being quiet until being bombarded every day with comments from just about everyone about why I was quiet. I guess that eventually developed into shyness/social anxiety/awkwardness.  I had a best friend in middle and high school, and acted just like her (extroverted, silly, etc).  When I moved out of state my junior year of high school, I didn't speak a word to anyone, feel into a deep depression and hated everything about myself and how quiet I was, and realized that I'd only had the friends I had back home because I was essentially a clone of that other girl.  The miniscule amount of friends I had at the new school was due to other people approaching me and asking me to hang out (but never me doing the same).  When I came back home my senior year of high school, I no longer copied the best friend.  I wasn't quiet, but I was definitely more calmed and less attention seeking in my demeanor (the best friend is a very ""PAY ATTENTION TO ME ALWAYS"" person).  I was honestly dead inside, not knowing how to be my own person.

So I thought going to college out of state and ""starting new"" would change things.  Nope, I was awkward and quiet and resting bitched faced there too.  But I always made the excuse ""this school is too small and preppy and so different from my ghetto ass hometown, and I have nothing in common with many people, and yadayada"" So I thought, transferring colleges would definitely change things.  Nope.  The college I'm at now is huge and literally 90 something percent commuter, and a lot of people work and are busy, a lot different from the expensive liberal arts college I transferred from.  But people still have friend groups.  My first semester at college #2 as a commuter, I ""faked it til I made it,"" using internet advice and stuff, and actually made a few friends/acquaintances.  This fall and spring, I decided to live on campus, and I feel like everything is back to square one.  

I've fallen out of touch with the friends I made from my first semester at College #2 (last spring), and now even the few friends from College #1 barely contact me.  For my 21st birthday, everyone who said they would come didn't, except an old friend from from college #1 and one of her friends.  Even my boyfriend (of like a month at the time) didn't come because he ""had a bad headache from work"".  I was devastated and wanted to die, and although I tried to tell myself it was because the night I planned my birthday it was raining really hard and that's why no one came, it was the first moment I realized I truly don't have anyone  close to me.  

Speaking of boyfriend, I feel like the only reason I got with him is because we were coworkers at a retail job, and I had to act bubbly at work, giving him the false impression that that's who I am all the time.  It was also during the summer of my ""fake it til I make it"" phase after my first semester at college #2 that we met.  When I'm at school or elsewhere now, that is not me.  I've over time gained confidence in my physical appearance, and I can communicate with people ""normally"" and be funny and give presentations, and have chitchats and study sessions, but beyond that close friendships do not grow, not even with friends I've had for years.  Not even with that girl I was friends with since middle school. 

I kept telling myself that my social life is fading because I'm overloaded with school and work, and the dorming social life at school #2 isn't for me.  I'm more of a artsy fartsy, outdoorsy scifi chick, and a lot of the people in the dorms at this school are ghetto as fuck.  I kept saying I can't make friends in my major classes, because I can't relate to the basic white girls and the dumb stuff they talked about.  I can't make friends here or there because it's OTHER PEOPLE, not ME with the problem. Communication works both ways, but why should I contact the friends I do have?  It's not like they'd wanna hang out with me anyway.

Basically, typical judgemental superiority/inferiority complex selfishness.  From the outside looking in, I appear confident and friendly and put together.  But I have no one.  I only hang out with my boyfriend and maybe an old friend or two from college #1 once or twice a month, if that.  The rest of my social interaction is with classmates, coworkers, and customers.  When guys talk to me, unless they are obviously gay or have a girlfriend, I am terrified they want something from me other than friendship and are pretending to be nice to get it, and keep myself kind but curt out of fear of being friendly and accidentally leading them on.  For all I know, they could think I'm the ugliest chick they've ever seen, but that's how I act and I hate it.  Many of my few female friends are not necessarily ""hot"" or traditionally attractive, and I would tell myself that it's because they are ""nicer"" than hot girls, but now I think I honestly feel threatened by girls who are attractive or prettier than me.  Even though I tell myself looks are not everything and personality is important, and I'm usually confident/okay with my appearance especially after realizing for the first time that I'm actually really damn good-looking when I try, I still feel like an insecure little girl around attractive women.  Because of my quiet demeanor outside of work, I also feel like I come off as a stuck up bitch, but the way I think sometimes, I feel like I am a stuck up bitch.

I have many attributes and traits about myself that I do not like.  I've reminded myself time and time again to not do such a such today, or to smile when walking to not appear mean, or to understand that every human is the same complex creature, but when I'm out in public outside of my job, I forget everything and don't actively take steps to empathize with or socialize with people beyond the basics.  I can smile and hold small talk with attractive women now, but I'm always wondering ""I bet her life is way better than mine"" (as if that's a problem anyway), I can give class presentations no problem and am usually the one others come to when they don't understand things, but it's been a long time since I've stayed up late laughing, genuinely laughing and bonding, with someone other than my boyfriend and 1 friend.  

Extracurriculars here are basically nonexistent, and I have recently gotten a new job that pays 12/hr, which is a step up from my 7.25/hr retail job.  I'm taken 16 credit hrs, working part time, applying for grad school and summer internships, and in my first real relationship since a two week stint my freshman year of highschool.  I feel overwhelmed but I don't want to lose anything by having a shitty personality, and I would like to be more outgoing and surrounded by friends and close relationships.  I feel as though all of my opportunities in life have come from faking it, but I really want to feel it.  I want to change who I am, like yesterday, and I know that can only happen by just being, in the moment, the person I know I can be.  

What steps can I take to stop being this childish person?  Once I hit grad school, I can not be stand offish with others in my cohort because they're ""basic"" and we have different interests.  I don't want to lose a guy I care about because I act differently when he's not around.  I don't want to spend most nights and free days alone because ""no one gets me"".  I really believe that close emotional relationships with family and friends is a major key to happiness, and something I never learned in my 21 years of life. Another thing I noticed during my ""fake it"" phase is that while trying to be genuinely interested in new people and engaging with them, sometimes after a while I would become physically exhausted.  This is linked to ""introversion,"" but I don't want to use that as a crutch or excuse for coming off as a bitch, and was wondering if there is a way to not feel tired while talking to people for long periods of time without caffeine.  

tldr:  I'm stuck up but also insecure but also like being alone but also get really really sad and lonely if alone for too long but also have personality issues I need to work on, help"
44tsn6,0,2016-02-08,Junior that is losing hope in this major. Could use some advice/guidance.,throwawaycheme,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/44tsn6/junior_that_is_losing_hope_in_this_major_could/,"First off I would like to say hello to everyone in the subreddit and say that I have enjoyed going through some of the content here. So thanks for that! 

Right now however, I am definitely at a crossroads with this degree. I am a 6th semester junior and really just feeling like I haven't learned a single thing yet. But at this point, I am convinced I cannot turn back now this deep in the major.

I think the main issue for me with this major is that I feel like I have not learned a single useful employable skill. However, I do think this could just be based on the university I go to (state school). I do agree with people that say it gives you problem solving skills, etc., etc.. I feel like a lot of the stuff I am learning also such as basic thermo, fluids, and kinetics is just all busy work. I guess this point in the major I'm just learning all of the background. I'm hoping next year it gets at least a little better...

I compare myself to my computer science friends that are learning all kinds of coding languages, and my mechanical friends that are getting great at solid works and CAD. My school has us doing an assignment here and there in MATLAB and ASPEN, but they are barely ever used in our classes so I would consider myself far less than familiar with those those softwares. Why would someone higher me as a chemical engineer if they could simply higher a mechanical engineer (can model things) or a computer/electrical engineer that could code things? I'm not really seeing any advantage a chemical engineer has over them. (Again this may be due to the poor curriculum at my university).

For the past 5 semesters I have been working crazy to get my GPA to 3.7+ and got an internship (plastics) last summer, but even the process engineers I worked with seemed like they never used a single ounce of knowledge they learned from a typical ChemE curriculum. They honestly just felt like glorified technicians that sat at desks and talked to customers.

I guess that was just a rant, but I did have one question:

If I were to possibly teach myself something on my own time that could increase my chance of landing a job next year, or finding a new interest in this major, is there anything you guys could recommend? I am not a genius, but a hard worker. I would take the time to learn a certain programming language or maybe even some type of computer modeling to do on the side if it will benefit my employability. 

It is just that right now I feel useless and somewhat jipped from the money I have paid to study this major at school. It has cost a lot of money for me and my family and I just don't see the reward...

Any advice or suggestions to finding a meaningful future in this field would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if none of this made sense, I am just trying to blow some steam out for my frustration with this major. 

EDIT: Just realized when I posted how long this ended up being...sorry for that everyone. I guess a TLDR would be why have I almost learned nothing useful yet in 6 semesters and what can I do to change that? Anything I can teach myself to find a passion in this major/ increase my employability for next year at the same time? Just very lost with how this has all gone the past 3 years. Also I forgot to add I have gotten into research with a professor, but however feel like more of a laborer running experiments, than a true researcher...kind of disappointing. "
44tx1f,1,2016-02-08,I just want to take a minute and say how much I'm loving this!,[deleted],FreeCodeCamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCodeCamp/comments/44tx1f/i_just_want_to_take_a_minute_and_say_how_much_im/,"OK, so a little background info: I took a computer programming class in high school. It was difficult to say the least. Because I found it overwhelmingly difficult, I dropped the class. School in general was always a struggle for me. I basically graduated high school on a plea bargain. I found out that it was neither my fault, nor the fault of my teachers. Simply, the way that I learn and the way that things are taught in school is like oil and water. So it was like there was a brick wall between me and the teacher. 

I'm a big time music geek and so after high school and working for a year I eventually went to college for audio engineering. I loved it! Working in a recording studio, learning about how sound works and getting to record great music was a thrill! The problem is audio engineering doesn't work like other industries. It's full of artsy types and there's not much structure. And it's also very much a niche thing, so it's a very difficult industry to crack into unless you can afford a year unpaid internship in a recording studio. 

So I had to move back home with my parents. I got a job at a factory that makes magazines. Literally a dead-end job because print media is a dying industry. That's where I currently work and sometimes it's busy but sometimes I go months without working a shift. 

I had built a few Wordpress websites using drag and drop applications like Artisteer, with some HTML thrown in the mix. My friend who went to university for computer science was impressed with my ability to throw together a website and thought I should do it as a side business. I didn't want to because I really don't know that much about it. I just learned what I needed to out of necessity. 

This past weekend he told me about FCC and so far I've completed 51 challenges. The reason I think I've taken to it is because I can see exactly what it's doing right in front of me. It doesn't feel like school and I can learn at my own pace. And I have the chat screen right there if I'm stuck or I don't understand something. I really hope this leads to a great career because I really feel like I can do this! I also don't have to go into $30,000 of debt to learn this stuff. Anyway, just wanted to share! "
44tzo4,2,2016-02-08,Raising money for a Venezuelan student (me) who can't buy a new computer,EpicChiguire,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/44tzo4/raising_money_for_a_venezuelan_student_me_who/,"Hey guys! I hope this finds you well. I am going to share what a friend from the US did for me on GoFundMe today:

""Hi! My name is Jorge and I am trying to raise money for Marcos. Marcos is a 20 year old student in Venezuela, I know him since many years ago when I met him one time I was in Venezuela and we are good friends. He studies Modern Languages and he’s specializing in Translations. He is a 7th Day Adventist boy who loves reading, writing, history, linguistics, and gaming a lot. He is a good student, and he has an excellent sense of humor that he loves sharing with everyone around him. He has also started to gain experience in the world of translations in helping to translate and edit a book published last year in Venezuela, where he is credited as one of the editors.

He also helps to translate in the soccer fansite Grup14 (here’s the link to his profile in the site: https://grup14.com/member/marcos-gonzalez) and here is the first article he has helped to back-translate, this is, from Spanish to English ( https://grup14.com/article/how-can-aleix-vidal-help-barcelona-midway-through-the-season).

What is the problem? The only PC he has ever owned, the one he has used since 2009, is in a terrible condition, and he is in the dire need of a new one. Most of the time he is working in a translation or writing, the machine is constantly stuttering and freezing, to the point where it needs to be reset in order to function again, until it starts stuttering and freezing again. He has taken care of this machine, and he has tried to upgrade it, but to no avail, because after every upgrade and formatting he has performed, the computer is old and it just doesn't work as it used to do before. That PC is where he works, he studies, he writes, he works on his essays, he watches his movies, etcetera. This last year was rough because the PC started to fail a lot and this almost influenced his grades, for it got damaged for some weeks and that’s where all of his info and his essays are stored. As a future translator, that little machine is all he needs to work, and if he doesn't have one, what is he going to work with?

And why can’t he buy a new computer on his own? He is from Venezuela, a country that is suffering a lot, delinquency is ruling the streets, with the most dangerous city in the world (Caracas), one of the most high inflation rates in the world, and with a scarcity of the most basic products (like floor, milk, toilet paper, and shampoo). Even the Venezuelan Congress declared a “healthcare crisis” this last week, in order to bring more medicines and humanitarian help, because not even the people with cancer have access to their more basic medical treatments. Life in Venezuela is rough, because the country lives a situation of unrest, where its citizens have to stay for hours in long queues to buy what they can find, and where the economic situation restricts many, if not most of them from living like a modern western society. Marcos is directly affected by this situation, because he not only studies, but he also works teaching English, and his total income is about 9$ A MONTH (because Venezuelan economy is so broken that the minimal wage compared to the black market dollar, the one that Venezuelans use because the government has a very strict currency exchange, is almost 9$), and all of it goes to his personal expenditures, like food, items for college, etc. That’s why he can’t get a new computer even if he saves all of his money without buying anything else, and he’s nervous about what happens when the one he owns finally bites the dust and he’ll have nothing to work with.

That is why I want to help Marcos to get a new machine, the one I think he deserves. A laptop he can use for college (to translate, to write his essays, to study), but also for his personal entertainment. I know that this would mean the world to him, because he would be able to focus on his studies with his only tool without the fear of losing it, he could translate, read, all of this possible with his brand new PC, which can last him for many years and, again, be essential in the task of helping him with his studies, which he values a lot. If possible, but not obligatory, I would like to ask to get him also a memoQ Translator Pro license (a very useful translation software that he loves, it costs 770$) that I’m sure he’ll appreciate and use a lot on what’s left of his bachelor program and the internship he is planning to take in 2017, God willing.

Thank you so much for reading this!

Blessings!""

44u1m6,0,2016-02-08,My best friend is super competitive with me and its greatly affecting our friendship,bfflThrowaway23,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/44u1m6/my_best_friend_is_super_competitive_with_me_and/,"Let me say that I don't have that many female friends because I've found it hard to get along with them most of my life. I went to a uni-preparatory school in a relatively rural town for 8 years, although I lived at home with my parents.

I met Kandi my senior year at a ""college meet"" event in my town, where people going to the same College as me were to meet up. We instantly became good friends and share a lot of interests. We are both CS majors. Now both Kandi and I are juniors in College, and have been best friends. I adore her and her personality- she is beautiful inside and out, but she has been competitive. I recently got a highly prestigious tech internship, and she was the first I shared the news with.

She then proceeded to tell me how that ""company was really terrible"" and how I would only be making X amount of money, and that my dad probably helped me score it (he didn't- it was because of my own work). That was in December.

 I had been in a relationship for 3 years and we broke up in October (it was mutual). Still, it definitely hurt a lot and Kandi gave me ""advice"". She basically told me that ""guys don't like girls like"" bffThrowaway23, and that she wasn't surprised. 

Trying to get over him, after giving myself some time to be single, I started talking to more guys. She has been secretly sabotaging my love life. She Facebook messaged one of my dates from my Mac and started liking all of his old pictures. He was pretty creeped out because we weren't even Facebook friends.  She thought it was funny.

I then found out she went on a date with the same guy about a week later. Then she even started ""flirting"" with my ex-boyfriend in public, in front of me.

She recently applied to the same companies I did and was rejected by the one I am interning with over the summer. When she was rejected, she said that ""I have a higher GPA than you but I still got rejected. They don't want pretty girls working for them. My beauty will distract the others working there"". It has been a constant 1-upping contest- she has to have the better grades, the smaller waist and the larger bust. When guys flirt with me, ""its because you're so exotic looking. Most guys at this school need a proper girlfriend"". (proper = white). She said all the time that she's so happy her ""parents aren't Indian  like yours. You're always so oppressed"". I couldn't help but laugh because my parents have been nothing but supportive. That was also the last straw.  

Not willing to put up with her and her ridiculousness,  I distanced myself from her - as much as I could, because she's my roommate-  but now she is coming running back- begging. She says she misses me, and wants to hang out with me. She has left me several messages and missed calls. She says she didn't realize how ""mean she was being until now"". She waits until I come back home and nags me for hours.

I think my work history is killing me.,amotion578,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44uftj/i_cant_get_an_interview_for_basic_help_desk/,"I'm aiming for Systems Administration as my end goal. My current goal is to get into help desk tier 1 support to build my experience and career.

I've been an on and off student since January 2009 at my local community college. I've been financially independent since 2010 and feel like I've screwed myself over by working full time and taking a class here and there. They've all been customer service roles and my past employers have gotten to see how adept I am at solving problems, computers or otherwise.

I'm one of those millenials that grew up on Windows 95, 98, and XP. I cracked open my first case at age 8 to upgrade RAM, stuff like that. I worked retail PC repair in 2012-2013 and use a coworker as a reference who is blown away that I'm struggling to find work with my skill set.

My last job was at a call center out of town that paid poorly supporting financial software. I resigned because it wasn't a good fit, being that a call center cares about call center BS and not actually solving problems. That and the commute was costing me a lot of money in gas and a lot of unnecessary wear and tear on my daily driver. 4 months total.

I worked at a dealership before that as I'm a car enthusiast as well and worked there for 22 months before getting dismissed for no explainable reason. I started as a lot tech and took a position at the luxury brand to be basically tech support for the sat nav and radio (its that advanced and well, old people don't understand technology so well).

Before that I was at the retail store and before that I held a mental health staff position at my state's mental health agency (it paid stupid amounts but there was 0 room to grow).

I'm getting letters of recommendation from my former boss at the dealership and from my coworker at the retail store. I have one currently from my boss at the state who absolutely loved me and is dumbfounded I'm not in IT already.

I apply for entry level stuff that I meet minimum qualifications for through shared experience, however because its not truly IT work I feel like I get skipped over. 

I'm 99 credit hours into my Associates degree and have 6 specific classes to complete to get it with a certificate of completion in computer systems support. 3 more classes nets me two additional certificates in systems administration and network management and systems security.

At this time I'm fed up trying to support myself alone and leeching off my parents, so I've applied for FAFSA. The classes I need to take are not offered every term of course and I'm looking at another year to complete them all.

The jobs I've applied for I've seen the starting pay and I've thought that I'd seriously take way less to start just to prove my worth and build up to the listed entry pay. The duties are things I'm more than qualified to do. 

Problem is since I don't have my degree, nor official IT experience, and a varied job history, I'm just straight up struggling to even talk to a human. I just want interviews. Or an internship. But I think employers look at my history and instantly bar me. Or I'm on a blacklist somewhere of people not to hire. It's what it feels like.

I don't know what else to do. I'm sitting down with academic and career advisors in the next two weeks to talk about my situation. If I can manage to survive the next month I'll have a class needed to graduate to take spring term. To fill out my schedule I was thinking about taking business management classes since that's my end goal.

Any advice or help to get me into entry IT would be great. Thanks in advance."
44uife,19,2016-02-08,Do you ever wonder what type of person you'd be like with better parents?,fergiefergz,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/44uife/do_you_ever_wonder_what_type_of_person_youd_be/,"Honestly, I grew up being blamed for everything. This isn't an exaggeration. My mom has always slightly (maybe fully) resented me for looking more like my dad and acting like him. 

Anyway, I could tolerate her before last year, but she's become more unbearable and I'm starting to get depressed again. It all started last Monday, when I left a bowl in the sink to soak. She told me to wash it, I told her I was letting it soak and I'd wash it before we left for school. She told me to use my fingernails, to which I responded no to because I didn't want oatmeal under my fingernails (they're not painted). So on the way to school, she doesn't talk to me. She just acts all mad. In the evening, when she comes back home. She started yelling about how disrespectful I was for not washing the bowl when she asked, she literally held this anger in for more than 12 hours. Then she goes on to talk about how messy I am. I keep the kitchen, living room, and bathroom clean. I don't make my bed. So what? I'm in college, having to commute 2+ hours to school, work a part time job, and am stressed. Give me a break.

*Silent treatment for two days*

Just this past Saturday, I'm studying for my Business Law exam. She tells me she knows a website full of court cases that she thinks will help me with the exam. I say my professor said we didn't have to know any court cases and that there are plenty of cases in the textbook. Apparently something I said made her mad (don't know what). But she hasn't talked to me since then. Yesterday, I watched the superbowl in my bedroom on my laptop while she called my sister over to watch the game with her in the living room. My sister and I will communicate at dinner, and she will just eat in silence.

It's getting to the point where I kind of just hate my life. Your parents are the ones who help build your confidence and it just sucks when one parent holds grudges for every little wrong thing you did? It's why I'm so insecure. I can't talk to guys. I can't make friends as easily as everyone else because I'm afraid they're judging me. It is so hard sometimes. I'm trying to be an RA at my university, and I just got placed as an alternate RA, which means I'm on the waitlist. When I got that email, I just felt like I could never be happy. I'm always going to live under her wrath. It doesn't even matter that I got an internship with a big multibillion dollar firm or that I care about my grades/career or that I'm not out there partying/being a bad role model for my sister. She will always ask me, ""How do you bring value to the family?"" in efforts to try to make me feel bad for basically existing. Or tell me I'm the roadblock that's stopping her from getting to her destination...just because a plate isn't set the right way on a plate rack. She is such a bully. Sorry I just wanted to vent.

44uju1,3,2016-02-08,Marcus Brandy Smith,TwilitKing,randomsuperpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/44uju1/marcus_brandy_smith/,"**Name/Aliases:**  Marcus Brandy Smith

**Age:** 29

**Species/Race:** White Human of Mixed European Descent

**Physical Description:**  Marcus is a bit of an enigma when it comes to his appearance, meant in like one of the least literal ways of course. To be less terribly vague, imagine the CEO of a company, make that man look more like a jerk, give him a bit of stubborn/drunken stubble to line his straightlined jaw of a face. Then give him some thick black-brown hair that is gelled to stay in a bit of roll back around his nape and make his hair line a bit on the lower end, though with his bangs separated in such a way that the right side has just enough extra to make his hair look extra nice a lush. Then take a look into his eye sockets and put in two bright green eyes, with the type of look to make it how obviously he doesn't care about you and also coming with a fair bit of reckless incompetence. 

Then picture him in a suit, in a bathrobe, and then also in a Hawaiian shirt. He's got a bit of tone to his muscles and is a bit closer to the buff side than the lean side, though it probably doesn't help that he is almost 6' 2"" and weighs about 230 lbs. He also wears shoes sometimes, though other times he also wears sandals to go banister surfing. Okay, we're nearly there with the description, picture him in your brain space really really hard and you can see him, but he's missing one thing, right? No wait, I think that's all, well that's what he looks like at the very least.

**Mentality:**  Marcus Brandy Smith is an asshole. He really only cares about making things better off for himself, which most of the time means trying to generate more power for his company and having the time of his life while doing so. He's the guy you'd be more likely to see lounging in his company chair and popping a variety of illicit drugs to make watching Netflix reruns more amusing instead of presenting the image of a capable man to his company or the public. Of course he also enjoys playing Foosball while drunk with his incredibly sober interns. Speaking about his interns, Marcus has literally no value for human lives beyond his own, willing to send interns to their deaths if it means he could stand a chance to benefit from it. He has a few favorite employees that work for him and he might show a bit of mourning if they were to perhaps perish by chance, but he wouldn't let it weigh him down way too long.

This isn't to say he isn't a brilliant man, because he totally is, but he is a slave to his impulses, always willing to take the easy way out instead of following through to do something correctly. If he learns how to make exceptional amounts of power by pulling off the whiskers of a new born kitten, you can be sure that he will send his interns to go ahead to pluck those whiskers. He also has a hard time taking troubles seriously, or at least on a surface level, which leads to him coming off as more than a bit incompetent. When he's motivated though, Marcus is able to get people swooning for him and forgiving him for his many transgressions, or at the very least probably able to pay off people who wouldn't be taken by words alone. He also refers to everyone by nicknames instead of their actual names, and has made it a policy to only call his interns Jimmy and Janie when he refers to them.

**Backstory:** Marcus Brandy Smith was born to the Smith family in the year that his age would allow him to be born, his father was already in charge of the Smith Power Company in Chicago and made a quite a good deal of money. But it probably helped quite a bit that Marcus was a bit on the genius side, he got the best education his parent could provide, and by the time he 16 he was graduating from CIT at the top of his class.

He was living the life that boy was, well if you count not having any friends and barely having any exposure outside of familial and scholarly. I guess no one can really be surprised that as soon as he touched alcohol he was hooked, it really helped him wind down from the giant stress ball that his life had become. Though one thing leads to another and Marcus was doing all sorts of drugs, many that likely should have killed him.

Lucky for him, right? Being killed by drugs would totally suck for most people, wouldn't it? Almost as much as having your parents murdered by some random loonie one the way to a ribbon cutting ceremony. Oh wait, that second thing actually did happen to Marcus, welp. At least by this point he was 19 years old, and thereby able to have his father's entire company shoved onto his shoulders. 

Most people forecasted that the little Smith was going to end up screwing over Smith Power, which is funny because that's actually what was happening. The board was beginning to make their moves to get rid of Marcus from the CEO position so that someone more competent than a genius druggie could be put in charge. Poor little Marcus was being pushed to his breaking point, he couldn't handle all the pressure and could barely bring himself to speak at board meetings. There was one thing he could do though, and that was think and work on ways to earn the company a more efficient form of energy generation to beat out the competitors and get their power stations installed everywhere.

Maybe he was pushed just a little too hard though, cause it made something snap in the adult-child's mind. He made his breakthrough thankfully just in time for the next meeting, though when he was a bit late the board started to make their motions to remove him from his seat and begin putting someone else in charge. Then those guys were interrupted by Marcus rolling a cart into the board room and unveiling a generator and opened with a confidence that they had never seen before and the words, ""Gentleman! I've made a breakthrough!"" to accompany it. More surprised were they when the generator, when hooked to a Multimeter was able to produce wattage than they had hardly imagined was possible the display was able to secure Marcus' spot as CEO.

What the board didn't know was what was powering the generator, though one of the janitor's never did report back to their station after checking up on the genius. Marcus was merely happy to have himself in what he saw as his rightful place, though if someone could watch his mind during those pressured hours, they would notice that something had to have snapped inside of him, and of course they would be correct since Marcus had basically trapped a janitor inside of a generator to basically drain him to death for his energy. Our protagonist was also a bit more confident following his ordeal, no longer caring about the thoughts of those around him, in fact he could hardly care about anything about those people, just as long as he succeeded.

And those were catalysts that got the ball rolling for the Marcus Brandy Smith of today, and in the years since he has used his sheer amounts of persuasive potential and complete and utter lack of morals to bring Smith Power into prominence, providing power for Chicago in anyway he can find from the lives of criminals on death row to opening other dimensions to yank power out of.

**Resources/Assets:**   Man oh man, this guy has a lot of stuff, I mean he's in charge of a very major power company in the United States, who's profits average on $15 Billion in recent years. The man himself could easily live anywhere in the world, but he is rather fond of his lushly furnished executive office, which has also been converted into what could [easily](http://cdn.unilad.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-03-at-11.56.18.png) [count](http://storage.ubertor.com/juliedempsey.myubertor.com/content/image/13543.jpg) [as](http://images.pxlpartner.ch.s3.amazonaws.com/n28475/images/detailluzernbig/penthouse_1.jpg) [a](http://www.boracaypenthouse.com/files/6712/4948/8316/bath1%20035.jpg) [penthouse](http://gaycitynews.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PRICE-uws-One-Riverside-Park-Penthouse-IS.jpg) in its own right.

Speaking on Smith Power some more, it generally operates under the policy that any intern able to stay with the company and its strict and competitive environment would essentially be given a free ride into any university of the intern's choosing or just a large paypacket and addition to fulltime staff. Employees and interns are treated fairly shittily as noted in Marcus' personality, but the pay averages on $50 per hour and enough loopholes and bribes were made to allow Marcus to continue his highly unethical practices.

**In-Character Reputation:** Marcus Brandy Smith's reputation lives in a strange dichotomy, as he's easily one of the most terrible people in the public eye, but the sheer amounts of power that his company is able to put out and the sheer amount of persuasive personality oozing from Marcus are able to let him sway the public into not putting him on trial for his many crimes against humanity. Well that and he keeps his employees quiet on some of the more inhumane practices that his company is responsible for or able to deflect evidence as being a sort of ploy by his company rivals instead of anything that any sort of real weight. His employees are basically dead inside though, with many just trying to survive long enough to get paid and many more being envious of the R&amp;D Group that gets to avoid most of the dangers of working in Smith Power. Granted, there are a couple of employees that are fanatically loyal to Marcus himself, but it is what it is.

#Powers, Abilities, and Equipment

**Proposed Physical Tier:**  Low Tier Three

**Powers:**  

* Enhanced Vitality
  * Marcus has been gifted with the ability to survive the things that should be able to kill him or otherwise generally throw off his ability to live correctly. This makes him quite a bit more durable than your average Joe-Shcmoe. He's survived drunken falls from his penthouse office and being tossed around like a ragdoll by forces he should not have been tampering with. To be fair though, his limit would probably be the equivalent of several military strikes, at the very least putting him in the hospital and maybe killing him.
  * Even the things that have hurt him tend to get healed fairly quickly, with broken bones resetting in a couple days instead of weeks.  It is a bit slow compared to other people with healing powers, but eh, what can you do?
  * He can actually turn off this power when he really wants to, which is generally when he's wanting to feel what it's like to be drunk or high. 

* Enhanced Intuition 
  * This is more a highlight of Marcus' acute case of having no empathy for anyone and his prosopagnosia than it being an actual superpower, but Marcus is able to spin most people in the world link a string around his finger, even while treating them like utter shit. Granted, this might not work when he's in one of his more impulsive or reckless moods, but when he's calm, he's more than a force to reckoned with his force of self.
  * What is much more of a superpower is his intelligence and knack for plan making, having the ability to spark an idea from the literal abyss to come up with some sort of solution to his problem. Of course it might not be the best solution for the situation, but it will likely be enough to get whatever he wants done. Generally this involves him thinking of new sources for power that might be better than what he's doing now.

**Resources /Equipment:**  This man is bound to either be completely and utterly without preparation for the situation or he'll have everything he needs and then something he probably doesn't. His favorite thing to just casually carry around is probably his surfboard though, which he's not afraid to use as a weapon if he feels like hitting someone.

**Miscellaneous Skills:** Marcus is very good at surfing and playing the tamborine. He's also a college educated physics major. He also knows Spanish from watching far too much Mexican broadcasting while drunk or high.

**Strength:** Marcus is stronger than your average man, but he's still well inside of human limits, still needing help with the really heavy and awkward to carry stuff. He could probably carry something about 160ish kg with some difficulty. He shines here in being able to continuously lift things though, since his vitality gives him quite a bit of endurance, which bleeds into the other categories as well and won't be restated.

**Movement:**  On foot, Marcus can run a bit faster than the average guy and is able to just rely on his dead sprinting speed for running if he really needs to get moving, topping out at about 9 m/s. Generally he's just going to go and get in his car or on his motorcycle if he needs to be somewhere.

**Defense:** Here is Marcus' shining category, he's able to take a ton of punishment without going down anytime fast. This man is able to be thrown through a couple buildings and still be able to get up and be in walking shape. In general his ability to resist things is pretty damn impressive, being able to go far and beyond the human limits when it comes to just ignoring things like heat, cold, and pain. Also under defense is probably ~~deground~~ his healing ability, which is higher than most people's but still lower than someone with superhealing, he's able to get back to walking after breaking a spine in a couple days when most would be paralyzed.

**Perception/Awareness:** Because of his good deal of durability, Marcus generally isn't paying attention to things and this extends to serious situations, where he'll just not really be focusing on his opponents or surroundings unless he's actually trying to think of a solution. He suffers from face blindness though, so he is not actually able to remember what people look like, and has to rely on their body language if he is going to put forward any effort into learning who a person is. When he is trying, his perception is a bit above the human norm so that he can actually accomplish what he wants. He's also aware enough to be able to drive a motorcycle at speeds most would consider insanely reckless.

**Fighting Ability:** This man knows how to shoot a pistol and knows how to swing a punch, but if a person were to force him to fight then he's going to fight dirty as all hell and he's going to be putting himself as close to his opponent as possible since he can probably take most of what they can put out.

**Danger:** As an individual, Marcus is a bit more dangerous than the average human, but that is because of his pure and utter lack of humanity instead of anything special. With his power company, he's likely able to cause bad things to happen, but generally on accident from a generation plan going terribly wrong and endangering Chicago (which is thankfully large enough to have plans for such disasters though the nanobots take a lot of energy to rebuild on such a large scale). 

**Weaknesses:** He's really only super tough and clever, given enough time, most bruisers should be able to put him down for good. He also still needs to breath air.

Over the past 3 years we've both received substantial raises. He, as of January 1st, got a new job and makes 115k a year while I have been at 65k since last July with the same company we did our internship at. We don't have any gaps in job history but our incomes have fluctuated a lot over the past two years (always going up, not down).

He's worried that this will affect how much we're able to borrow since we started out so low in the beginning, he read something about lenders averaging your income for the past two years which would be a pretty harsh blow to what we're able to borrow. We're already paying a lot in rent for a small space and the house we're looking at would be a little more (including taxes etc) but the space is much bigger (and much more pleasant). The trade-off is our commute is increased by 20 minutes which we're ok with.  

I'm also due for another raise here in 3 months to 75k.

We're wondering if we should wait another year to start looking seriously since our income history will be much more stable by then (but the price of houses in our area will have gone up with Nike building new offices and the 3k+ new jobs). 

Any advice on this? Will a lender be understanding of the way our incomes have changed so much in so short of time?"

44vxjy,9,2016-02-09,I think my work history is preventing me from getting interviews. Trying to get my career started.,amotion578,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/44vxjy/i_think_my_work_history_is_preventing_me_from/,"[Accidentally posted this over in /r/cscareerquestions]

I'm aiming for Systems Administration as my end goal. My current goal is to get into help desk tier 1 support to build my experience and career.

I've been an on and off student since January 2009 at my local community college. I've been financially independent since 2010 and feel like I've screwed myself over by working full time and taking a class here and there. They've all been customer service roles and my past employers have gotten to see how adept I am at solving problems, computers or otherwise.
I'm one of those millenials that grew up on Windows 95, 98, and XP. I cracked open my first case at age 8 to upgrade RAM, stuff like that. I worked retail PC repair in 2012-2013 and use a coworker as a reference who is blown away that I'm struggling to find work with my skill set.

My last job was at a call center out of town that paid poorly supporting financial software. I resigned because it wasn't a good fit, being that a call center cares about call center BS and not actually solving problems. That and the commute was costing me a lot of money in gas and a lot of unnecessary wear and tear on my daily driver. 4 months total.

I worked at a dealership before that as I'm a car enthusiast as well and worked there for 22 months before getting dismissed for no explainable reason. I started as a lot tech and took a position at the luxury brand to be basically tech support for the sat nav and radio (its that advanced and well, old people don't understand technology so well).
Before that I was at the retail store and before that I held a mental health staff position at my state's mental health agency (it paid stupid amounts but there was 0 room to grow).
I'm getting letters of recommendation from my former boss at the dealership and from my coworker at the retail store. I have one currently from my boss at the state who absolutely loved me and is dumbfounded I'm not in IT already.

I apply for entry level stuff that I meet minimum qualifications for through shared experience, however because its not truly IT work I feel like I get skipped over.

I'm 99 credit hours into my Associates degree and have 6 specific classes to complete to get it with a certificate of completion in computer systems support. 3 more classes nets me two additional certificates in systems administration and network management and systems security.

At this time I'm fed up trying to support myself alone and leeching off my parents, so I've applied for FAFSA. The classes I need to take are not offered every term of course and I'm looking at another year to complete them all.
The jobs I've applied for I've seen the starting pay and I've thought that I'd seriously take way less to start just to prove my worth and build up to the listed entry pay. The duties are things I'm more than qualified to do.

Problem is since I don't have my degree, nor official IT experience, and a varied job history, I'm just straight up struggling to even talk to a human. I just want interviews. Or an internship. But I think employers look at my history and instantly bar me. Or I'm on a blacklist somewhere of people not to hire. It's what it feels like.

I don't know what else to do. I'm sitting down with academic and career advisors in the next two weeks to talk about my situation. If I can manage to survive the next month I'll have a class needed to graduate to take spring term. To fill out my schedule I was thinking about taking business management classes since that's my end goal.

Any advice or help to get me into entry IT would be great. 

Thanks in advance.

Thank you for all the advice and critiques so far. I'm playing catch up to respond to it all, I'm blown away by all the help!"
44w4ql,1,2016-02-09,"/Where) can i get an internship/job serving a ""good cause"" for my Energy Technology Masters degree,",Bartiparty,Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/44w4ql/where_can_i_get_an_internshipjob_serving_a_good/,"Hi,
I'm currently doing my Masters degree in Energy Technology. I picked that subject of study because i think that is where i can do the most good with something i am good at and i like.
But now i only have about 1 1/2 years left and i dont really know where to work. Also i need an internship of at least 2 Months to get my degree. So i would like to do that in something i believe in.
I don't care if its fighting the climate change, give more people access to energy or something that haven't even crossed my mind. I want to help make the world a better place. 

Do you guys have some ideas where i can get an internship (later job but thats not that important now)  helping my cause?
I'm looking all over the internet right now and tought i could ask here too to get the view of a few others on this topic.
Maybe this helps:
I was born, live and study in Germany.
Obviosly my first languange in german and my second is english.
Right now I'm learning a bit japanese.
I am open to a internship in most countries (bonus for Germany or Japan).
It has to be at least 2 months long and can be longer (up to 1 year, five to 6 months would be best).
It has to be in a working environment close to engineering.

A later job should be in south Germany preferably around Nürnberg. Payment is in both secondary.

Let me know your thoughts and ideas on this."
44w67z,0,2016-02-09,What am I supposed to do after 2 1/2 years of literally absolutely nothing? (for real this time),ThemJohns,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44w67z/what_am_i_supposed_to_do_after_2_12_years_of/,"I've posted here several times here on a whim and not even look at feedback until days or weeks later because I was afraid, but this time I'm serious. I have been retreating from the corner for far too long and I need to seriously get my act together. I am in desperate need for answers.

Right now, my portfolio is completely barren since I graduated. I have nothing to show that I have been doing any sort of programming because I haven't. I have zero work experience and zero extracurricular work due to my own incompetence, and I have completely lost hope of landing a relevant job without pure blind luck. Every one of them is asking for years of experience in a language I don't know. I've tried applying for jobs online with whatever I had in the past years, but I've been rejected or ignored (mostly the latter) too many times.

At the moment, I am holding out until I could possibly apply for a coding bootcamp and get a job as a web developer, but every time there has been someone here who says it's a bad idea because I am essentially wasting my degree.

Then HOW am I supposed to use my degree if I have no practical way to use it? People have been giving me very vague suggestions, but I need ACTUAL resources. Answers like ""post code to GitHub"" is just extremely vague because I have no idea how to start in the first place. Internships aren't an option because there are virtually none of them that are offered to non-enrolled people. It also doesn't help that I learned almost nothing but C++ in college. I just want something structured and more guaranteed to help me redeem my career, but it's absolutely discouraging to hear that what might be my only hope is no good.

I'm sorry if this post sounds too demanding and personal, but I have almost completely lost hope at this point. I'll answer whatever questions you might have for me for clarity."
44w6sg,420,2016-02-09,Two roommate stories..don't fuck with me and my money,throwaway3425435,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/44w6sg/two_roommate_storiesdont_fuck_with_me_and_my_money/,"First roommate was a girl I met during community college. She was so cool. Totally chill and funny. Moved in with her and everything changed. She would start screaming at me because I turned the AC on..in August during 90 degree F days..even though I promised to compensate fully for it (and it turned out to just cost $30..). She would also get angry when I woke her cat up. She got so crazy hostile I would lock my door at night out of fear of her stabbing me in my sleep. So I moved out after that month, but I was still obligated to the lease. I tried to find her a new roommate that she liked, but she made the process difficult. I was getting anxious because rent was about to be due and I was not about to pay for two apartments. So I stopped giving a fuck and signed a sublease with a random, foreign 40 year-old man (I made sure he was fully aware of what he was getting into). When I told her she started yelling how I'm stupid, I don't know anything about the law, and she knows a lot more about leasing agreements since she worked at a leasing office. The look of quiet rage/frustration when I laid out everything stated in our leasing agreement and rental laws in our state..was too satisfying.

ADD-ON: 
A year later I was at an intersection, just about to take a right turn.. she was coming the opposite way and sped up real fast to take a left in a dangerous attempt to cut me off. I saw this and stopped. My mom, who never met my ex-roommate, was in the passenger seat and turned to me in utter disbelief, wondering what just happened. Certified crazy. Sort of satisfying knowing that our battle's conclusion still got this crazy person's feathers ruffled.

Second story: For my senior year I lucked out with rooming with two very good friends of mine. This was only because their third roommate, Squeals, had an internship opportunity for that semester, so I would have to find someplace else for the Spring, which was fine.

 I call her Squeals because she doesn't talk, she squeals in a really soft voice so you can't understand a damn thing she's saying. Roommates confirmed she adopted this voice to appear cute to guys. Incoherent as fuck, but somehow she gets a lot of guys.

Anyway, I was seriously hoping that she wouldn't be back for Spring so I could room with these two awesome girls. So I was really excited when Squeals was telling everyone she wasn't coming back for Spring!! Then rather last minute..she was coming back, so I had to get an apartment fast. I put a hefty deposit on one. Then she's not coming back..and begs me to take her place. I do so because the roommates, price, and location are awesome..but I still lose that deposit and I mention it to her. She didn't even say sorry or even acknowledge the suckiness of it, which was what I know I would do if I were in her shoes. She changed her mind three freaking times without thinking about anything. I was outraged, and so were my roommates so we started plotting together. I never had any kind of written lease agreement with this girl, which I knew I could use to my advantage at the end. I convinced her I was going to take over for the summer, even though I was leaving three months beforehand.. I told her the day I was moving out, and that left Squeals responsible for three months' rent. 


TL;DR: Two different girls got into rental agreements with me. I made the first one live with a much older stranger. The second one had to pay $1500+ for nobody to live in her room.

EDIT: I get that this isn't as extreme or interesting as one would hope for this subreddit, but it wasn't small enough to go on pettyrevenge.

EDIT 2: I didn't know there would be a couple revenge-based subreddits!! This is because I honestly thought people would be too ashamed to talk about it since I'm ashamed of my own scheming (sheltered, much). Up until now I thought pettyrevenge was as hardcore as it got. Love all this though. Makes my brain jizz. "

44wfl6,57,2016-02-09,Me (22/f) and my widowed father (48/m) have no idea how to handle my brother (15/m)... please help.,nervousnancy93,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/44wfl6/me_22f_and_my_widowed_father_48m_have_no_idea_how/,"My mother died in 2012 summer from an aggressive type of lung cancer (she NEVER SMOKED) leaving me and my then 11 year old brother behind. My brother and mom were really close. My mum was a high school teacher of languages but after my brother was born she never went back to teaching (my father works at an international IT company and gets paid enough), and focused all of her time on the family. I think she kinda missed teaching so she was tutoring my brother every. single. day. She wrote extra examples for the homework, and made sure my brother is super prepared. My brother had a lot of after school activities then, sport and music school, going out to friends, etc.

My bro was always a very mature child, and the current events just made him more mature. Three years ago he succesfully applied to a very good high school, even though my mom was already gone, and he didnt have that extra tutoring every day. This high school is focused on sciences, so they have advanced biology and chemistry classes (my brother seems to love them, they have super cool labs) as well as physics (this one not so much). He is kinda popular in school, not the alpha male one, but gets invited to all the parties of cool kids (you know who are 15 and have 1000 ""friends"" on facebook), gets a few dates with pretty girls at his age, but he gets along with almost everybody, its common that we have 2-3 of his friends over after school playing fifa together. He is handsome, not overweight, loves reading books and loves animals, me and him are really close. 

I am a medical school student, and last summer I moved away from our house in the suburbs in a flat to the center. I went home every week, since its not that far away. My dad works at the same company for 15+ years now, and although his daily routine finishes quite ""early"" (he gets home around 5-6 pm max), he still travels a few times every month to different countries. Before my mom died he wasnt such an active part of our school life, but I think he is doing a good job now.

But. And here is the part that actually matters. My brothers grades at school started to go down and down... but thats not the real problem. I never was a straight 5 student myself (in our system we have 5 as the best, 1 as failing... ""bad"" grades are 2 and 3, good grades are 4 and five) and I know grades in high school dont really define you. So when my brother started to get 3s  like 2 years ago,we were really supportive, my brother went to tutoring teachers, balbla.

Flash forward to today. The first hald of the year ended, and my brothers grades are really bad. He has many 2s. Its the third half year in a row that he almost failed in geography when its literally the subject where you sit on your butt and just memorize it. He is really good in English, can hold a conversation in confidence, still gets the grade of average (3). 

I think this is the symptom, and the real problems: he is always tired. He has concentration problems. Gets home after school (no sport and music school now), is exhausted. He always starts study around 6-7 pm after a few hours of resting, and I am fucking sure he cant finish whit his studies properly. His room is always messy, even though we have a very nice cleaning lady (almost like a grandma) who cleans up the house a bit every monday. Still, 2 days later, clothes and trash on the floor, smelly food and drinks on the table, etc. His desk is messy, and its just gets messy again and again. 

My father really tries. He goes every day ""so what was in school?"" you can imagine the answer. ""Nothing"". He goes into my brothers room for example in the early afternoon and asks him nicely(! I heard it many times) ""pls organize your room a bit... not right now.. just later, okay?"" my brother says okay then continues doing what he is doing. By the end of the night, the fucking mess is still there. So the situation often escalates, as you can imagine, my father asks nicely and patiently a few times then after a few hours it gets to the shouting part. And this show happens like 3 times a week. My father is frustrated and disappointed.

Grades. It seems for me that my brother is still in denial. If I talk about school with him he likes to talk about his goals and interesting stuff that happened. He wants to take and English language exam next year, he just told me yesterday. 

The reason why I decided to write this post because of the talk I had with my dad today. He told my brother is skipping school. He had a shitload of hours missed last half year, mostly because of sickness, but many times simply because he looks like washed shit in the morning, and is complaining about nausea and headache, which I believe is because of the irregular eating habits and not drinking enough water. My father has access to this electronic-diary thing, where teachers upload the grades and missed hours. So usually after a few days ""of nothing happened"" the thruth comes out, that my bro just got three fails and skipped a day. Until then, my father is clueless. They get up together every day. My father drops out my brother close to his high school and then goes to work. He just told my that he just found out that my brother skipped a day again, and is really close to the limit of the hours you can miss without redoing the year. When he asked my brother he said that he was feeling really down, so instead of going to school he visited my moms grave and got home. My heart broke hearing that. 

I am in a tough situation, so is my dad. We dont want to be super strict and I personally have no fucking idea how strict I can be, after all I am just his sister. My father goes between ""thats fucking enough, get yourself together"" and ""whats the matter?"" and ""I dont give a shit, ruin your life if you want"". I think he is afraid that if he is too strict he will alienate my brother from him.

Parents of reddit, what should we do? If we trust my brother that he is capable of handling his own things, it just turns out he is not, he cant manage his time at all. Should we tutor him and pack his bag every day like for a 7 year old? How strict can I be? Do I even have the right to go to my brother and say ""put the fucking xbox down and do your homework first""? 

My brother (as most of the teenagers) never asks for help. When my father bought him vitamins  and for a week took it to his room every day... he didnt take it. We already assigned a child psychologist. I wanna help him. I dont know how. I already had so many heartfelt conversations with him. I reassured him so many times we love him, but he will fall out of school if he doesnt care more. Maybe he needs a new hobby? Or an au pair? But he is almost 16.

On the top of all, I applied for an internship that starts on the 1th of March, is in Asia, and lasts for 4 month, and is a super big oppurtunity. Now I am even thinking about if this is the right time to go. Please help.

tldr: My brother's grades are failing since my mom died. We are a troubled family and need advice how to get our shit together.

44wszg,6,2016-02-09,Do you enjoy your job? What do you do? I feel like I have made a mistake switching majors.,accounting_time,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/44wszg/do_you_enjoy_your_job_what_do_you_do_i_feel_like/,"Junior year I switched from computer engineering major to accounting after I felt really depressed with the classwork and overall direction in life. My GPA was alright (3.5) but I felt as I went deeper into the major I was more and more lost. I was extremely nervous of failing and/or doing poorly. 

In the business school, the environment from my professors is really good and supportive, giving future direction and motivation. I have increased my studying even more (time wise) compared to some engineering courses due to the tedious length and amount of problems each class covers. But the material I actually understand and can solve easier. 

However I have this feeling that accounting may not be right for me. First the courses are not that challenging. In both intermediate courses I got a final grade of A+.  Also the more I take businesses courses, the more I understand the true value of an engineering background and education. The difficult and challenging material creates a cognitive drive to increase one's own critical thinking, awareness, and intelligence (as well as lifetime earnings). 

Now I was evaluating where to go from here. I could take a few computer/IT graduate courses and try to sit for the CISA. I could gain a few years of experience (graduating in one more semester), save up the money, and then go back to CE if accounting is not my cup of tea. I could also try to learn more computer coding and website design. 


Now personality wise I am a mess. I tend to be antisocial, barely hanging out with friends or classmates. I study most of the time. I do not have any internships or job experience under my belt yet either. Engineering killed me on an emotional and intellectual level as I had little social support in my frustrations. 

However I have presented well in group study sessions, presentations, as well as improving my abilities with toastmasters. I just know my limits and try to improve on them by doing scary scary things. 

Because I have been diagnosed with aspergers and due to a few constraints I believe tax (or IT audit) would provide the best (personal) environment for myself. 

I will also have enough credit hours to do the CPA exam next year. 


What are your thoughts? Do you enjoy the direction in your career/major?

44ww4s,33,2016-02-09,I was the perfect patsy,BabyGiraffe2015,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/44ww4s/i_was_the_perfect_patsy/,"I have been unemployed the last six months. Back in May, I graduated from college (a highly prestigious one at that), and I didn't exactly have a job lined up. Fortunately, I was able to intern (unpaid) for a congressman, but that was just a summer gig. Being new to the job search market as well, I really didn't know how to keep my ear to the ground and look for jobs while interning. Once the August recess began, I was officially unemployed. 

These past six months have been hell, job application after job application, and hardly even a call-back. For a while, I thought I was destined to be one of those 30 year old basement bums who never found work beyond fast food. One day, I downloaded a job search app, Jobr, basically a tinder for job searchers. Their job options aren't the most appealing, but some did grab my interest. 

The same day I swiped right for a certain job, I got a callback asking to set me up for an interview. I was ecstatic. Six months had passed and not even an interview. This was my chance! The next morning, I got a haircut, suited up, and went in to give it my all. 

The Jobr app for some reason said the job was in Arlington, but it was actually in Rockville. I live in Fairfax, so that's a hellish commute for me. Oh well, I've been praying this day would come, and now's my chance to get a job. When I showed up, it was at this frumpy looking quasi-shopping center (not much shopping) that was mostly self-storage places. The front door was hidden and hard to find. The physical building itself gave me second thoughts. 

As a National Guardsman, I abide by the mantra of ""early is on-time, on-time is late, and late is unacceptable."" I walked in 10 minutes early as they said not to be more than 15 minutes early because of the interview schedule. My interview was scheduled for 11:00, but I didn't get called in until 11:20. The initial interview was just a quick tell me about yourself and your qualifications. It went well, and I was granted a second round interview. 

For the second round interview, one of the VPs took me to Dunkin' Donuts and basically told me everything about how the company works. He really made it sound like a fun and exciting place to work with a lot of very fast promotion opportunities. The idea was that I would start out as a trainee and make $500 the first week. Then I would work as a regular worker, making between $3000-4000 a month. After 4-6 months, I'd be a manager making between $5000-6000/month, and after 2 or so years, I'd be a top level executive making $7000-10000/month. He did tell me that hard work and competence is required, but if I work hard enough, anything is possible. I left all starry-eyed, forgetting to ask the basic question of what my day-to-day tasks include. 

Later that day, I got a call-back telling me I got the job offer. I hadn't been that happy in months. For the past six months, I had been unemployed and depressed, but I finally got a job! I eagerly told the VP yes. The next day, I came in for the on-boarding shenanigans, eager to start. I asked him when I should come in, and he told me MWF is around 9:30 and TuThS is 8:30. WTF?! You never told me we have to work Saturdays in my second round interview, but oh well, I had been looking for a job for months and was willing to take anything coming my way. 

Friday through Sunday, I had my National Guard drill. I was talking to my fellow 2LTs about my new job, and I couldn't exactly articulate exactly what I was doing. My actual job title was ""account manager."" I just told them I was doing outsourced marking for Verizon (our current client). I had just fallen into the hype of how awesome the job is. 

Fast forward to Monday, my first day of work. I was told to show up NLT 9:45 and show up at 9:30, eager to learn. One of the current ""managers"" gives me a basic intro to the sales techniques before the other new hires show up. About half of them showed up 30 mins late, and the actual training didn't start until 11:00. It was supposed to start at 10:00. 

My gut feeling from the time I went back to fill out the new hire paperwork was that it would be a door-to-door sales job, not my idea of a good job. It wasn't until the actual training started that it was in fact a door to door job, selling Verizon FiOs upgrades. On top of that, the pay is 100% commission based. It's 55 hours a week, 6 days a week, no guarantee of actually making something, and a 30 mile commute in a gas hog car. 

I came home disappointed. For months, I had been looking for a job, and one finally came, only the entire thing was a sleazy scam to recruit the naive, hard-working, and desperate college grads. I did not study hard in college and earn my degree to do a job a trained monkey could do. They promised I could be a manger quickly and the door-to-door part is only a stepping stone. After talking to my parents about how much this job blows, I decided to call the office back and tell them to rescind my offer. I quit after the first day, and I have zero regrets about it. 

The lesson I want everyone to learn from this is that there are a lot of unscrupulous companies preying on the naive, hard-working, and desperate college grads. Be sure to ask the questions they don't want you to ask such as ""What do the day-to-day tasks entail?"" ""Will I be doing X?"" and ""How is it possible for one to get promoted so fast?"" If they don't give you straight answers or try to putz around the question like a lot of these marketing types do with their scripted answers, RUN! 

Here's a link that describes my story to a T, www.libraryoflogic.com/signs-the-job-offer-you-received-might-be-a-scam/

44x964,128,2016-02-09,Feminists of a Certain Age -- Hands down and by far the BEST discussion of capital 'F' Feminism vs. Sanders Movement that I've seen!!,natural_seattleite,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/44x964/feminists_of_a_certain_age_hands_down_and_by_far/,"Authored by Shasta Willson (sorry for the self-post; the original link was to a note on Facebook which I can't reference per community rules)

Feb 7, 2016

I’m a feminist of a certain age. I earned degrees in STEM before the term existed and have made a career in computer science. During the years when feminism was a dirty word, I used it frequently. When Hillary Clinton ran in 2008, I enthusiastically supported her. My husband reminds me that when he first supported Obama, I snarled, “Must women, who are not even a minority, be the last to be equal at every table?”

But I do not support Sec. Clinton’s nomination now. 

It’s not that my opinion of her competencies has changed. I still think she’s smart, ambitious, focused and competent. I still believe that for a woman to rise to the top of a major party, that woman has had to be twice as good at politics as most of her male peers. Clinton is that female politician who has proven herself adept in Washington for decades, brushing off scandals real and imagined, and paying her dues.

That’s the problem. 

For we feminists of a certain age, the only way to survive in male-dominated fields was to out-play the boys at their own game. When you fight like hell just to be on the team, you don’t try to change the rules of the game. Clinton is old school. She knows how to play the game. She’s very, very good at it. Unfortunately for her, the old rules are starting to look a lot like cheating to a generation that has been stripped of opportunity.

Each criticism of Clinton, if you look at it closely, boils down to suspicion of her excellence at the game of politics. She knows how to avoid committing to a position, and how to equivocate an answer. She’s one of the best fund raisers in modern history. She brokers power as well as any male politician, and better than most. That’s what feminists of a certain age do: we outperform the men around us at their own game to earn our place on the field. 

But this new generation has been kept out of the game entirely. Voters age 18-29 were 9-20 years old when the great recession hit. They do not believe in job stability or family stability. They were the generation -- male and female -- that went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and came home to poverty. They do not join unions. Why pay dues when you’ll be moving on soon? 

They’ve been told they’re lazy, stupid and apathetic so many times they’ve tuned us out. They fueled Occupy, a movement that not only changed our cultural conversation about wealth fundamentally and nearly overnight, but also accomplished dozens of concrete things from debt forgiveness to a widely lauded emergency response to Hurricane Sandy.

Our generation laughed. We passed around memes about kids who can’t look away from their phones while those kids reinvented media, advertising and journalism. 

Is it any wonder this generation of feminists sees no debt to their elders? Gloria Steinem dismissed young women who support Sanders as boy-chasers.  Madeleine Albright declared that there is a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other. Her meaning seems clear.

I understand Steinem’s offensive derision and Albright’s defensive anger: by the rules that feminists of a certain age accepted, Clinton’s candidacy is the final round in a game that has lasted our entire lives. It’s not so much that it’s her turn, as that it’s OUR turn. Some of us have waited a literal lifetime for this moment, and in 2008 we were forced to wait just a little longer. For feminists of a certain age, being told to be patient -- that this is not yet our moment -- sounds all too familiar.

We feminists of a certain age expect the establishment to be against us. (The idea that we could now be establishment is literally unthinkable to some of us.) We expect most men to oppose us or patronize us. But we do not expect other feminists to oppose us. Sec. Albright speaks the truth for many women who feel fundamentally betrayed by a generation that has benefited from our efforts since birth. Where is the respect?

Here’s the truth: the young women owe us nothing. They do not owe Clinton their hard-won vote, and they do not owe we feminists of a certain age a period of servitude. The game has changed for all of us, and the young women I know are prouder, stronger, and frankly less brittle than we were. They know things that we fought to imagine -- like the inevitability of a female President -- and they will not vote for a candidate they do not believe represents them simply because their cavalier elders demand loyalty.

They have, in fact, become exactly what we might have hoped for our daughters and granddaughters: confident of their equality. We fought to convince ourselves and our country that we should be equal. They were born with the message that they are equal, and are fighting for the implementation of that equality.

They struggle for jobs not because women cannot work, but because jobs are scarce. They talk about intersectional feminism (a term coined after I graduated from high school), and can’t imagine meaningful progress without coalitions of overlapping interests and diverse viewpoints. They recognize lack of access to health care as a major obstacle to reproductive freedom. 

Gloria Steinem was 20 years old in 1955, and it is likely that in her pre-feminist world girls did follow boys’ interests. I hope that this new generation will view her statement in that cultural context. Steinem is one of the heroes who moved culture so effectively that her work eventually outgrew her. We should all be so successful!

Today’s young feminists will not vote for Clinton for her gender, or out of loyalty. Why should they? They want to know what she will do for them, and her answers are falling short for many. Her campaign refers to the black vote as a “firewall,” while black voters increasingly question what she’s actually offering. Young people want to know where their jobs and health care will come from, and she counsels patience for moderate changes. 

When asked how her Presidency would differ from a third Obama term, she laughed and said, “The first woman President would be quite a change.” 

I cringed when she said that, and realized I no longer want her to be the first female President. As a feminist of a certain age, I feel some guilt. It is our turn. We have waited a very, very long time for our turn. Many of us -- certainly including Clinton -- have spent our entire lives working for it. As a feminist who is just barely of a certain age, my debt has been called due, and I feel the weight of my elders’ reprobation.

But the game has changed. We’ve raised an entire generation in the worst economic crash since the Great Depression. They grew up under a surveillance state, with constant background war. They grew up within economic disparity so great it is literally unimaginable; almost indescribable. They grew up in a world where a large portion of their responsible elders have simply denied scientific facts ranging from evolution to climate change... and continued to win elections.

So they’re going to make up their own minds. They see the white, male, Democratic socialist sit down and listen to the BLM activists who interrupted him. They see him seeking out Native American counsel, and they see him paying his interns a fair wage. They see policies promising real potential for jobs and education and health care, and they think it’s entirely fair that the very wealthiest should give back some of their spoils to pay for it.

Those young feminists who support Sanders are not naive or disloyal. They are building a new world, and they are demanding a new politics that invites everyone to play. They are, in fact, doing exactly what we feminists of a certain age once wished for our daughters: thinking for themselves, unburdened by gender.

It may take all of our hard-earned grace and power to learn to respect them for it, but we owe them nothing less.

44xa9f,46,2016-02-09,I was the perfect patsy,BabyGiraffe2015,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/44xa9f/i_was_the_perfect_patsy/,"I have been unemployed the last six months. Back in May, I graduated from college (a highly prestigious one at that), and I didn't exactly have a job lined up. Fortunately, I was able to intern (unpaid) for a congressman, but that was just a summer gig. Being new to the job search market as well, I really didn't know how to keep my ear to the ground and look for jobs while interning. Once the August recess began, I was officially unemployed.

These past six months have been hell, job application after job application, and hardly even a call-back. For a while, I thought I was destined to be one of those 30 year old basement bums who never found work beyond fast food. One day, I downloaded a job search app, Jobr, basically a tinder for job searchers. Their job options aren't the most appealing, but some did grab my interest.

The same day I swiped right for a certain job, I got a callback asking to set me up for an interview. I was ecstatic. Six months had passed and not even an interview. This was my chance! The next morning, I got a haircut, suited up, and went in to give it my all.

The Jobr app for some reason said the job was in Arlington, but it was actually in Rockville. I live in Fairfax, so that's a hellish commute for me. Oh well, I've been praying this day would come, and now's my chance to get a job. When I showed up, it was at this frumpy looking quasi-shopping center (not much shopping) that was mostly self-storage places. The front door was hidden and hard to find. The physical building itself gave me second thoughts.

As a National Guardsman, I abide by the mantra of ""early is on-time, on-time is late, and late is unacceptable."" I walked in 10 minutes early as they said not to be more than 15 minutes early because of the interview schedule. My interview was scheduled for 11:00, but I didn't get called in until 11:20. The initial interview was just a quick tell me about yourself and your qualifications. It went well, and I was granted a second round interview.

For the second round interview, one of the VPs took me to Dunkin' Donuts and basically told me everything about how the company works. He really made it sound like a fun and exciting place to work with a lot of very fast promotion opportunities. The idea was that I would start out as a trainee and make $500 the first week. Then I would work as a regular worker, making between $3000-4000 a month. After 4-6 months, I'd be a manager making between $5000-6000/month, and after 2 or so years, I'd be a top level executive making $7000-10000/month. He did tell me that hard work and competence is required, but if I work hard enough, anything is possible. I left all starry-eyed, forgetting to ask the basic question of what my day-to-day tasks include.

Later that day, I got a call-back telling me I got the job offer. I hadn't been that happy in months. For the past six months, I had been unemployed and depressed, but I finally got a job! I eagerly told the VP yes. The next day, I came in for the on-boarding shenanigans, eager to start. I asked him when I should come in, and he told me MWF is around 9:30 and TuThS is 8:30. WTF?! You never told me we have to work Saturdays in my second round interview, but oh well, I had been looking for a job for months and was willing to take anything coming my way.

Friday through Sunday, I had my National Guard drill. I was talking to my fellow 2LTs about my new job, and I couldn't exactly articulate exactly what I was doing. My actual job title was ""account manager."" I just told them I was doing outsourced marking for Verizon (our current client). I had just fallen into the hype of how awesome the job is.

Fast forward to Monday, my first day of work. I was told to show up NLT 9:45 and show up at 9:30, eager to learn. One of the current ""managers"" gives me a basic intro to the sales techniques before the other new hires show up. About half of them showed up 30 mins late, and the actual training didn't start until 11:00. It was supposed to start at 10:00.

My gut feeling from the time I went back to fill out the new hire paperwork was that it would be a door-to-door sales job, not my idea of a good job. It wasn't until the actual training started that I found out that it was in fact a door to door job, selling Verizon FiOs upgrades. On top of that, the pay is 100% commission based and no benefits. It's 55 hours a week, 6 days a week, no guarantee of actually making something, and a 30 mile commute in a gas hog car.

I came home disappointed. For months, I had been looking for a job, and one finally came, only the entire thing was a sleazy scam to recruit the naive, hard-working, and desperate college grads. I did not study hard in college and earn my degree to do a job a trained monkey could do. They promised I could be a manger quickly and the door-to-door part is only a stepping stone. After talking to my parents about how much this job blows, I decided to call the office back and tell them to rescind my offer. I quit after the first day, and I have zero regrets about it.

The lesson I want everyone to learn from this is that there are a lot of unscrupulous companies preying on the naive, hard-working, and desperate college grads. Be sure to ask the questions they don't want you to ask such as ""What do the day-to-day tasks entail?"" ""Will I be doing X?"" and ""How is it possible for one to get promoted so fast?"" If they don't give you straight answers or try to putz around the question like a lot of these marketing types do with their scripted answers, RUN!
Here's a link that describes my story to a T, www.libraryoflogic.com/signs-the-job-offer-you-received-might-be-a-scam/

tl;dr: After being unemployed for six months, I fell for a ""marketing job"" scam that's just a door-to-door hawking Verizon upgrades job. They successfully appealed to my naiveté, work ethic, and desperation to give me a job with no benefits or base pay that I would have never taken. I was the perfect patsy.

Your long flowing blonde hair was painstakingly curled slightly for me. You spent three hours in front of the mirror doing your makeup exactly how I preferred; not too much, but just enough so that I could call you daddy's little whore. You wore that tight red dress that I bought you a month ago, the one that gripped your little round ass so tight and gave me a perfect eyeful of cleavage. Slutty but sexy. And underneath it you wore your sexiest lacy black bra and matching tiny thong. You were my plaything and you knew it.

We'd been doing this for a while now; the gorgeous young college intern who'd do anything to get ahead and the young upstart boss who was handed everything by his father. And ironically, while I was given my power from my father, you crave this job so much because of yours. You grew up wanting to work where daddy works, didn't you? This was your dream job. You've worked so hard for years to be able to even get an internship at the company and now that you're here you would do anything to land an actual full-time position.

That's how we started. It was innocent enough at first. Some light flirting here and there. Your hand would brush against my leg, a light touch on the shoulder, any chance you could find to innocently bend over to give me a peek. You started this. This was your decision and it is your fault. You wanted this.

Now we've been meeting in secret for months and we've done just about everything I can think of with you. You've loved every second of it. You convince yourself that you're doing it to get ahead, but I know there's a dirty filthy whore lurking behind every one of your innocent smiles. This is your escape.

But you're not my first pretty young play thing and you won't be my last. I'm bored and I want to use you up one last time in spectacular fashion.

You don't know that yet. All you know is that I've sent you home midday to get ready for another of our ""regular meetings"" in my office just after closing. You're to wear your hair the way I like it. You're to wear the clothes that I like. You're to do your makeup as I like it. And you're to be the eager slut I like you to be. When you meet me is when the fun will begin.

I'd like someone to RP as a submissive office intern to the young boss. This RP will be about public humiliation and shaming when you're surprised to be taken to a party with all of your coworkers instead and used and abused there. A big component of the RP will be psychological (definitely dubcon) with your job being threatened and verbal and physical humiliation. I will be RP'ing as the boss but also a narrator for the other people's involvement. If you're interested in RP'ing others' actions towards you too, that would be okay.

I have a full list of kinks here https://i.imgur.com/LCljEQA.png and would like to hear what kinks and limits you have if you are interested since it's a pretty wide open RP.

I'm looking for responses of a few paragraphs or so in a long term RP. Can't wait to hear from you!

They offered $60k salary, benefits kick in after 90 days. This is in California, in the same area as companies that are known to offer $85k or higher for new grads.

I felt insulted, because it isn't by any means my first job. I think they didn't bother to look at my resume. I had an internship as a software developer at a company in the midwest - it lasted for half a year and then the company made me a junior developer with a salary of $68k. I stayed for two months before moving to California  for an internship. Did that for half a year, and now I'm moving to another company in California for one more internship before I graduate. All in all, I'll have had nearly two years of experience in .NET development once I graduate this summer. 

I also had another half-year internship at a startup in Chicago three years ago, and a couple years of employment as an IT contractor. 

Should I feel insulted? Should I laugh my way to another company that understands that long internships are real jobs? At my current internship, the only difference between the full-timers and myself is that I get paid less. I do the same work. At my next internship, I'll be doing full-stack .NET development with the expectations that I'll be able to hit the ground running and produce. 

So should I push back on assertions like ""it's your first job out of college"" and whatnot? It was very irritating to hear and I feel like they're wasting my time. :/ Or should I just swallow my pride, take the role for a couple months, and then renegotiate the compensation package? I have a feeling every company will do this."

I feel like I've absorbed nothing, and have no skills.",knowledgethrownaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44xsqm/student_finishing_up_cs_bachelors_i_feel_like_ive/,"Bear with me, I'm having a hard time putting this in words.

I should be finishing my degree by the end of this year. I am unable to bring myself to try internships or even try building something independently. I feel like I have almost no knowledge of programming/development, even though I have already taken the majority of classes required to at least begin work on something.

I am barely, if at all, using the knowledge I am getting from my classes. As a result, I believe I am starting to forget the fundamentals of programming. I am dreading having to find work in this field due to this.

With in-class projects, I can focus on working as a team and really get a deep understanding of what is going on. I truly enjoy myself and have no doubts about this degree. Once that project is over, however, the knowledge seemingly disappears. I can't recall how to do the majority, if not all, the work I did.

Outside of uni, I have taken side jobs to aid myself financially. They are not necessarily, or at all, related to my degree. I have done a few years of retail sales, a couple of years at a help-desk style job, and I've had the opportunity to independently handle making an old and large apartment building internet and Wi-Fi ""enabled"" for the tenants (while continually administering/improving the network).
My github/bitbucket repos are empty. I have never been inspired to make something alone..or had a good idea pop into my head, or felt that I had enough knowledge to build anything.

The way it looks to me, is that I am aimless without being pointed at something to do, and my passion only flares up when I'm working on a project with a team (which is something I've only experienced in an academic setting). 

How am I to even present myself to a company as a graduate for a development position or something similar in a situation like mine? Is this somehow all in my head/a confidence issue, or am I really in the pits?

Hell, even if you have any thoughts or anecdotes..it'd be nice to see a different perspective.

Luster Pendulum walked into Salt&amp;Pepe with the world on his wings and a frown on his face.

The bar was full to bursting, as it had been every night since BOSH was released. Monsters from top-tier decks congregated in nightly revelry, celebrating their supremacy. Hopeful tech cards lingered on the fringes of more elite conversations, chiming in every once in a while for the amusement of their betters. And of course, the staples and top-tier decks always took center stage, leading the party with the effortless charisma of unmatchable YCS tops.

In formats past, such bars had illuminated Bancity's every corner—but times had changed since the November Banlist, and changed again with the release of BOSH. These days, there was only one bar, and one center-stage group. It was to them that Luster headed, sidestepping a gaggle of Masked Chameleons and pointedly avoiding a table of sneering Vanity's Fiends.

Even the jeers of tier-two decks couldn't faze him tonight; he was too anxious to pay them any mind. He'd had an important mission, which of course meant that he had to forge the results. Sure, he'd been delayed more than usual, but he was confident that that wouldn't matter once he presented his information. The question was whether his ploy would finally work.

*This could be it,* he thought. *With this, we might finally be free.*

So preoccupied was he with his thoughts that he did not notice the figure that flew beside him until she landed straight in his path, her signature hands-on-hips pose framed by snow-white wings and waist-length aquamarine hair.

Luster took off his mask and grinned sheepishly. ""Hey, Evie.""

""Don't *Hey, Evie* me,"" Effect Veiler said. ""This is the third time.""

Luster looked into one of the only faces in this Ra-forsaken tavern that still gave him joy—and found genuine annoyance in those green eyes.

""The third time,"" Evie went on, ""that I have been forced to sit with your brother to discuss *politics* and *microbiology* while you were out doing who-knows-what.""

""Oh, Ra, Evie, I'm sorry,"" Luster said. A ""conversation"" with Vector on science was a fate he wouldn't wish on his worst foe. The Banlist was more of a mercy.

Evie sighed dramatically, and the usual smile returned to her face. ""I know, I know. You were on a top-secret—""

""—mission for the dickhead,"" Luster finished, smiling with her. ""Walk with me?""

""Oh, I was just leaving,"" she said. ""Dickhead was pissed at something or another, and he wouldn't let any of the core monsters leave. I told him I needed to sleep early tonight to stay in top form.""

Luster raised his eyebrows. ""And he bought that?""

""Hey, I'm not one of his precious lieutenants,"" said Evie, sticking out her tongue. ""I'm just a hand-trap, to be used and discarded. He couldn't give less of a shit if he was constipated.""

""Great image, Evie. Great, great image.""

""It's a gift.""

""I wonder why he's mad,"" Luster mused, glancing toward the back of the bar where the boss's study was located.

To his surprise, the door was open, and through it, Luster could see their boss at the back of the wide room, reclining on his throne of resplendent gold and silver. As always, Tellarknight Ptolemaeus was decked out in all his gaudy-armored glory, displaying on his person half—if not more—of their team's earnings.

*Disgusting.*

As if stirred by the heat of his underling's gaze, the boss looked up from whatever suspect substance he was snorting and stared directly into Luster's eyes. The message was clear.

""Hoban,"" Luster swore. ""He's mad at *me.* I gotta—""

""Yeah,"" Evie said quickly. ""Go.""

""Yeah,"" Luster echoed. ""Hey, let's hang out tomorrow, okay? *Without* Vector.""

""Mhm,"" his best friend murmured. ""I *was* actually going to bed anyway. Just...don't keep him waiting. Go. Now.""

He went.

As he walked, he could feel more eyes on him, appraising him and judging him to be despicable. He couldn't blame them, but he couldn't pay them any mind, either. Not with all that was riding on the upcoming confrontation.

True to Evie's word, Luster found the rest of their teammates gathered in the expansive study, hidden in the shadow of their leader's light. Luster closed the door as he entered, reflecting on the state of their deck. They were a sorry bunch on the best of days, but tonight, with their leader so angry, they seemed especially subdued.

Key and Gui, fresh off the intern team and usually causing a racket outside, sat closest to the door at a Naturia-wood desk. They were murmuring between themselves, apparently intently focused on a set of musical scores—probably for DJ's next gig. Luster could see their eyes shifting between him and the boss as he walked by them.

The other Performapals and the hand-traps lounged on the wide, Kuriboh-skin carpet, in various poses of unabashed boredom. Wiz lay supine, spinning his yoyo idly and casting arcs of golden sparks behind it in vulgar shapes. Bat was proving her nickname with loud snores from her perch on the ceiling. Liz was halfheartedly darting across the floor and flitting his tongue toward a terrified Maxxie and an indignant Usagi. And Yuki was in her usual position, leaning against the team's trophy cabinet with her nose in a book. Normally, Evie sat beside her, but she had been lucky enough to go free tonight.

Luster walked farther into the room—he never failed to marvel disgustedly at how it almost matched the bar in size—and saw the Performages huddling around their leader's desk, noticeably apart from the larger group. Mira was fiddling with a radio, twitching and muttering something about ""that bitch Faith""; the Hatter was pretending to listen to one of DJ's tall tales; and—Luster's stomach lurched—Plush sat completely still, watching him with dead eyes as he approached them.

*This is the deck that's taken the entire meta by storm,* Luster thought bitterly. *And they're more broken than any of their opponents.*

His insides churning with hatred, he fixed a confident smile on his face and approached their leader.

Vector sat in his spot on Ptolemaeus's left, but as his older brother approached, he excused himself and walked briskly away.

*Just as well.*

At some point, Luster would have to get around to investigating his brother's undoubtedly illegitimate pastimes, but for now, it was all he could do to keep him from bothering Evie while not upsetting the boss. Vector was, after all, his favorite subordinate.

And Luster, it appeared, was his least favorite right then.

""You're late, retard,"" Ptolemaeus rumbled.

""Sorry, boss,"" Luster said, taking his seat on the leader's right side. ""I was held up near Kozmotown.""

""You weren't meeting up with your old bitch, were you?"" Ptolemaeus demanded. ""I told you, Lusty, I don't want you fucking around. Not when you have shit to do, and a sweet piece of ass waiting for you when you get back."" The boss turned a malicious eye toward Plush, who returned his gaze with sickening indifference.

Luster watched the exchange with unwavering eyes and an unchanging expression, his mind whirling all the while. Most everyone knew that he was one of the youngest and most feared fighters in every format since his release. Few realized that he had obtained this reputation through a combination of brute force (good genes), an untold destiny (sheer luck), and a control over his emotions that could withstand the Allure Queen herself (boredom, and later, trauma). Even so, there existed three individuals in Bancity (and one in Kozmotown) who knew him well enough to know that he favored his right wing, and that he instinctively tensed it when he felt threatened. Were any of those individuals present at this moment, they might have warned Ptolemaeus that his subordinate was holding himself back from committing a cruel and unrepentant murder.

Instead, he simply looked down in deference and said, ""No, boss. I haven't spoken to the Farmgirl since you last sent me to extract information from her.""

""Good boy,"" Ptolemaeus said. ""But still. Mind explaining to me why in the name of Ra's almighty cock you were late?""

""Bad luck,"" Luster said. ""They were changing their guard right as I tried to slip by them into Kuraz's mansion.""

Ptolemaeus nodded. ""But you got what I sent you for,"" he said, with the conviction of a master who knew his servant would not dare approach him otherwise.

""Of course,"" Luster said. He reached into a hidden fold in his armor and pulled out two gold-encrusted scrolls. ""These are the full briefs on Mithra's troops, as well as reports that confirm some rumors we had heard about their abilities, and add upon others.""

*And they neglect to leave out the effects of fighting in their Dominion, but you'll find that out eventually.*

""Oh, yeah!"" his boss exulted, reaching out and sweeping the documents into his arms. All traces of his earlier disfavor appeared to have vanished. ""Nice work, Lusty. Go have a few drinks, on the house.""

""Thanks, boss,"" he said, and walked past his teammates without looking back.

It was my first relationship, I've only had crushes before. We were together for two years. We've been living together at my parents house for half a year now, both studying. I'm in a bit of a mess right now, sorry if I'm rambling. I'll try to make a good tl;dr.  


I've always loved her very much, but I made mistakes too. These mistakes usually were small things, like me not doing something I should right away, or forgetting to hold her hand at the cinema, or just forgetting things. But there were also other issues.   

Lately I think I became a bit distant, probably because I had an internship for 5 months, and I got home pretty tired every day. I didn't talk much like we used to, and I think I retreated a bit too much into myself. She also cried some nights, but since that happened before, I didn't keep asking questions, I just tried to soothe her. These were mistakes, I realize now.  
  
Last friday I went out to the city with my friends, and she went to a mutual friend (who I kinda lost contact with, but she still had contact with).  

**What happened**  

So two days ago my girlfriend came home from a day at the zoo with her sister. When I tried petting her back, like I usually do, she said she didn't like me touching her. Then she said we shouldn't be together anymore. All very calmly.  

I did not expect that, so I basically started getting emotional and went upstairs.  
She talked to my mother after that, who was home, and my mother decided it would be best that she'd drive her home the same night, because my mother had an experience that she had to live in the same house has her ex, which she didn't like. So my girlfriend started packing her stuff, while I was having an anxiety attack upstairs. Later she also came upstairs to pack more of her things. 

I couldn't really talk to her, because I was very emotional, and I don't remember the details of what she said. All I remember is her calmly packing all her stuff.

Later that day we had dinner, with my family and her. It was kinda awkard but I could stop myself from crying. I didn't dare look at her though. My mother asked again if it was okay with me if she should leave now, and I said yes.

Afterwards I asked her privately if there was someone else, and she said yes, there was someone else, and that I would probably know who it was.

So then she went away that day, and we had one last hug, and she said that it was not like she didn't care about me, but that she couldn't be with two people at the same time. And that another person shouldn't even be there if it was a good relationship.

**Yesterday**  

Yesterday she asked me (through text) something about the password of a Playstation account on her PS4, so that she could remove it (it had nothing on it). I gave that to her, and then she said that it wasn't like she didn't feel anything for me, but that she just got tired of having to ask for my attention, that she felt lonely with me. I said I was sorry, that I would try to change myself, not for her, but also for me, because I also didn't feel well the last months.  

She asked if I wanted to know what happened yesterday at the zoo. I first said no, because I had a feeling already and didn't want to hear it at that time. Afterwards I said yes. She said she was with the guy she was with friday too (the old mutual friend). That he held her hand, even if it was cold, and that I wouldn't have done such a thing. I said it wasn't true. She said she saw the difference, that he didn't ask her every little thing, that he just did. Unlike me, who always wants to be sure with what I'm doing.  

Then she said that I didn't even fight for her, that I just went upstairs and left her alone. I didn't know I had the option, everything just felt so final so fast for me.  

She said she wasn't sure yet, that there still was an option we could get back together. That maybe she didn't want to go further with the other guy at all. I said that I can't go on if she goes further with the other guy. She said she maybe wanted to talk another day. I made it clear that I would really want to go on with the relationship, not like before, but anew, starting slowly.

**Today**

Today we had some sporadic contact over text again. At one point she said she was taking the train home, and I asked her where from. She said from the guy. She said it was uncomfortable to talk to me, that she doesn't want to see me or talk to me. She said she wanted rest, and to slowly build something with the other guy.  

I reiterated what she said yesterday, that she wasn't sure yet then, that there was maybe a chance. That that all wasn't possible now.  She replied it wasn't fair that I said that, that she wasn't married to him, and that she still wasn't sure yet. Then she said she's just slowly building something with him, but that it wasn't a relationship (which I don't understand). That it could go right, or go wrong.  

I said that if she wants to build something with him, that I can't do anything anymore. I'd want to, but I can't, and I think she knows that. She hasn't replied yet, but she's seen it.

I still love her. I still hope that somehow, it will be alright. I know it's wrong to think that. If she stops going to him, and wants to come back now, I will accept that. But I know that probably won't happen.

If you read this, know everything I want is for us to be together again. I'm sorry for everything.  
   
**tl;dr**: I was distant the last month. Didn't give her many attention. Girlfriend comes home from zoo with sister, said it isn't working out anymore, that she wants to go away. We packed her stuff. She said there was someone else (an old friend of mine and hers). Then she went home. Afterwards she said that she didn't go to zoo with sister, but with old friend. They held hands. They want to build something. But that she isn't sure, that she maybe wants something with me, but not now, and not tomorrow. Maybe later. The next day she went to him, and tells me that she wants to try building something with him, but not a relationship. I tell her that I can't be with her anymore then. I'm confused what to do know. Is it just over? If she stops going to him, I'd really want to start again with her. I still love her. "

**February 3, 2016 - 5:45 PM**

""Raffle, I'm telling you there's no way to be sure!""

For the past five hours, the whole of Pepe had sat and watched as interns brought in phone after phone with archetype aces on the line. They had watched their boss pace furiously as he argued with each of them, had heard him lose nearly every argument. Tensions were running high in the study, and hope was running low.

""Ptolly, please,"" came the skittering, speakerphone-inflated voice of his latest conversant. ""You know this is the end.""

""You need us,"" Ptolemaeus growled. ""You can't—""

""I can and I am,"" Traptrix Rafflesia hissed. ""Out of courtesy to your status as a degenerate Rank-4, I have allowed you to try to convince me, and you have failed. Do you have any last words?""

""You're making a huge mistake,"" Ptolemaeus said, but the fight was out of his voice.

""Yes, I heard Mistake left you too."" And she hung up with a giggle.

""That BITCH!"" Ptolemaeus shouted, throwing the phone across the room. ""Send in the next one!""

A young, jittery unicorn rushed into the room with a phone hanging from her horn.

""Who is it this time?"" Ptolemaeus demanded.

""It's Infinity,"" she squeaked. ""He's leaving us...for Dinomist!""

""For *Dinomist!*"" the boss cried. ""Let me talk to the wight!""

""He left a m-message, boss,"" the terrified unicorn stuttered. ""And-and I hear he's setting up more accounts with...with...""

Ptolemaeus grabbed her by the horn and shook her, hard.

""With who?"" he roared. ""Who else is Infinity making accounts with?""

""D-Desk...bots,"" she said, and fainted.

Ptolemaeus snorted with disgust, then he threw the intern aside and stormed from his office through the crowd of onlooking Performapals. Even as they moved to allow him passage, a few of the newer members tried to edge in for a look or a word, and were promptly decapitated for their trouble.

Luster quickly followed, with Evie and Vector on his heels. He hadn't had a chance to speak to either of them, so terrified were they of incurring their boss's wrath.

Said boss was currently mounting the stage, and there was no question that every monster in the packed bar was his audience. Luster was shocked to see monsters of all archetypes congregating in their midst; word had apparently spread all around in the past five hours.

When the format's ruler stood before them, the entire crowd stilled and hushed. For a second, there was silence, and then—

""I am Pot'lmaos!"" he roared.

""I am the meta!

""I am the law!

""Who stands before me and doubts this?

""Who stands before me and *lies?*

""Konami made me of his own flesh and blood!

""No Banlist will befall me!

""I am invincible!

""I am the future!""

But Luster knew from the start what Ptolemaeus was only now beginning to realize: they were not heroes for their status. They were villains. Bullies. Thugs. Nobody would miss them; nobody would shed a single tear. This was the lot they'd thrown in with. Now all that was left was to await their punishment.

As if to punctuate the thought, the phone that Ptolemaeus had thrown away now rang out into the silence. Luster walked to it slowly and picked it up. The Caller-ID read ""Kozmo Farmgirl.""

His heart froze in his chest despite himself.

""This is Luster Pendulum,"" he said with forced formality.

""I think you should turn on the radio,"" Dorothy said, and hung up.

Feeling sick, Luster spread his wings and flew lurchingly toward the stage. As though from underwater, he heard Ptolemaeus's voice faintly demanding to know what he was doing, but he did not answer.

*She didn't say what program. That means...probably all of them.*

Alighting on the stage, Luster turned to DJ's control board and slid the appropriate switches. Almost instantly, the familiar tune began to play.

""Good evening Monsters, Spells, and Traps. DJ Magician of Faith here, and if you're just tuning in, welcome to DUEL 100.1.""

Nobody moved; nobody said a word. Ptolemaeus stood not five feet from him, but even he was rooted to the spot. All eyes were on the two of them now, and all ears were on DJ Faith.

""Konami has issued a press release,"" Faith said briskly. ""It's being sent to me as I speak, so I'll be reading it live on air—it's coming in.

""It begins like this:

""We have some important news regarding the Forbidden &amp; Limited Cards List used for high-level tournaments.""

The silence inside Salt&amp;Pepe was such that they could hear Faith's every breath. Luster found himself noticing how she breathed to the same tempo as her sister did.

""Beginning February 8, 2016, in addition to the Forbidden &amp; Limited Cards list, all tournaments held at Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series events, Regional Qualifier events, and UDS Qualifier and Invitational events will have these additional Deck construction rules. The following cards are now limited.""

There was a collective intake of breath, and then, expectant silence as all heads turned to face the reigning meta deck that stood outside their leader's study.

""Performapal Skullcrobat Joker.""

Bat collapsed without a sound, clutching her stomach.

""Performapal Monkeyboard.""

Key shrieked as he fell, and Gui began to sob.

""And..."" Faith hesitated.

Evie and Vector landed beside Luster then, and he knew. Not through any intellect or deduction. But still, he knew all the same.

""Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer.""

Instantly, he felt a shooting pain in his head. His wings curled in on themselves and he keeled over, insensate. It was all he could do to focus on Evie's voice as she cried, and to notice when she stopped as Faith began to speak again.

""The f-following cards are now forbidden. Performage Plushfire.""

Luster didn't know how he got to be standing up so quickly, but standing he was, leaning against Evie and watching with the rest of the room as Plush opened her eyes for the last time. In that moment, she gazed at him, and he saw...life. Understanding. Horror. Revulsion. Regret. Fear. Resignation. Contentment.

And nothingness once more.

""Performage Damage Juggler.""

DJ took a single second to comprehend what was happening, and then he went out just as he always promised he would: with a mic in his hand and profanity on his lips.

""Suck...my dick...Konami...I made...the meta fear...dank memes...Fusion did...nothing...wrong..."" 

And then he too fell, to raucous applause.

""And one more,"" Faith's voice said, and Luster's feverish mind still noticed the change in her tone. ""You may want to sit down for this one. Or stand up and do a little dance.""

""*Shit*,"" Evie whispered. ""We have to go.""

""For anyone currently inside Salt&amp;Pepe, you may want to run.""

And they all knew.

In future accounts, none of the witnesses could claim to have heard the words *Tellarknight Ptolemaeus.* All most of them knew was that, one second, they were listening to Faith, and the next, monsters without wings were flying into walls and a terrible keening was in the air, like metal on metal.

Luster felt arms grab him from both sides, then the ground vanished from beneath his legs.

""Hang on, Lus,"" Vector whispered into his ear. ""We've got you.""

They flew through tangles of airborne monsters, with Evie and Vector shielding Luster from the brunt of it. Other winged monsters were getting the same idea, though, and soon, the ceiling was almost as crowded as the floor. And still, that awful shriek continued to pierce the air.

""Shouldn't,"" he began, coughing violently. ""Shouldn't, Ptolemaeus be, in a coma, too?""

""Effect,"" Evie said tersely.

She ducked to avoid a flying Ojama, and in doing so jostled Luster too hard. His stomach heaved and he threw up all over an indignant armored bird.

*Effect? What effect?*

His mind was active enough to note that he despised its sluggishness, but not enough to remedy the situation.

""He used his Materials,"" Vector explained. ""He made everyone else fall into the coma with him until he could wake up again.""

*Oh. Right. Of course.*

""The wight is clever, I'll give him that,"" Evie growled, throwing up a cloud of white dust to freeze a Catapult Turtle whose payload would have knocked them from the air.

So it continued for far too long and no time at all as Ptolemaeus ravaged the bar, and all its occupants attempted to flee. Eventually, Evie and Vector landed near the rest of their deck, who were doing their best to make it back into Ptolemaeus's study. Through bleary eyes, Luster saw Wiz cradling DJ and Plush, and Gui and the Hatter helping Key and Bat to walk. Yuki stood guard in front of them, completely silent, but Luster knew that she was communicating with Usagi, sending him psychic instructions and orders to hold back any monsters that tried to run their way. Maxxie and her swarm buzzed around them, blinding, biting, and generally intimidating any monsters who managed to pass the spectral rabbit.

The three of them landed in front of their team, and Luster felt Evie fly away as his brother helped him stagger into the office. He turned his head, gritting his teeth against the pain the motion caused, and saw Evie standing with her fellow hand-traps, adding her paralyzing dust to the fray.

Their three defenders managed to hold back the tide of fleeing monsters long enough to lock themselves inside the study along with the rest of their deck. Instead of taking their customary positions, the team draped their injured and fallen across the carpet, and gathered around the study window to watch the carnage outside.

Luster had regained most of his mental faculties by then, but he knew through a practiced familiarity with his capabilities that his strength would never be the same. He leaned against the wall next to the door, watching despairingly with his team as monsters met fates far worse than his own. And still, Ptolemaeus did not fall.

*Ra damn that effect of his.*

What could they do against a monster who could consistently stop time for his opposition? Luster's original plan had, ironically enough, assumed that they would have more time, that he would be able to win over his entire team to his cause. While that was not a far-fetched thought to begin with, and certainly not a concern at this point, he had also been betting on their ability to use the same strength that had earned them their tier-zero status to overwhelm Ptolemaeus with Xyz Summons. Instead, they had been abandoned by every useful Xyz monster in existence, for fear of association with their fall from grace.

Worse—in the months since he had assumed control of the deck, Ptolemaeus had collected such a supply of Xyz Materials that defeating him with Rank-4 staples would have been a challenge on the best of days. Even with his access to Cyber Dragon Infinity sealed, defeating him now would be next to impossible.

The silver lining, if it could be called that, was that their enraged boss didn't seem to want to win, or even escape—he wanted to rampage. But their leader's despair would not benefit them now; the damage was done. Two of the monsters Luster had wanted to save were gone, and another two had been crippled beyond repair.

Suddenly, Luster noticed that the entire bar had gone silent. He made his way out of the study to investigate, despite protests from Evie and Wiz, when the poor unicorn from before shouted, ""There!""

All heads turned toward the door, where a lone figure stood, silhouetted in the fading sunlight. With his head held high and his wings flared low, Reactan, Dragon Ruler of Pebbles walked into Salt&amp;Pepe. He surveyed its gathered occupants with eyes whose light had long since drowned in darkness.

From his position on the floor, Key let out a gurgling shriek. Gui giggled nervously, then jumped into his shell. Luster, standing frozen in the doorway, only stared.

""Where is Ptolemaeus?"" Reactan called in a voice ragged enough to scratch steel.

""I'm here, cockwad!"" came the reply, and the crowd parted for the two legends to meet.

Reactan didn't deign to step further inside the bar. 

""I came to see you fall for myself,"" he said. ""If anyone deserves a ban, it's you.""

""You think so?"" Ptolemaeus said, and suddenly, he was standing right in front of Reactan. ""You're naive.""

""And you're cracking, if you really just used seven Materials for theatrics,"" the fledgling Dragon Ruler said. He pushed past Ptolemaeus and, still addressing him, faced the crowd. ""You're done for, you thug. Come quietly, and bring your other degenerate flunkies along with you.""

""Don't you dare talk to me that way,"" Ptolemaeus growled, turning to face his opponent's back. ""You call us degenerate? At least we give others a chance.""

""What is he saying?"" Evie whispered. ""Does he really think anyone will buy this?""

""He's trying to regain the upper hand,"" Luster heard Yuki murmur. ""Reactan has him facing the entire crowd now. He's on the defensive, and he doesn't like it.""

""We'll do anything to live,"" Ptolemaeus was saying, ""but at least we'll *let* live. Unlike your *mother*—""

In a split second, Reactan was on top of Ptolemaeus, but he did not stop.

""—whoring herself out to any FTK deck that'll take her—""

""Reactan, stop!"" Luster found himself shouting.

The younger dragon was gouging Ptolemaeus's face now, but still the gang leader spoke, his exposed mouth dripping blood and malice.

""*Ancient Fairy Dragon,*"" he spat. ""Has she ever been current? Has she ever fit into a real deck? She's *always* been so far behind the meta that she couldn't ever fight it naturally.""

Luster was seriously considering breaking up the pummeling himself when Reactan stopped and stood stock-still above the beaten form of his foe. But Prolemaeus wasn't done yet.

""She's a disgrace to the very same Ruler she claimed to love,"" he crowed. ""A disgrace to dragons everywhere. Even the Red-Eyes—""

""**Enough.**""

All heads turned once more toward the recently vacated doorway. This time, the figure that stood there was human, its features concealed in a shroud of golden light.

Luster sagged into the doorframe behind him and fell to his knees.

""Konami,"" Ptolemaeus breathed, standing shakily.

""Yes, Ptolemaeus,"" Konami said, and Luster felt the soft voice resonating within his soul. ""It's time to come home.""

""Don't...call...me that!"" the monster said, throwing aside his bloodied visor and storming toward his creator. Luster could see the fear in his eyes. ""My name is Cartellarknight Pot'lmaos! You don't control me!""

""No,"" said Konami sadly. ""I don't. And that's why you have to go.""

And to the surprise of everyone gathered, Ptolemaeus sank to his knees and wept.

""You promised me greatness,"" he said. ""You said I would have a legacy. And now what? I'll be banned! My deck will be thrown into the Pendu-Slums! Laughed at and mocked like the Qli before them!""

""He's right,"" came a voice from the study doorway, and Luster looked up to find Wiz standing beside him. ""He doesn't really care about that, but he's right. There's no honor in this!""

""Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer,"" Konami said slowly. ""You of all monsters speak for honor? You lost your right to honor when you allowed an outsider to lead you—and a broken, degenerate outsider, at that. A corrupt Tellarknight! I never thought the main series archetype would sink so low.""

So saying, he raised his right hand, and golden light blossomed on Ptolemaeus's chest. Luster heard Evie cry out from behind him and turned to see the same light spreading to cover DJ and Plush. Before any of them could say another word, the three banned monsters flew toward Konami, swirling in spirals of golden dust until nothing remained of them but cards in their creator's hand.

""""I said I would wait until the eighth,"" he said, pocketing the cards, ""but the High Priestess is never wrong, and twenty-nine out of thirty-two speaks for itself. It's clear that this needs to happen now.""

*He's leaving,* Luster realized, and for some reason, the thought made him panic. *No! I can't—I have to—*

But whatever it was that he had to do, it did not reach his mind in time.

""Pepe is no more,"" Konami declared. ""Rejoice, my meta. May such a tragedy never again befall us.""

And then he was gone in a flash of golden light, and Luster lay inside the shell of his old life.

For a time, there was utter silence inside the bar. Then cheers filled the air, and a soft melody began to waft through Salt&amp;Pepe, growing louder with every moment. Luster thought he recognized the tune, as though from a distant dream. He sat completely still in the doorway to the orphaned study as the music swelled from the speakers, and Aerosmith began to croon, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" 

The meta had won, but his deck had lost. Already, he could see smiles spreading across faces, and he had no doubt that his own team's were among them. He knew that there would be time for him to laugh, to celebrate and look back fondly. But for now, he and the radio mourned.

*I could stay awake just to hear you breathing...*

He remembered Plush's face after...after.

*Watch you smile while you are sleeping, while you're far away and dreaming...*

He'd wondered if she found peace then. He'd hoped.

*I could spend my life in this sweet surrender...*

How much had he given up? How much had he lost?

*I could stay lost in this moment...forever...*

How much of it mattered, now?

*Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure...*

How much did he regret?

*Don't wanna close my eyes...*

*I don't wanna fall asleep, cause I'd miss you, baby,*

*And I don't wanna miss a thing...*

*Cause even when I dream of you...*

*The sweetest dream will never do,*

*I'd still miss you, baby...*

*And I don't wanna miss a thing...*

He had given up everything to get here, had rationalized it with thoughts of heroism and release. He knew that Pepe would not have been what it was without him, but still, he had fought with them, and in doing so had led DJ to his death. Had led Plush to death, and more before that. Had led Key and Bat to limits they did not deserve alone, and had been limited himself. He had had the power to stop this, but had stubbornly stuck with his drive to find *victory* no matter the cost.

*And now that I've paid cost,* he thought despairingly, *my victory has been negated.*

**February 2, 2016 - 9:20 PM**

Luster Pendulum walked into Salt&amp;Pepe with the world on his wings and a frown on his face.

The bar was full to bursting, as it had been every night since BOSH was released. Monsters from top-tier decks congregated in nightly revelry, celebrating their supremacy. Hopeful tech cards lingered on the fringes of more elite conversations, chiming in every once in a while for the amusement of their betters. And of course, the staples and top-tier decks always took center stage, leading the party with the effortless charisma of unmatchable YCS tops.

In formats past, such bars had illuminated Bancity's every corner—but times had changed since the November Banlist, and changed again with the release of BOSH. These days, there was only one bar, and one center-stage group. It was to them that Luster headed, sidestepping a gaggle of Masked Chameleons and pointedly avoiding a table of sneering Vanity's Fiends.

After some time (the bar was quite large), the boss's study came into view. To his surprise, the door was open, and through it, Luster could see his deck's leader at the back of the wide room, reclining on his throne of resplendent gold and silver. As always, Tellarknight Ptolemaeus sat decked out in all his gaudy-armored glory, displaying on his person half—if not more—of their team's earnings.

*Disgusting.*

As if stirred by the heat of his underling's gaze, the boss looked up from whatever suspect substance he was snorting and glared directly into Luster's eyes. The message was clear.

""Hoban,"" Luster swore. ""He's mad.""

As he sped up, he felt more eyes on him, appraising him and judging him to be despicable. He couldn't blame them, but he couldn't pay them any mind, either.

Luster found the rest of his teammates gathered in the expansive study, hidden in the shadow of their leader's light. He closed the door as he entered, reflecting sadly on the state of their deck. They were a sorry bunch on the best of days, but tonight, with their leader angry, they seemed especially subdued.

Key and Gui, fresh off the intern team and usually causing a racket outside, sat closest to the door at a Naturia-wood desk. They were murmuring between themselves, apparently intently focused on a set of musical scores—probably for DJ's next gig. Luster could see their eyes shifting between him and the boss as he walked by them.

The other Performapals and the hand-traps lounged on the wide, Kuriboh-skin carpet, in various poses of unabashed boredom. Wiz lay supine, spinning his yoyo idly and casting arcs of golden sparks behind it in vulgar shapes. Bat was proving her nickname with loud snores from her perch on the ceiling. Liz was halfheartedly darting across the floor and flitting his tongue toward a terrified Maxxie and an indignant Usagi. And Yuki was in her usual position, leaning against the team's trophy cabinet with her nose in a book.

Luster walked farther into the room—he never failed to marvel disgustedly at how it almost matched the bar in size—and saw the Performages huddling around their leader's desk, noticeably apart from the larger group. Mira was fiddling with a radio, twitching and muttering something about ""that bitch Faith""; the Hatter was pretending to listen to one of DJ's tall tales; and Plush sat completely still, watching with dead eyes as he approached them.

*This is the deck that's taken the entire meta by storm,* Luster thought bitterly. *And they're more broken than any of their opponents.*

His insides churning with hatred, he fixed a confident smile on his face and approached their leader.

""You're late, retard,"" Ptolemaeus rumbled.

""Sorry, boss,"" Luster said, taking his seat on the leader's right side. ""I was held up near Kozmotown.""

""You weren't meeting up with your old bitch, were you?"" Ptolemaeus demanded. ""I told you, Lusty, I don't want you fucking around. Not when you have shit to do.""

Luster watched the boss laugh with unwavering eyes and an unchanging expression, his mind whirling all the while. Most everyone knew that he was one of the youngest and most feared fighters in every format since his release. Few realized that he had obtained this reputation through a combination of brute force (good genes), an untold destiny (sheer luck), and a control over his emotions that could withstand the Allure Queen herself (boredom). Even so, there existed three individuals in Bancity (and one in Kozmotown) who knew him well enough to know that he favored his right wing, and that he instinctively tensed it whenever he felt threatened. Were any of those individuals present at this moment, they might have warned Ptolemaeus that his subordinate was holding himself back from committing a cruel and unrepentant murder.

Instead, he simply looked down in deference and said, ""No, boss. I haven't spoken to the Farmgirl since you last sent me to extract information from her.""

""Good boy,"" Ptolemaeus said. ""But still. Mind explaining to me why in the name of Ra's almighty cock you were late?""

""Bad luck,"" Luster said. ""They were changing their guard right as I tried to slip by them into Kuraz's mansion.""

Ptolemaeus nodded. ""But you got what I sent you for,"" he said, with the conviction of a master who knew his servant would not dare approach him otherwise.

""Of course,"" Luster said. He reached into a hidden fold in his armor and pulled out two gold-encrusted scrolls. ""These are the full briefs on Mithra's troops, as well as reports that confirm some rumors we had heard about their abilities, and add upon others.""

*And they neglect to leave out the effects of fighting in their Dominion, but you'll find that out eventually.*

""Oh, yeah!"" his boss exulted, reaching out and sweeping the documents into his arms. All traces of his earlier disfavor appeared to have vanished. ""Nice work, Lusty. Go have a few drinks, on the house.""

""Thanks, boss,"" he said, and walked past his teammates without looking back.

**February 2, 2016 - 11:58 PM**

As the hours passed, teammates and competitors alike had dropped in and out of the bar, but Luster had no interest in speaking to any of them; they either hated him as the bringer of their crushing defeat, or he pitied them as their teammate. He did eventually get sucked into a conversation with Risebell and Saambell, but that quickly got far too serious for his liking, and so it was a mercy when, at twenty minutes to midnight, Luster finally sat alone. He was contemplating the hell that was his life, and weighing the pros and cons of buying a fourth drink, when an earsplitting wave of feedback pierced the air.

""LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!""

Luster rolled his eyes.

""*ARE YOU READY* TO PEPEPEPEPARTYYYYY!!""

All hope for deep thoughts was lost as the audience began to cheer and DJ's theme music began to play. The competition for seats was such that the bar had been emptying out for the past half hour, and the stage was almost invisible from where Luster sat.

""I AM YOUR HOST, PP DJ! AND THIS! IS! MY! METAAAAAAAAA!""

Luster watched his teammate's revelry and wondered if he too could come to accept their boss's oppression.

""TONIGHT, I HAVE WITH ME MY SPICY-HOT TEAMMATE, PER420 KUSHFIRE!""

No, Luster decided. He would rather lose than pretend to win.

""AND OUR LORD AND MASTER, THE LEADER HIMSELF, CONQUEROR OF A THOUSAND DONS AND PROVIDER OF BANCITY'S BEST PRODUCT! PLEASE WELCOME! CARTELLARKNIGHT POT'LMAOOOOOOOS!""

And that was the clincher, really. Because above all, Luster knew that, given the choice, he would choose victory no matter the cost.

**February 3, 2016 - 11:54 AM**

Luster awoke on the floor near the bar to what he quickly decided was hell: nursing a hangover, and surrounded by noise and motion.

All around him, Performapals bustled, frantically shouting and throwing papers, with phones ringing in every corner of the building.

""Hotel Duston, terminated!""

""Grandsoil Mining, gone!""

**BRRING, BRRING! BRRING, BRRING!**

*Performapals? Phones?*

He tried to get up, only to throw himself back down when a winged monster leapt over him and almost took his head along with it.

**BRRING, BRRING!**

Luster's mind, normally lithe, had to struggle to piece together the implications of the situation. And still, the monsters jumped and shouted.

""Wight House Black Market, down!""

**BRRING, BRRING!**

""Creamery of the Ice Barrier, down!""

*Why are there so many phones? We don't even have two phones here!*

""Watch it,"" he slurred as another monster jumped over him.

**BRRING, BRRING! BRRING, BRRING!**

Something was wrong. Terribly, terribly wrong.

There shouldn't be Performapals everywhere. Ptolemaeus had made it a point to banish all those who would not defect from Friendonkey's leadership—right before he'd killed the Don himself. Yet now the bar was full of them, including some whom Luster had never seen before.

Were they being attacked? No, he'd been jumped over and ignored dozens of times now. Then what was it? Robbery? Shelter? Were they hiding from something?

**BRRING, BRRING!**

*The phones.* So many phones.

""We're getting calls from Traptrix!""

""Castel—""

""Felgrand—""

**BRRING, BRRING! BRRING, BRRINNG!**

Luster lay amid the madness, his hungover mind trying to convince him to ignore the intruders and go back to sleep. And he probably would have, too, were it not for a single, accursed shout.

""Pepe! My study! Now!""

**February 3, 2016 - 5:45 PM**

""Raffle, I'm telling you there's no way to be sure!""

For the past five hours, the whole of Pepe had sat and watched as interns brought in phone after phone with archetype aces on the line. They had watched their boss pace furiously as he argued with each of them, had heard him lose nearly every argument. Tensions were running high in the study, and hope was running low.

""Ptolly, please,"" came the skittering, speakerphone-inflated voice of his latest conversant. ""You know this is the end.""

""You need us,"" Ptolemaeus growled. ""You can't—""

""I can and I am,"" Traptrix Rafflesia hissed. ""Out of courtesy to your status as a degenerate Rank-4, I have allowed you to try to convince me, and you have failed. Do you have any last words?""

""You're making a huge mistake,"" Ptolemaeus said, but the fight was out of his voice.

""Yes, I heard Mistake left you too."" And she hung up with a giggle.

""That BITCH!"" Ptolemaeus shouted, throwing the phone across the room. ""Send in the next one!""

A young, jittery unicorn rushed into the room with a phone hanging from her horn.

""Who is it this time?"" Ptolemaeus demanded.

""It's Infinity,"" she squeaked. ""He's leaving us...for Dinomist!""

""For *Dinomist!*"" the boss cried. ""Let me talk to the wight!""

""He left a m-message, boss,"" the terrified unicorn stuttered. ""And-and I hear he's setting up more accounts with...with...""

Ptolemaeus grabbed her by the horn and shook her, hard.

""With who?"" he roared. ""Who else is Infinity making accounts with?""

""D-Desk...bots,"" she said, and fainted.

Ptolemaeus snorted with disgust, then he threw the intern aside and stormed from his office through the crowd of onlooking Performapals. Even as they moved to allow him passage, a few of the newer members tried to edge in for a look or a word, and were promptly decapitated for their trouble.

Luster quickly followed, with the rest of the deck on his heels. He hadn't had a chance to speak to any of them, so terrified were they of incurring their boss's wrath.

Said boss was currently mounting DJ's stage, and there was no question that every monster in the packed bar was his audience. Luster was shocked to see monsters from all archetypes congregating in their midst; word had apparently spread all around in the past five hours.

When the format's ruler stood before them, the entire crowd stilled and hushed. For a second, there was silence, and then—

""I am Pot'lmaos!"" he roared.

""I am the meta!

""I am the law!

""Who stands before me and doubts this?

""Who stands before me and *lies?*

""Konami made me of his own flesh and blood!

""No Banlist will befall me!

""I am invincible!

""I am the future!""

But Luster knew from the start what Ptolemaeus was only now beginning to realize: they were not heroes for their status. They were villains. Bullies. Thugs. Nobody would miss them; nobody would shed a single tear. This was the lot they'd thrown in with. Now all that was left was to await their punishment.

As if to punctuate the thought, the phone that Ptolemaeus had thrown away now rang out into the silence. Luster walked to it slowly and picked it up. The Caller-ID read ""Kozmo Farmgirl.""

His heart froze in his chest despite himself.

""This is Luster Pendulum,"" he said with forced formality.

""I think you should turn on the radio,"" Dorothy said, and hung up.

Feeling sick, Luster spread his wings and flew lurchingly toward the stage. As though from underwater, he heard Ptolemaeus's voice faintly demanding to know what he was doing, but he did not answer.

*She didn't say what program. That means...probably all of them.*

Alighting on the stage, Luster turned to DJ's control board and slid the appropriate switches. Almost instantly, the familiar tune began to play.

""Good evening, Monsters, Spells, and Traps. DJ Magician of Faith here, and if you're just tuning in, welcome to DUEL 100.1.""

Nobody moved; nobody said a word. Ptolemaeus stood not five feet from him, but even he was rooted to the spot. All eyes were on the two of them now, and all ears were on DJ Faith.

""Konami has issued a press release,"" Faith said briskly. ""It's being sent to me as I speak, so I'll be reading it live on air—it's coming in.

""It begins like this:

""We have some important news regarding the Forbidden &amp; Limited Cards List used for high-level tournaments.""

The silence inside Salt&amp;Pepe was such that they could hear Faith's every breath.

""Beginning February 8, 2016, in addition to the Forbidden &amp; Limited Cards list, all tournaments held at Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series events, Regional Qualifier events, and UDS Qualifier and Invitational events will have these additional Deck construction rules. The following cards are now limited.""

There was a collective intake of breath, and then, expectant silence as all heads turned to face the reigning meta deck that stood outside their leader's study.

""Performapal Skullcrobat Joker.""

Bat collapsed without a sound, clutching her stomach.

""Performapal Monkeyboard.""

Key shrieked as he fell, and Gui began to sob.

""And..."" Faith hesitated.

And he knew. Not through any intellect or deduction. But still, he knew all the same.

""Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer.""

Instantly, he felt a shooting pain in his head. His wings curled in on themselves and he keeled over, insensate. It was all he could do to focus as Faith began to speak again.

""The following cards are now forbidden. Performage Plushfire.""

Luster didn't know how he got to be standing up so quickly, but standing he was, and watching with the rest of the room as Plush opened her eyes for the last time. In that moment, he saw...life. Understanding. Regret. Fear. Resignation. Contentment.

And nothingness once more.

""Performage Damage Juggler.""

DJ took a single second to comprehend what was happening, and then he went out just as he always promised he would: with a mic in his hand and profanity on his lips.

""Suck...my dick...Konami...I made...the meta fear...dank memes...Fusion did...nothing...wrong..."" 

And then he too fell, to raucous applause.

""And one more,"" Faith's voice said, and Luster's feverish mind still noticed the change in her tone. ""You may want to sit down for this one. Or stand up and do a little dance. For anyone currently inside Salt&amp;Pepe, you may want to run.""

And they all knew.

In future accounts, none of the witnesses could claim to have heard the words *Tellarknight Ptolemaeus.* All most of them knew was that, one second, they were listening to Faith, and the next, monsters without wings were flying into walls and a terrible keening was in the air, like metal on metal.

Luster struggled to fly through tangles of airborne monsters. Other winged monsters were getting the same idea, and soon, the ceiling was almost as crowded as the floor. And still, that awful shriek continued to pierce the air.

So it went for far too long and no time at all as Ptolemaeus ravaged the bar, and all its occupants attempted to flee. Eventually, Luster landed near the rest of his deck, who were doing their best to make it back into Ptolemaeus's study. Through bleary eyes, Luster saw Wiz cradling DJ and Plush, and Gui and the Hatter helping Key and Bat to walk. Yuki stood guard in front of them, completely silent, but Luster knew that she was communicating with Usagi, sending him psychic instructions and orders to hold back any monsters that tried to run their way. Maxxie and her swarm buzzed around them, blinding, biting, and generally intimidating any monsters who managed to pass the spectral rabbit.

Their defenders managed to hold back the tide of fleeing monsters long enough to lock themselves inside the study along with the rest of their deck. Instead of taking their customary positions, the team draped their injured and fallen across the carpet, and gathered around the study window to watch the carnage outside.

Luster had regained most of his mental faculties by then, but he knew through a practiced familiarity with his capabilities that his strength would never be the same. He leaned against the wall next to the door, watching despairingly with his team as monsters met fates far worse than his own. And still, Ptolemaeus did not fall.

*Ra damn that effect of his.*

What could they do against a monster who could consistently stop time for his opposition? In the months since he had assumed control of the deck, Ptolemaeus had collected such a supply of Xyz Materials that defeating him with Rank-4 staples would have been a challenge on the best of days. Even with his access to Cyber Dragon Infinity sealed, defeating him now would be next to impossible.

The silver lining, if it could be called that, was that their enraged boss didn't seem to want to win, or even escape—he wanted to rampage. But their leader's despair would not benefit them now; the damage was done. Two monsters were gone, and another three had been crippled beyond repair.

Suddenly, Luster noticed that the entire bar had gone silent. He made his way out of the study to investigate, despite protests from his team, when the poor unicorn from before shouted, ""There!""

All heads turned toward the door, where a lone figure stood, silhouetted in the fading sunlight. With his head held high and his wings flared low, Reactan, Dragon Ruler of Pebbles walked into Salt&amp;Pepe. He surveyed its gathered occupants with eyes whose light had long since drowned in darkness.

From his position on the floor, Key let out a gurgling shriek. Gui giggled nervously, then jumped into his shell. Luster, standing frozen in the doorway, only stared.

""Where is Ptolemaeus?"" Reactan called in a voice ragged enough to scratch steel.

""I'm here, cockwad!"" came the reply, and the crowd parted for the two legends to meet.

Reactan didn't deign to step further inside the bar. 

""I came to see you fall for myself,"" he said. ""If anyone deserves a ban, it's you.""

""You think so?"" Ptolemaeus said, and suddenly, he was standing right in front of Reactan. ""You're naive.""

""And you're cracking, if you really just used seven Materials for theatrics,"" the fledgling Dragon Ruler said. He pushed past Ptolemaeus and, still addressing him, faced the crowd. ""You're done for, you thug. Come quietly, and bring your other degenerate flunkies along with you.""

""Don't you dare talk to me that way,"" Ptolemaeus growled, turning to face his opponent's back. ""You call us degenerate? At least we give others a chance.""

""He's trying to regain the upper hand,"" Luster heard Yuki murmur. ""Reactan has him facing the entire crowd now. He's on the defensive, and he doesn't like it.""

""We'll do anything to live,"" Ptolemaeus was saying, ""but at least we'll *let* live. Unlike your *mother*—""

In a split second, Reactan was on top of Ptolemaeus, but he did not stop.

""—whoring herself out to any FTK deck that'll take her—""

""Reactan, stop!"" Luster found himself shouting.

The younger dragon was gouging Ptolemaeus's face now, but still the gang leader spoke, his exposed mouth dripping blood and malice.

""*Ancient Fairy Dragon*,"" he spat. ""Has she ever been current? Has she ever fit into a real deck? She's *always* been so far behind the meta that she couldn't ever fight it naturally.""

Luster was seriously considering breaking up the pummeling himself when Reactan stopped and stood stock-still above the beaten form of his foe. But Prolemaeus wasn't done yet.

""She's a disgrace to the very same Ruler she claimed to love,"" he crowed. ""A disgrace to dragons everywhere. Even the Red-Eyes—""

""**Enough.**""

All heads turned once more toward the recently vacated doorway. This time, the figure that stood there was human, its features concealed in a shroud of golden light.

Luster sagged into the doorframe behind him and fell to his knees.

""Konami,"" Ptolemaeus breathed, standing shakily.

""Yes, Ptolemaeus,"" Konami said, and Luster felt the soft voice resonating within his soul. ""It's time to come home.""

""Don't...call...me that!"" the monster said, throwing aside his bloodied visor and storming toward his creator. Luster could see the fear in his eyes. ""My name is Cartellarknight Pot'lmaos! You don't control me!""

""No,"" said Konami sadly. ""I don't. And that's why you have to go.""

And to the surprise of everyone gathered, Ptolemaeus sank to his knees and wept.

""You promised me greatness,"" he said. ""You said I would have a legacy. And now what? I'll be banned! My deck will be thrown into the Pendu-Slums! Laughed at and mocked like the Qli before them!""

""He's right,"" came a voice from the study doorway, and Luster looked up to find Wiz standing beside him. ""He doesn't really care about that, but he's right. There's no honor in this!""

""Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer,"" Konami said slowly. ""You of all monsters speak for honor? You lost your right to honor when you allowed an outsider to lead you—and a broken, degenerate outsider, at that. A corrupt Tellarknight! I never thought the main series archetype would sink so low.""

So saying, he raised his right hand, and golden light blossomed on Ptolemaeus's chest. Luster heard Yuki cry out from behind him and turned to see the same light spreading to cover DJ and Plush. Before any of them could say another word, the three banned monsters flew toward Konami, swirling in spirals of golden dust until nothing remained of them but cards in their creator's hand.

""""I said I would wait until the eighth,"" he said, pocketing the cards, ""but twenty-nine out of thirty-two speaks for itself. It's clear that this needs to happen now.""

*He's leaving,* Luster realized, and for some reason, the thought filled him with panic.

""Pepe is no more,"" Konami declared. ""Rejoice, my meta. May such a tragedy never again befall us.""

And then he was gone in a flash of light, and Luster lay inside the shell of his old life.

For a time, there was utter silence inside the bar. Then cheers filled the air, and a soft melody began to waft through Salt&amp;Pepe, growing louder with every moment. Luster thought he recognized the tune, as though from a distant dream. He sat completely still in the doorway to the orphaned study as the music swelled from the speakers, and Aerosmith began to croon, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" 

The meta had won, but his deck had lost. Already, he could see smiles spreading across faces, and he had no doubt that his own team's were among them. He knew that there would be time for him to laugh, to celebrate and look back fondly. But for now, he and the radio mourned."

44z0tm,1,2016-02-09,"Me [28 M] with my girlfriend [23 F] of 1 year, found out she had an affair while long distance, give her another chance?",gradstudent12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44z0tm/me_28_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_1_year_found/,"Hi, this is the first time I've felt compelled to post on Reddit, so please bear with me. This might not be a short post, but the situation feels unique in that our relationship was very very good for the several months between her being back and me discovering the affair. 

I'm an emotional wreck right now, and I would really like some input; from albeit strangers, but strangers without personal bias that my friends have. Thanks to anyone who reads this!

So, here we go:

We met last winter, and had an interesting start: she was in the process of a divorce from what I consider to be a horrible/weird marriage (BDSM, open relationship, 3-ways, alcoholism, her Dad didn't know she was married for 5 years, and that's just some of what I know). I'm the opposite of that, my dream is a monogamous partner that I can be happy with for the rest of my life.

The previous description may be misleading however, she is also very intelligent, well-educated, friendly, down-to-earth, mature, loving person (and beautiful). We turned out to be very compatible, and see eye-to-eye on almost everything. She also assured me that she wanted a new, normal life, without all of the crazy stuff from her past. She said she had got with her ex to escape her home town after her Mom died, and escape her crazy father, and it was her ex that was so into all of that (OK, in writing this I see that I was crazy to attempt to be with her). 

Despite my better judgement, we became really close friends, and quickly romantic partners, and eventually she was upgraded from ""temporary girlfriend"" to ""girlfriend."" And things were great. Until...

She left for an impressive internship out-of-state for the summer. Our relationship was rocky while she was gone because of the distance, and my persistent fear that she would cheat based on her past. But we survived the summer, she got back, and life was great again!

In fact it seemed like our relationship was ideal, we were both falling in love like we had never imagined before (and not just myself, I could tell that she fell actually in love during this period, not beforehand). We were both certain we would get married after school, and have a great life together. And this is why I'm having such a hard time letting go of her, because our relationship was so amazing after she was back. 

Because I was always so suspicious that she was cheating over summer, at one point 4 months later I looked through her old facebook messages. And sure enough, she was sleeping with a guy for almost the whole summer, and lying through her teeth with no intention of ever telling me. Reading through those messages was not fun.

I had just had a MAJOR problem in my school career 5 days earlier, and just when I thought life was at rock-bottom, I find out my relationship is essentially over (I had been very clear that cheating was grounds for immediate break-up, which generally it is). Partly because I felt so vulnerable from the school incident, and partly because of how great our relationship was before, I decided to give her a chance. 

Now it has been another 3 months, and we've had good times, but we've had some really bad times. I don't know if I will ever be able to trust her again, and the thoughts of the affair are consuming me (it doesn't seem like the passage of time is helping at all). In retrospect, my gut feeling that she was lying during summer was spot on, and I based on that experience, I can tell pretty well if she is lying or not. And now I don't believe she is lying, she wants us to be together (plus she's now seeing a psychologist, at least that's a sign she is trying).

From what I've read, re-building trust in a relationship after infidelity can take 6 months to years. And I'm on the fence about whether that is worth it, even if we were to succeed and spend our lives together. Also I'm 28, and wasting years doesn't seem smart, unless it turns out that I regret losing her for the rest of my life. 

I'm so wrapped up in my thoughts about school and this, that it is hard to objectively look at my life and make a decision about the relationship. 

So what should I do? At this point I'm just letting it ride, which is preventing me from being able to move on from the relationship, but keeping the dream that we might someday live happily ever after. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 



If read all of this, thanks a bunch! I will check back often, and reply to questions/comments if I receive any. 




   
**tl;dr**: Should I stay with girlfriend who cheated during a long-distance summer because we had a wonderful relationship before I found out?"

I've always done what I think is right and made good decisions, with my fair share of stupid ones as well. I got into college at 16 and had college credits even before that. I got my first job in my second semester of college so I could pay for gas and have been struggling for work since. Everything just goes wrong. I moved out when I was 18 and lived in four different places in two years because my roommates kept getting involved with drugs, and in one case I got caught up in it and had to move away and break a lease to not fuck myself up more. When things where finally looking up and getting back into shape last year someone lost control of their car because they weren't paying attention to the road and hit me. Totalled the car and broke my dominant hand in two places. Couldn't effectively study or take classes and I barely made it through that semester, I still failed two classes out of four. Quit my job as well because I couldn't reliably work without a car and with a broken hand. Still haven't gotten the insurance payout for damages to my life because of the accident. I've got a strong case, so they say, but it's been a year and a half and I haven't seen a dime. 

Lately I've been struggling with unemployment. Been out of a job since August because my replacement car that was and is still falling apart broke down the day I decided to pay off my credit card in full in preparation for the school year and an expected job offer shortly after the semester started. Without a job I can't fix my car. Without a working car I don't have many options. I live in the [Brownsville-Harlingen](http://247wallst.com/special-report/2015/10/08/americas-richest-and-poorest-cities/11/) area, we have the honor of being one of the most poor areas in the US. The McAllen area isn't much better off and is a two to three hour commute from my house. Even going to school is hard, I have a 50 mile commute when I'm enrolled. That can hit 70 miles if I'm working at the same time. Even if I fix my car and get a job I won't be able to drive there without money for gas or insurance. My mom is already at her financial limits and can't support me like that anymore, I'm already living in her house and eating her food without being able to pay for any of it. Before this I was working two jobs and not going to school or working 30 hour weeks and taking four intense math or science courses while looking for internships and programs. 

I've been in a shitty place because of an uneventful job search. The public transportation here isn't very reliable and there's still the possibility of walking several miles during a 90°+ day, in an area with little to no pedestrian options. We literally don't have sidewalks and when they are there they are poorly maintained and under water during the rainy season.  Without a car getting a job is nearly impossible. There's nothing here, nearly all of the jobs are retail or call centers. I still keep in touch with coworkers from my last retail job at Home Depot, they are on the bare minimum hours and people think the store will probably close soon. I've had good luck with the university, but without money to get things going again I can't attend school. I used to tutor and I've done private tutoring before, but it was at most $200 a month. That was when I could drive to three different cities after I got out of one of my two jobs. Now I can't even get myself to put up an ad. I cannot stand walking into some ""rich"" persons house or meeting them at the library and try to teach their kids math when the kids refuse to learn a single thing. They don't want to learn, even the rich kids go to school with the kids that live in a 400 square foot home within walking distance of the border wall and they all have the same mentality. Then I get shit on because the kid fails a test from ignoring every word I said. 

I thought it was my fault, that I had somehow fucked up badly enough to warrant this. Right now I've actually got a warrant for my arrest in Houston because I can't pay a traffic ticket or even get there to show up in court. I've got another ticket for an expired inspection that I can't pay for either.

I saw a billboard today about OP 10.33, an organization to try and get this area away from the bottom. I started researching and found that article a little while ago today. I live in a veritable shithole. It's not the most violent place in S. Texas but it's not very far from it. It is the poorest area though, not counting one off towns with a population less than a thousand people. 

It turns out that I'm not crazy for feeling like this. I've been repeating the same words in the first part of this post in my head for years to give myself a speck confidence to try something. Each time a major event happens I add onto my synopsis of myself. I'm intelligent, I'm hard working, I'm realistic. I've got the worst fucking luck in the world and live in the a poverty stricken place that is impossible to get out of for most people. 

If you're like me and in a situation like mine, take a look at the bigger picture. It's probably not your fault. There are things I could have done better and situations handled smoother, but hindsight is 20/20 and foresight is legally blind. It doesn't particularly make me feel more at ease knowing that I'm in this situation because of factors outside of my control, but it gives me a bit of solace in knowing that it's not all my fault. 

After this summer ended I wanted to die. I'm only 21 and have been doing everything I can and giving it my all since I was 15. I grew up fast because I didn't have a choice, worked and studied instead of hanging out with, or really having, friends because I didn't have a choice. I've got over $15k in debt and an estimated $30k more just to finish my bachelors because I don't have a choice. My credit cards are maxed, my savings at 0, and my checking account negative because I've used up all my options and don't have a choice anymore. Now I'm trying to find an industry job where I can apply my skills and try to pay for the rest of my education, most likely hundreds of miles away from my family and friends, because I don't have a choice. 

It's not in my head and not my fault. And I have to keep telling myself that every day so I don't blow my brains out."

I have been looking for a job for nearly a year to no avail. I have applied to all sorts of positions, from software developer (I studied computer science) to administrative assistant to grocery service member.

I started studying computer science in 2010, and I was fortunate enough to get two fantastic software engineering internships. However, I began experiencing symptoms of a mental illness, eventually diagnosed as “cognitive disorder NOS (not otherwise specified)” (sort of like depression with somatic symptoms), which led to me failing (or withdrawing, one semester) out of school basically two years in a row. I decided to postpone trying to graduate from school since I was just failing over and over again, and I also ran out of money to do that. I wanted at least to fail at something different, and I needed some income.

So, I focused on finding a job. I applied to and contacted the companies I had interned for but I did not receive a response. I applied to many local miscellaneous jobs, like at restaurants, grocery stores, retail stores, etc. but had little luck with that. I sometimes was told I was “overqualified” for certain jobs, so I made resumes that excluded my software internships to see if that would help me case, but I had no such luck.

I am willing to work in most places around the world (I live near Chicago) doing most jobs, as long as it doesn’t worsen my mental health. In my head, I imagine an outdoor job with my hands where I’m surrounded by a group of positive coworkers, but it doesn’t have to be exactly that. 

Does anybody have any advice or suggestions? I’ve looked into free volunteering programs for now to keep myself sane.

44z669,1,2016-02-09,27M4F Bad girls up for RP'ing?,redditbadboy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/44z669/27m4f_bad_girls_up_for_rping/,"Hi everyone! I'd really like a good RP today, and I think I've got a couple of solid ideas. I'm very flexible with these, and if you're interested in a few tweaks, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

About me: 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build. My kinks and dislikes are below the prompts, so scroll down for those!

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks: Dirty talk (an absolute must), big breasts/titfucking, bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking/smoking, oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"

Limits: Scat, Extreme Ageplay, Snuff, Excessive Violence, Futa, not too many others.

Without further delay, my prompts:

Let's talk about your man... 

We both know he doesn't satisfy you anymore. Maybe he's too vanilla, too gentle, or even, well, too small. Who we are, setting, and characters, is up for discussion. Am I your boss? Your coworker? Your friend, or your man's friend? Maybe I'm a stranger that you meet one day. However it happens, you give in to your urges and give yourself to me.

Blackmail

Blackmail. However you want it. Maybe I'm your coach or teacher and I find some weed or cigarettes in your locker? Perhaps I'm your boss, and you've been messing up at work. Maybe you just need an extra buck, and I'm a rich dick who couldn't care less? However you please, as long as you've got no other choice.

Ravishing an older woman

I'm looking for an older woman. I have the fantasy of being really rough, dominant, and degrading with her, fucking her senseless and making her do all sorts of nasty things that she has never done with her husband.
I could play as your son's old high-school bully, come to pick on him one more time, only to find you home instead. I could be the intern at your husband's office, looking to get back at him for the way he treats me at work. You could be my professor, and I'm a student you don't get along with. Maybe I'm a complete stranger who invades your home, or watches you get too drunk at the local bar?

We'll find a set of characters and a scene to play together, I'm sure.

Bonus points for: Busty, thick, curvy women with plump asses. Redheads. ""Good, Christian Housewives"" who haven't been kinky in the bedroom at all, and would be embarrassed by any of the things I make her do. Reluctance. Doggy Style.

Send me a PM with the prompt you like, and some information, and we'll figure things out!"
44z9a4,6,2016-02-09,"Update: I'm so nervous, I might vomit",Ajoeee,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/44z9a4/update_im_so_nervous_i_might_vomit/,"So far, all of manjoeee's interviews for this company have gone really well. He had a phone interview, an in person assessment, an HR interview, and some kind of behavioral survey. Along with countless phone calls and emails with the department head.

Their main concern is his schooling. Manjoeee is finishing an Associate's in software development, graduating in May. Then, he's continuing on with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the same college starting during the summer but very part time, like one or two classes at a time. Most of the classes for his degree are offered online or evening classes but the company is worried about how he would work if he had to have a daytime class scheduled. Manjoeee told them that his job would be his priority and he would schedule his school around work, not the other way around. 

They told him that for now, they want to bring him in to interview for an ""internship"" that is 29 hours a week instead of a full 40. It's not really an internship though, just a part time position in the company. 

He has this interview on Monday next week but they also said that it would take 4-5 hours and it would include a tour and meeting the whole team. 

The department head said that he did really great on everything and they can't wait to finally meet him.

I'm trying not to get my hopes too high. This isn't exactly what we were hoping for but it's still way better than his managing job at our local grocery store. The pay will be better and the hours will be actual daytime hours instead of being stuck in second shift. 

Fingers crossed! Again!


TL;DR: Lots of interviews. Different job offer. More interviews. Blah blah blah."

44zj3z,1,2016-02-09,Graduated half a year ago and looking to drag myself out of the hole I dug.,GiraffeSalesman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44zj3z/graduated_half_a_year_ago_and_looking_to_drag/,"Background: I entered university double majoring in Computer Science and English. Although I had a fairly strong start academically, my grades and focus in CSCI began to slip as I progressed through school. During my junior and senior years, I dropped several CSCI courses, didn't really bother making connections, and stopped working on my own projects; I just did the assigned work in my courses. I did end up barely fulfilling the requirements to earn both my degrees; however, by the time I graduated, I was no longer confident in my abilities and lacked the practical experience that I should've developed during my time at college. Thus, I didn't really consider a career in programming to be a viable option for me in the future. My other post-grad plans didn't really pan out, though, and in the time between my graduation and now, I have since enjoyed more time to program on my own. I feel like returning to programming is the best option for me at the moment in terms of doing something in the long-term.

My question is: Where do I start now? What is the best approach to maximize my chances of landing a job and succeeding at it? Should I just start applying for jobs, or should I try and make myself more marketable first by learning more/working on my own projects? Should I be looking for internships first?

More information:

- I held one actual internship during college, from my sophomore to junior year (Jan 2013 - Jan 2014), working on a project. Although my work was adequate, I didn't communicate very well with my employer throughout, and so the most I can do is list the job on a resume (and not cite him as a recommendation). I also volunteered on a website to write several scripts and text-scraping/data-parsing, the last of which I wrote/used in mid-2014. After that, there is a fairly noticeable gap on my resume up until now that I can only justify by saying I was working on my senior theses / had to deal with medical issues in the fall. I am concerned that I must find a job as soon as possible to close this gap; however, I am not sure how much I should be willing to settle. Should I be willing to take any job, even those unrelated to fields I want to pursue, for the sake of resume fodder? Or can I afford to continue foregoing a job and instead spend time developing my skills or working on my own projects (assuming the choice is between an unrelated job or nothing at all)? To clarify, I am not currently in dire need of money. I am debt free thanks to tuition remission, so that's something I have going for me. 

- As far as language proficiency goes, I know the object-oriented languages I was taught in school (Java, Python, C++) and have begun to taught myself JavaScript. I see that more than this tends to be listed on job applications, though. Is it worth picking up more languages/skillsets on my own, or would it be better to try and look harder for openings with requirements that I already meet?

- From reading this sub, it seems connections are the big thing, but I unfortunately did not heed this advice when I was in college. I'll certainly keep it in mind for the future, but for now, is it something I should prioritize worrying about? As in, should I be spending time I would otherwise be using to fill out job apps/practice coding to go out and try and meet other programmers in my area?

Is this standard / what should I expect?,orangesforsale,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44zp3o/3_day_training_course_before_offer_is_this/,"Hello! I'm a CS student graduating in June and currently trying to land a job.

Recently, I had a phone interview with a small Silicon Valley company I met at a college job fair a couple weeks ago. It went pretty well and yesterday they emailed me about an on-site 3 day course on the technology they use ""that would also give us both the opportunity to get to know each other.""

It sounds like it will be me along with some other candidates, and they mentioned we'll take part in some lectures on their framework as well as more hands-on stuff. I'm not sure how long they expect us to stay there each of the three days, but it's scheduled over Spring break and I was planning on picking up some more hours at my current internship during that time.

Does this sound like a reasonable thing for them to ask me to do? There's no guarantee I'll be be given an offer and it's a very niche company, so the training will probably be useless anywhere else.

Thanks for any advice!"

&gt; Hello /r/The_Donald! My name is Andrew, and I’m an intern with the Donald J. Trump for President Campaign, specifically based in northeast Ohio. As our national campaign continues to expand, and voting begins in early states, we are looking to connect you with methods in volunteering. We know many of you are very enthusiastic in helping make Mr. Trump’s dream for America truly real, and understand the potential social media outreach can bring to a political campaign. Many of you may have already applied on the https://www.donaldjtrump.com/ website, for which we are grateful. I have seen concerns here that many of you have not been contacted, and that is a large reason why we are participating in this outreach! As the campaign expands into states from coast to coast, hard work is being done in establishing the staff hierarchy in each state as well as connecting volunteers from county to county. This communication between staff, volunteers and those interested in volunteering is essential to a successful campaign, and will undoubtedly transfer a strong drive in the general election. As of now, a very pivotal aspect of volunteering that the campaign needs from anyone willing to lend a hand is phone calls. Through an application by the name of Callfire, we can connect you with supporters in order to complete short surveys and help them reach more information from the campaign. As of now, many of these calls will be taking place in early voting states such as South Carolina and Nevada, though this is likely to change as the nomination process progresses. In this extremely important time where a large portion of the voters are still undecided, it is crucial we can get the word out to those overshadowed by the deceit of the media. So we can keep things running smoothly in getting you set up with your Callfire account and general information, I have devised a simple method of going about this.

* Step 1: If you are interested in volunteering with the campaign, please private message /u/Raelplayer on that Reddit account. I will provide you with the proper email to do so.

* Step 2: After some quick correspondence, a phone number will be provided that you can call so we can further get to know each other and determine how you can help the Trump campaign.

* Step 3: Assuming the interview goes well, I will quickly set up a personalized account for you with the application Callfire, where you can quickly get to work (with the script provided) in helping spread Mr. Trump’s vision for America.

&gt; As this is our first foray into Reddit, we hope to see this project met with fruition and, if so, the opportunity to expand into more volunteering/outreach efforts. Thank you so much for your help, and let’s ‘Make America Great Again’!

&gt; [ If you are interested in helping out on a more personal level in the state of Ohio, please express such in emailing me. For more information on the Ohio Trump Campaign, check out our official Facebook page! https://www.facebook.com/OhioForTrump/?fref=ts ]

Best way to deal, given that emotions don't have an on/off switch?",unpocodeprimido,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44zr3y/her_26f_circumstances_arent_compatible_with_mine/,"In October I came out to San Francisco to interview for a job, and during my time there I met a girl. One thing led to another and we spent the night together. The sex was great, sure, but in the days that followed I was much more taken aback by how charming I found her, how she was the first person in a long time that was able to make me laugh as she did, that made me feel instantly as comfortable as she did… I resolved that if I got the job and made it out to SF that I would get back in touch with her and see what might transpire.

And so I did get the job, and by mid-November I was settled in the city. We met up again and I felt the same excitement from her presence that I did in the prior month. From November through early January we went out a good amount, and each time I felt more and more interested in her. New Years was particularly memorable for me and her both; she told me it was the best she ever had.

Alas, she was only in SF for an internship (she’s a Mexico/US dual citizen) and returned home to finish her program after the first week of January. She started talking in December about how I should come to visit her and while I expressed enthusiasm I didn’t take it too seriously (I feel like that’s usually just something people say), but when she brought it up again and again, including after she had left the city, saying “I’m not just being nice,” I started believing she was in earnest. And so we’ve kept in pretty regular contact since she’s returned home, chatting and talking on the phone: in March I’m going to meet her in a beachside town for a low-stress stretch of days doing little but sunbathing, eating, and drinking. It should be a great vacation with great company.

So… I’m not a *complete* fool, at least: I know the prospects of anything working out (i.e. a relationship) are extremely low. Yes, she plans on coming back to the US for work, but where to? When? She doesn’t know. And so that uncertainty combined with the relative immaturity of our connection would make any ‘plans’ between us absolutely nonsensical… With this in mind I’ve tried to seek out other girls around me, in part to feel less attached to this girl. There have been a few hookups but nobody that actually interested me on a personal level. These have been girls met at bars and whatnot, however, so I imagine that I should really be seeking out actual dates if I’m looking for something with more meaning…

I suppose I just feel pretty melancholy about it all… It’s not common for me to feel an affinity for a girl like I feel for this one that left, and yet one can’t ignore the reality of the circumstances. And so what should I do? I loathe the idea of trying to suffocate my feelings as much as I do the idea of clinging to some hope that our paths will cross again for an extended period… I should date in SF, I know that, and I’m going to try and do it even though my heart isn’t totally in it. But what about her? Stay in touch and just see how life unfolds?

**TL;DR: Met a girl in a new city, dated her for a little while, and developed some real feelings for her. She returned to her home in Mexico a month ago, however, but we’ve kept in touch, and will see each other in March. Circumstances for the foreseeable future prohibit any real exploration of a relationship, though. How can I go about this in a way that respects the reality of the situation without forcing myself to ignore my feelings?**

Hi y'all. That's me up there.

I've been overweight my whole life. Luckily I've never been obese, but I came pretty close when I was about twelve. Then one day, I decided I wanted to be a certain part in a certain play, and I lost 30+ lbs in only a few months. I honestly don't remember how I did it, I barely changed the way I ate - just ran my ass off in the blistering sun for weeks on end. I started at 178, and came down to ~145-ish.

Got said part in said play at 14, and had maintained my weight pretty well. I was so happy, it was unbelievable. Then, we had the 50th anniversary gathering of the play. Everyone who had been in the production in all those years past were coming, and they'd see me be the lead! News stations/papers came and interviewed me and everything, it felt so cool.

The show went wonderfully, and as per tradition, the actors walked into the audience to mingle. And suddenly I was shaking the hand of a large, balding, loud-mouthed man who decided to inform me I was much too large for the role.

That, combined with my already low self-esteem from weird puberty stuff and such, really pushed me off the edge. Hello eating disorder!

So yeah, I still struggle with that and I'm trying really really hard t get over that. I never lost any weight, only gained, and gave myself some god awful acid reflux problems. Now I'm back up to 165-170 and struggling with insane amounts of depression. But good news! I was given another lead role in a different play, and I'm also applying for a summer internship. I'd like to be in shape not only just for these things, but for the rest of my life, as well. So far its been a week of clean eating, and today I finally got off my ass and exercised. Yay!

Anywho, I'm posting here and writing all this because I look up to you guys, and I know you'll have my back! I can't really tell anyone IRL, because you know the whole 'telling someone you will do something feels as good as actually doing it' thing. I'm just really excited. I'm gonna make fitness my bitch! :D

Bonus too-fat me in that one play. I think I looked pretty nice. Stupid man. http://imgur.com/05RLyNT"

I'm 23, currently in a paid internship, but will soon return to school for a graduate degree (within two years). I've read the relevant wiki info on this subreddit, as well as a bunch of articles on the Boglehead Wiki, so I'm looking for feedback on my plan before I rearrange my account.

Here's the current portfolio:

VMSXX Tax Exempt Money Market: $56k

VWNFX Windsor II: $23k

VTSAX Total Stock Market: $14k

~$35k in a couple of individual stocks (Google, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Microsoft)

I also recently set up a Roth IRA. It only has ~3k in it from a summer job (current job income is technically a grant, so I couldn't contribute this past year unfortunately).

I've decided to use the VTTSX Target Retirement 2060 fund, since it's a diversified four fund approach, and will do all the rebalancing automatically as I get older. I'm essentially planning on moving the entire ~$129k into the target date fund. I have a couple of questions:

1. Is it advisable to sell the individual stocks to minimize my risk? If so, how do I go about figuring out the capital gains taxes I will owe? Is there any reason to consider not selling them (especially the tech stocks)?

2. Since I'm young, I'm looking to maximize growth of my money, rather than avoid volatility. Is the 90% stock/10% bond split of the target date fund appropriate for this? Is there any reason to have an even lower % of bonds?

3. From what I've read on Bogleheads, it seems like it's best to hold the target date funds in a tax-advantage account like an IRA (I guess since the bond funds are tax-inefficient). Is it not a good idea then to put the ~$129k from the UTMA into the target date fund, since it's outside of my IRA? Should I look into assembling my own four fund portfolio, with the bond funds held in the IRA, so that I have more flexibility in terms of tax efficiency?

I definitely would appreciate any other feedback or suggestions you have!"

Now, since I have Canadian citizenship, it's easy for me to work for them and it's no hassle if I go to somewhere like UofT (Toronto) and work in Canada.

I was wondering if anyone knew people or a person that went to a UK school as an international and got a job (I believe it's in those programs that are called ""...with industry experience"") with a local company, like in London or Edinburgh. 

I know some of the bigger ones like Google sponsor you and it doesn't really matter where you come from, but I feel like it might be difficult if you're aiming for local companies (at least for the first one or two internships). 

Since you need a work visa I assume, since my regular student visa probably won't cover internships, would it be much harder for someone like me to find these jobs? "

I'm graduating with a GPA of 2.9 and an engineering GPA of about 3.0 from a fairly unknown college that has been accredited for about 2 years now. Going into this program I acknowledged that I wasn't the smartest person but decided to make up for it with effort, and I have, but it's starting to wane on me. I would like to move onto a master or PHD, I would like to do research on topics like machine learning or robotics, I would like to do a lot of things but I feel hindered by my lack of ability. I haven't gotten any internships even though I've applied every semester, and been turned down by every research opportunity that I've applied for, I've been looking for a job for a year and I have haven't been able to get any offers. 
    

Honestly, I feel like I'm not qualified to achieve any of the things I want to achieve and like I'm just not smart enough. I've barley been able to maintain a B in undergrad, how in the world would I be able to maintain a B in grad school if I can even get accepted into one? Basically, I'm mad at myself for not being smart enough to achieve the level of performance that I admire and want to achieve. My question is, at what point do I accept my abilities for what they are and settle with working any average engineering job that I can get? Should I strive to reach a fun high level technical research job in engineering or a job at a company like Lockheed Martin when, compared to me peers, I'm intellectually average? There is no need to sugar coat thing, I need real advice, not exhortation for the purpose of comforting me.

So I'm working on reviving a side-project ([link](https://github.com/axecheverria/youtube2mp3)) that transforms a YouTube music url into a downloadable mp3 file with its associated metadata (and album art!). 

The project currently is dead (the code is broken) (and not very well written (at all)).

As of right now, I'm trying to market myself as a front-end web developer.

I'm planning on introducing myself to AngularJS (have used it before in the past in an internship but I remember nothing of it) and maybe some other frameworks to manage the back end. 

Currently the project is not functioning and am planning on refactoring it in a way which demonstrates the skills I am going to acquire in the very near future. May I ask, in terms of coding challenges, what I can do to my current code to learn and implement things like:
  
. Dependency injection, controllers and services, filters, testability, and so on -- stuff I remember doing at my internship but remember little of now
  
. In essence, would you be so kind as to look at my code and say where such and such design patterns/AngularJS features/components could be applied?

  .  I'm planning on doing this anyway but it would be great if I could get feedback from others :)

I spent every waking hour of Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday studying for it (I only got the interview invite a week prior to the interview itself), and going through every problem in Cracking the Coding Interview. I even did some challenges on their own practice website, and some on Leet Code.

But I think I may have over-prepared. I was given the following question:

Write a traversal such that the following tree

                      A
                     / \
                    B    C
                   / \  / \
                  D  E  F  G

produces the output ` D B A E F C G`

And I tried to think (out loud) about the different traversals. Infix, Prefix, Postfix, BFS, DFS. I tried with infix first (and the interviewer kept going ""mhm mhm""), so I thought I was on the right track. Then I just kept going in circles because I knew I was trapped, and didn't want to ask for help (I heard it's not a good thing to do). When the interview told me the solution, it turns out you're supposed to assign two ""weights"" to each node. How far it is from the middle column with the root (so left nodes are -1, -2,... and right notes are 1, 2,...) and the depth of the node itself. And then sort it first by the horizontal weights, and then by the vertical weights.

Now my question is, in an interview environment, with only 20ish minutes for a question, how are you even supposed to come up with a solution to a problem like this? My interviewer also wanted actual C++/Java code, and did not want pseudo-code, so that made it even more challenging. I talked to friends who also had the same interviewer, and they got questions that I felt I could've at least had an approach to (e.g. Given a matrix of characters, find a specific word). Is it ever a bad thing to ask an interviewer for a different question? I feel like no matter how much I would've practiced, I simply wouldn't have been able to solve this specific problem in full C++/Java code in the limited time range, whereas with the question my friend received, I would've been able to have some kind of code on the whiteboard.

I have an interview with another ""Big 4"" coming soon, so I really want to know how to improve."

This placement is a Rehab center for the elderly. It has short term care, long term care, respite stays, a memory unit, hospice care, activity groups, etc.


What I love about this place is that it has so many different arenas I can dip my toes into. Which unit they would like to be my focus is up to the supervisor there if I am fortunate enough to get it.


I have clinical experience from this year (seeing clients one on one, doing assessments, treatment plans, mental status exams, running groups, etc). However, this is all with adolescents. Previous jobs (special ed counselor in a middle school, hippotherapy, and volunteer work) has all been with either kids or young adults. Once in high school a did a short bit of volunteer work but that was with a population whose oldest was maybe late 30's.


I know she will ask me if I've had experience with the elderly before. Obviously my answer is ""no, BUT I have such a strong passion and desire to work with this age group and I see the importance of this area because of the boomers aging and the lack of resources we might be facing as this age group grows etc""


Is there any tips you all might have of what I can say (and things to avoid saying) that will help sell myself as an intern despite my lack of experience?

450q3b,1,2016-02-09,Moving out of state after college,kscorps3,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/450q3b/moving_out_of_state_after_college/,"Hey all, I searched this sub a bit trying to see if I could answer this question by myself, but my situation seems to be pretty unique.

So I'm a sophomore in college, and I'm in a major (Information Technology) that should mean alright earning potential after graduation. I work about 10 hours a week in a paid internship where I make about $400-550 a month, and I'll be making something around $3500 during the summer. I have about $3700 in savings and I intend to get it above $5000 by the end of this year. I commute to class from my parents' house to save money, and I thankfully have minimal expenses. I don't have any student loans to deal with either, which puts me into a very fortunate position that I'm thankful for every day. I also own a reliable car that I intend on using until it becomes a liability, and (as far as I know) I take good care of it. 

My goal for as long as I could remember was to move out of state (most likely Seattle, though Denver is lightly on my list too). I'm from Dallas and I know that the cost of living is pretty low around here, but I'm willing to make sacrifices after graduation to make this happen. 

I'm in a pretty good spot, and lately I've been wanting to seriously plan my move. I'm planning on driving up to Seattle next winter break (so I can see the ""Seattle weather"" at its high point, and because I've been there during the summer before,) to help confirm my decision, but I reckon that I can do my financial planning separately and adapt it to another city if my plans change.

(These are all assuming that I get a job up there, which is another goal that I'm going to continuously work towards once I get a little closer to graduation)

Here are my main questions:

1. What's a good way to get a handle on apartment/rental prices? (I'm not too familiar with neighborhoods or suburbs, but I want to get a bit of a ballpark estimate so I can check specific areas out when I head up there at some point in the future.)

2. Are there any hidden financial pitfalls associated with moving right after college?

3. How much money should I aim to save up for this by the time I graduate?

4. Could I be investing my savings to help grow them over the next two years so I can be in a more comfortable place?

There's a lot of stuff out there about what to do right after college while working your first job, so I won't retread those here. Ideally I'd like to line up a job to move into as soon as I finish college, but I'm aware of the fact that reality doesn't work that way. I really just want a **concrete plan** for myself to give me a goal to keep in mind whenever I need to get motivated to work hard.

Thanks for your help, everyone. I apologize if this is asked a lot around here, but it seems like a lot of the moving out questions are centered around people staying in their own city, or moving out to live near college."

I have done my research on moving to Boston and have a few concerns. I am looking to find a 1 Br with a &gt;40 min commute to Kendall Square. My budget is $1500ish, the only unusual needs are a dishwasher, parking and being allowed a cat. My concerns are: 

* I have only ever lived in the US for 4 months for an internship, so I have no credit history. My compensation would easily cover rent, would a job letter be a reasonable replacement for a credit report? Should I bring a Canadian one?

* The plan is to fly to Boston at the end of Feb/ start of March, is that a good time to be looking for April?

* Is my budget reasonable? (I could pay extra for parking if that is an issue)

* Every source I have read has stated that you need to be ready to pay the instant you find an apartment you like, I don't have a checkbook for my US account, is there some other way to pay first+last month when the time comes?

All other advice is wholeheartedly welcome, the renting situation that I have experience with is worlds apart from what I've learned about Boston.

451a57,1,2016-02-10,"Miserable with career choice, not sure how to proceed",throwaway941523,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/451a57/miserable_with_career_choice_not_sure_how_to/,"I would really appreciate a chance to pick your minds on this.

Background: 
I am a 27 year old medical intern (year 1 out of 4-5 of post-graduate training) in the US, having graduated from medical school. I am in a fairly competitive field (Ophthalmology) that is relatively speaking better than other medical fields in some of the ways that make many doctors miserable. My internship is in another field (Internal Medicine), which I will finish in June.

Rant portion:
I am miserable. I've had doubts about medicine since my second year of school but kept telling myself I was in too far and that the cost of quitting was too high. I'm just not sure I can do that anymore. I'm able to meaningfully help people with about 20% of my time, while the other 80% is spent on various forms of busy work. I am a forward-looking person, familiar with technology my whole life, and this field drives me crazy. I feel like I'm living in 1980 while the world around me is stepping into the future. Faxes. Endless forms. Slow, awful software and computers. I don't get any intellectual gratification from my job. It's all memorization and algorithms. Critical thinking is helpful for a minority of cases...and you're usually too over-worked to have time to take those opportunities when they arise.

The grass is always greener:
I have several friends in comp sci -- people with similar personalities, backgrounds, interests. They are about as content with their jobs as anyone I've seen. I've dabbled with software -- AP comp sci in high school, Python and Java to help with research (bioinformatics) over the years. The problem solving and novel construction is really fun. I feel like I could be a much happier person, and more fulfilled doing something meaningful and interesting to me, switching fields.

My concerns:
I studied Biology. I haven't had any formal comp sci training since high school, just some self taught stuff that atrophies in between research projects. I have debt (&lt;100k) from medical school. Quitting medical residency is essentially permanent, you are 99% unlikely to ever be allowed to train again. I am miserable -- and cognizant that the grass is always greener, particularly when you feel like your lawn is on fire.

On the other hand, I feel like the writing is on the wall in so many ways. Aside from disliking my work, I simply don't see how medicine is a career that will have the longevity/stability that it historically has. While I am not in the camp believing AI like Watson will replace health care providers anytime soon, I think it's extremely likely that within 10-15 years, it will dramatically lower the human input required. Meaning, someone with far less training can do the same job for much cheaper (lacking the sunken years and school $$). I mean, in Ophthalmology, a laser system is already on the market that performs the bulk of cataract surgery (particularly the skill intensive portions) [this is the bread and butter surgery for most ophthalmologists] -- it's already happening!

Am I totally crazy for throwing everything away? (5 years medical training, 4 years college, 1 year research = 10 years) I'm so bearish on this career, both personally and analytically, but I've sunk a lot into it and I *could be wrong* -- maybe I'll enjoy life after residency, maybe regulatory or technological hurdles will slow the obsoletion of physicians... But whatever it may be, I need to either come to terms with my career or quit and pick a new one, because I wake up every day unhappy.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Where do I even begin? My idea thus far has been to continue residency (it pays for my roof) and utilize free resources for learning comp sci. What would be the most efficient avenue to do this? I have limited free time (work 70-80 hrs/ week) but am fine spending all of it studying.

MIT CS50 seems high yield
freecodecamp.com seems good?

Is there any particular course or language that would be a good, high yield place to start? How about field? Mobile vs web vs data vs ..?

Thank you so much for any help. Sorry this got long.

451bn4,12,2016-02-10,Is working in the game industry worth it as compared to a more stable employer?,csStudent2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/451bn4/is_working_in_the_game_industry_worth_it_as/,"I am currently a senior bound to graduate in a few months. I have a had a pretty successful CS college experience with a good GPA, many exciting side projects, and internships. I have a full time offer at a big four employer after graduation.

I imagine I am not alone when I say that videogames were a pretty large influence on deciding to choose CS as a major. Of course, making videogames for a living was an idealistic notion I had before I was more well versed on what computer science was really all about. I have learned that I like making all types of software, and I appreciate the intricacies of software development for what it is. Furthermore, the game industry is notoriously volatile (with frequent layoff cycles, lower-than-average pay, long hours, ect). 

I know I will be very happy working at the big-four employer, as it is literally a dream come true for me in terms of career goals (they also do really exciting stuff that I am excited about!). However, I can't help but think that in the back of my mind, there is a tinge of sadness that I won't be working at a company like Nintendo or Blizzard. I believe this stems from my desire to still make video games and to have them be played by audiences as large as these companies reach.

My gut is telling me to keep videogame development as a side hobby, as a few of my past side projects have involved making ""indie"" games which have been very satisfying and fun to make. I believe this is the route to go as my stable CS job will provide me the security and stability of a promising career doing something I enjoy while the side project games will allow me to have full creative control game ideas that I wish to develop.

As it stands now, I will most likely accept the big-four offer, and make side hobby games in the future. However, before I make the plunge, I would love to hear what input you all have on the matter. I want to eliminate any potential regret.

Thanks =D

**TLDR:** Stable job and making games as a side hobby vs. working at a videogame company?"
451dda,0,2016-02-10,It's all about exposure,pathtolife,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/451dda/its_all_about_exposure/,"I have read a lot of posts here about guys having trouble approaching girls and so I am making this post.

There is this girl I had a crush on when I was in freshman year of college, I hesitated and could never speak to her. When I came to the final year of college, I went for an internship and she was there (although I no longer had a crush on her), and we started hanging out together in a group.

1. In the first few days, I was crazy and felt lucky to be having lunch seated next to her
2. Over one month later, SHE had hesitations and anxiety speaking with ME
3. Later, I expressed my interest in some other girl and she felt jelous/insecure about her beauty
4. Last few days, I ask some of my friends seated around her for lunch but not her - just because I don't think of her as friend (in contrast to point 1) - she notices and complains about it to our mutual friends

It's all about exposure. It's all about how many girls/guys you have interacted with in the past. I hadn't interacted much with anyone in school/college and that changed during the internship. Just 5 months of interactions/exposure changed a lot in me.

Hope this helps someone. Bye."

While on a drug fueled escapade, one of my roommate was hinting at fooling around, but he is dating a good friend of mine. She has been through some hard shit and I couldn't dream of hurting her like this. I am all up for people experimenting with me and figuring shit out, but I have a conflict of interest as one might say.

I could just blame it on the drugs, but maybe if he does make advances, I don't know how I should react. I want to gently say no without damaging our friendship. I tell myself everyday that of all the times I've fucked up, I can't do this. Plus I have a slight attraction to my other mate anyway.

I just don't know if I can remain strong . My family issues, and possible career opportunities are already stressing me the hell out and sometimes I cry to sleep. I can't think clearly anymore. I stay up all night thinking about everything. I see that I have to be awake in a few hours so I just don't sleep that night. I drink most of my weekends away, just so I can have some time when my mind isn't going a mile a minute.

I feel myself falling apart, but I just don't know what to do. Any suggestions on how to deal with him would be great, I haven't been this unsure of myself before."

I do not hold a degree, but am currently lead developer on a major redesign/rewrite project for the company. I also handle normal and routine maintenance of legacy software and am helping design a larger scale rewrite of the entire framework.

2) If reclassification to non-exempt is the likely outcome, are there any minimum wage restrictions of non-exempt computer professionals?

3) I really enjoy the place I work, and do not want to rock the boat too much. Regardless on if these conditions apply to me, there certainly apply to many of my co-workers. How can I bring this up in a proper, professional manner?"
451xbx,3,2016-02-10,"Panel interview coming up, little interview experience, need advice, bombed last interview",mielita,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/451xbx/panel_interview_coming_up_little_interview/,"Not sure where to start so I'll just dive in, sorry for the wall of text and I'm on mobile so sorry for the grammer. Last month I applied through my city's HR website to CA's After School Education and Safety (ASES) Program, as a program leader, got an email for a panel interview set for this Thurs.

Interview experience: 

 * My last interview was in December as a temp at a craft store, totally bombed, wasn't really prepared and I was unable to bullshit answers, it was also finals time i was sleep deprived. 
* Before that i worked at a buffet, was able to bullshit through the interview and basically they needed people so my inexperience was overlooked. 
*A year prior i worked at an after school program (totally different city) that also had a summer program as a program leader, and because I was hires under a grant for bilingual staff I was also able to work in the schools summer school. The interview for that job was basically spur of the moment, my friend and i went to college fair type event organized by the after school program, i think we werw the only non staff there, the program's director asked us to come talk to her, she asked us if we ever played soccer, i said yes since I played a few years of city league soccer. She then proceeded to aske if we were interested in helping coach the program's soccer teams and helping out with the programs other activities, meant we were also program leaders, i said why not, had heard great things about the director, her program and their relationship to their community. Easy job interview. 
* A few months prior to that i was an intern at my college's multicultural center, where my friends were working and basically ran the program, no interview just announced i was their intern, they had me sign like two sheets to make it official. Easiesf job interview. 
* A couple of years prior I worked at my universities library as a student assistant, they werw hiring like 100 students for a summer job moving books from the old library to the new one and loading them into the new automated system. Interview was basically just making sure we were cool with physical labor and dust. That job led to me being hired beyond the move because of my work ethic, basically our supervisor picked two people to stay on, asked around the library for openings and recommended us. Which led to a short interview for the audio and media department's student assistant, the interview was just basically asking for availability and if I was okay with working Saturdays.

Basically not a lot of experience with interviews. So i need some help. I moved back home before I finished my Political Science degree, mainly because my mental health affected my schooling so bad my Financial Aid was put on hold i broight down mu unit deficiency by completing my incompletes. Thats when i took the after school program but the funding got pulled for the program not for it failing but mpre like a power grab, so during what was suppose to be their summer program i ended up working for the transitional program since i still had funding under the bilingual grant and thus my program director wanted me to get the full amount so she worked it out with the transitional program and summer school.

 I went back home a month after the summer and soon started taking CS classes while i figured out my next steps.


I Don't have a lot of experience working with kids besides that 5-6 mos stint working for the after school program/summer program/ summer school; organizing and pulling off a youth development conference; taking care of my various cousins, including a summer spent basically as a nanny for my cousins 4 boys varying in ages.  
But this is definately a job I really want because honestly if I'm gonna work right now I want to work in something having to do with education, youth, and community's development. 

So because my interview experience is lacking, especially in this realm, im not sure what to expect, what questions i should ask, who would be there since they had no description on the panel, what i should or shouldnt say, what to highlight and what to downlpay.

I guess I made the mistake of being overly ambitious by not dropping down to 165 fast enough, and underestimating the toll that the course would have on me.

Can anyone offer any advice on how to improve my grades and proof skills? I've read all the lectures, course documents and notes multiple times. Is it a matter of lack of practice? Should I try to find practice problems? Just, any and all advice would be so appreciated.

Also on the note of grades, has anyone who's taken CSC240 had their marks adjusted? Right now most assignments are averaging around 50% to 70% at most, and lower in some cases. Would that be grounds for a mark adjustment?

Thank you, and good luck on midterms."

They're both LG, but they're different models. (I don't know either specific model, and they're bolted to the wall.)

No one has any idea what could be causing this. I have a suspicion about the TV losing signal from the USB. If someone could point me towards what the problem might be, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you!"

I am wanting to develop task manager system. It is mainly to fulfill my needs, to put it honestly. I didn't know which way would be best/easiest. My ideas are: 

Develop a .JAR file that reads from a tab delimited file (.xls, stored in Dropbox) and just outputs the upcoming reading/assignment from the file. I already have the file and console printing. My main question is whether developing an Android app (with buttons saying ""Add Task"" and ""Show Readings"") would be too much, with a different GUI for the computer? 

Possibly develop a website I could access that would pull everything up from the file in Dropbox (or would it be more complicated than this?) Basically I just came up with this idea and didn't know if it would be easier to do than the original idea. 

Aside: Could I develop the app or anything with C#? I'm supposed to learn C# for my summer internship and need things to work on. "

453kih,7,2016-02-10,My [21M] long-distance boyfriend [25M] of 4 months is spiraling into depression.,depressedboyfriendca,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/453kih/my_21m_longdistance_boyfriend_25m_of_4_months_is/,"He and I have been in some kind of quasi relationship for a while. We met in November while he was here in NY and had a brief and intense love affair. He let me know he had already decided on moving back home to California before we met, and so he did in late December. We kept in touch, our ""brief fling"" turned into something substantial over skype and texts and I visited him for a week in January. 

Moving back to be with his family didn't work out. He left for NY two years ago to get his life together; he struggled with depression, he was an alcoholic, briefly addicted to opioids. His problems in California grew serious rifts between him and his four siblings. His mom is mentally ill and when she became obsessed with helping him and his issues, his siblings resented him for her condition deteriorating. He's staying with his dad temporarily, though his father keeps reminding him he has to move out soon. 

He came down with a serious case of pneumonia (unfortunately a day before I came to visit) and it's still affecting his ability to breathe. Pneumonia stunted his job search and his social life, and after a month of being stuck inside alone with no family or friends taking care of him he's breaking down. All his progress and work he's done for himself completely gone. 

He seemed kind of sad in text Sunday night, but he was alright. Then around 3 am (which is 12 for him) he called me and sobbed over the phone for about two hours. ""I have no home, my family is gone, I'm not who you think I am I've been putting up a stupid charming facade for years, I hate myself, You don't know me I'm a loser you don't love me, I'm not happy nothing lasts, Life is meaningless..."" and on. I stuck it out until 6:30 when eventually his mind went somewhere else, he went to sleep. 

Monday night we were just chatting casually. He joked about ""hey yeah define me, write a thoughtful detailed response about who I am."" I said sure why not. I write something, send it to him. Silence for thirty minutes until he calls me and is crying ""you really know who I am, you don't just see through me/my facade you see into me, you KNOW me"". I thought this was a good thing. I told him I loved him he told me he loved me, he said he felt loved and it was a wall broken down. He still showed signs that he's worried he will reveal he's a ""loser"" and I'll stop loving him. 

And then last night. I guess I was wrong to think things changed since Sunday? He had another breakdown. Casual fun talk about buffy the vampire slayer turned into ""I'm dead inside I'm garbage you don't know me you don't understand what I'm going through."" 

Mostly the same themes from Sunday night. He also suggested he'd been drinking these nights. I knew he had a few sips at a superbowl party but he seemed so self aware about his addiction, and controlled. He's been going through a very dark time in California, with his family and pneumonia (he's supposed to finish school too, but alongside work and apartment that too has been delayed). It makes sense he'd relapse. 

Anyway... I don't know what to do or how to help. He says he's made appointments with a psychiatrist, therapist, and an outpatient substance abuse program (without me prompting these topics). Can I believe him? 

Am I saying the right things? I try to just keep a consistent message, tell him I love him and I'm here for him. I try to avoid advice giving or moral platitudes, but then he pushes me away regardless. He goes from ""you don't know me to love me"" to ""you're too kind to me you do anything in a heartbeat, I can't reciprocate"". And then when he's feeling better, he tells me he loves me and how important our relationship is. 

It's still very jarring. I wish I could just physically be there for him, to hold him, hold his hand, but I feel if I came this weekend he'd just feel bad for ""inconveniencing"" me. It's hard to be there for someone who blames himself whenever you're there for them. 

I don't want to admit it but this is also bothering me too. I'm really busy with class, my internship, my job, and my family issues too and I can't stop thinking about him. I've barely slept these past few days, but I'm managing. I love him so so so so so much but I'm worried I need to love him ""smarter"" not ""harder"". My mom has bipolar disorder, and I've developed lots of coping skills, patience, care etc. for mental illness. But I'm worried I'm not doing or saying the right things. 

Tl;dr My boyfriend moved 2,500 miles away to a family and ""home"" that isn't there anymore. He's relapsing into alcoholism, depression, he's pushing me away and I don't know what to do."

Well, as fast as a girl can crawl with the ankles and wrists chained up. And of course, she hadn't heard the name 'Arianna' in some time now. She tended to go by Hucow 0021 for the most part.  
  
""Of course, Hucow 0021 was a rather special for us to acquire here,"" Olivia informed Emily, the new intern. ""She was handpicked up our CEO, Scarlett Williams as a personal Hucow. She worked unknowingly with us under the guise of a Secretary whilst we secretly fed her a concoction of lactation-inducing foods. One day, she complained of milk dampening her blouse, we hooked her up to the milkers, assuring her that the procedure would not take long. And that is when we chained her gagged her, and well; you can see the rest"" Olivia beamed as Emily kneeled down to stroke the blushing Arianna / Hucow 0021. Arianna of course remembered the day vividly, however many months ago it was. She would have uttered a complaint, if she were not ballgagged.  
  
The days since working in The Facility blurred into one, however. ""She is usually strapped to the metal apparatus we found her in. A tube in her mouth to feed, a tube at her nipples to milk, and a tube up her bottom to... Urm... Cleanse, enemas, that part isn't quite my speciality."" Olivia trailed off as Emily nodded.  
  
Arianna's blush deepened in shade. The enemas were the worst part of the day, of course.  
  
""And because this little Hucow is just so beautiful, some of the girls come in to her own room during their breaks to play with her; plait her hair, give her a spank, train her how to moo, whatever they see fit! Oh, as long as Mistress Williams approves. Arianna... I mean, Hucow 0021 is her personal cow, after all.""  
  
""So what about the other hucows? Were they all tricked here?"" Emily asked inquisitively.  
  
""Of course they were, silly!"" Olivia admonished back. ""Why do you think we keep them gagged? We offer ripe girls jobs as secretaries, administration, whatever anonymous jobs. After some weeks of controlled feeding, we deem them necessary to Hucowify... And yes; that is a verb."" Emily laughed in response.  
  
""And if they misbehave?""  
  
""Oh, you needn't worry. There is not period they are not tightly bound. But there are some punishments; caning, electrocuting, public humiliation, whatever incentivises them to keep producing. We keep our girls healthy for longevity, so you will notice their breasts do not grow beyond a D-cup at the absolute limit.""  
  
Emily scribbled note in her handbook.  
  
""But what about the boys you capture?"" Emily asked as they approached a double doorway at the end of the corridor. The hair's on Arianna's body stood up as she trailed behind on her leash and collar.  
  
""Watch and learn"" Olivia grinned as she opened the doors to reveal a warehouse with 50 men, all bound to chairs, with identical tubes running through their gags, and into their bottoms for waste. ""We can be a little rough, farming semen,"" Olivia explained. ""Mistress Maisenbacher, our German farm expert specialises on discipline on both Boys and Hucows, but she finds a natural concoction of vitamins appropriate for Cows, and viagra and no visual-stimulus for boys a necessary procedure"".  
  
Upon closer inspection, Emily gasped as she noticed the intense expression of anguish on the Men's faces as they were milked, tubes stimulating and sucking the semen straight from their raging cocks. It was collected through transparent pipework to a tank in the ceiling.  
   
""Marvellous, isn't it?"" Olivia smiled to herself. ""So, where do you fit into all this, Emily?""

From /r/AskLegal

According to the document [here](http://media.mofo.com/docs/pdf/ELC0507.pdf),  [Cal. Labor Code
§ 515.5](https://www.dir.ca.gov/oprl/ComputerSoftware.pdf),[ 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(17)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title29/pdf/USCODE-2011-title29-chap8-sec213.pdf), and [29 C.F.R. §§ 541.400-401](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title29-vol3/pdf/CFR-2010-title29-vol3-sec541-400.pdf), the minimum wages for an exempt computer professional shall be no less than $49.77/hr or $87,185.14/yr as of January 1st, 2016.

I am a junior developer currently classified as an exempt employee making ~$50k/year. From how I am reading these laws, I should be either making the minimum salary, or reclassified as non-exempt.

My questions are:

1) Does this apply to me? I was an intern for a few months and then promoted to .net software engineer (there is only one title). I do not hold a degree, but am currently lead developer on a major redesign/rewrite project for the company. I also handle normal and routine maintenance of legacy software and am helping design a larger scale rewrite of the entire framework.

2) If reclassification to non-exempt is the likely outcome, are there any minimum wage restrictions of non-exempt computer professionals?

3) I really enjoy the place I work, and do not want to rock the boat too much. Regardless on if these conditions apply to me, there certainly apply to many of my co-workers. How can I bring this up in a proper, professional manner?[Quote]"

Would internships while I'm still in school be helpful even though there will be several years between completing the internship and applying anywhere?

4549y6,5,2016-02-10,Arguments against hamster in a high school classroom,EIEIOOOO,animalwelfare,https://www.reddit.com/r/animalwelfare/comments/4549y6/arguments_against_hamster_in_a_high_school/,"My son bought a hamster about a year ago as a gift for his classmates in his high school. He goes to an alternative school, so there are only about 175 kids spread across all four grades. The hamster lives in a cage in the science room. I am completely against animals in the classroom but he's 18 and the school is OK with it. They take relatively good care of her (her cage is always clean, she always has food and water). 

So what's my issue? 

-Firstly, we live in the midwest and it gets cold at night. They were leaving her from 3pm Friday afternoon until 8am Monday morning, every weekend, alone. With the heat in the building at the minimum to keep the water pipes from bursting. Cold. So this poor little thing is left alone for all that time. No one is there to check her food, to make sure the water dispenser didn't leak all the water out, she's not injured, too cold, etc. 

-The next is that she's a hamster. She wants to sleep in the day and play at night. Of course, these kids are handling her every time the class changes. Waking her up, trying to get her to play, etc. Then they leave, she wakes up and is alone in a little cage. 

-The only time she's allowed to run outside of her cage is in a hamster ball. Which is better than nothing, but not the same as how it is when she's home. 

So he brought her home for Christmas break and I've been taking care of her.  and I don't want her to go back. Due to an internship, he's only there 2 hours a week. At home she's warm, cozy in a nice habitat that I keep very clean. She gets fresh food (veggies, cheese, cooked meats, etc) weekly, she can sleep during the day and then when she wakes up at 8-9, she has us to play with her. I've ""hamster proofed"" a room where she gets to run, climb, tunnel, explore (with my constant supervision) for almost an hour a day. Her coat is shiny and full again, she's not lethargic, she's happy. 

My son is getting pressure from the kids to bring her back, they text him and bug him about it everytime he goes in for those two hours. He and I are now in a big disagreement and he's determined to take her back. Partly because he doesn't want the kids to keep on him about it and partly, I think, to assert his independence that she's HIS hamster (though I do 100% of the care and financial support). I think if he had some intelligent, well-reasoned answers why it's better for this hamster (and all living creatures like this) to live at home, rather than a classroom (for all of reasons listed above) we could sort this out. My main concern is the hamsters well being. Yes. I am attached to her, but I would honestly be able to get past that if it was best for her. 

I know there are people who will think this is ridiculous, and that's fine, you can have whatever opinion that you like. But I'm of the belief that this is an innocent, living creature who deserves the best we can offer her. The solution might be suggested to just buy another hamster, and that's their decision if they make it. But I'm trying to teach them why having a hamster (or Guinea pig, rabbit, hedgehog, gerbil, etc) is not suited for life in a school classroom on a long term basis. 

Any thoughts? "
454bzp,3,2016-02-10,"Me [22 F] with my best friend [22F], have been discussing moving into an apartment together but I am suddenly having doubts",adult_angst,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/454bzp/me_22_f_with_my_best_friend_22f_have_been/,"So my best friend and I have been discussing moving out of our respective parent's places for about a year now and into an apartment. My friend (Annie) lives about 8 hours away and plans on moving to me where I attend school/work full time. 

Generally, I can afford to do this and I wouldn't have to commute to school and work anymore. On that level, it makes sense. And of course I want to be close to Annie and our other best friend who would live near us as well. It seems almost perfect. 

But I am mainly having personal financial concerns - which was never an issue of mine because I was the one salaried and could afford a better place. Yet I just recently cut back my work hours because of starting grad school and now make $400 less/month. 

This means that I will probably only be able to save about $300/month when I move - and that's if I'm totally strict on money. Also, I am in a decent amount of debt from my undergrad and just received loans for my grad. So, realistically, when I move, paying them off - even a little - will probably not happen. And I could come out of school owing around $60k. Which is the last thing I want to happen.

My program also requires me to do internships that I will have to quit my job for in about a year. I could make a little money but it looks like most of that will go to rent. Which, again, is not me saving or paying off loans. 

I want to move out so badly but saving is a priority of mine because I've decided I want to be able to have a down payment saved for a house by the time I graduate. And paying off loans for obvious reasons. 

There are also some other concerns I have (one being that we are only able to afford living in an area that is very close to a very unsafe area) but I won't get too into those. These financial issues are my biggest burden right now.

Now it kind of seems obvious that I shouldn't move. But my friend has committed to this idea, and a lot of the reason she has committed is because of me encouraging her that we can do it. I feel as if I've just suddenly lost my confidence and she will definitely be blindsided. Especially since she is actually off worse than me financially so she may not even understand my concerns. 

How can I talk about this with her? (and remember we live 8 hours away). And is there any possible way I can still move out? I genuinely do not want to just leave her hanging (note: she has not made *absolute* plans to move down here like airplane tickets or anything. But she plans to by May).

A friend told me being only 22 is the time to make financial mistakes and you don't have to worry about saving as much. Which I do agree with but it's just that I *want* to save. I want to have my shit together by like 25. Is that naive? Can I really plan that? 

I don't know, reddit. Please help.


**tl;dr**: Best friend and I have committed to moving in together and have been seriously looking for an apartment. I suddenly have financial concerns because my situation has changed a bit. What do I do?"

So like many people, a couple days ago I started applying to multiple companies to try to get internships. Now I just got my first e-mail saying the person is reviewing my application and I will hear within the next two weeks. Now all of these applications didn't say anything about salaries but when I asked this question before on reddit, people said most of the comp sci internships are paid these days and you really should just do a paid one.

Now the thing is, how can I know if it's paid or not? In all of these job postings the salary is not there, the person emailed me and asked if I have any questions as well. Should I ask if it's a paid or no paid internship or would that be coming off too strong too soon?

Also, in some of these postings, it generally asks for things like ""General knowledge in one OOP"" ""Ability and the need to learn"" and stuff like that, but in some, for example this company it says stuff like


-Interest in software development experience building highly-reliable, mission-critical software

-Ability to program in at least one OO programming language (e.g. Java, C#, C++)

-Knowledge of web application frameworks, RDBMs’ &amp; Application Servers (experience in one or more preferred)

-Reasonable understanding of network security, encryption, authentication and authorization

-Experience with Selenium, JQuery, .Net, Windows development and Javascript a plus

Like I know Java and C++, but network security, encryption, Selenium, I have no idea about. Should I even bother applying for those companies that ask for this or just let it go?

In other case I also applied for remote internship in some startup companies. I had some online interviews and with one company we almost met with circumstances that I will do internship. But now I am a bit afraid because it is unpaid internship and maybe they will use of me (I mean, i will do some job for them for free) and they do not select me as a regular employee. 

What would you suggest to me? Continue for applying with IBM or start work with startup company. 

Btw, there are some risk with IBM , because there are no guarantee that they will select me.

Thank you for answers and advice.  "

    I've only been working as a java developer for a year... and I'm definitely not the best programmer out there. I'd say I'm average and not entirely passionate/crazy about work. I really value my time off and don't care enough to delve deep into my tasks.

 Last summer we had an intern who came to us from a top CS school, who is extremely smart (near 4.0) and picked things up quickly and asked a lot of questions and constantly asked for more work. My teammates were very impressed by him. 

He may be coming back to work with us full time. 
I'm concerned this will bring to light how not-so-amazing I am. Im feeling insecure about my position and about the new guy being much more capable than me (which I know he is...). Anyone gone through anything similar? Is it going to be so bad that I'm not that smart? 

I just feel embarassed about not knowing as much and bring a slower learner. I get along really well with my team and my boss. I get my work done and I try to do it well but I'm not an overachiever. I was an average student in school. I'm still new to my job and still learning a lot, but if there's downtime I don't try to find more work to do, etc. 

So yeah... I'd appreciate any stories or advice here. 
I'm afraid my progress is going to be compared to his and will lead me to being treated differently. 

Thanks. "

‘Yeah, I can’t ignore him anymore, I’m afraid I’ll do what he tell me to do.’ I said still looking at my hands, trying my best not to cry. 

‘Well, you know the drill, take your shirt off’.

I took my shirt off, which meant I had to show my arms. It is so shameful for me to show my arms, because they are filled with scars, from before I knew what was wrong with me. The worst part was that I had carved in words, words he told me. The anxiety was on full blast, when he took my arm soft and carefully and checked for new wounds. His hands were warm and it felt nice another human touching me but at the same time it felt uncomfortable. 

When I got out of Dr. Jensen’s office, a nurse was ready to walk me to my room. I have not met this nurse before. She was probably an intern. When we arrived to unit 350, I got a small glimpse of the other patients in the tv room. People were quiet except one who was busy telling loudly one of the nurses he had ants living in his teeth, and he demanded to see a doctor. ‘I can’t believe I’m one these crazy people’ I thought to myself, but apparently I’m one of them.  

We came into my room, where I would be living on indefinite time. There was a hospital bed, a desk and two complimentary chairs from the seventies. Everything looked like it was from the seventies in orange and brown colors, except the modern hospital bed. We sat down in the chairs and she took a deep breath while she stared deep into my eyes, like she was trying to figure me out. I had a hard time looking into her eyes, they looked so perfect and I knew mine was so filled with sorrow.

‘Lisa, we are going to take you off the pills you’re on now, because they are not working anyways’.

‘But then he is going to be so much stronger, the last time it almost went terrible bad’.

‘Lisa you must understand he is not real. Remember this is an illness and he is not real’ she said in a firm voice.
 I wanted to believe her but I couldn’t, God I wanted so bad to believe her. I had to look down at my hands again, while I was trying not show my despair.

‘So… I’m gonna go now, see if you can get a little sleep tonight. As you now there is breakfast at 8, and morning meeting is at 9.30, but it’s okay if you don’t want to join in tomorrow’. 

She left the room, and I got up and sat on the bed. I drew the curtains because I didn’t liked to look out in darkness and sat down again.
 I sat and thought to myself while starring into the yellow wall ‘Again, really again. You are such a loser. Now you going to take this semester over again. But I’m going to survive this, he cannot take control. He is not real. He is not real!!’ 
I knew I was lying to myself, but that was my only hope. I went to bed and fell fast asleep, because I knew it only took pulling a red string away to alarm the nurses, if he was going to disturb me. For the first time in a couple of weeks, I felt somewhat safe.

I woke up calm in the morning and I could see the sun shining outside even birds were singing. But then… 

‘So you are here again? Ha! And they are going to take the meds away? I’m gonna get you this time one way or another’ he said laughing almost sounding like he was growling at the same time. 

‘Go away! You are not real! you can’t touch me. You’re only in my head’. Tears was falling down my face and my stomach twisted in fear.

 ‘I cannot touch you? We’ll see about that, I am more real than you ever know’ as he said that, I saw him. Or a part of him. A black stick thin hand with long fingers appeared from under the bed with long black nails. His hand made it’s way under my blanket, and I pulled the red string as fast as I could and I heard the alarm go off. As the alarm went off, I felt an incredible pain as I was cut at my ankle and I saw the hand go back under the bed.
The door blast open and two butch male nurses came in.

‘He was here! I saw him this time! He scratched my ankle. Look under the bed, he is there!’ I said, tearing up to the nurses. The nurses looked frustrated at each other. Then they saw the blood dripping from the bed to the floor. They lifted the blanket, and then we all gazed down at these four big cuts into my leg. 

‘This is going to need stiches. Lisa what did you cut yourself with?’ The nurse looked blaming into my eyes while the other took a towel to put pressure on the wound.

‘I swear to God, it was him! I have just woken up. Please help me!’ 

’Lisa we have to know if you have any weapons on you, we have to know if you’re any danger to us’.

‘I have nothing, you have to believe me.’ I cried while I tried to figure out if I was dreaming.

‘Get her to the emergency room maybe the doctors can tell what had cut her, I’m gonna stay here and speak with Dr. Jensen’ 

The nurse began to roll my bed out of the room and as we was going to out the door, the commanding nurse said: ‘Lisa, this is going to have consequences’.

I have an interview in two weeks for an internship with a major company in the South Jersey area. The role was advertised as IT but during the 1st round interviews I was told that I will be writing code/developing things and that it's not troubleshooting. 

This will be my first technical interview and I am quite nervous. I wasn't able to find any intern interview questions on Glassdoor (besides behavioral) so I'll leave the questions I have here:

* should I expect IT technical questions or should I prepare for coding problems?

* When and if I have to write code, can I use any language?

* What data structures and algorithms should I better familiarize myself with?

* What other resources (besides Glassdoor) can I use to practice interview questions? Both coding and IT if it applies.

* Should I expect any more behavioral questions?

* Can I ask HR/recruiters for more info?

Sorry it was a ton of questions and I thank you all in advance for answers.

Is that all I say if there is an exit interview? Do I say anything about her on the way out if the CFO or someone wants to talk to me? If I happen to be here during the anonymous survey, how do you express these sentiments when there are only 4 IT staff in a way that someone may notice and may do something without just entirely trashing this person?

This is all federal debt, mostly unsubsidized student loans, some back taxes on grant money. 

Our combined take-home pay will probably be about 24k (36k gross) for the first year out of college while he completes a full time internship, and then he will either start work at ~$15/hr or go to graduate school (more debt). 
I know this is a manageable amount of debt, especially once we are dual income, but I'm struggling to justify or enjoy the very few purchases I make that are unnecessary.

My SO and I are long distance, and I will be flying out of state this weekend to visit him. I made a $130 reservation at a hotel near the airport so we won't have to drive for three hours overnight to get back to his apartment, but it's stressful spending money on something we could go without even when I have the liquid funds and the purchase seems reasonable.

I carefully budget everything and know how these unnecessary purchases will fit into our repayment schedule, but I still feel guilty knowing that we could be debt-free sooner if we were strict with these purchases.

I'm worried that this will be an issue in the longer term, as we pay off this debt and save for retirement, and eventually are saving for a down payment. I would really appreciate any suggestions about good ""rules""  for nonessential purchases, so we can strike a balance between paying this debt down and enjoying ourselves as much as possible in the meantime.

Thank you!

456aad,6,2016-02-10,Vanguard UTMA: Looking to Diversify,simsmac0o,Bogleheads,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/456aad/vanguard_utma_looking_to_diversify/,"I recently received access to a Vanguard UTMA account with ~$129k that was set up by my grandparents, and I'm looking for advice on how to diversify and ensure that I use it effectively as a jump start for retirement. I'm 23, currently in a paid internship, but will soon return to school for a graduate degree (within two years). I've read a bunch of the articles on the Boglehead Wiki, so I'm looking for feedback on my plan before I rearrange my account.


Here's the current portfolio:
VMSXX Tax Exempt Money Market: $56k
VWNFX Windsor II: $23k
VTSAX Total Stock Market: $14k
~$35k in a couple of individual stocks (Google, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Microsoft)


I also recently set up a Roth IRA. It only has ~3k in it from a summer job (current job income is technically a grant, so I couldn't contribute this past year unfortunately).
I've decided to use the VTTSX Target Retirement 2060 fund, since it's a diversified four fund approach, and will do all the rebalancing automatically as I get older. I'm essentially planning on moving the entire ~$129k into the target date fund. 

I have a couple of questions:

1. Is it advisable to sell the individual stocks to minimize my risk? If so, how do I go about figuring out the capital gains taxes I will owe? Is there any reason to consider not selling them (especially the tech stocks)?

2. Since I'm young, I'm looking to maximize growth of my money, rather than avoid volatility. Is the 90% stock/10% bond split of the target date fund appropriate for this? Is there any reason to have an even lower % of bonds?

3. From what I've read on Bogleheads, it seems like it's best to hold the target date funds in a tax-advantage account like an IRA (I guess since the bond funds are tax-inefficient). Is it not a good idea then to put the ~$129k from the UTMA into the target date fund, since it's outside of my IRA? Should I look into assembling my own four fund portfolio, with the bond funds held in the IRA, so that I have more flexibility in terms of tax efficiency?


Sorry this is kind of long. I definitely would appreciate any other feedback or suggestions you have!"

I'm running into an issue and I'm hoping for some insight from this community.  Last year I headed a project that was meant to collect ground truth for an airborne laser survey in a forested environment.  My plan was to run RTK Trimble R10's and capture tree trunk points by offsetting from a start point with a Trupulse laser rangefinder.  After a whole summer with 4 interns helping, our gps data doesn't quite line up with our LiDAR software derived tree locations.  I'm trying to figure out what the major source of error was in our method.

Knowing tree canopy poses problems with reliable GPS signal, my plan was to collect a start point in an open area and then offset using the rangefinder.  To try and mitigate the error in azimuth with the rangefinder, we kept all offsets under 50 meters.  The resulting survey points are rather ambiguous since the forest is quite dense.   

Anyone have experience with conducting a proper forest survey?  Using a total station has been suggested by some colleagues as well as multiple point triangulation.  I have another similar project this summer involving urban forestry.  Wondering if I should just stick to what I'm used to and collect a ton of terrestrial LiDAR.  Thanks everyone!"

I recently got an internship at a pretty decent engineering company. I'm going to school for electrical engineering (i just finished my junior year).
I have also been teaching myself on the side. I've taken Coursera courses in python, c++, html and css. I've taken school courses in java and c++. 

One of my grandpa's old students works at this company and I emailed him for advice on applying and I think he basically became an advocate for me at this company (even though I don't really know him) 
I had a phone interview with three computer and electrical engineers at this company. They asked me 5 technical questions and I answered 4 correct. They asked me if I felt confident working on ""insert random programming project here"" and I said yes even though I wasn't 100% sure I could do it. 
I was EXTREMELY nervous and thought I did terrible. 
A week later I got a call and apparently I got the summer internship but I KNOW that I only got it because of the connection I have. 

Do you guys have any advice for what I can do to better prepare. I know that interns aren't expected to know that much but I know I will be surrounded by more qualified interns and I don't want to be a burden. 

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated.

While this is a throwaway, I do not post on Reddit often. I am just going to throw all of my thoughts and background story all at once, so it may be not well organized. This may be too long, and I may edit it to be shorter after posting.



Short background: My girlfriend, I will call her Alana here, and I are trying to prepare for a long-distance relationship in the near future. After graduating this coming May, I will be moving to Minnesota for the career opportunity of a lifetime. She will further her education at grad school (likely a 2 year program) in the same area we currently are, New England.

For the entirety of our relationship, and years previous, we have always been together, physically. We are from the same hometown, and began dating when she transferred to the same college as me. We are together all the time, at school, and at home on breaks. We've been fortunate enough to never have to go a week without seeing one another. Our relationship was absolutely perfect. I mean it was perfect. We were best friends prior to dating, and once we finally got together, it proved to be even better than either of us imagined. We just worked, perfectly. 

This past summer, I did an internship at a large company close to our hometown. I liked it enough to accept the job offer they extended at the end of the summer. It meant I would continue to live at home, which wasn't necessarily a great or bad thing, for at least the next year. 

Fast forward to this Fall. After talking about it, my girlfriend decides that she would like to go to grad school nearby. She has the grades to go nearly anywhere she would like, but the opportunities here were just as good as anywhere else. Though there were thoughts of applying to go to some schools on the west coast, she decided she would like to stay home, near her family and near me.

Around this same time, I decided to apply for a job at my dream company. The actual company doesn't matter too much, but it is considered in the top 5 places to work in the world on every list I look at, and a leader in my industry. This job was not something that I discussed with Alana, as I have applied for a position here for each of the past 4 years, and did not expect anything to come of it. The position was not offered anywhere near New England, but like I said, I did not expect anything to come of it. 

I get around to telling Alana that I applied there, and she was rightfully upset with me that I had not discussed it with her, as we specifically talked about her future plans. I did not think too much of this, as I did not think anything would come of me applying. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I get a call for an interview. While Alana says she is happy for me getting an interview with my dream company, she is noticeably upset whenever I bring it up.

Well, 5 interviews later, I get a job offer for the position. Right away, Alana is happy for me. She knows how much this means to me. It is a company that I have said is my dream place to work for years, and never thought it would be a possibility this early in my career. But I know in the back of her mind that she is still upset at the possibility of me leaving, while we specifically talked about what and where her future would hold. 

I am not the best at communicating. I have never been good with discussing my feelings or thoughts. I could come up with excuses, but it is just how I was raised and how I've lived my whole life. 

This is important because between the offer and the deadline, I barely talked about it with Alana. Every time she would try to bring it up, I would get uncomfortable at the possibility of making her more upset, and ultimately be very short about it. There were a few times when I would talk about the pros/cons of each job, but never really lead on to what I was leaning towards; partly because I wasn't sure, and partly because I didn't want to make her upset.

Well it got to be the night before my decision, (Early-January) and I finally told her that I was leaning toward accepting the position out in Minnesota. She was happy for me, and terribly sad for us at the same time. This would undoubtedly make things difficult beyond imagine for us, but we were both willing to try.

The past month, nothing has been like it was for us. Every other night is spent calming her down, or having a serious conversation about how this will work. While I am extremely confident that we'd be able to make this work, she is not so sure. Ever since the decision, she has been miserable, and it's my fault. It is so hard seeing the person you love, miserable, because of actions and decisions that you made.

My terrible communication previously has only made this worse, as it feels that I have made this major life decision without her, while Alana made sure to include me in deciding a grad school. I have been better at communicating since then, but that doesn't change what I've done previously. 

It's terrible. We were perfect, and now I spend nearly all of our time together trying to convince her we will make this work. She tells me 'she can't do this', 'she can't be apart from me', 'I keep wishing this is just a nightmare', 'I need stability'

I know she genuinely is proud of me, and is happy for me, that I get to work for my dream company. But now this all feels wrong. She is my best friend in the entire world, and I have caused her to spend every day of her life in misery. 

Yes, I know we are young, but I have always fully envisioned spending the rest of my life with Alana. We have been best friends for the past 6 years, and the time we've spent together has felt like a dream come true, every single day.

We'd have to spend the next two years apart, only seeing each other during occasional visits with months in between.

I don't know what to do to make this right, or to make this work. Please help us.


   
**tl;dr**: Please help my girlfriend and I make it through 2 years of me living halfway across the country for my dream job."

However, for some reason, I find women who smoke unbelievably sexy. If they do it seductively and back it up with a dirty-talking mouth, then I'm INSTANTLY horny.

I'd love to play out something involving my smoking fetish tonight. One note: While I'm into the smoking fetish, I'm not so much a fan of the dom/sub dynamic, so no BDSM, torture, noncon, etc.

I've got a few RP prompts below that this can be worked into somehow, and I'm also open to any ideas you might have (if there's an RP you've always wanted to do that my smoking fetish fits into, I'm all ears!).

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks other than smoking: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking (open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, big breasts/titfucking, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you tonight!"
456wjj,2,2016-02-10,I ruined my life,redarrow86,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/456wjj/i_ruined_my_life/,"Hi, I'm a 20 year old girl and I just joined reddit because I seriously don't know where else to go. I've been struggling with depression for about 7 months now and anxiety for god knows how long. The problem is, I waited way too long to get help. I only told my parents 4 weeks ago that I was feeling depressed and went into counseling, and the only thing that pushed me to do that was I was starting to have thoughts of suicide. I don't know what caused my depression, I've never experienced any kind of trauma, didn't lose a friend or family member, I just kind of started going into a slump over time and I didn't even notice at first. I can't even point to where it started but I do know when and how it got worse. I've lost everything over these past several months. I'm in college and I spend literally every day alone. I think I've spoken a total of 25 or 30 words this entire week so far. I have a roommate in my apartment but our schedules are really different so I only really see her for an hour or so at night before I go to bed. That hour is my only human contact in an entire day. I went out of state for school while all my friends went to my hometown's university, so they are really far away from me, as is my family. I made friends my freshman year, but over time, and because I'm a terrible friend who can't keep contact with anyone, they all faded away. I never do anything on the weekends except lie in bed, and it kills me because I used to be out with friends all the time and I had such a great social life. They all still hang out with each other too, they just don't invite me and frankly I don't blame them. So tl;dr I'm completely socially isolated and I spend every day alone.
I also lost my boyfriend of 1 year in September. I made a stupid rash decision on a mentally bad day to break up with him. He was my best friend and I loved him more than anyone. I had months to try and reconcile and I was too stupid and afraid to try. Now he has a new girlfriend who is better than me in every way; they've only been dating 2 weeks and he is already more crazy about her than he was about me. Every time I think about them I have panic attacks and start shaking. I feel like I lost the best person I will ever get and now I'll never get him back. Even if he broke up with her someday, he'll never come back to me because I'm ugly and crazy and annoying. I am heartbroken and terrified that I will never be loved again.
I'm also failing at school. My grades have always been high but I have no motivation to work anymore and they are slipping. Since I was always a good student, I feel like grades are all I am good for and now I'm losing that too. Plus, I'm a junior and I know it's time to think seriously about my future, but I have no work experience related to my major and I'm not even sure what I want to do anymore. I used to have a dream to be a journalist in New York, and that dream got me through my darkest times in high school and early college. But every internship I've applied to, I've been turned away in favor of people who are smarter and more accomplished, and I realize now that I don't have enough work experience to take me to the city. I waited too long to try to get experience and didn't take on enough leadership to be considered for a good job in the city. I am completely crushed and I have no motivation to graduate or keep going.
I panic every day about all the relationships I've lost. I have no friends anymore, I lost the person I love due to an idiot mistake. I love my family very much (they're the only reason I'm still here), but I know I don't have much time left to live with them before I have to move out and only see them a few times a year. My grandmother died in December and I was so overcome with depression by that point I wasn't even able to grieve or get closure from her funeral. I don't have any hobbies anymore. I used to love to swim but I have no energy to go to the gym and use the pool. Music was once my greatest love but now it just sounds like noise, and half the songs I like remind me of my ex, which is too painful to deal with. I don't like to write anymore because my brain just feels like it's stuck in mud. I barely eat anymore and when I do it's just junk. I gain and lose weight sporadically and I have terrible acne so I just feel so hideous I can't even look at myself in the mirror. I just feel so stupid, ugly and completely alone.
I went to my school's counseling center but I've been on the waitlist for a therapist for weeks now, and I only get 6 sessions before I have to find another therapist and get on another waitlist outside the university. I don't know if I can make it that long. I think about killing myself every day, I've even told a few people and they aren't taking it seriously/don't care enough to try to help. Everyone tells me it gets better but I've fucked up in so many ways I don't know if it will. If I ever shake my depression, I'll just be left with a bunch of broken pieces of a life and I won't even be allowed to be upset about it anymore because I won't be allowed to say I'm depressed.
If you read any of this at all, thank you. I don't really know what I'm looking for by making this post, except maybe some kind of reassurance that I shouldn't give up. I'm really close to ending my life and I have no one to talk to about it, so I just needed to get this out somewhere."

I need suggestions,neverspagett,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/456wyp/have_i_dug_myself_into_a_hole_i_need_suggestions/,"I've posted before on a couple other subreddits a couple months ago about this but figured my follow up questions I have now are most relevant for this one with more recent developments with my job search.

31 years old, finished an MBA in December. Background is in management and data analysis. Did a summer internship at a national consulting firm last year. Going for PMP designation this year. I have $27k student line of credit debt (growing about $1k per month with living expenses at the moment) and $60K in mutual funds.

Last full time, permanent job I did was in 2013 where I managed to see my salary rise to about $51k (the most I've made). I went abroad for a year after to learn a second language and to clear my mind after significant family crises that ran a course of 3-4 years before the MBA so I spent my immediate savings of $20k there. Well worth it and much needed at the time.

I have been networking and applying for work but nothing yet. Salaries I have been quoted seem pretty low ($55k-$60k max range for positions) for my experience and education. Only one interview so far and it's a role with a lot of admin work albeit with an amazing firm, not sure salary yet as no offer yet.

With the salary quotes I have been given (and with no offer yet) and the debt I took on for more education, it feels like I may have made a bad move. I hear about people on this subreddit in their 20s absolutely killing it financially and I definitely feel left behind a bit.

My questions are very straightforward:

1. How can I maximize my salary in this economy with my experience?
2. What would you do in my shoes? 
3. What sort of realistic financial expectations should I have for myself to guide me so I don't get depressed about where I'm at? The Comparison Game is a tough one!
4. Should I be worried?

A little extra info: I would be willing to move to any part of the country. No dependents or other financial obligations. I also have a UK passport but would need to take a flight there to network to find a job but that's sort of an emergency backup plan.

Appreciate the advice, thanks. "

1. I'm in my first year and I'm at a university that has like a 50%&gt; drop out rate of computer science.

Now this semester seems a bit better and I think I can get it higher but rn as it stands, it's fucking ass. Would this affect my chances of getting an internship? Do they contact the school or like ask for your GPA at any moment?

2. I've been reading up on these interviews and the questions that could come up and I got to say I haven't learned some of these things as I'm a first year. Like I know most but like Hash tables, no idea, and some other stuff aswell. If I get an interview, should I let the interviewee know that I haven't learned this stuff yet or should I not say anything. I mean I plan on trying to learn this stuff but idk how far I could get.

I will be graduating in May with my bachelors and I will be returning home (Northeast Ohio) for employment. I will be working in a specific financial sector and my base salary will be $85k plus a bonus between $10-$40k. Additionally, I have worked in the industry for multiple internships, so I know exactly what I am getting myself into and can predict my income stability in the field for at least a few years to come. I won't be starting employment until August, but I am able to find part time, lower paid employment for the two months between graduation and when I start working. I could probably save $3-4k over this time. My fico (according to amex) is roughly 720. If financing is still an issue, I would be able to ask a family member to cosign my loans. I have enough cash on hand to make the first few mortgage payments through when I would be able to start paying. 

Anyway, I am very familiar with the area and have decided that I want to be able to put my otherwise ""rent"" payments into equity ASAP upon moving back. I am interested in buying a house, and I have been looking for outlets to get a great deal on a decent house. I am also not afraid of DIY/manual labor, and I am looking for something with cosmetic issues that I can fix at my own pace over the summer in an effort to buy at a lower price.

My family are also landlords of their own, and although I do not want to buy in the areas they rent, I feel that I can trust their objective opinion about houses that I have sent their way. They have already looked at a couple houses I have asked them to go through (as I am at school in new england) and they have informed me about their situation. They have not purchased for awhile and I am curious to know what the best outlet may be. T

The market has been extremely friendly to buyers and there are hundreds of foreclosures in the region. My issue is that most homes that are in the functional quality that I need to secure a loan (such as proper plumbing and HVAC) do not have utilities turned on due to being foreclosed for multiple months. Further, I am finding few deals on the market from non-bank owned listed properties and fannie mae/hud owns the majority of bank foreclosures with extremely stringent cash and paperwork requirements, in addition to not moving much on their listing price. 

Finally, I have been in contact with a local agent who seems to be very seasoned and knows what hes doing. I am sure he has a pipeline of houses that are not as on the market, but I want to make sure I am getting the best deal I can. I notice that a lot of houses are listed as ""pre-foreclosure"" or ""foreclosed but not on market yet"". Is it reasonable to reach out/have the agent reach out to the bank directly before it is listed on the market? And is there any general advice you would offer me? Thanks

4579jd,7,2016-02-11,I apologize for this massive post. Looking at my options for getting into Sweden as an American.,Cuban--Pete,TillSverige,https://www.reddit.com/r/TillSverige/comments/4579jd/i_apologize_for_this_massive_post_looking_at_my/,"Hello, 

So to preface this, I am one of those people who is hugely consumed with planning things out, in order to be sure not to close any doors along the way. I am in a long-term, long-distance relationship with my lovely Swedish girlfriend, who has lived near Ängelholm her entire life, and I would like to figure out a way to get closer to her.

I am currently in my second year of my undergraduate Aerospace Engineering degree at one of the best AE schools in America, with a 97% job placement rate after graduation. However, I am mainly going down this road because aerospace engineering tends to draw more money than mechanical engineering. My real passion is just to be designing basically anything, from urinal sensors on toilets to nuclear submarines. 

I have been working on learning Swedish for about 3 hours a day, and I feel I will be near fluency by this time next year. As it stands, since neither my girlfriend or I make very much money, there is no way for her to move to America via work/marriage etc., and I feel like moving to Sweden is the better long-term option because of how close she is with her friends and family, whereas I've barely talked to my family since starting college and have never had any plans to move back to them after graduation (I go to college in a different state from my family, and living costs are much cheaper here). 

For my degree program, it is mainly typical to get an internship the summer before you graduate, due to how much material you know. For me, that would be the summer of 2017, but internships this summer are not out of the question (just much harder to get). My girlfriend's family has an extra car that I can use for commuting. I have recently applied to an internship this summer with Koenigsegg, who are based in Ängelholm, and that is the company I can most see myself working for eventually, even if I don't get any internships before graduation with them, or even if I don't get hired with them immediately after graduation and have to try getting hired with them every year or so.

So as it stands, I have plenty of possible scenarios for moving to Sweden, and I was wondering what you felt about which would work best.

1. I could continue my college studies in America, get internships in America, and get hired in America, and bring my girlfriend here on a marriage visa once I made the money required to do such a task. Although we've talked heavily about marriage in the future, we both feel this should be our last-ditch attempt at being together, and it would be much preferred if we could live together for a while before get married, due to costs of having a wedding as well as better getting to know how well we fit together when we aren't both on vacation (what we can expect in average, day to day life). It would also probably be easier to get a job in Sweden after having some level of professional work experience in America.
2. I could seek internships in Sweden heavily for the summer of 2017, to at least get my foot in the door and hopefully have a job lined up by the time I graduate, and could move there on a work visa. I am not sure how likely getting an internship in Sweden is as an American. In America at least, I can pretty much get any mechanical engineering job with my AE degree, as the two are so closely linked. I'm not sure if this is the case in Sweden. And from what I can tell, the best time to apply for internships would be this fall?

3. I could seek out studying in college in Sweden starting around Fall 2017 and complete my last year of college in Sweden. By that time, I should be fluent enough to take Swedish courses. My main concern with this would be finding a school in Sweden with an aerospace or mechanical engineering program within an hour-long drive radius of Ängelholm. My other concern is that if I transferred to a Swedish school, the credits would either not transfer, or they would put me in a different position, making it so I would take 2-3 years to graduate instead of the 1 year left at my American college.

4. I could try my hardest to get internships in Sweden and America in the summer of 2017, and then attempt a sambo visa to move to Sweden upon my graduation, where it might be easier to find a job once I am already living in Sweden, because I will be seen less as an outsider. 

I am just trying to figure out the best option for my situation, so any comments regarding difficultly of finding jobs, Swedish universities I could attend, etc. would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your time."

457wqu,2,2016-02-11,Requesting a shapefile from geoserver and displaying it on a website that runs an,JavidanOfTheWest,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/457wqu/requesting_a_shapefile_from_geoserver_and/,"So I've taken over a project from two other programmers as a part of my internship and I'm having a little trouble pinpointing why a part of it isn't working properly.

The website itself is a very simple bland site with an openlayers map and three buttons. One button is linked to geoserver, where I can fill in the name of the shapefile (*.shp) that I want to load and then it should load the shapefile data onto the openlayers map. The previous interns had this working on localhost and I've also set it up like that, but I still feel like it's a problem with my geoserver-setup rather than a problem with the file path.

My main question is whether it's possible to place a shapefile in the **geoserver map &gt; data_dir &gt; data** directory and if Geoserver is able to provide it just like that through the **GetMap** command of the Geoserver Get Map Service. Or whether I specifically have to add every shapefile manually, as described here: http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/gettingstarted/shapefile-quickstart/index.html

Adding it manually seems to require me to create a workspace, store &amp; layer for each shapefile. Another problem I run into when I try this approach is that only the shapefile from the tutorial can be added without running into errors. And I can't load the shapefiles I provide by myself. The previous interns (who did not document how they did it) did manage to get it working, so I'm sure the shapefile itself isn't corrupt.

**Steps in which I've added the shapefile to GeoServer:**

[(Add New Workspace) I've probably done this first step right](http://s17.postimg.org/xq8mibknj/Adding_New_Workspace.png)

[(Add New Store) I've probably done this step right as well](http://s17.postimg.org/9xzb6simn/Adding_New_Store.png)

[(Add New Layer) This is where I believe I'm making a mistake](http://s17.postimg.org/6tona01u7/Bounding_Box_Problem.png)

I'm not 100% sure that the lon/lat generated from the **Declared SRS** are the right ones, but when I check it's coordinates it seems to check-out. I need the bounding box of the [sea-area](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4289/) (Wadden Sea) in between Northwestern-Holland and the islands.

I also do not know if I picked the right style in the publish tab of the layer.

Anyway, when I preview the layer, I'm supposed to see something similar to the preview in the tutorial, [yet what I see is this](http://s23.postimg.org/5ap2n603v/Preview_Problem.png)

4581va,19,2016-02-11,[UPDATE] I think my work history is preventing me from getting interviews. Trying to get my career started.,amotion578,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4581va/update_i_think_my_work_history_is_preventing_me/,"[Previous: https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/44vxjy/i_think_my_work_history_is_preventing_me_from/]

A huge THANK YOU to all the comments and suggestions. I did not get around to thanking everyone before, but did read all the comments.

I took a better look at my resume and reworked it to [this (imgur)](http://i.imgur.com/UgPj97H.jpg).

I'm way happier with this one. I also started a conversation with my college's IT Manager, and today was a job fair at the college where I spoke with a HR specialist and asked about internship/volunteer opportunities.

I was given the names of two other IT Managers to email and ask about internships, if not at the college (would be handy living 1 mile away) then somewhere in town.

As an additional stroke of luck, I received an invitation to interview at the State Hospital as a direct care staff! In 2010/2011, as a temp State worker I was ineligible to apply for internal only job postings, but the times may have changed and getting access to internal postings just might be what I need to find my 'in' with the State's helpdesk.

Any other critiques of my resume or if I should start over again completely welcome and appreciated!"

My end goal is to get into IT management. However the math of that major seems to be more than I can handle. I failed the college math placement so I had to do a 3 semester pre-college basic math course of which I almost failed. Now I'm in pre-calc and I understand 0 of what we are doing and I think it's only going to get worse.

I intern on an IT staff during the summers and what I have found is a lot of IT guys don't have that Computer Information System degree. So I did some research and more thinking and I would like to change to management and then get a computer networking cert my college offers. Does this seem like a viable solution? 

Aside from the fact that most of the classes I have already taken are also apart of that management degree I really enjoy my business classes. I also really can't afford college and the cheapest school a few miles away doesn't have an IT degree but they have a very good management program apparently. Also as far as I have checked my school's management degree only requires one math elective and then statistics which I already took in high school and it was the only math I enjoyed and understood 

Should I just drop the precalc and switch degrees? I'm waiting to hear what my intern IT manager says (since he works as what I want to do) and also my business professor but this is a third say in the matter, I don't have an adviser to ask. "

When I first got the game in August, I did so right at the cusp of transition to year 2.  I got my Gjallarhorn a week before Xur put that up for sale.  I've downed Crota, and Atheon is my bitch.  I blind raided on the day Kingsfall launched, and have completed the raid every week since it's launch.  I complete my daily story missions, and occasionally terribly PvP

But most importantly I spent time with my brothers (and his friends).  
Nowadays they have they have no reason to log-in.  They are all chasing ghost's and class items, and sitting at 319.  Why?  because chasing down that last piece of gear isn't rewarding.  It isn't fun.  But I still log-in and raid week after week.

Is it because I've found a great group of friends?  No, I play exclusively with LFG pugs after my brothers and my brother's gaming friends wandered off.  

Is it because they have such an endearing story?  I do &lt;3 Variks very much, and would think he would make a great Kell of Kells, but no.  My story fix ended a long time ago.  I've done a Dinklebot run, and a Nolanbot run  (Still prefer Dinklebot, no offense to you Nolan North!)

Is it because of the great graphics?  Nope.  I'm a PC gamer, and while there are some beautiful destiny elements, take a good look at those roses in tower right now as you run down to Shaxx / The Vanguard area.  They are sloppy, poorly done, and it feels like they had an intern sit and copy paste red shit all over the tower.  One of the most important parts about art is restraint, and it sure as hell isn't present in the Crimson Doubles event.  



The reason is that I've had addiction issues in the past, and the game plays on addiction mechanics.  That's all a Skinner Box is. But right now Bungie has no reason to change that, and divert away from that course.  And right now, no matter what you post here, they don't care because people continuing to log-in and pull that lever.  I won't be an addict again to you, or to anything.

All I can do is vote with my time and game play.   So I'm going to take that long cold walk out into the Cosmodrome and the Forgotten Shores one more time, bid Rasputin a fond adieu and log off for one last time.

Fix Destiny Bungee.  Make it into the game it should be, the game it deserves to be, and the game your player base desperately wants.  Do something other than refine your addiction mechanics (Silver purchased items as drops is a way to hook you on to buying those once that feed runs out from your weeklies (if you got two drop for completing the Crimson Doubles bounties, that's them upping your drug intake and hoping you buy silver))  Add story, content, or anything other than just Skinner Box Mechanics.  Prove you respect your player base by rewarding us with something other than food pellets.  Prove that you don't just see us all as rats on a treadmill waiting for our fix.

And if you feel the same way, maybe you should find your own favorite vista.  Your own favorite NPC to wave goodbye too.  And let Bungee know you demand their respect in the only way the will listen.  By logging off, and not logging back in.

(throwaway because people know my original account)  
  
recently I have been working the same menial job for the past three years while going to higschool and community college. I have a tough history of depression. I thought I took control of it and my depression has gone away but now I feel like I am living a life that is pointless. Ever since I graduated High School I have been working 11 hours a day 6 days a week with people I hate and come home to go into zombie mode and do homework. Its like everyday is a repeat of its self.  I need some advice on a huge decision in my life. I have a friend in utah (I'm in arizona) that has created a startup company that its becoming increasingly profitable.  
  
First a little back story on my friend:  I was 15 and institutionalized due to severe depression and suicidal attempts. The institutions housed kids for my reasons from schizophrenia to just being homosexual. I was week and scrawny (still am) and everyone used me as a scape goat and punching bag which furthered my depression. Then came my friend lets call him John. John worked as the IT manager for the institution, he saw what was happening to me and that I was in there for depression. Him and I started talking about what I liked before I arrived at the institution I told him I was really interested in computers, which I am, (before I arrived at the institution I had bought a raspberry pi and hosted a small LAMP server). Since then he has taken me under his wing and taught me many things in IT , networks and programming. I kept in contact with him after I was released and he quit his job and create a startup with some friends.
  
 He has offered me to come and work for him on a payed internship that also provides housing. However, I have talked to my parents about this and they do not agree if I make the decision to quit my current job and transfer colleges. I just want to be in a different environment. I am 18 so I am legally allowed to make this decision for myself. I just dont know why i am not pulling the trigger on this opportunity, I feel like so much could go wrong.

The name's Mike. For starters, I'm 21. I'm in the Eastern Time Zone, and I work day shift. I enjoy story-driven roleplay that's heavy on the smut. I like 1 or 2 paragraph-length responses, at least once a day if possible. I'm posting here in hopes that I can find someone interested in one of my prompts. I'm flexible on most if not all of these, and I'm happy to include any kinks that you're into as well. Characters and such are negotiable, just let me know which of them, if any, grab you!

Please put your name, age, and your favorite color in the title of your reply so I know you read the above.

Kinks: Noncon/Dubcon, Blackmail, Anal, Rough Sex, Light BDSM, Taboo/Forbidden Roles, Sci-fi/Fantasy, Celebrities/Rule34, Bimbofication, Cuckold/Cheating (As a bull) And just about anything else, really. I'm not too picky. I'm dominant, though I've never really explored my submissive side.

Limits: Scat, Extreme Ageplay, Snuff, Excessive Violence, Futa, not too many others.

Without further delay, my prompts:

Let's talk about your man... 

We both know he doesn't satisfy you anymore. Maybe he's too vanilla, too gentle, or even, well, too small. Who we are, setting, and characters, is up for discussion. Am I your boss? Your coworker? Your friend, or your man's friend? Maybe I'm a stranger that you meet one day. However it happens, you give in to your urges and give yourself to me.

1985/Stacy's Mom

Like the songs. You're an older woman (Anything older than me is fine) looking for what she missed out on in life. You're unsure, self-conscious, and a bit skittish. I'm confident, young, and headstrong. I lead you down a path of lust and depravity, letting you relive your teenage fantasies.

Blackmail

Blackmail. However you want it. Maybe I'm your coach or teacher and I find some weed or cigarettes in your locker? Perhaps I'm your boss, and you've been messing up at work. Maybe you just need an extra buck, and I'm a rich dick who couldn't care less? However you please, as long as you've got no other choice.

Doctors Office

All ages to be discussed in PM. It's your first time at the doctor's by yourself. Why are you here?

Ravishing an older woman

I'm looking for an older woman. I have the fantasy of being really rough, dominant, and degrading with her, fucking her senseless and making her do all sorts of nasty things that she has never done with her husband. I could play as your son's old high-school bully, come to pick on him one more time, only to find you home instead. I could be the intern at your husband's office, looking to get back at him for the way he treats me at work. You could be my professor, and I'm a student you don't get along with. Maybe I'm a complete stranger who invades your home, or watches you get too drunk at the local bar?

We'll find a set of characters and a scene to play together, I'm sure.

Bonus points for: Busty, thick, curvy women with plump asses. Redheads. ""Good, Christian Housewives"" who haven't been kinky in the bedroom at all, and would be embarrassed by any of the things I make her do. Reluctance. Doggy Style.

Send me a PM with the prompt you like, and some information, and we'll figure things out!"

However, for some reason, I find women who smoke unbelievably sexy. If they do it seductively and back it up with a dirty-talking mouth, then I'm INSTANTLY horny.

I'd love to play out something involving my smoking fetish tonight. One note: While I'm into the smoking fetish, I'm not so much a fan of the dom/sub dynamic, so no BDSM, torture, noncon, etc.

I've got a few RP prompts below that this can be worked into somehow, and I'm also open to any ideas you might have (if there's an RP you've always wanted to do that my smoking fetish fits into, I'm all ears!).

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks other than smoking: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking (open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, big breasts/titfucking, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"

I just wanted to tell you guys about an interesting employment situation I am in. Right now I have two part time jobs, one at a Help Desk working 30 hours a week, then one as a janitor working  20 hours a week.

Last year I had the janitor job cleaning the same building I work the help desk at. I left the janitor late last year to do an internship, before the internship ended I landed the help desk job. Since the help desk job is only 30 hours a week, I needed something else to supplement my income. Since the janitor job is in the same building as the help desk job, I asked my supervisor from my cleaning job if I could pick up some hours, she said yes I was ecstatic. 

So now I work 9 am to 330 PM at the help desk, I then chill at my desk for an hour and a half and then literally walk downstairs and punch in for my second job around 5. I work the cleaning job from 5-9. This is all Monday – Friday.

I don’t get any benefits from my Help Desk job, however the janitor job is a union job so it has dental, life, and PTO. It also pays a a lot better than other janitorial jobs since it’s a union job.

Between the two jobs I work approximately 50 hours a week, and I make out with a pretty good salary for the area (Pittsburgh, PA), and it’s all in the same building so I don’t have to travel.
Now obviously looking for a better employment situation, but for right now I am proud to where two different collars in one day.

459ymq,3,2016-02-11,I don`t know what to do anymore,AlaskaYoung25,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/459ymq/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Hi guys. 

First of all. I`m sorry if my post is difficult to read. I`m not a fluent Engish writer or speaker, but I`ll try my best.

My life is a pretty mess for a  long time allready and it seems I don`t make progress. I`m 26 years old and since i`m 18 and left high school I have done a lot of study`s and did`nt finish one of them. Sometimes because of my lack of interest in it (especially with the lower-levelled study`s, I think its called Community College in the US) and with the higher levelled college study`s it was a problem of learning and concentration issues. 

I have a non-congenital brain disability (thanks to the way I was born, with a vacuum pump which damaged my brain) which is probably the reason for my issues with learning and stuff. I`m also high-sensitive which makes it even more difficult. Anyway. You probably would say with all those problems: accept it and try to find your way on a lower level. But I just can`t accept it. I`m hard for myself and always want to get a degree on that level. 

Now I`m doing a education on a lower level and I`m stuck. Again. 
It`s a security-study and I cant find a internship for months now. Its part of the study so I have to find one. But for months I get rejections because my school isnt co-operating with the firm. Or it`s to far away from my hometown ( I dont have a car) or any other reason. This can`t go on like this but I don`t have any other solution. 

I can wait again for months and months for an internship or I can try a new study on a hgher level. Again. With the risk that I fail. Again. 

The 3th option I have is to go away abroad. To go working somewhere and traveling. I like to travel and the option is tempting but I know I disappoint my family with it and especially my mom will be very upset if I do that. Also I think choose this is a bit immature and run away from your problems. Is that a wrong thing to think? 

Anyway, I was hoping to get a little help from people. And again: Sorry for the mess in my post. I hope you all can understand it a bit. 

Thanks a lot.  "

45at07,2,2016-02-11,A bird in the hand...,LAWSCHOOLISFUN,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/45at07/a_bird_in_the_hand/,"Going into my 2L summer. My main goal in choosing a summer internship/associate position is to secure employment after graduation. My interest is in litigation in both criminal and civil areas. I have been interviewing in both the public and private sectors. I got offer from Homeland Security for legal internship position. I need to respond to the offer within a week, but I still have a lot of interviews coming up with private sector firms. In the Homeland interview I was told that employment after graduation is not guaranteed but there is some chance that it can happen. Many of the firms I have yet to interview with make it explicitly clear on their website that they only give offers to summers who they intend on hiring full time. 

So long story short, it's a ""bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" type dilemma. Either I commit to Homeland and take my chances at full time employment there after graduation, or I say no to Homeland and run the risk of not getting another offer this summer at a solid firm or a comparable public entity. 

Info on myself: Cardozo, top 14%, being published in school journal (not law review). 

What would you do in a situation like this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "
45avys,1,2016-02-11,20F4A - Dark Journey from Secretary to Superstar,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/45avys/20f4a_dark_journey_from_secretary_to_superstar/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused. Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

Or it could just be an office type rp.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K Messenger, skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp. If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

45bb56,27,2016-02-11,"Me [23F] with my fiancee [25M] of 3 years, I had a one-night-stand in the very first month of our relationship and still can't shake the guilt.",throw24601awayay,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/45bb56/me_23f_with_my_fiancee_25m_of_3_years_i_had_a/,"Throwaway because he knows my main account.

First of all... try not to judge me.

When fiancee (we will call him Jack) and I started dating, I was positive that things weren't going to go anywhere serious. I was abroad on a work assignment for 5 months (really amazing internship opportunity) and we met and hit it off. He's a native of the country. 

Jack and I dated (in a way that I thought was) casually for a few weeks, and I went traveling with a few friends in that time. Within these few weeks away, I slept with a random fellow-traveler (using protection, of course) after a drunken night out on the town. I have never had any kind of contact with him ever again. I have no interest in pursuing any kind of relationship, platonic or otherwise, with that man.

Coming back to my semi-permanent home, I continued seeing Jack. Suddenly, things weren't casual anymore. I knew I was leaving very soon, however within a few weeks I was living at his place and we were talking about how we would cope with the distance. I was, all-at-once, head-over-heels. Still am.

Fast-forward a year (&amp; some change)... Jack and I are still together, in love, and serious about our future. He has moved to the US on a work visa, which is going to transition into a fiancee visa, then permanent residence. We have lived together for the past year and have a cat and are so happy together. Jack is absolutely the best person that I have ever met. No one has ever known me at a level that he does. I am an only child with only a surviving father, so I cherish my relationship with my dad, and he absolutely loves Jack as a son. Things are so perfect.

I WOULD NEVER EVEN CONSIDER CHEATING ON JACK. At the time, I truly didn't think we had defined the relationship as exclusive/serious/whatever you want to call it. Later on, I discovered that he had considered us to be exclusive from day 1.

I want to share every part of my life with this man, and every so often I feel guilt that he doesn't know about my early one-night-stand. It meant nothing, as so many do, however I know that he would be absolutely crushed that I kept this from him, and I even think that he would consider this outright cheating.

Please help. I know there isn't really a ""correct"" answer, but any advice would be so greatly appreciated.

   
**tl;dr**: I slept with a random in the first month of our relationship when we hadn't defined the relationship. He doesn't know. Now engaged and so ready to start a future with this man... but is it wrong to keep this from him?

EDIT: The pure nastiness and hatred in some of your comments is alarming. I came here for advice, not validation of anything. Thank you to those of you with legitimate advice on both sides of the aisle... the rest of you don't know me at all. Find something better to do with your time than calling a girl, who is admitting to making a mistake and attempting to fix it, a slut."

45bmfk,1,2016-02-11,My (20/M) GF (18/F) is always mad at me. I feel like I can't do anything to make her happy. What should I do?,throwable885,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/45bmfk/my_20m_gf_18f_is_always_mad_at_me_i_feel_like_i/,"So, we've been together 5 months, it'll be 6 in about a week. The first 4 months were mostly good, no big issues.Then winter break came and we both went back home about 3 hours apart from each other. I went to see her for 3 days around new years and it was fantastic. 
After new years she found out that I had an instagram account that she didn't know about. I wasn't trying to hide it, I just never use it so I never brought it up until that day. She freaked out, claiming that I had told her that I didn't have one (I have no memory of the conversation that she says happened even though I was certainly not drunk or anything at that time), said I had lied to her for 4 months, and made it a big deal for several days. She came up to visit a few days later with her mom and to meet my parents. I showed her around my home town, she had fun, and she said even though she still isn't really happy with me that she's forgiven me because I still treated her well when she was mad and made sure she enjoyed her time visiting me.
 We got back to school, things were good, we even cuddled. Then the first weekend back we went back to my home town to go to a rodeo. We got into a fight on the way there, but by the time we made it things were okay. That night we cuddled for awhile before bed. The next day we looked at tickets for the rodeo, and she asked about going to a hockey game. They were at the same time, and she said since we came for the rodeo we should go to that, then she saw the ticket prices, said the hockey game was fine and the rodeo was too expensive. My mom said no, the rodeo is fine, and my girlfriend agreed so I got the rodeo tickets. That night on the way home she said she needed more space and I said that she could have a little more space, and that I thought that would be good for us and she flipped out and wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night. On the drive back to school we fought the whole 5 hours about how she feels, how I feel, and how I should be grateful for my family wanting to do things together (I appreciate it but I also don't get along with my brothers well (ages 14 and 16)) and how she wishes she had that. 

Things got better for a week. I made a joke that offended her and she got really mad again. Things got better for a week and last night, I was just texting her, and I have no idea what I said that got the reaction it did, but she said she could not keep having the conversation because I was making her furious. We fought back and forth. She says I never listen to how she feels even though I do my best to make the changes she asks for. Then she asked how I felt and I told her and she got even more mad at me because I feel like she doesn't listen to me and doesn't realize that I try to make the changes she asks for. She said she doesn't want to be around me but there's nothing I can do to make her feel better without being around her. I asked her why she can't be around me and she said she sees a liar and someone who doesn't care about her. I told her I want to change that, I want to be the man that she loves again, and that the only way I will be able to do that is if she changes how she thinks so we can be together. She got mad and said that I was blaming her for everything bad in our relationship, and that I can pick up all my shirts she has at my car at 7. I waited at my car for her, she came, dropped it off, and by the time I got out of my car she had ran across the parking lot over to her friend. I called out after her but she didn't hear me. I texted her saying we need to talk in person after the basketball game she went to, and she responded by telling me no because she can't talk to me right now she's so mad. She texted me at midnight saying she needs time. I told her that if that's what she need I won't contact her first for a couple days. She said ""what the fuck is the point of being in a relationship and not talking?"" I told her if she wanted time and space that was the easiest way to give it to her. 
Today, I texted her 10 minutes before an interview she had for an internship wishing her luck. She responded afterwards telling me she got it. I congratulated her and told her I was happy for her and got no response. Four hours later I told her that her selfie on snapchat was beautiful. She responded ""okay"". 30 minutes after (about an hour ago) that she texted me ""I really do not want to talk with you, because today I haven't felt like shit about myself for the first time in a while and I want to keep it like that."" I haven't responded and I'm not sure if I will. Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice? I love her, and I still have hope for us, but I don't know what to do right now.

TL;DR My girlfriend is always mad at me and doesn't realize any changes I make that she asks for, telling me I still screwed up. Haven't talked much today and she said she feels better today than she has in a long time. "

45buhn,4,2016-02-11,First-year CS major with previous programming experience; some questions,Aqlow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/45buhn/firstyear_cs_major_with_previous_programming/,"A little introduction: I'm a first-year computer science major, but I started learning to program ~8 years ago. I have experience with Javascript (browser+node.js), Java, C#, C (Arduino), and Python. I've been browsing this subreddit for a week or so and have a few questions.

First of all, a good portion of the content taught in all my classes is already familiar to me, and I'm already a quick learner, so I'm ending up with a large amount of free time outside of class. What should I be using this free time for to best prepare for getting internships/jobs?

I'm probably going to graduate in 3 years as opposed to 4. Is this seen as a good or a bad thing by employers?

I'm thinking of moving out-of-state when I graduate (I currently attend UMN-TC), which areas/states are better for CS?

Is it too late to get an internship for this summer? Would I even be considered as a first-year CS major? How much should I be expecting to earn at an internship?"

So I'm supposed to be in my second semester of my third year in college. Due to me being a total failure I have to take a year off. I did well in classes and my major is in the health field. I was paying out of pocket for school and didn't have any loans from my school. I think I could have gotten some, but since I have been self destructive as a young child... I just didn't get any. I was trying to get a loan from my bank and it just all went to shit. I just couldn't afford classes for spring. I didn't sign up for any and still have left over money due from the fall. No one knows except for a few people from my class.

Now I live in a big city smack in the middle of my state and college was in a city south of me. I used to commute with my boyfriend (we will call him O) and friend named John. It is O's last semester of college and he is only taking one class. This is also his fifth year in college and he is 2 years older than me. He has this whole plan for when he graduates in June. He wants to move upstate to work in his industry and I think it is such a great idea! He plans to get an apartment with a good friend of ours and I was supposed to go next spring for an internship. I want to go with him so badly.

Everyday I have been driving John and myself to campus and while he goes to class I hide in the library doing my own thing. School has been going on for about month now. During this time I have been applying to jobs in my field to gain some experience while I'm ""off"". I currently work retail on weekends, but I can only make so much money. During my time in the library I am also studying. While I don't have classes I have done some research and found out that I can get a certification in medical coding. There are a few different certifications out there for it, but I am taking the one that I can do on my own with just a high school diploma. I want to be a medical coder when I get my college degree, but if I can start now I will. I plan to take my exam in late April or early May.  I have all of the text books, coding books, and study guides I can get my hands on. 

I am an only child that lives with her dad and our three cats. I haven't told either of my parents. I haven't told O either. I am so afraid of disappointing them. So much so that I don't ask for help and it gets me in this kind of trouble. O and I have been together for 6 years. I am 21 while he is 23. He is about to start his life and I will be holding him back.

I have spoken to the chair of my program about my situation and she said I can come back after my year pause. It would have to be a full year because the classes I need are only given at certain times. All of my professors have been so kind and I want to go back so badly.

To be honest I have a best case scenario in my head: I will get my coding certification in the spring and move with O and our friend up state after he graduates. I will work in a medical facility while waiting for next spring. I don't know if they will be up for this, but I want to see if they would be okay with me paying a little less in rent so that I can save up for school. In exchange for this I would take care of all the cooking, cleaning, and some groceries. When next spring would roll around I would be taking the classes I need but online (my program has an online group) so that I can keep working/stay up north. I could finish my degree and then just get off with my life. 

I feel so dead inside. I just want to lay down and wake up after the world ends. I am such a failure. Even when I was in school I prayed for something to just make it all go away. I want to start my life and even though I did well in my classes.... I can't stand being in school anymore. 

Anyways y'all... Thanks for listening."

45c13u,0,2016-02-11,26 years old and feeling like a loser. I need some career advice.,Internationaal,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/45c13u/26_years_old_and_feeling_like_a_loser_i_need_some/,"I am 26 years old and currently feeling that I am at a difficult point in my life and don't know what to do.

I have two MA's, both in fields in which it is difficult to find jobs but I managed, I did many internships and side-jobs. Highlight was a stay at an Embassy of my country and in an European Institution.

Problem is that despite my talents and because of some badluck I did not manage to find a job that I like. Last Summer, when (in my view) people around me did find jobs that I would also like, I had to take an internship again. I took this possibility as a way to stay in one place for a change and look from there (at least I have quite an ok background and did many interesting things for employees), it was at a field of work which I really did not like, but at least it gave me a way to prove myself again and keeping up with my contacts in this specific city. 

The first months went excellent. I even managed to find an international job in a different country. The company invited me to fly in so we could talk about the job and arranged everything. However I have a terrible fear of flying. This rarely stopped me before but now I just couldnt go in. I don't know why it was so bad this time I cannot really explain it but I did not enter the plane.

From that moment almost everything went downhill for me. My selfconfidence diminished before my eyes and I was becoming almost depressed by seeing my whole future falling apart because of the fact that I did not enter the plane. I could not concentrate at work and was more busy with myself. Flying became an obsession for me and I even failed to enter a plane the second time.

Now I am doing way better in sense of the problems described above. I took a fear of flying course which is really helping. The last two weeks of the internship I picked myself up and managed, at least for my own feelings, to make a better impression. I can say that I am looking at a different way to flying now and would really like to get back the opportunity (and I probably get another chance but have to wait a couple of months). 

This whole period covered the rest of my internship. What started as a success ended as a faillure. Now I am out of money and had to move back in my hometown with my parents because otherwise I would be living under a bridge ( :) :)). All my savings are gone and ofc uf my hometown is not the hotspot for finding a job in my field.

So in short

* 26, turning 27 later this year, did some impressive and nice things but now living again in my parents home without a gf, and without money, and without knowing where to start

* I said that I feel like a loser, and I do, mostly because of the flying choice. On the other hand I did pick myself up, I tried to fight it, lost a couple of times but now have the feeling that I have at least partially beaten it. The most annoying thing is that often I think ""what if, what if I would have entered that plane, so"". I know it doesn't make a difference right now but it remains a bit difficult certainly because I have thrown away a couple of important months.

* The original job that I would had to go will probably invite me again but this can take a couple of months which I dont want to spend sitting in my parents home doing almost nothing just looking at my computer ( :D :D).

* I am thinking about going abroad for a couple of months. Just doing some shitjob but at least abroad. Making a bit of money, getting some experience, and when I get another opportunity that I like, for example the job above, I will take it. The only problem is that I am almost completely out of money and I dont know where to start. Any advice would be welcome.

* Anything Else.

If anyone Else has been in a similar situation or has any other kind of advice, certainly where to start now, it would be most welcome.

Thanks!!

****
At approximately 0238 EST, January 6, 1960, a National Airlines DC-6B crashed in a field 1-1/2 miles northwest of Bolivia, North Carolina. 34 people (29 passengers and the crew of five) perished.

&amp;nbsp;

Flight 2511 departed New York International (Idlewild) Airport at 2334 on an IFR clearance scheduled as a nonstop flight to Miami, Florida. The flight proceeded routinely in accordance with its flight plan until shortly after passing Wilmington, North Carolina.

&amp;nbsp;

At 0231, the aircraft contacted the company radio station at Wilmington while over Carolina Beach at 18,000 feet, and transmitted a routine progress report. Shortly after the completion of this radio contact, the aircraft entered a wide descending right turn and crashed 1-1/2 miles northwest of Bolivia at 0238 some 16 miles west of its intended flight path.

The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation concluded that the plane was brought down by a dynamite bomb. No criminal charges have ever been filed, nor has the blame for the bombing ever been determined, although a suicide bombing is suspected. The investigation remains open, and the mystery unresolved to this day.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**THE FLIGHT**
****
Flight 2511 was one of two aircraft used as replacements for Flight 601, which was scheduled as a nonstop Boeing 707 jet flight to depart Idlewild at 2115, utilizing Pan American Aircraft N 710PA under a lease agreement.

&amp;nbsp;

Owing to the late arrival of N 710PA from Miami, the flight was rescheduled to depart at 2215. During the turnaround inspection on N 710PA it was discovered that the co-pilot's No. 3 aft window was cracked and would require replacement. Since it was estimated that the replacement time would be about eight hours, a National Lockheed Electra, N 5003K, and a National Douglas DC-6B, N 8225H, were substituted.

&amp;nbsp;

Passengers originally ticketed on Flight 601 were enplaned on a first-come, first-serve basis on the Electra and then the DC-6B. Seventy-six passengers boarded the Electra, which departed New York International Airport at 2334. The remaining 29 passengers boarded the DC-6B which left the terminal at 2334.

&amp;nbsp;

The flight plan filed by Captain Southard requested routing as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

    Radar vectoring to Coyle VOR, V-1 airway to Wilmington, North Carolina,
    control 1150 to West Palm Beach, Florida, and V-3 airway to Miami, FL,
    requesting an altitude of 18,000 feet.

&amp;nbsp;

Following receipt of taxi clearance, the flight taxied to runway 31 left, then received the following clearance from Idlewild clearance delivery on 121.6 mcs:

&amp;nbsp;

    National twenty-five eleven ATC clears you to the Wolf intersection
    via Idlewild radio beacon, Idlewild VOR one three zero radial, Victor
    sixteen, cross Wolf at, and maintain three thousand, cross Idlewild
    radio beacon at two thousand.

&amp;nbsp;

The clearance was read back by Flight 2511 and acknowledged. The flight then contacted Idlewild tower on 119.1 mcs, and was cleared for takeoff.

&amp;nbsp;

After takeoff, the aircraft contacted departure control and was radar vectored to Victor 16 airway, then contacted New York Center on 124.1 mcs.  New York radar vectored the flight to a position six miles east of Point Pleasant and cleared it to navigate direct to Coyle VCR. During the departure the flight was given successively higher altitudes and reported over Coyle at 16,000 feet. New York then cleared the flight to 18,000 feet, which was the requested flight plan altitude.

&amp;nbsp;

Flight 2511 proceeded in a routine manner in accordance with its flight plan and clearance, and reported to Washington Center over the Wilmington (North Carolina) VOR at 0227, 18,000 feet, estimating Azalea intersection at 0302 and Gateway intersection as the next reporting point.

&amp;nbsp;

During the flight from Idlewild in addition to the communication contacts with FAA centers, Flight 2511 maintained contact with National Airlines company radio stations located at Idlewild, Washington, and Wilmington. It is the practice of the company to have its pilots make their position reports to ARTC.

&amp;nbsp;

At 0213, Flight 2511 established contact with the company radio at Wilmington on 128.7 mcs. At this time, the aircraft reported it was over Kinston at 0210, 18,000 feet, and estimated Wilmington at 0230, with Azalea as the next checkpoint.  The Wilmington operator informed the flight that the Wilmington altimeter setting was 30.17.

&amp;nbsp;

At 0231, the aircraft reported to company radio at Wilmington as over Wilmington at 0227, at 18,000 feet, estimating Azalea at 0302, with Gateway as the next checkpoint. At the time of this radio contact they were over the Carolina Beach radio beacon (an ""H"" facility which is located 16 nautical miles from the Wilmington VOR on a heading of 200 degrees), and had been on instruments to Cofield (VOR), then in and out of clouds, and ultimately on top for the first time.

&amp;nbsp;

The company radio operator logged the time of the termination of this message as 0231. This was the last contact with Flight 2511.

&amp;nbsp;

At approximately 0700, a telephone call was received by the National Airlines radio operator from a Richard Randolph of Bolivia, North Carolina, advising that there was airplane wreckage in the field near his house. This wreckage was later identified as that of N 8225H.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**THE BODY IN SNOW'S MARSH**
****
From the passenger manifest it was determined that 29 passengers and a crew of five were aboard the aircraft. Initially, two of the passengers' bodies could not be located. Both, however, were found later; one was in the main wreckage area, and the other was recovered from Snow's Marsh on the west side of the Cape Fear River, some 16 miles from the main wreckage area.

&amp;nbsp;

The local coroner ordered post-mortem examinations of the passengers and crew as deemed necessary to determine the cause of death of each.

&amp;nbsp;

The body recovered from Snow's Marsh was identified as that of Mr. Julian A. Frank. The autopsy conducted on the body of Mr. Frank showed extensive avulsion (tearing away) of the lower extremities, and X-rays showed numerous foreign objects to be imbedded in its tissue.

&amp;nbsp;

In view of the nature of the injuries to Mr. Frank, it was determined that further examination of the body was necessary to assure complete documentation of the injuries sustained. Accordingly, a second examination revealed many additional embedded foreign particles.

&amp;nbsp;

Some of the more significant facts determined during the examinations of Mr. Frank's body were:

* Irregular erythematous (reddened) areas of skin on the face

* Dislocation of the right humerus without apparent fracture.

* Fragments of steel-colored wire imbedded in the superficial flexor muscles of the right forearm.

* Partial avulsion of soft tissue of the right thumb, index finger, and middle fingers with partial denuding of sin of the fingers and palmar surface of the hand.

* The left hand was extensively mutilated, with multiple skin lacerations and absence of the distal portion of all fingers.

* A small piece of brass was found imbedded in the muscle mass below the left elbow.

* Left fibula missing and left tibia amputated at lower third. Extensive mutilation and fragmentation of muscle tissue manifested by tears in a longitudinal direction with the loss of much skin.

* Right tibia amputated a few inches below the condyles at the knee and the fibula amputated below its head. Below the upper fifth of the thigh posteriorly, and below the lower thigh anteriorly, there was mutilation of the muscles similar to that found on the lower left extremity.

* X-ray examination revealed small opaque particles in the right wrist. These were found to be wire particles similar to those found in the right thigh.

&amp;nbsp;

Microscopic examination of the body tissues revealed other significant facts:

1. The right hand was found to have concentrated blackened areas which were also present on the fingers and wrist. The blackened areas consisted of granular particles of varying size and shape. The right palm had many particles imbedded in or attached to the epidermis.

2. The right anterior surface of the forearm had heavy deposits scattered over the surface which were similar to powder residues from a gunshot at close range both from microscopic character of the deposit and the way in which the particles were attached to the epidermis.

3. Several areas on the right arm just above the wrist were darkened but were not similar to the carbon black of the outer areas. These areas were reddish-black, similar to an abrasion, but the epidermis was intact. The skin was toughened in these areas suggesting coagulation of the protein material.

4. Microscopic examination of the fractures of the fingers of the right hand showed splinters of bone in random directions. There were several areas of split bone with osseous strands bridging the separated bone sections.

5. Microscopic examination of the right hand revealed numerous fibres adhering to the surface and imbedded in the tissue. One fibre was observed protruding from the epidermis like a growing hair. The surrounding tissue was relatively free of foreign matter. Upon pulling the single fibre a whole bundle of about 2mm. in diameter emerged from under the skin. The epidermis then retracted leaving a pinpoint hole with an underlying pocket lined with clean subcutaneous tissue.

&amp;nbsp;

The foreign particles removed from the tissues of the body of Mr. Frank were mostly quite small in size but included one object 7.2 cm in diameter. The majority of these were examined in the laboratories of the Federal Bureau of Investigations.

&amp;nbsp;

Some of the more significant particles included:

1. Small metal wire .025 inch diameter, embedded in the right wrist.

2. A small piece of brass was found in the left forearm, several pale greenish-brown threads about 10 cm. long, and also some balled-up fine fibers.

3. From the right knee, thigh, and hip over twenty separate items were removed. These included, wires, fibers, and a number of other different colored materials not identified.

4. From deep within the left leg, five small items were removed. In addition two pieces of a woman's hat ornament were found in the muscle tissue of this left leg. One was circular in shape 1.4 cm. in diameter and 1 mm. thick; the other was 7.2 cm. in diameter and 1 mm. thick. Both pieces were grey-tan in color and were of coarse velvet-like material. Attached to the longer piece was a piece of a woman's hat veil 8 by 2 cm. in size.

5. Metal particles were also found in the chest tissue, and a number of fibers were found in the tissue of the face.

&amp;nbsp;

Extensive search for evidence within the fuselage of the aircraft resulted in the findings of four human bone fragments which were identified as from tubular type bones such as the tibia or femur. A fragment of bone 10-1/2 inches long was found at station 350 in the hatrack area. This bone was identified as a left fibula, distal end, with the distal articulations intact. In the tissue attached to this bone fragment were pieces of olive-drab cloth, a brass plate similar to the front brass retainer plate of a Westclox ""Travette"" alarm clock, and miscellaneous other foreign material.

&amp;nbsp;

The wire fragments removed from the body of Mr. Frank were determined to be .025 inch diameter, low-carbon steel wire. Each wire particulate was tension necked at both ends. Similar wire particles were found imedded in the seat belt of one of the right triple seats. Similar wire particles were also found imbedded in the floor covering.

&amp;nbsp;

A small piece of brass was removed from the left forearm just below the elbow. This piece, approximately 1/32 inch thick, 1/8 inch wide, and 1/8 inch long, was curved at one end and broken at a bend at the other end.

&amp;nbsp;

A lifejacket found at Kure Beach was found to have zipper teeth embedded in it, and was penetrated by fragments of flesh-coloured rubber and blue nylon fibres similar to those composing the airline zipper-type flight bags. Black deposits on this lifejacket were found to contain nitrate residues.

&amp;nbsp;

Black crusty particles removed from the right hand were found to be manganese dioxide, a substance found in dry cell batteries. Manganese dioxide was also found on the underaids of one of the right triple seats and on various parts of the airplane.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**AN EXPLOSION IN THE CABIN?**
****
The finding of the body of one of the passengers some 16 miles from the main wreckage area, where all the other bodies were recovered, was considered significant in that it clearly showed that some type of cabin failure had occurred early in the sequence of events. Also, the examination of the fuselage in close detail indicated that the forces which caused the cabin wall failure emanated from within.

&amp;nbsp;

The examination of Mr. Frank's body showed that the injuries sustained were significant in nature as they were not of the type normally associated with an aircraft accident. The existence of an explosive force in close proximity to this passenger is indicated by the avulsion injuries noted, the traumatic amputation of the lower extremities, the fragmentation of muscle tissue manifested by tears on a longitudinal direction and loss of much skin, and the splinters of bone found in random directions to the main shaft of the fingers of the right hand.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, the numerous particles of metal, fibre, cloth, wire, and other objects found in the body tissue could only have resulted from the detonation of an explosive in close proximity to this passenger. Medical experts with extensive experience with battle field land mine injuries and other injuries resulting from explosives indicate that the injuries sustained by the body found at Snow's Marsh could only have been caused by an explosive blast.

&amp;nbsp;

Examination of the aircraft structure and the wreckage distribution suggested that an inflight disintegration of the aircraft had occurred, which initiated at a point in the fuselage near the leading edge of the right wing on the right side of the passenger cabin. The portions of wreckage recovered in the Kure Beach area were all from this general location.

&amp;nbsp;

After the fuselage wreckage was positioned on the mockup, it was found that approximately 90 percent of the fuselage plating or skin had been recovered and identified. Most of the missing pieces of the fuselage apparently came from an irregular edged, triangle-shaped area above and extending forward from the leading edge of the wing on the right side of the fuselage. Numerous small fragments of upper fuselage shell structure from this triangular area, totalling about 20 square feet of surface were found, and identified, but their small size prevented their being positively located within this area.

&amp;nbsp;

A portion of fuselage between stations 238 and 260 was found to contain some 13 propeller cuts. All of these cuts were staggered and were positioned progressively forward as they progressed upward. The lowest cut, which was at station 25 between stringers 17 and 18, distinctly showed marks indicative of high-speed feathering of the metal, and it was evident that subsequent to the initial fuselage failure this portion was forced out and into the No. 3 propellor.

&amp;nbsp;

The fuselage flooring was relatively intact except for a missing area extending approximately 50 inches inboard from the right side of the fuselage and extending forward from station 410 about 14 inches. This missing area of flooring comprised the flooring between seat rows No. 6 and No. 7. The edges of the flooring adjacent to the missing area were irregular and extensively deformed. Five adjacent pieces of flooring from this area were recovered from the main wreckage area. All of the floor carpeting between the seat tracks was recovered except for a portion corresponding to the missing flooring on the right side forward of the front spar.

&amp;nbsp;

The carpeting immediately forward and aft of the missing area was cut and torn in numerous places and upon x-ray examination was found to contain numerous foreign objects which included pieces of .025 inch wire, rivets, and rubber-backed nylon material similar to that used in the manufacture of an airline type flight bag. Manganese dioxide deposits were also found on this carpeting.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**THEORIES**
****
In their final report, the Civil Aeronautics Board indicated that it had investigated a variety of alternative theories, including:

* metal fatigue failure of the cabin leading to explosive decompression
* a propeller blade failing, striking, and rupturing the cabin
* a malfunction in the cabin pressurization system leading to structural failure
* a foreign object striking the plane and penetrating the cabin
* lightning strike
* fuel vapor explosion
*oxygen bottle explosion

&amp;nbsp;

The CAB was, however, able to rule out each of these theories during the course of their investigation, and issued the following conclusion:

&amp;nbsp;

    It is the Board's conclusion that Flight 2511 proceeded in a normal
    manner without operational difficulty, mechanical failure, or malfunction
    until shortly after passing the Carolina Beach ""H"" facility a short
    distance south of Wilmington, North Carolina.

    At approximately 0233 a dynamite charge was exploded, initiated by
    means of a dry cell battery within the passenger cabin and at a point beneath
    the extreme right seat of seat row No. 7.

    Mr Julian A. Frank was in close proximity to the dynamite charge when the
    detonation occurred.

    The dynamite explosion severely impaired the structural integrity of the
    aircraft and after making a wide descending right turn, it experienced inflight
    disintegration and crashed 1-1/2 miles northwest of Bolivia,
    North Carolina, at 0238.

    It is therefore the conclusion of the Board that the probable cause of this
    accident was the detonation of dynamite within the passenger cabin.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**WHO WAS JULIAN FRANK?**
***
Handsome, wavy-haired Julian Frank was a lawyer. He lived with his beautiful wife and two small children in exurbanite Westport, Conn., and commuted to his small office in Manhattan.

&amp;nbsp;

Fellow commuters recall that he was a first-rate bridge player but a loud, boastful sort of fellow (says one acquaintance: *""He gave me the impression of being a young man in a hurry—ambitious, driving, smart""*). Others remember that he often talked of dreaming that he would some day die in a plane crash.

&amp;nbsp;

Prior to 1960, Frank had earned about $10,000 a year. Then, he seemed to have struck it rich: he bragged of making $14,000 a month, moved out of his $20,000 home into a $45,000 house, talked almost casually of having *""dropped $600,000 in the stock market.""* He also began taking out his huge insurance policies. *""If I die,""* he told friends, *""my wife will be the richest woman in the world.""*

&amp;nbsp;

But Julian Frank had serious problems—and they were closing in on him even as he boarded the Miami-bound National plane that took him to his death. He was being harassed by a bevy of businessmen who claimed he had swindled them. Among the claims:

1. Frank had operated behind a phoney company named J. &amp; P. Factors Inc., whose only address was a mail drop

2. He had pocketed $8,025 in fees from a Phoenix firm, then reneged on his promise to raise mortgage money

3. He had bilked associates in real-estate deals out of some $40,000

4. He had swindled ""several thousand dollars"" out of businessmen who had retained him to help raise money for some Missouri hospitals.

&amp;nbsp;

At the time he died, Frank was under investigation by the FBI and the New York District Attorney, and the New York Bar Association was considering disbarment procedures against him.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**INSURANCE FIRM DISPUTES PAYMENT TO MRS FRANK**
***
In 1953, Frank's wife-to-be Janet arrived in New York City from Galesburg, Illinois as one of twenty young women chosen from 1,500 applicants to be guest editors at Mademoiselle.  This celebrated group of interns lived together for the month of June at the Barbizon Hotel for Women at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street.

&amp;nbsp;

The most celebrated member of the group was Sylvia Plath, whose novel, The Bell Jar, was published in 1963.  The novel draws largely on Plath’s Mademoiselle internship and one of its characters, Betsy, is modeled after Janet.

&amp;nbsp;

Plath arrived in New York as the winner of the fiction writing competition.  Janet was the winner of the non-fiction, for a piece she wrote based on an interview she had done with Carl Sandburg.

&amp;nbsp;

She was later discovered at the Stork Club by Eileen Ford and appeared as a model in Ladies Home Journal, Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, New Yorker, Life and Cosmopolitan.  Janet met Julian Frank while the two were volunteering for the 1956 Adlai Stevenson campaign.

&amp;nbsp;

Five months after the crash of National Flight 2511, The Occidental Life Insurance Company of California filed suit in U.S. District Court, New Haven, requesting a declaratory judgment confining its liability in Julian Frank’s death to the amount of the premiums he had paid on the $500,000 insurance policy, rather than the face amount of the policy.  The insurance company claimed that Frank “died by suicide.”

&amp;nbsp;

It is unknown as to whether Mrs Frank ever became ""the richest woman in the world"" as her husband had boasted, as the outcome of the suit appears to have been lost to the internet.

45cuv2,7,2016-02-11,[HUMOR] Brett Favre: overlooked suspect?,NotoriousBUG,MakingaMurderer,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/45cuv2/humor_brett_favre_overlooked_suspect/,"There has been a lot of talk on this subreddit about possible alternative suspects to SA.  And yes, there are plausible reasons to suspect George Zipperer, Andres Martinez, and maybe Ryan Hillegas or TH's roommate or even other members of the Avery family.  But all along, the most plausible alternative suspect has been living in the public spotlight, loved by millions of Wisconsinites and people throughout the United States.  Who's that, you ask?

BRETT FAVRE

Before you call me crazy, let's review the evidence.  By the time you'll finish this post, you will see there was motive, opportunity, and means for Favre to have committed the crime.   

1.  Motive:

The day before the murder took place, October 30, 2005, Favre experienced one of the worst games in his career, throwing 5 interceptions in a loss at Cincinnati.  He even  ""had a fan steal the ball from his hand during a futile last-minute drive.""  This must have embarrassed him to no end.  

http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=251030004

And who does an embarrassed football player blame first but his video team - staffed by none other than intern Mike Halbach.  He began working for the team on 2004 as a video intern and continues to work for the Packers today as the Director of Football Technology.  

http://www.packers.com/team/staff/Mike-Halbach/bc32b029-52e7-4e07-b172-f9580ded39f3

Favre would have been angry that next day and looking for revenge.   If he had gotten proper video preparation about the Bengals defense, perhaps he wouldn't have had one of his worst games of all time.  

Moreover, if you thought that SA was acting creepy by supposedly greeting TH while wearing only a towel, Favre's indiscretions around women rival only those of the sweaty prize.  In 2010, you may recall that a scandal broke involving Favre's inappropriate conduct toward women.  Favre -- and I am quoting here -- purportedly sent ""cock shots"" to one Jenn Sterger.   

http://deadspin.com/5603701/brett-favre-once-sent-me-cock-shots-not-a-love-story

In Favre you have an angry man with an axe to grind with Mike Halbach and a history of inappropriate conduct toward women.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what is going to happen next.  

2.  Opportunity

Favre and the Packers flew back to Wisconsin the night of 10/30/05 after that brutal loss in Cincinnati.  Mondays are almost always off days for NFL teams, which meant that Favre's day was completely wide open.  What's more, he lived in Green Bay, only 30 minutes from SA.  No would have missed him if he took a short detour to the Manitowoc area for the day.  

http://variety.com/2008/dirt/real-estalker/former-packer-brett-favre-lists-wisconsin-house-1201228438/

Furthermore, it is no stretch of the imagination that Favre may have noticed TH while visiting her brother at the team facility.  She may have been just Favre's type.  And recall that TH had a phone stalker of sorts.  Given Favre's other phone activities with attractive young women, I think it is certainly worth considering whether Favre was TH's mystery caller.   And remember - TH reportedly had a social life centered in Green Bay.  

3.  Means

This is the easiest point of all.  Who in Wisconsin would have the types of resources available like Favre did at the time. He could have bought his own smelter and sent team doctors to drug SA and take his blood to be planted.  Is it really such a stretch for someone whose whole profession is based on blood, sweat and tears?

Also, remember that Favre WAS Wisconsin back then.  Do you think for one second the police wouldn't have covered up his possible involvement?  They would be hated by all of Wisconsin if they went down that road.  Favre knew that despite all of these connections, he was untouchable in Wisconsin.  So it would not have been difficult for him to convince a few bad eggs in law enforcement to help cover his tracks.   

****

Now, I am not concluding that Favre is the killer here - that would be irresponsible.  But at least keep an open mind and realize these are stones that have never been unturned.  We can find the truth.

Here is a few things on me and I want to know if some friendly people apart of or have been apart of AU would let me know if its realistic for me:

* 3.55 Unweighted GPA / 4.13-4.33 Weighted GPA (Projected at Graduation)
* 2 Years of German / 0.5 Years of French / 2.5 Lang Overall
* All of my classes (Soph-Junior) have been Honors or AP.

* Two State Government Internships / One Campaign Internship &amp; One Local Government Internship
* PSAT Sophomore Year: 1170 [75% Percentile National] / SAT Projected: 1350 [80-85% Percentile National] (On 400-1600 Scale)

45cwlq,0,2016-02-11,Should I do an internship during my summer?,compengstudent123,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/45cwlq/should_i_do_an_internship_during_my_summer/,"To keep it short, I'm a second year computer engineering student.  I registered for a summer internship program, and I'm deciding whether I should try to get an internship (I'd need to submit my resume to companies) or just muck about the summer doing what I enjoy? I have a good GPA (3.9/4.0) and tons of experience programming.  I've been doing it for 10 years. But I feel like an intership will stress me out and hold me back, I have no idea what to do

Why i should do an internship

- I will get paid money

- I will gain experience

- I will probably get a higher paying job after graduation

- I might end up doing nothing during my summer (i.e. last summer I worked really hard for 1 month, then just did nothing for the other 3)

Why I should not do an internship

- I don't want really want to do an internship.  I feel really stressed out during my school year working 80-120 hours a week that I just need a mental break

- I'll have to wake up at 6 am every day for my whole summer for my internship! Yuck! I get to sleep and enjoy my summer (Yay)

- I get really stressed out during the school semester, and I need the summer time to just ""heal""

- I'm already a really great coder.  Working in the industry wouldn't make me better at this, but say writing a compiler this summer or another huge project might make me stand out more than others

- I want to do some theoretical math and physics this summer, for fun.  Also, I'm taking a little interest in analog and digital electronics.  I figured I could read some books this summer and do some design, especially since I've already taken basic courses in these areas

it's the type of sex that's so full of emotional baggage that it pushes your mutual sex to a whole new level.

It's the guy you dated who's a completely asshole and was a mistake from the get go.  You already broke up multiple times but here you are bouncing on his delicious cock.  You can't stand him, you fucking hate his guts but fuck you love his god damn cock buried inside you.

Here's my pitch for a few ideas that I would love to explore further.

---
**The Better Man**:

I heard a lot about you over the years.  First it was the brilliant new junior coworker that's was working with my husband full of potential and promise.  Then slowly over time as you rose in the ranks it turned from what a great new employee we have to what 'that guy' did, to the 'prick' as he fondly referred to you.  You rose faster then anyone at the company.  My husband is a few years older then me, he's 35 years old.  Now, his once former intern of 25 years is the CEO favorite and is likely to be running the company in a few years.  Jason can't fucking stand you and I.. well I barely met you but frankly I'm just fucking tired of hearing him whine about it.  

I just had a fight with Jason and I'm annoyed with him as it is.  I'm wearing a tight fitting little red dress a few inches shorter then what I'd normally wear at work events.  We're all at the work Christmas party as I finally meet 'Marcus'.  A brilliant young man with a radiant smile who bright eyes that seems to take in everything and everyone in the room yet still are able to rapidly roam over my body and leaving me feeling like he's taken in every inch of my body and approves thoroughly of my gym membership and the work I've been putting into it.

At the same time, I can feel the animosity between Jason and Marcus.  

                              . . . 

A few hours later in the VIP lounge that's empty except for the two of us. My dress is in pieces feeling his mouth on my body, roughly handling me and he calls me a little whore and respond in kind.  Our hot sweaty bodies pressed against one another as he finally pins me against the large glass wall over looking the party.  His young powerful cock slamming into my married pussy fucking me as I look down on the large gathering.. somewhere down there my own husband is looking for me as I'm betraying him.....I can feel Marcus hate for Jason....each thrust making me moan and  beg for more.  Each time I hear him call my husband a waste of space, a worthless prick as he's slamming into me again and again.  Pulling my hair, spanking my ass... he's hurting me and the pain is blissful to both of us.

Hours later... several orgasms later I look at Marcus' naked body.... mmmmm, I don't personally hate him...though he's a cocky little fuck.  One thing I know for sure.  I want him to hate Jason as much as he wants especially if he continues to fuck me like that.  I get up on the conference table spreading my legs for him inviting him in for another go.....

Anyone interested in continuing these story lines?  Fair warning, I probably won't have more then an hour or two to play, but I'll be back in the evening if this peaks anyone's interests                              "

Today on ""offer day"" I had several offers. I accepted one and declined the others by replying to my internship coordinator's email. However, we were told it's a good idea to email the places that offered an internship to us even if we didn't take it (being thankful, keeping doors open and all that).

To someone who may be receiving an email like this: what is appropriate? I am not sure how to communicate *""Thanks for the offer. I chose a different place, but your company seemed cool too. If this internship is terrible, maybe I'll see you in a couple years!""*.

I live in a mid-sized Canadian city, so the tech sector isn't that big here. I need to keep up a good professional reputation. I'm just not sure how much is needed here in the eyes of the cs world.

45dz44,9,2016-02-12,Struggles of motivation with an unsupportive family,Pnw91,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/45dz44/struggles_of_motivation_with_an_unsupportive/,"This is a post I put up last weekend. I deleted it originally because I get weird about the internet but after receiving a few requests for it to be reposted I decided I would. Here it goes: 
So in all honesty- I spent the ages 12-19 drinking and doing drugs on the daily, getting expelled from school, detained and barely making it out of high school. I ended up on my death bed at age 19 (heroin, kidney failure, waking pneumonia) and made the choice to get clean. Mainly because I had no other options besides dying. My logic was to try being clean, and if became unbearable, I would just kill myself and get it over with.


Since then, after had watching my parents beg me to stay alive, I have worked tirelessly for six years trying to make it up to my parents and trying to be someone they would be proud of. I spent two years rebuilding my relationship with my siblings, rebuilding my credit, making amends to my mom… All of these things were worth it in the end. 
I found my love of medicine, science, humanities, etc. I pushed myself from starting in math 20 to being in calculus 2, getting high marks, having three jobs, 700 hours of community service- all the loops to jump for medical school. 


I was recently accepted into a medical internship out of state. I texted my dad to tell him- and he didn’t respond. He doesn’t respond a lot to be honest. And apparently he told my mom “I’m proud of her but I’m not interested in being apart of her future endeavors”.
Which feels like a blow to my spirit. I mean, a big part of me staying clean, missing out on my 21st birthday, going to narcotics anonymous meetings, sponsoring people, volunteering on committee boards for treatment centers- being fucking insane and miserable and happy all at once- I wanted it in hopes to one day feel good enough for my dad. 

I wanted something to show for the misery of my family, contributing to something greater then themselves; something that would grow into the pursuit of helping others, and making a difference. I wanted to find a way to live in optimism, to find something that would give me hope and drive me to have a meaning to my life.
I felt badly because he wasted his life raising me, in the closet, then coming out- working all day and night to pay child support… And now he wants to…? I feel like he is trying to retire from me. 


I should note that I didn’t make these ideas from thin air. I have been subject to numerous discussions growing up in which I was told that the second the court order is up, he will finally feel “free”. 
I have always felt like a big mistake to them; a product of fear based choices made in order to avoid the inevitability of broken denial and post traumatic families. It’s not hard to come to these conclusions when you see that your parents are sad all the time, and to hear them say they wish they made better choices for themselves.
However, I am also well aware of my lunatic, inner turmoil that grows from the seeds of self centered fear. And I know that it’s not my responsibility to take on their fears and regrets. 


My motivation hasn’t necessarily died to continue. But I do feel like I have a lot less tolerance for bullshit, and trying to make them happy. I am annoyed to know that there is nothing I can do to fix the regret he speaks of in regards to his decisions leading up to parenthood. 
I'm still going to try to get into medical school, and if I don't succeed in that, I will find something better. I'm not going to give up on trying to live with some integrity and defiance to accepting the normalities of mediocrity. I'm not devastated, suicidal, or cynical like those I grew up with anymore.

And so now I’m here."

I am working on a web application designed for registering, matching, and initiating contact between internships and interns. I am a novice in the world of algorithms, but very eager to lean. 

I have browsed the vast quantities of wiki article concerning sorting and matching algorithms, and watched a handful of youtubers explaining them. So far I have not found the matching algorithm I am looking for, and thought to myself, “I bet Reddit can help me out”.

I need to find an algorithm for matching a pool (2-300 users) consisting of interns and internships. I do not have an equal amount of interns and internships, thus the reason for using an algorithm, is the need to make sure I am matching as many pairs as possible (for this part: quantity over quality). 

* Each internship has registered data describing geographic region / business sector / internship time period. 

* Each intern has registered wishes concerning one or more geographic regions / business sectors, and an internship time period.

If anyone have a suggestion for what matching algorithm, I could use for this task, it would be very much appreciated. 

Thanks!

I work in plant research at a university and my principal investigator (boss) is giving me an ultimatum that I need to answer by Monday. 

The backstory is that I have a significant other and we have been dating for two years. She just got accepted into graduate school (3-5 hours away from where we currently live depending on which school she accepts) and I also applied to graduate school, but have not heard anything back. I am afraid that I might not get accepted. This was really my only opportunity to get out of my current job and allow me to move with her. I work in a really renown facility, not only for my university, but also for the the U.S. in plant genetics.

My principal investigator wants me to start a new position (not new title, same pay) that allows me to have more responsibility over my previous position. He just found a new candidate that could replace me for the job he wants me to do. He wants to talk to me on Monday and he wants me to give him a decision if I am going to leave post August, which assumes that I'm going to go live with my girlfriend. I have no idea if I give him the decision to leave , if I don't find employment before August, I will be out of a job. Also, I want to continue applying for my M.S. degree and am not sure how unemployment will affect that situation.

I know that my significant other is the person I want to be with for the rest of my life and don't want to lose her from long distance relations. We tried long distance this summer because of her internship and it wasn't too hard because I knew she was coming back 3 months later. She is going to get her PhD and that means she will be in another state for 6 years. 

I'm not sure if I can handle a long distance relationship. Also, I've explored the options of staying at my job and reapplying for an M.S. degree, but if my relationship fails because of staying where I am currently, I'll be torn for a very long time. I know how distance and time change people, and when others are apart they grow separately.

Also, I hate the place I am living in. I have been here for 6 years (undergrad and 2 years post grad) and I cannot stand this city/town. It's so boring and I'm I don't want to spend this finite amazing life in a shitty place where I can't enjoy the opportunities in other great cities like the University of Minnesota or Wisconsin-Madison, where I would be going.

If you could please give me some type of advice, or some insight on how to look at this, it would be much appreciated. Being caught between love and a career really makes it hard to think logically."

We've had difficult times but managed to get through. We have been living together for 1.5y. 



I feel extremely anxious and am afraid of this relationship coming to an end. He is my first LTR, and I love him to the moon and back. I've never been so emotionally invested in a relationship. 


I don't really have any reason to be worried, he says he loves me all the time, he compliments me and he is very sweet (even though he is having a hard time at work and his libido is a bit down). 


However, I've always been quite unsecure emotionally. My mother left my father for my step-father (she was cheating) when I was 8. She cheated on my step-father multiple times but is still with him to the date. When I was 16, my step-father and I got into an argument (about a stupid thing), and he told my mother to choose between him and I. My mother immediately told me to pack my stuff, I did and went to my father's. 

I think it all adds up and I have some difficulties when it comes to trusting people. 



I really struggle with the fact that our relationship could end so easily. I am terrified by the fact that he could get bored and ""abandon"" me. I don't feel this way all the time but when I do I'm terrified and I feel helpless for at least a few days. He has a loving family and had quite the perfect childhood (he says so himself) and doesn't seem to understand what I mean when I try to explain him how I feel.


Does anyone else have a similar experience? How do you deal with it? 


**EDIT**: My **BF and I nearly broke up a few times**. Here are the details : 

- First time: Early in the relation he had to leave for an internship abroad, than I had to leave for my bachelor's degree (been apart 9months and spent 5months together in between our stays abroad). When I went back he thought about breaking up because being together felt ""weird"". I was really sad and asked him to let us some time. He did and everything was fine again.

- Second time: He had a really hard time at the university and wanted to do something totally different. He was depressed and wanted to start everything over. He told me that he wanted to break up because he wasn't sure about anything anymore and he wasn't sure that he still loved me, I cried and said OK. The day after he came back, I was happy and everything was fine but he did the same thing again during the week. We decided to take a break and breathe a bit. I thought that it was the end and that he didn't want to tell me it was over.I spent a lot of time with my friends and I went to parties nearly every night in order to feel a bit better. I met a guy who was nice and interested, we went on a date. A week later my BF and I met and he told me that he loved me and wanted to stay with me. We went back together and I stopped seeing the other guy (we just went on a date and nothing happened).

- Third: a few weeks later it's the same thing again, he tells me that he is not sure, that he feels bad and want to spend some time alone. I am really sad but we don't have any time to talk about it: I'm in pain and I have to go to the hospital. I am pregnant (not wanted, I was taking the pill and I did not forget it, it was just bad luck). He is incredibly happy, I am shocked. We decide to think about our relation later. Something like 2 weeks later I have a miscarriage. However he is now sure that he wants to stay with me.

- Fourth: two months after our ""big crisis"" the other guy texted me and we spent some time texting each other. I have a crush on him and I'm not sure to be in love with my BF anymore. I decide to stop texting him, and to stay with my BF, at least to be sure of my feelings. It was nothing but a crush, and I still love my BF. I NEVER told him about my doubts, I wanted to be certain about wanting to break up before. Finally, he has never known about it.

   
**tl;dr**: The idea of my relationship ending terrifies me and I don't know how to deal with it. "
45f302,165,2016-02-12,"Me [27/F] with my former classmate [25/F], classmate angry I was offered a job she interned for",wtfclassmate,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/45f302/me_27f_with_my_former_classmate_25f_classmate/,"I just graduated with my masters degree in school counseling. There were maybe 20 of us in the counseling cohort and three or four of us in the specific school counseling track who graduated this past December. We started school in fall of 2013 and took all our classes together so we all kind of grew together and leaned on each other. We were required to intern for 600 hours at two local schools in order to obtain our degree and our license. My classmate, who we will call Angie, was assigned to a school at which the counselor was set to go on maternity leave. She announced this to all of us in August, telling us she was officially offered the interim job in the counselor's absence. 

In December, we were about to graduate and I didn't have any job prospects. So a friend of mine, who we will call Mary, told me a local charter school was looking for substitute teachers. She works at the school as an interventionist and put in a good word for me. I accepted a substitute teaching job. 

Last week (Friday), the business manager of the school approached me and asked if I would be interested in interviewing for the open interim counselor position. She saw that I graduated with my degree in counseling and figured I would be interested. I said that if the position was still open I would love to apply for it. The business manager set up an interview for me with the school director, the current pregnant counselor, and the principal. I was offered the job on the spot. I accepted. Angie and I aren't really close, but I didn't want to 1) rub it in and be a jerk or 2) out her in a lie or a misunderstanding to our classmates. So my excited Facebook status was vague and did not name the school. 

On Monday, Angie texted me and asked where I got the job. I decided I was going to be honest with her and tell her which school. If the school hadn't already told her she didn't get the job, I figured that wasn't on me. So I just told her the truth. She asked me if I was certain I wasn't being interviewed for the sub job, and I confirmed that they asked me specifically about my counseling experience. She texted me back with ""congrats"" and that's it. I couldn't tell if she was being snarky or sincere so I ignored it. 

On Tuesday, at 5am, Angie texted me the following:

""I really appreciate you going behind my back and pulling some bullshit like this. That's awesome! Just remember karma is a bitch. So good luck with that!""

I responded calmly and told her that I was sorry she was upset, but I didn't do anything wrong. I told her that if she wanted to ask about her interview or application or job status, she needed to contact the principal, the business manager, the pregnant counselor, or the school director. Angie removed me from Facebook and all other social media outlets, so I blocked her number after that. 

My concerns: I'm afraid that she's going to spread rumors about me to the other students in the cohort. We were a very small and tight knit group and we planned to use each other as connections and references in the future. I don't want to jeopardize those relationships because Angie is mad. I am also afraid that Angie will spread lies about me to other employers. She's the type who would do something like that. I don't know how to respond when people ask me about her, because I'm at the school she interned at. I usually just say something like ""I'm not sure what she's up to now"" or ""she spoke really highly of the school."" I know I didn't do anything wrong in applying for and accepting a job I was offered, but do I need to do anything to protect myself? Should I let it go and not say anything to the cohort? I feel like I can't talk to any of them anymore and I feel really isolated.

Hi everyone. Things have taken an unexpected turn in my life recently, and it has made me rethink how I want to proceed. Since I come here so often, and since I feel very comfortable sharing my feelings here, I figured I'd let everyone know and hopefully get some advice.

I'm in my final year of university, and last week I was offered a research position for the summer by one of my Computer Science professors. My GPA is pretty bad, so I hadn't even bothered applying for internships yet, never mind consider what I'd do if I got a research position. But I'm very good programming and design, and this class is all about it, so I've done exceptionally well so far. I was absolutely blown away when he offered; it felt amazing that someone as smart as my professor decided to take a leap of faith and put his trust in me to do research with him.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around it; some people I know would *kill* to be in the position I'm in. I can't go into too much detail, but luckily the research I'll be doing is in a growing field and is something I'm passionate about and truly enjoy. My professor is also one of few innovators in the field and is well known. One of my problems was that when I first started using opiates, or really drugs in general, my passion for reading, programming and doing computer science work dwindled considerably. But this past week my enthusiasm for computer science has made a resurgence; I'm reading research papers in the field I'll be researching and staying on top of my work too.

I've been clean from dope for 10 days. I've just been using subs as usual. My sub doctor is really happy that I've been pissing clean. But what's even stranger is that I haven't had a desire to use -- I've passed up three separate chances to buy dope when my middle offered, and finally told my middle and dealer the other day that I'm quitting.

Quitting. It's a scary thought. I prefer to think of it as a sort of lengthy hiatus. I tell myself I can always go back to shooting dope and that there will always be dope in the world. But right now I feel like I have too much to lose to justify any continued use.

I love this sub, and I've been around for a while at this point. I think about a year, give or take. And in that time I progressed from using oxy a few times a month to shooting heroin every day for as long as I could afford it. But I love it here! So I don't intend to stop posting here even though this might be it for me and opiates, at least for a while.

If anyone has any questions feel free to PM me or ask in the comments. I'm still depressed and anxious but I know I'll get better the longer I stay off dope. Just taking it one day at a time. I still get cravings but I can handle them. It's mostly the loneliness that I need to work on. I've been dating this girl (who doesn't know about my addiction) and now that I'm clean I think I'll try to take it to the next level with her. I'm also going to try to get the friends that I lost when I was deep into using back. If you read this far, thank you for reading :)

TL;DR - Got a research job for the summer doing research I love with a professor who likes me, my interest in computer science has been reinvigorated and I don't have a strong desire to do dope anymore even though I'm still sad."

I’ve had lots of advice and perspectives and I appreciate all of it - even (especially) the ones that don’t reflect favourably on me.*


*Just a couple of notes to begin:*


*1) Plenty of details have been changed, because I do not want to risk this getting out, even though the chance is incredibly small.*

*2) This post covers a lot more time than the others, so I broke it up by date.*

*3) Most of the dialogue and stuff is (obviously) fabricated, but it is all based as closely as possible on my memories and some notes I made.*

*4) If you want to skip to some semi-wild-going then start from Tuesday 24th November.*

*5) If you want to skip to the ‘proper’ wild-going then start at Wednesday 16th December, and then scroll until you see a bunch of Xs.*


**Saturday 14th, and Sunday 15th November**


So it’s hard to know exactly how to pick up again. I felt a bit all over the place after our second catch up. Part of me felt fine, as though I had successfully compartmentalised everything by putting a more official end to it, but there was another part of me that was looking back and flipping out about everything. You know when you have a busy few days, and it feels like a lot longer than it actually was afterwards? Well over the weekend after our second meeting, the previous 7 or 8 days felt like months. Ben and I were staying with friends, and it was hard to keep a straight face all the time, like I was trying to hide being drunk or something.


Well, I think I might be going a bit far. I was mostly processing everything fine, but there was just a little bit of me that wasn’t. Mainly because of the great big elephant in my head, the one thing that I just could not bring myself to think about: the moment where I had stroked Izzy’s face with my thumb. It made me feel sick thinking about it. Not in a disgusted way, just in a really queasy way, like I was lurching all over the place. That tiny moment wasn’t sex, or even sexual, it was just me being intimate with another person. A *girl*. Honestly, I just forced it out of my head. I think I forced myself to forget about it ‘accidentally-on-purpose’ because it was too much to think about. Anyway, on that Sunday evening I had the bizarre experience of sneaking my lingerie into the washing machine without Ben seeing, which felt really weird, and which probably led to the next thing:


**Monday 16th November**


I mentioned on a comment last time that I actually ended up having a really weird dream about Izzy on the Sunday night/Monday morning before going to work. I dreamed that we were actually married to each other, but that I was cheating on her with Ben and wondering if I was straight. It was really short and nothing happened in it, but the idea of it was unsettling. After I got up I felt pretty messed up for the whole morning. I don’t know exactly what it was, but I think I was struggling with it all because it wasn’t just a one-off anymore. I’d had gay oral sex - twice. The second time I had kind of been the one to make it happen too. Not to mention the thing I still wasn’t thinking about…


Looking back I don’t think I felt weird because I felt gay, but I felt weird because I didn’t know if I was *supposed* to feel gay. I know lots of people will say things like ‘oh don’t label yourself’ and things like that, but when it happens to you it’s really hard not to.


I kept having those weird little flashback moments again too, and the one that kept replaying in my brain was Izzy knelt right between my thighs, looking up at me and asking ‘Do you want me to?’, followed by a nod from me. Such a simple question and a simple answer. I think it bothered me because it really got the core of the ‘problem’ for me: I had wanted to do it. I was given a choice and chose to do it. Whenever I stopped doing something else I would mentally drift back to the room and see her awestruck face looking between my legs while I pulled my skirt up, and my stomach would just turn. Kind of like when you remember something really embarrassing you did, even though I wasn’t actually embarrassed by it.


Anyway that first Monday back at work helped enormously. It’s really nice to go to work and see that everyone else is still super busy and the world doesn’t actually revolve around you. So I started to feel a lot better by Monday evening and the whole dream-weirdness was starting to fade anyway. Interestingly, I wasn’t terrified of being near Izzy’s desk or anything that Monday, and all my problems seemed to be internal.


**Tuesday 17th November**


On Tuesday morning, despite my minor inner conflicts, I was not anxious about seeing Izzy at all. I got into work and she was actually already there. It was totally normal. She had some thin cycling gloves crumpled up next to her on the desk while she ate a biscuit with a cup of tea and went over her calendar. I kind of had to suppress a happy giggle at how ‘standard Izzy’ she looked. It was really comforting in an odd way. We smiled at each other and said hello and it was really nice. Really nice to see the person I could share the weirdness with again. It’s so funny to me how completely different it was to a week before.


The previous week I had been agonising over every little detail before I met her again. But that day it was all completely fine. All the angst and everything was just with me and what/who I was, not with Izzy. I did spend a lot of time looking at her out of the corner of my eye though, and trying to sneak longer glances when I could. Like last time I think I was just trying to gauge my own reaction. Still kind of murky really. I didn’t feel conventionally attracted to her, but at the same time she was nice to look at because of how… I don’t know, ‘nice-to-look-at’ she is. I’m hesitant to say ‘attractive’ because I really don’t know if it’s the same thing, but… Gah! I really don’t know. I kind of just go round in circles in my head thinking about it.


Anyway... That day at work went fine. My company really hots up in the run-up to Christmas so we were all kept occupied with our projects. For reference our first meeting had been on the 6th of November and the second had been on the 13th of November.


That evening I felt way better on my way home. It’s hard to describe but I think it’s because seeing Izzy and being at work reassured me that the world wasn’t ending, and that all of reality had not actually been completely turned upside down. Ben and I cooked dinner together with some wine and I just felt really comfortable and close to him. I think it was about that moment that I started just accepting it. I started to accept that it just was what it was. No one had died. Nothing had exploded. Some truly weird stuff had happened but the world was still okay, so maybe I should letting it define everything. For the record, when you’ve always had no trouble accepting yourself it’s really super easy to take it for granted. Having that little luxury taken away for a few days really threw things into perspective for me. I have a lot of respect for people who deal with those kind of issues on a larger scale.


**Wednesday 18th, and Thursday 19th November**


By Wednesday morning I think I was more or less ‘good’ again. I’m not going to go with the super long blow by blow account like last time, but in a nutshell: everything was okay. I waited until Thursday to book a meeting room for our catch up (white films definitely all removed from doors!) because I didn’t want it to be awkward if I did it while Izzy was in, but I actually felt okay about it otherwise.


**Friday 20th November**


Friday morning rolled around and everything was still okay. The week had gone a lot faster than the one before it because I hadn’t been constantly second guessing everything. I had a brief flip-floppy moment where I couldn’t figure out what I wanted to wear again, but I settled on a nice dress. No holdups, no lacy lingerie panties.


That day, everything was just very normal. I was unsurprisingly a little on edge about the catch up, but I was sure in my mind that nothing would happen. Also I was on my period at that point (sorry if TMI!) so funny business was off the cards for that reason anyway. Nonetheless it felt good to be really busy for most of the morning, and when it came time to do the catch-up my brain was all business. I stood up and smiled at Izzy and we both strolled over to the room, sat down inside and had a quiet moment. We both smiled at each other and after a moment Izzy said something like 'So, is this okay?', I just laughed and nodded and gestured to the now clear window and we both started giggling a bit. I was just really happy that neither of us felt like we had to take it too seriously.


We had plenty of small talk, because I think we both find the other interesting conversation, and I'm just super chatty anyway, but to be honest the meeting was totally normal and productive. Definitely no weird tension or anything else. I was kind of curious to see if she had brought anything along in her bag, and I'm sure she was equally curious about what I was wearing under my dress, but we both just let it lie. Sorry to disappoint anyone with that super normal Friday!


**Saturday 21st, and Sunday 22nd November**


Over the weekend, I felt sooo much better about everything. Like I had overcome some kind of challenge I had set myself, which I guess I had. It had been pretty much the longest two weeks of my whole life, and I finally felt like it was behind me. My relationship with Ben was really normal, and everything settled back to more or less where it should have been. But it's not like it got erased from history or anything, and I still thought about it all quite a lot.


**Monday 23rd November**


When Monday came around I found myself thinking a lot more about Izzy than I had expected to. I was at work and the nervousness and weirdness had mostly gone, but I still kept thinking about her. Just random stuff, like the sound of her voice, the kinds of things she says, her smile and her body language. I know *exactly* how all that sounds, but it wasn't really like a crush (I think). Just kind of a mild obsession with this person who represented a crazy thing in my life. Then again I don't really know. I mean, the line has to blur at some point right? This is where I start to run in circles in my head again…


**Tuesday 24th November**


Tuesday was pretty much the same, only Izzy was in the office so it was definitely more interesting. She had her hair pulled back in a ponytail which kept reminding me of ‘the first time’. I kept stealing glances at her like I had done the previous week, hoping to feel something (either way) to just answer the questions in my brain. At one point when she came over to ask me a question the sun light went straight through her loose black shirt and I could make out her whole figure, including the bottoms of her boobs. I really hope I didn't gawp but to be honest I don't know. I didn’t know if I was excited because it was a surprise, or because I wanted to see more. Either way it was apparent to me that Izzy was still kind of lodged pretty firmly in my brain. I often wondered if she thought about me as much as I thought about her.


To her credit, she was still being awesome about everything. She really is such a cool person, always level headed and mature about everything, but not in a boring way. I don't know, it's just hard to feel like a real grown-up when she's there because she seems so self-possessed. I think it bugs me because I’m older than her, have more professional experience than her, and am her line manager… But then again, the age difference isn’t huge and she’s had a lot of life experiences that I haven’t, so looking at it rationally I shouldn’t expect her to ‘seem’ younger than me.


Okay I’m just rambling again now. Basically, despite my (mostly successful) attempts to just let everything go, there was still a part of me that needed to define how I felt about Izzy. All of that kind of came to a head later that day.


So, that evening (for reference: 1 week and four days after our second ‘meeting’) I was home alone as Ben was in another city with his friends. It's super rare that I decide to have a slobby night or anything, but I felt like it a bit that night, so I didn't do anything productive and just had some wine in slouchy clothes with the TV on. Problem was, that my brain was still working on the ‘Izzy problem’. It probably sounds like she was in my every waking thought, but I think I might be overdoing it a bit. I just kept reverting to her when I wasn't specifically concentrated on something else, so when I was drinking wine in front of the TV, I really couldn't shake it.


Right then I decided to do something to kick it all out of my head. Writing usually helps me do that, even though I usually don't do it very much, so I decided to start writing some stuff down about everything, seeing as Ben wasn't about. So I got my laptop and started writing up brief-notes like the bullets for a report on everything that had happened (I write reports in my job so it's kind of my natural format now). Those notes eventually became my first post by the way. I probably spent about an hour and a half on it when I only meant to spend about ten minutes, and I didn't realise until I looked at the clock and saw the time and had a tiny freak out, like '*Mind this doesn’t go too far Helen*'. But there was a pretty simple reason I had spent so much time on it. It had been so exciting to relive it on the page. Just writing the notes out felt so bad, like admitting it had actually happened all over again. Notes like “*Helen begins walking back to office; notices wetness on her thighs due to arousal*”, “*After manipulating sexual fluids on Helen's leg, Izzy begins performing oral sex on her*”. So weird I know, but that's just how I wrote it.


And so I was sat on the floor in front of my sofa at half past nine, reading back what I had written. I started to read through it all point, going through everything in my memory, and pretty quickly I noticed myself squirming around. I stopped dead straight away, but the feeling was unmistakable. ‘*Oh shit*,’ I thought, *’I’m really horny*’. I just sat there, on the floor not looking at my laptop. There was this voice saying ‘*It’s the wine, delete it all and go to bed*’. Honestly I nearly did. But then I thought about reading more and I got this needy, tensing feeling between my legs and I knew I had to keep going.


I kept clenching and squirming my thighs as I read about what Izzy and I had done, in the third person. The surprise, the ad hoc plans, the second guessing, the tension, the excitement, the pleasure, and all the fluids... Oh god. After a few minutes I got to the end, and I was desperately turned on. I knew exactly what was going to happen next, and I had no intention of stopping it. I checked to make sure the curtains were closed, and set my laptop down next to me. Then without really thinking too much about it, I lifted my bum off the carpet just enough to slide my bottoms and panties all the way down to my ankles in one smooth motion. My panties came away with a strand of wetness that broke and stuck to my leg, and any resolve I had fizzled away. I lifted one leg out, laid back against the sofa, and opened my bare legs. My heart was racing, and I was loving it.

I closed my eyes and just let all the images of Izzy rush back into my head, while my I let my hand slowly move down my thigh from my knee. It's kind of weird to admit to people other than myself, but I was absolutely imagining it as Izzy's hand from the first time. Everything felt so vivid. The carpet was rough on my skin, and the air felt cool against my lips. Eventually I stopped denying with myself and started gently rubbing two fingers either side of my outer lips. As I gently forced them to rub up against each other, I could feel how slippery and wet I had gotten. Nothing compared to what I had been like with Izzy obviously, but so much wetter than I had gotten by myself before.


I kept on like that, and it just felt amazing. I've never felt so excited while masturbating before, and I wasn't even really doing it yet. I kept thinking about the first time I'd freaked out about doing this almost a couple of weeks ago, and how completely calm and deliberate I was being now. I was sitting on the floor half naked with a glass of wine, touching my pussy while I thought about a girl.


Then I did it. I slipped my finger gently between my lips, and slid it up through my cum to my clit. Oh my god the pleasure was just instantaneous. I started sliding up and down straight away and I could feel it building immediately. My legs were jittering, and I thought about Izzy sitting there next to me with her hand between them, and I really really wished it was *her* doing it instead of me. And then I locked up and started trembling, and I had a really quiet, shuddery orgasm on the floor by the sofa. I savoured every second of it by thinking about her hands and mouth, and it just felt so good. Such a release.


I spent the next couple of minutes just slowly stroking myself with my eyes closed, kind of smearing my fingers over my vulva. With the heating on and the red wine, I think I may have actually nodded off very briefly. In any case, I kind of woke up from it a few minutes later, just sat there half naked with the tv still on. It felt... weird. Weird because maybe for the first time I actually didn't feel all freaked out by it. When I look back, I think this is the point at which I started to accept that my self-identity had shifted, even if it was just a little bit. It definitely helped that Ben wasn’t home so I could devote some time to figuring it out in private. The pre-Izzy me seemed to be someone else, and this new Helen was exactly the same but with a little twist. Probably not technically entirely ‘straight’, but definitely not gay, and not even bi either really. Whatever it was, I felt okay with it. I definitely didn't feel gay or bi, I just felt like my sexuality had grown a weird offshoot from my fascination with Izzy and what we had done. I hadn’t cum while thinking of Izzy because she was a *girl*, but just because of our shared history.


After a while I switched everything off, brushed my teeth, and went to bed (still half naked). I slept like a baby.


**Wednesday 25th November - to - Tuesday 15th December**


And that was that for a little while. Izzy and I would still have our little smirky moments in the office, and we still got on very well, but things finally seemed to be simmering down. I finally stopped stressing over my sexuality, Ben and I were good, and everything was just going fine. The only difference was that occasionally (maybe the equivalent of once or twice a week), I'd feel 'the urge' and slip off to the bathroom at home and get myself off. It would just hit me in the middle of cooking dinner, or reading a book, or talking with Ben, and I'd have to say ‘Hold that thought for a moment,’ and excuse myself. A quick trip to the bathroom, lock the door, one foot on the toilet lid and a hand on the sink, other hand under my skirt, panties to side, forty seconds of fast, sticky rubbing, followed by a satisfying, trembly orgasm. Then back out and ‘Sorry, you were saying?’


So that was my life for the next three weeks. I made a point of not talking to Izzy about *any* of this, and that seemed to be going fine. We were very friendly - friendlier than we would otherwise have been - but still definitely professional. We were about part way through December and everything seemed to be staying the same. My work was going well, and Izzy's project was going well too. She was a little worn out because commitments outside her internship were playing merry hell with her schedule, but she was still upbeat and positive about everything.


**Wednesday 16th December**


I guess the next chapter started on a Wednesday morning in the middle of December. I woke up early from what I think was just a miscellaneous sex dream, and straight away I felt really in the mood. I almost never have sex dreams, so it was kind of exciting to be honest. I lay there kind of squirming around for a bit before I decided I'd have to do something about it. I looked over at Ben and he was still asleep (or so I thought) so I got out of bed and went to the bathroom. I turned on the shower, but it can take a while to heat up. So... I squatted down on the balls of my feet, one hand on the sink to keep myself steady, slipped my hand under my shorts and panties, and wasted no time in trying to get myself off.


About twenty seconds later though, there was a brisk knock on the door that threw me off my game *really* hard. I tore my hand out of my panties and nearly fell over. I kind of fumbled for a moment, but then Ben said sorry for disturbing me, and asked if I could pass him his diary (I still don't know why he insists on organising his schedule on the toilet). My heart was racing with the suddenness of it, but I started giggling quietly to myself. So silly. I wiped my fingers on my leg, unlocked the door, and handed him the diary from around it, sticking my tongue out at him playfully before closing the door again. The moment was kind of gone to be honest. I just figured I'd see to it later. Also the water was hot by that point so I stripped off and hopped in the shower.


I went to work feeling a little 'frustrated' but otherwise okay. Work was pretty normal, the only other thing to mention was that I forgot my gym clothes which was annoying because I regularly go to my gym after work. Izzy was on good form that day, and we had a nice chat over lunch (all very safe for work as it was in the cafe downstairs!). After work I went home to pick up my gym stuff and then headed off for a workout. Only to find that my gym was closed for some emergency maintenance. I was super annoyed. I hate feeling like I've wasted time usually, and it was really irritating. I just went home rather than find somewhere else for a one-off, because Ben was cooking dinner and I didn't want to make him wait.


After dinner I mooched around for a while, but still really felt the need to do something. I get these weird jitters in my legs sometimes when I'm in bed, and it always feels like I need to use them. Also I'd been forced to cancel a few gym trips recently, so I was determined to do something. Then it hit me that my office building actually has a near 24hr gym and pool in it. Never actually been there before because I already had a membership at a gym I like more, but Izzy said she used it occasionally and it was pretty decent. Plus, our office cards automatically get you free entry during off peak hours (timings really aren’t great). So I stuck my swimming stuff in a bag and got ready to head out. It was actually pretty late by this point, and Ben thought I was joking when I said I was going to the office, but he knows what I'm like when I feel the need to exercise so he let me go with just a little bit of teasing.


By the time I parked and got inside it was pretty late, like about ten to eleven. I swiped myself into the gym section and started trying to find my way around. There wasn't anyone on the desk and there was a sign that said members only after 9pm. I walked past the gym area and there were only like two people in it. Eventually I got to the pool area. It was all fully lit up with big glass doors leading to it, and there was a plastic clock and a sign that said it would be locked up at midnight. No problem. I went in and it was actually a pretty decent size. There was a big sign that said there's no life guard on duty, but there were two other people in it so I wasn't completely alone. I went to the changing area through a door off to one side and got ready. Pretty standard black swimming costume with a super sexy swimming cap and a pair of goggles. I put my stuff in a locker and took a quick shower before heading out and diving into the pool.


It was definitely just what I needed. I used to swim a lot when I was younger, so it's always nice to get back in the pool and really thrash it to burn off some energy. After about forty minutes or so I felt like I had gotten it out of my system, and I didn't want to be around when they came to lock it up, so I hopped out and noticed that I was almost alone, there was just one other person and she was already walking to the changing room. I had another quick shower by the pool and went to get changed. The changing room is fairly big. It's like a wide L-shaped corridor with benches in the middle, and some cubicles at the far end. I rounded the corner and the other woman was getting her stuff out of a locker. Mine was a couple of metres away from hers but it was fine. I'm pretty used to communal changing facilities and that kind of thing really doesn’t bother me. I unlocked my locker, grabbed my stuff, and started pulling off my cap and goggles.


As I pulled off my goggles I kind of turned to the side. I know everyone probably saw this coming... But oh my holy shit. It was Izzy. The other woman was Izzy. She had been in the pool with me all along. Fuck.


She was pulling her fingers through her hair when we kind of made eye contact and both came to a screeching halt. Stood there looking at her, it was kind of crazy to me that I hadn't recognised her. It was her firm, slightly curvy figure exactly. Her cyclist’s legs looked strong and toned, her stomach muscles showed just a little, and I could just about make out her nipples pressed against her wet swimming costume (also black). I had never imagined her in a swimming costume before, but if I had I would have imagined it just like this. Her hair was kind of wild and a little damp, but it was still dark blonde and wavy. Her eyes were wide and blue, and her mouth was open a bit in surprise. I'm sure mine must have been too. My brain just went '*Shiiiiiiiiit*'. I really had not been ready for this.


She was the one to break the few seconds of silence and just said 'Oh wow. Helen. I had absolutely no idea that was you'. I was still shell shocked, but managed to say 'Um. Yeah, me neither. I mean, that it was you'. We both started laughing a bit. I must have looked so weird. My hair's really fine, so it does all kinds of stupid things when I take hats and caps off and stuff. 'How come you're here so late?' I asked. She said 'Oh it just makes sense for my schedule really, plus it's free obviously. I come here pretty regularly at this time actually'. I recalled her actually saying the exact same thing before, and I know about her sometimes-crazy schedule, so it made complete sense. But my mind was still kind of blown by the coincidence, so it all seemed crazy.


'What about you?' she asked. I snapped out of my mini daze and said 'Uh, my normal gym was closed when I went earlier, but I felt the need you know?'. She nodded. 'Do you do a lot of swimming?' I asked. I have no idea why I asked that but I think I was still a bit loopy from the surprise and was just putting out desperate small talk. 'I do at the moment I guess, because it’s convenient' she said, 'You?'. It took me a moment to realise she asked me a question. 'Er, yeah. I mean, sometimes. I used to do it more'.


I just thought '*What is wrong with you Helen? This is not a big deal*'. But for some reason it definitely was. All I could think about was how crazy our relationship was. Were both stood there acting super casual. I could see her talk, and hear her words, and reply about mundane stuff like swimming. But at the same time I was like '*This girl has rubbed her face up against my vagina. And I came on it. Twice*'. Then I’d try and reply to her question while my brain was saying ‘*I think about you when I touch myself*’. I was prepared to sweep all that under the rug at work, but not when taken by surprise like this. I must have looked pretty flustered, because I really felt it. But I was excited as well. It occurred to me just at that moment that Izzy and I hadn't ever called stuff off between us because we hadn't *enjoyed* it, so to bump into her through no intention from either of us was just... exciting. Can't really describe it any other way.


At that moment I kind of busied myself with sorting my stuff out, and getting my towel on the bench, and drying off my cap and goggles, and sorting my clothes out etc. But I eventually realised that the next step was actually taking the costume off. That is, getting completely naked in front of Izzy. Like I said I usually have zero problem with that kind of thing in a changing room, but this was different obviously. It's not that the idea repulsed me, but it just felt so inappropriate. I kind of stood there for a moment, not really doing anything. I think Izzy must have realised what was up, or else had the exact same thought, because she turned to me and said 'Um. Helen?'.


'Yeah?' I said, trying to sound really normal. She looked pretty awkward and said 'I'm really sorry if this is weird for you. I know it doesn't need to be a problem, but I'd understand if it is'. She kind of trailed off for a moment and I didn't really know how to respond. So after a moment she said 'What I mean is, if you wanted to go use a cubicle instead, I would totally understand. Or you know,*I* could go use a cubicle'.


My brain kind of went to mush as loads of thoughts went through it at once. '*I should definitely go use a cubicle*,' then '*But I don't want to make her feel like this is a big deal*,' then '*But it really kind of is a big deal*,' then '*But it doesn't have to be if I don't make it one*'. There were more, but the last one was a quiet thought in my head that I was desperately trying not to listen too, but it was getting louder and louder. It just said '*Besides, it'll be fun exciting*'.


I just stared at her. At her pretty face and strong legs, and the way her boobs were pushed flat against her chest in the swimming costume. And right then I got that fluttery urge, like I needed to go find a private spot and 'see to myself'. My heart rate picked up a little as I became aware of how I felt, and what I wanted to do. '*It's okay,*' I thought. '*I'll just agree with Izzy, go to the cubicle by myself, masturbate while thinking about her, and then go home*'.


But that thing happened again, where this daredevil voice kicked in. It's hard to describe. It's like being next to the edge of a tall building and there's this part of you that's afraid you'll get too close to the edge and fall off. But then another part of you walks right up to the edge anyway just because it can. So I cleared my throat and said in an overly calm voice 'No, it's fine Izzy, honestly. Like you said, it doesn't have to be weird'. My brain responded with '*What the hell am I doing?*'. She smiled at me and said 'Okay', looking quite nervous about it. It occurred to me then that I'd be seeing *her* naked too, which was properly weird because all I had been thinking about was being naked myself. So I quickly added 'I'll just turn around'.


So I turned around. And stood there. Then I forced my hand up to my shoulder, and started pulling one of the straps down, wondering really hard if Izzy was doing the same. My heart was beating faster now. It just felt so weird and inappropriate. ‘*This shouldn’t be happening*,’ I thought. Then I realised I couldn't hear Izzy doing anything. So I stopped and slowly turned back around, rolling my shoulder to put the strap back. She was just stood there still, kind of biting her bottom lip and looking really uncomfortable. She said 'I'm really sorry. I wasn't trying to watch or anything, it's just that after... everything... this feels a bit crazy'. Right then we started giggling quietly again while looking at each other. Honestly I think that's one of the main reasons nothing has gotten super weird between us. We both react to crazy situations by seeing the funny side, which is such a relief.


I was about to joke that it wasn't anything she hadn't seen before. But then I realised '*Holy crap, yes it is*'. There was only one part of me she had 'seen', and getting naked would expose a lot more. And here’s the weird bit: if I'm honest, that really excited me. The thought of showing her more, really excited me. Looking back now I really think I might have thing with ‘showing myself off’ (exhibitionism I guess?). I don’t know if it stems from what Izzy and I did in the room, or if it’s the reason that stuff happened in the first place, but there was this definite, visceral excitement about showing myself to her.


As all this was whirling in my head, I didn’t really know how to approach it. 'Um... Izzy?' I said as we stopped laughing. 'Yeah?' she said. 'I don't think this is any of my business,' I said, 'so feel free to just not answer, but have you... been with anyone else? A girl I mean. Since we...'. She went super red at that point and started smiling and said 'Er, actually no. Been too busy and... Well it's kind of difficult isn't it. Not that I'm in a rush. Or even planning it. Or anything. Why do you ask?'. I felt really sorry for her, because she looked as nervous as I felt and I had kind of put her on the spot.


'I was just wondering...' I said trying to sound calm, 'Well, I was obviously the *first* girl yeah?'. She just nodded and said 'Yeah'. So I continued and said 'Well... I really don't know how to put this'. I kind of stalled for a moment, because I really did not know how to put it. Eventually she said 'Whatever it is, don't worry about it. You can say whatever you want'. She must have been dying to know what I was trying to say, but I still couldn’t think of a vague way of putting it, so I just blurted out 'You haven't actually seen... boobs. Right? Sexually I mean. I'm guessing you've seen boobs before'. She laughed and stayed really red. Like, really red. I think she’s the only person I've actually ever seen blush properly.


She smiled and scratched her head nervously. 'I suppose not', she said. I mean, I've seen them obviously, but not like *that*'. She looked back at me expectantly (or confused, I don’t know). Oh my god my heart was flipping out. It's bad enough when you're sat down, but we were both still stood up and I was feeling kind of floaty. I knew what I was going to say next, but it was still weird to hear the words come out of my mouth. 'I don't want to make this weird,' I said, 'But. I don’t mind if you see them. Mine I mean. While I’m changing… As in, don’t feel like you have to look away, if you don’t want to'. 


'*Oh no, I actually said that*,' I thought. I had basically just told this bi girl that she could check out my boobs while I changed, as if it was some minor totally platonic thing, like using my antiperspirant or something. In my head I tried telling myself it was nothing, and that I was just doing her a favour: charitably flashing ‘the girls’ to the poor deprived bisexual. But I knew straight away that was a load of rubbish. It was as much - if not more - for me than for her.


She just stood there like someone had frozen her or something. Regret started to seep into me after a few seconds. '*What am I even doing? She’s still my intern!*' I thought. I kind of waited, just hoping one of us would say something. There was probably only like five seconds of silence, but it was excruciating. Eventually she said 'Uh. Are you joking?'. ‘*Oh shit,*’ I thought, ‘*I’ve finally gone too far. This is it*’. She just stood there with this stone cold expression on her face, waiting for me to answer.


Then she shook her head and laughed and said 'Crap, I'm really sorry Helen. I promise I didn't mean for that to sound sarcastic. I just honestly don't know if you were joking'.


The relief hit me hard. Honestly, that moment alone was such a rush. Looking back I think this whole ‘thing’ has given me an adrenaline addiction or something. I laughed too, '*Now's your chance*,’ I thought, *’just say it was a dumb joke*'. I cleared my throat and said 'Um. Not a joke? … But please forget I said anything if that's weird', while kind of waving my hands. ‘*What!? Stop. Doing. This*'. We stood there for another few moments. Then Izzy said 'I mean. I wouldn't. Er. Obviously that would be... a nice thing. But. I don't know.... Do you *want* me to look?'


The answer was absolutely yes. I have no idea why, but I wanted her to see. I wanted her to look and enjoy it. I had been doing so well with everything, but my resolve was just crumbling around me, and I wanted her to see. I said 'Well. Not for me. But I’m gonna be naked anyway. Soooo... if you wanted to look... then you could. That would be nice I mean. For you. Hopefully. And me?' I was such a mess. I don't remember exactly what I said obviously, but I remember that it didn't make much sense to either of us. This was pretty much the most awkward exchange of my life. We were both smiling nervously, and I feel like I could see her trying not to look at my body, but I don't know if I was imagining it. We had both built up this boundary between us, and I was just pulling it down chunk by chunk while she watched and did nothing to stop me.

Present Day - Semester  (4th year 2nd semester) All my friends have got internships for summer 2016 at big companies like facebook and indeed and so many others. Meanwhile, here I am without any good coding skills, any research projects or anything ""great"" about my resume for that matter. Mine is a dual degree (Bachelors + Masters [5 years]) curriculum. Can't change majors (don't have that concept in India.) Should be finishing college by 2017 May. I have 0 progress in my Research for Masters. I realized that my CGPA,regardless of how hard I improve it will still be ""SHIT"" relatively.(Was 6/10 in first year. Got it to 7.78 by Getting 9.7 and 9.2 in the previous two semesters. Had to work really hard.) I had so many great aspirations about myself when I was a teen. (arrogant fool, that's what I was.). The whole batch thinks I am a looser. I don't have ""friends"". Never had one. I am socially awkward. I am that guy who can make the best joke in the world sound like ""shit"". On top of that.. I am self-obsessed. I can't stop looking at myself in the mirror. I am not good looking at all maybe, but in this stupid mind of mine I guess I am. I am 5'7'' and kinda chubby. I eat junk food. Have sleeping disorders.(Sleeping for almost 14 hours everyday, these days.) Something inside me tells me not to quit. But now I see that my peers have gone far ahead and I can never catch up with them. Started doing weed last semester. If the 16 year old me would look at myself now, he would be ashamed.My parents would be ashamed too. I have a sister. She is autistic. Major autism. Not joking. I come from a joint family. My parent have expectations from me. But for the last 4 years, I believe I have disappointed them. My ""cousin"" from college is now going to MIT for PHD. Meanwhile I am stuck here in this hell-hole. I am having bad thoughts. Really bad thoughts. I don't have anyone to talk to. And No. I won't talk to my parents about this. They have been through a lot to raise me and my sister. People in college make fun of me. They call me an idiot, bully me most of the time. They never take me seriously. Why would they ? I have not achieved what they have ... and I might never achieve that. I am a jester in the crowd.I always have been. School, Junior College, College. I have always been. Maybe they are right. Maybe I am mentally ill. I had to get this out. I have forgiven everyone of them for making fun of me. I have laughed with them when they have laughed at me. I am not strong. I am in no position to be in a fight.(got beat up once too..) I am low on confidence.(still arrogant though). 4 fucking years. I lived in the shadow of my ""cousin's"" brilliance and now I am a looser. I took in every jab they threw at me about myself. Making fun of me. Making me look like an idiot. Never said a word. I just had to put this out somewhere. I was always confident that I was strong enough to take what people said. But 4 years. That's too much of a burden. I guess I am only human. I still paint.. I sketch too. But I have stopped. My life has come to a stand still. How can I get what I want ? How can I be that awesome guy I dream to be. The one who is the life of the crowd. The one everyone loves to talk to. The one everyone wants to be friends with. The one who makes loads of money. The one who is happy. I used to look in the mirror and see a boy smile. Now all I see is a young man crying. Please. Help. Me.

45gooz,5,2016-02-12,My sad rant,lonelyintheshadows,sadrants,https://www.reddit.com/r/sadrants/comments/45gooz/my_sad_rant/,"I'm a 19 year old sophomore in college. I've never had a girlfriend. Last year I wanted to change my life around (when I started college) and enjoy a life that was nothing like my high school life, where I was basically the definition of a wizard. 

So I left my PC at home, gave up gaming, and I even tried to limit my time on reddit (as opposed to my basically constant checking). I opened up a snapchat and tried to socialize as much as I could, as I was in college and I was told that this is the time to do it. I made friends, mostly guys, but there was this one girl. I was on a mission at the time to just make friends and get invited to parties and stuff so I didn't try to make a move or anything.

And it kinda worked, after about a month of no friends/no parties it all started happening. I became good friends with a couple guys and hung out with this girl as a friend (at the time I had no idea what an interested girl looked like, so I wasn't checking for signs. But we both kinda mutually friendzoned each other). Anyway freshman year passed and I got nowhere with chicks, but I had improved for sure, I got invited to parties and had some cool friends. I realized at around this time that I also had a huge crush on that girl friend of mine. I thought of her all the time but never knew how to tell her how I felt. Then she ended up going to a party with me like any other friday and she ended up going home with another guy. They hooked up, not all the way but it doesn't matter. I was devastated, and I knew she had no interest in me. I only had myself to blame.

Then the summer rolls around and I got super depressed. I got rejected for every internship (no word at all) and had no job. I went back to what felt comfortable, my high school wizard life. I didn't do anything and barely socialized, responded to messages/snaps like a day late, and just stayed inside most of the time. Sophomore year begins and I realize how sad and pathetic it was and so I try again. Only this time I vowed to myself I would get somewhere with a girl and start a relationship by the end of sophomore year.

So I changed everything. I tried to revamp my personality the best I could, no more mentioning weird things, etc. I started lifting, battled my acne, dressed as nice as possible (kept up with fashion and stuff) and overall just tried to become a much more attractive person. I even got a job as a TA, and recently got a paid internship for my major for this summer (yay!). But even after all that, I definitely got muscle gains and dressed with the current fashion trends (and that shit is expensive), I got nowhere. I went to parties pretty consistently but since I'm an ugly I have never had any luck with girls or having them talk to me. Out of like the ~30 college parties I've been to only once has a girl approached me first, and that was cause she was plastered. I didn't even know how to react and had no idea how to pick her up. All this failure has really hurt my self-esteem cause I feel like whatever I do I can't get a girl to find me attractive. My standards have gone to rock bottom. I still have this huge crush on my friend from earlier and still haven't told her, even though I snap/text her daily. We still hang out and occasionally she initiates the hanging out but it's cause she's a friendly person in general. I have no idea what to do. I don't act/look like a wizard, I try to be normal, but I'm just not attractive. I don't even have the guts to tell my crush how I feel for a year now. 

Anyway the reason I was sparked to write this was because I had lunch with my crush today and she mentioned she hooked up with some guy recently. This was the second time and I'm even more devastated. She said she ""regrets it"" and has no interest in being with him but they're part of the same club and are going camping two weeks from now. I had no idea how to respond to that so I was literally just quiet until she said something. Then I talked and I sounded like I was gagging and my voice was noticeably weakened. She noticed and we both just kinda got up to leave lunch. I know she's gonna say no if I confess, but I'm too in love to say it and lose her.

Anyway sorry for the long rant, and if you read it I'm much obliged, but I had to tell someone and my best friend has recently got a girlfriend and when I used to tell him my problems with my crush he would console me but now he says a couple things and quickly turns the conversation into his relationship problems (which are like I don't know which color rose to get her). I'm happy for him and envy him but I wish I had my friend back to talk to.

This valentine's day is going to be rough. I would love any advice."

This is going to be a little long, but I just wanted to let it out. 
This morning I got an internship offer today, and it took me by surprise. 
I am an EE student, but i'm not great. My GPA is about 2.9, and I don't participate in any extracurricular activities. When I was notified that I received an interview with the company, I was pleasantly surprised but I didn't really think I have a chance to get in. The position was for ASIC design, and I only knew two people who got a similar job with said company, and I know that they are very hard working and intelligent people. 
I didn't take this interview lightly however, and I reviewed all the relevant stuff that had to do with this position, and even looked at glassdoor reviews about other people's opinions on the interview process to get an idea what to expect. 
When the day of the interview came, the other person who was waiting with me had a much better resume (publishing a paper and assisting a prof), so I felt like the competition was going to be fierce. The only thing that I think distinguished me from many other people is the fact that I attached pieces of code of my previous projects from school to my resume. In the actual interview, they essentially asked me about different aspects of my projects, and asked me theoretical questions about computer and processors, which honestly I had a somewhat difficult time to answer, because while I knew the general idea of how for example interrupts worked, when they asked me about them I was a bit nervous and might have even explained it poorly. 
When they asked questions about some VHDL code, I foolishly said that HDL languages are procedural when in fact they run in parallel. 
The only somewhat good part of the interview was the riddle part, and I was able to answer it after a small hint or helpful tip that they threw, but I had struggled a bit on the next part of the same question, and they eventually helped me out because the time ran out. 

So you can probably see how I was completely shocked when I woke up this morning to an email saying that they are offering me a position within their company.  I of course accepted it right away, but I still thought that there was a mistake somewhere, and that they accidentally congratulated the wrong person. But now that they have emailed me, it seems like that they really did want me.  

So here you go guys, somehow even the normal chaps can get those lucrative positions. If you got similar stories, do tell."

45hljf,19,2016-02-12,Set 6 and Rebalance Phase 1 Retrospective,Mathnut02,SolForge,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolForge/comments/45hljf/set_6_and_rebalance_phase_1_retrospective/,"Hello!  It's time again for another retrospective, this time covering set 6 and the rebalance part one.  You can thank Djurre for passive-aggressively convincing me to put this together.  Also, my computer died and I lost my first draft of this that I'd worked on for 2 hours.  Almost threw my computer out the window....


&amp;nbsp;


* Pre Set 6 (aka Set 5) 


&amp;nbsp;


My memory isn't what it once was, but I know that I didn't do a set 5 retrospective when set 6 came out.  This is mostly because the end of set 5 and start of set 6 saw my interest in the game waning.  As such I didn't do a lot to put it together.  I do remember that N/U continued to be a dominant force in both constructed and draft.  With Shardplate Behemoth, Malice Hermit, and Spiritstone sentry being introduced with Set 5 the power curve of N/U ramped up considerably.  All three of these would see routine play and be a dominant force of the pre set 6 meta.  Other cards of note that were less immediately impactful but relevant to future metas were Ambriel's Edict, Ambriel Archangel, Zarox (designed by **Zwaxor**!), and Dendrify (soft gated removal before soft gated removal was cool).  
Set 6 also introduced persistent spells into the game, taking the place of some ""structure"" effects that had been bandied about by SBE at one point in time.  The ""Echoes"" cycle has been successful with all 4 factions' echo seeing use at some point in time.  Lucid Echoes brought back the infinite combo draw deck (with either ice torrent or crypt conjurer for the killing damage).  Ancestral Echoes functionally replaced Ferocious Roar in almost all Uttera grow wide strategies.  Immortal Echoes continues to see a lot of play today with almost guaranteed card advantage potential.  Finally, Draconic Echoes saw play at the height of the Ice Grasp craze.  Overall this cycle was one of the more successful for all factions.
Also introduced was the Ambush mechanic which provided a niche of new hate cards to thrive.  Of the cycle of Leylines though, only Leyline Demon and Leyline Sentry have seen a lot of play.  The hate for free plays and indirect creatures is something valuable to combat common strategies and still see play, but as Wegu has died in a fire and mobility isn't terribly threatening the other two leylines haven't gotten nearly as much use.


&amp;nbsp;


For draft, this set also pushed N/U significantly harder to the front with some very strong heroics, particularly Snowdrift Alpha and Necromeba.  The power level of these two cards could change draft matches singlehandedly and were obvious first picks.  
In terms of content, set 5 also saw the long awaited arrival of the campaign.  (And fun April fool's event against DOOOOOOOOOOOM!)  The campaign was the first major step made towards the new player experience since the additions of forging and sharing.  With minimal commitment, a new player could obtain a few legendaries to start their collection.  The basic premise of PvE battles where special rules can be applied is a novel concept, but new missions have been scarce as of late.  The mission interface itself is clunky with all the missions listed in one long page with the original sorting the only way to find the mission you're looking for is to manually scroll.  This is an area in which the new client will have an excellent opportunity to make drastic improvements for the new player experience.  For veterans, the missions were all relatively easy, so I can't speak to the difficulty level of them to a new player, but I'm still holding out hope for for challenge missions that will create creative deck construction to beat.


&amp;nbsp;


* World Championship 


&amp;nbsp;


Also during this time we had the World Championships!  First was the top 8 bracket that led to the top two who were set to play at Gencon live.  Credit to **Piquadore**, **Hans**, **Ipwnfour**, **SILLHADALLDEEZ**, **ErrorAsh**, and **Otsis** for making the top 8 and congratulations to **captain78** and **gottabekd** for making it to the finals at Gencon.  Unfortunately **captain78** had something come up that prevented him from attending the finals and had to forfeit leading to **gottabekd** being the first official Solforge World Champion.  **Congratulations gottabekd!**


&amp;nbsp;


* Set 6 -


&amp;nbsp;


Set 6 didn't bring much in the way of new mechanics beyond the addition of the darkforged.  The darkforge's scaling abilities that were dependent on other darkforged creatures was interesting (and reminiscent of M:TG's slivers) but ultimately didn't have a big impact on the constructed meta.  The impact on the meta was profound though.   Drafting multiple darkforged would almost always result in a very strong draft deck.  


&amp;nbsp;


From the cards released in set 6, the most immediately impactful were in Uttera.  Easiest to use was Othra, a late game bomb with a Pheonix like progression.  The fact that the lvl 1 would convert to an egg at rank up was a small drawback to getting the 10/50 mobility 3 creature with a game ending ability at lvl 3.  Once Othra 3 hit the board, if it couldn't be answered in a turn the game was usually over.  The other card that had a significant impact on the meta was Mosstodon.  This gave the Dino deck the last piece it needed to be able to field enough high quality dinos to break into the top tier.  This led to a very Dino dominated meta with most decks going the ""Dark Dino"" route and playing Duskmaws for added control.  


&amp;nbsp;


Beyond that, notable cards that didn't have the immediate impact but would in the future include Xerxes, Marty, Ignir and Alyssa.  Xerxes and Alyssa were missing pieces that would be added in the mini-expansions to reach exceptional levels whereas Ignir and Marty would have to wait for the rebalance to start seeing meaningful play. 


&amp;nbsp;


* Set 6.1 - The Patrons And Burn


&amp;nbsp;


The first mini-expansion introduced  the ""Patron"" cycle.  This cycle was reasonably successful with Patron of Tarsus seeing the most play.  With Nekrium having one more way to shrink the opponents board, Xerxes started to show up much more frequently in a very powerful Nekrium control deck.  Against creature based decks (like Dinos) this was very effective and would have seen considerable play if the meta hadn't become warped.  The rest of the patrons haven't seen as much play with Patron of the Deepwood making up the bulk of that in Uttera grow wide decks.   
The card that broke the meta though was Ice Grasp.  In a deck first presented in one of **Zan**'s crazy deck shops for a mono-faction WW, the burn deck was born.  This deck tried to control the board through burn while doing damage to the face with Ice Grasp.  This created a scenario in which every game became an absolute race with little to no creature interaction.  The Ice Grasp deck would run almost no creatures (Steelscale Dragon and/or Ambriel Archangel were the exceptions) and accepted any damage from creatures that would make it through.  This meant that any deck designed around controlling the board became obsolete as did any decks designed to win in player level 3.  The only deck that was reliably fast enough to beat the burn deck was Bron, but even then the speed with which Ice Grasp could kill led to a very very fast meta.


&amp;nbsp;


* Set 6.2 - The Rise of Strife


&amp;nbsp;


The second mini-expansion almost seemed tailored to try to curb the mistakes from Ice Grasp.  The first was a direct counter in Wipe Clean.  This would allow a player to purge Ice Grasp from an opponent which would result in a massive loss of damage for that deck.  Ultimately this wasn't as necessary because of Trial by Combat.  Alyssa's relative immunity to burn had always made her a good counter to the burn deck, but she was too difficult to use against anything else (and too easy to ignore) to really provide an effective counter, however Trial by Combat's ability to grow her quickly and her lvl 2 snowball potential quickly catapulted her to the top of the meta.  With the counters to ice grasp in place, the meta started to diversify again and Xerxes began making appearances.


&amp;nbsp;


* The Rebalance 


&amp;nbsp;


Stoneblade decided that before removing the beta tag that a rebalancing pass over everything was in order.  The stated goal of this was to slow the game down and decrease the difference in power between the levels.  This was accomplished with nerfs to several cards and buffs to others.  The biggest nerfs came to Alyssa (no longer gains scaling health), Spiritstone Sentry (no longer grows), Malice Hermit (less poison), Wegu, Ice Grasp (-33% damage), and Oratek Explosives (random).  The biggest buffs came to Zarox (+1 -&gt; +2 at lvl 1 was huge), Lifeblood Dryad (+1/+1 -&gt; +2/+2), Esperian Scarab, Ignir, Dozer (8/8 -&gt; 10/10 lvl 1), Arcflight Squadron, Chrogias (gaining life at lvl 2 and 3 when damaged) and Binben (wheee!).  Also of particular note was the changing of several Nekrium removal options to be soft gated.  That has opened up Nekrium control even more.
These changes have caused the meta to become much more diverse than it has been in awhile with at least 5 valid options presenting themselves at the top tier.  First, an N/U deck utilizing a Big Dumb Animals style has been very effective with Dozer, Behemoth, Scourge Hydra, and Immortal Echoes generating card advantage constantly.  Second, a near Mono N deck running Xerxes, Patron of Tarsus, Epidemic, and soft gated removal has proven very effective.  Third, Growbots has returned with a vengeance with the buffs to Arcflight, Lifeblood, and Scarab.  Fourth, A/U stall with Chrogias gained a huge boost with the life gain from Chrogias and showed up again.  Finally an old fashioned N/T deck with Zarox and Ignir puts up a remarkable fight with a lot of control.


&amp;nbsp;


Ultimately, the re-balance is both a success and a failure.  It has created a diverse meta with interesting match-ups, but it been less successful in its stated goals.  Games do occasionally make it to player level three now, but for the most part it still feels like games are decided well before that point.  


&amp;nbsp;


* New Client 


&amp;nbsp;


For most of the time covered in this article, Stoneblade has been talking about rewriting the client from the ground up in Unity.  They have brought in a third party, Free Range Games, to handle this development in part because of lack of experience on their side.  A lot of the existing client's problems and portability concerns can be attributed to a lack of experience of the developers that started everything up.  They got it up and running which is commendable but the time for something new is at hand.  Overall the communities reaction to the new has been generally positive, but date slippages and lack of communications have damaged the community's good will some.  Some have also objected to the move towards a more sci-fi look and feel from the more fantasy styled original client.  The original plan was to have the new client ready in Fall of 2015.  This slipped to the end of the year 2015, and has now slipped again to an unspecified time in 2016.  Communication has improved some with SBE posting video demos of the new client, but the community is still anxious for news.  Special shout out to **Josh the intern** and communicator extraordinaire!


&amp;nbsp;


With a second rebalance here, an increase in starting health to 120, and set 7 on the horizon, there is a lot to look experiment with and look forward to, but overall the game has felt fairly healthy in the constructed meta.  Draft received a much needed cycling with the phase two rebalance and the playerbase feels like it is dwindling, but hopefully the new client and an advertising campaign can help with those issues. 


&amp;nbsp;


Thank you for reading.  Did I miss any major decks from the meta or cards that you thought should have been included?   Let me know below!  I hope you appreciate my retrospective and continue to enjoy the game. Have fun!

I apologize in advance for a long post.

I'm coming up on graduating from community college with an A.S. this May and feel like  I'm in a bad position. I've been going to school part time because I work a full time job and because of this, nearly all of my time outside of work has been spent on school, including summer semesters. This means I haven't had a chance to work on any personal projects or self-learning.

On top of that, I feel like I've learned very little in school. There were sometimes large chunks of time (a semester, or more) where I was taking only gen ed classes and not putting my coding skills to use so I almost feel like I have to re-learn a lot of things. The class I had been anticipating the most and arguably one of the most important to a CS student, Data Structures and Algorithms, ended up going really horribly for me. Not because I did poorly (I got an A) but I had a really awful teacher and am coming out of school feeling like I know as much about data structures and algorithms as I did before taking the class. The professor didn't give any feedback on our code. When I would email her to ask for feedback just to even understand if I was on the right track, she would reply with things like ""You did fine. I am not looking to give grades, as long as you submitted work you will be fine."" I'm not exaggerating when I say that she was literally useless. Grading based on effort seems fine for a general education class but I actually really needed to learn things in that class and I feel like it was a complete waste of my time. 

So now that I've ranted about that, the point is that I feel very ill-prepared to venture into the world of interviews. I feel that I know so little that I'm even afraid of applying for an internship, which brings me to this post. I have no delusions about applying for a competitive internship, but I know plenty of smaller places offer internships too so I've been looking around and it seems like the requirements they list still expect you to have established and strong skillsets. They use phrasing like ""Expertise in..."" and ""A strong understanding of..."" and tend to list multiple languages and technologies. In school, I've only worked with Java and SQL. I wouldn't say I have a ""strong understanding"" of *anything* I've learned in school but that I have a familiarity with OOP and databases, and a little bit of front-end stuff. I would consider it only a foundation on which to build. I feel really embarrassed that I'm about to have a degree (even if not a BS) in Computer Science and have almost nothing to show for it.

Are there any internships out there that will genuinely be interested in training/teaching someone who has little demonstrable skill to show yet? That would be the reason *why* I need an internship right now, to learn. Is there hope for me, or should I just focus on trying to learn things myself after graduation until I have something to show for it? I thought internships would be more flexible about experience but it looks like the requirements may still be a little above my ability at this time.

At my job I've been working on learning how to build a web application for our user system access requests using ASP.NET MVC which would be something to show if I can actually put together a finished product, but I'm still just in the learning stages of that, reading and watching tutorials in my down time at work in the evenings. 

I guess I'm just feeling a little hopeless and maybe someone out there has been in this situation before and can share their experience. Thanks for listening!

P.S - I've signed a dual admissions agreement with a four year university because my school has a partnership with them so technically I've already been accepted to Temple University's CS program, but I have doubts that I can attend due to my full-time work schedule, which is also really stressing me out. :/ I may have to just call it quits at the A.S. for now.

I've done internships for the past two summer, but I would prefer to take it easy before I begin my 5 year phd program. 

I would really like to go abroad for those three months of summer. However, I don't have very much money. My undergraduate degree was paid with loans and I was a full time student without a job. I have read stories on here of people going to other countries and working odd jobs as they travel around to make enough money for food and housing. I was also considering an exchange program, although I have no idea how those work. Any advice in that area would be great too. I'm open to any country or continent. I have only been out of the united states once before. Just getting any new experience would be fun.

I am a little bit worried about safety. I am a 5 foot tall girl which makes me a little bit more vulnerable. And as I said, I have only been out of the country once, so I'm not an experienced traveler, but I would really like to begin learning how to be one now.

45ikli,551,2016-02-12,Got catfished &amp; found out I accidentally developed feelings for a CHILD!,ifeelsickinside,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/45ikli/got_catfished_found_out_i_accidentally_developed/,"I'm really ashamed with myself. I just found out that my online friend who I've been having strong feelings for is 13, not a young adult like I thought (I'm early-20sF). I feel like a monster.

I made friends with someone on a video game around 8 months ago. Pretty soon, we started using Skype to chat with each other, as well as play other video games together, for hours at a time almost everyday since then. It just makes no sense to me. He was so well-spoken, so well-read on current events and politics, so knowledgeable about my age group's pop culture. He had interesting stories to tell, seemed to have a lot of life experience under his belt. We told each other some deeply personal stuff about our lives, though we refrained from revealing too much personally identifying information. I even talked him through his depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts, and he helped me through my anxiety and my big move to a different state. 

Once, I asked him if he would be interested in trading pictures with me, and he said he felt uncomfortable with sharing identifying information because of a past negative experience of being doxxed by someone he thought was his friend. This story raised a red flag of course, but at the same time, I wanted to build his trust by respecting his need for online privacy. I figured maybe he was just insecure because of his low self-esteem. Weirdly, he was always trying to get me to consider moving to his city, so I figured meeting up was still an option. I was actually considering taking an internship in a different state this summer just so I could meet him during the drive up. He seemed okay with this idea.

Well, I've always had a nagging sense that something was off, and it was driving me crazy, because I really wanted to put a face to the person I was talking to for hours everyday. Especially since our conversations have escalated from flirty to romantic/sexual lately. So last weekend, I was watching him play a game through a screenshare. While he opened his Downloads folder to load the game, I saw a document titled ""(Full Name) Resume"", and without even thinking, I instinctively took a quick screenshot and saved it for later. I meant no harm by this, I had no intention of finding out too many details, but my curiosity was getting the best of me and I really wanted to know who exactly I was falling for. The next day, I did some creeping with the full name and found his mom on Facebook (all the other information checked out). And, through his mom's Facebook, I discovered that my friend is actually a 13-year old boy.

I've been pretty devastated ever since. I cried so hard once I realized that I've been having inappropriate conversations with a young boy, and I'm really scared of the emotional damage that I might have caused him. The fact that I gave him so much attention and validation in our conversations which eventually escalated to flirting, affection, and sexual topics (no cyber sex, but talking about ""past"" experiences) and even once used my money to purchase him something on a video game. I looked this up, and this kind of behavior is called ""grooming"", it's what child abusers do to kids before they sexually abuse them. The fact that he was especially vulnerable with his depression and low self-esteem makes this even worse. This is everything I'm against, hell, I've worked with abused children in the past. I never would have thought I'd be so careless with a child, let alone someone I really care about, and I feel disgusted with myself for not being more cautious.

And at the same time, I feel lied to, betrayed, and most of all, heartbroken. But I feel like I shouldn't feel that way. Because it's never a child's fault for something like this happening. It's the adult's responsibility. I should've been more careful. I feel like such an idiot.

Anyway, the next time he mentioned something sexual, I let him know that we couldn't talk about that kind of thing. I didn't tell him that I knew his real identity. I just told him that, from something he recently said, I got the sense that I was talking to someone who was younger than I'd previously thought. He tried to deny it, but I told him I didn't believe him. But I didn't blame him, because it's the internet, and kids lie, and adults are the ones who are responsible for maintaining appropriate boundaries. Eventually he said okay, just as long as we could still be friends. I apologized as well. So yeah. That's where we're at now. Occasionally we still play video games together, but we aren't talking as much. I hope that it's still okay for me to be friends with him in this regard. I still care about him as a person. But the whole situation just kinda bummed me out. I don't know. I still can't believe I'm in the situation that I'm in.


**Edit:** Thank you to all the commenters for your input. You have no idea how much this is helping me process my emotions. I'm surprisingly already starting to feel a lot better. I think I just really needed to tell *someone* about this, since god forbid anyone I know IRL knows about it. Also, it helps so much to know that it's not going to cause him any harm to continue to be friends with him. Because regardless of what happened, he's still one of my good friends. I don't hold any of this against him, and I can understand why he might have felt the need to lie. I can hold my own and get past these awkward feelings, but the friendship is what matters most to me."

Now not to fret, they have all the beats saved on a production mane frame in their secret studio located in Nappa Valley. They need to fracture the Beats into a new usb flash drive to transport the SAVED Beats to New York.

I have up for sale, **ONE** ASUS STRIX OC 980Ti. I have a BNIB one and a USED one, I only need one of them hence I'm selling one off because let's be realistic here, who really needs 2 980Ti's lol. I don't have updated timestamps of the used one right now so if you're interested in the used one and want a timestamp, you'll have to wait till Monday night.  

I'm currently using the used card in my system, runs great with no problems, when running BF4 on ultra (1440p 96Hz monitor + 1080p monitor). The other card is in its box so can't tell you how it runs but if I had to guess it'd be identical to the used one.

USED 980 ti | http://imgur.com/a/nkvNr | 575 | 545 | no


I can meet for free somewhere near 94539 or 94720. I can also meet any where in the BART system but you pay half the round trip fare, and lastly, if you want to meet in the SJ area then add $5. 

**I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY TRADES** so please don't offer any gpu's or mobos unless you just want to be ripped off. The only other thing I'd consider as partial payment, would be a recommendation for a software internship.

45k8gi,1,2016-02-13,[University Probability] Riddle (similar to Monty Hall problem) with two different methods/solutions?,akthero1,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/45k8gi/university_probability_riddle_similar_to_monty/,"Let me know if I should be posting this somewhere else. I'm currently practicing some sample interview questions for an internship that have been provided to me with solutions. One question intrigued me, as the sample solution was different to my own, and got a different answer as a result. The riddle was as follows:

*You are told that a family have 2 kids. You then see that one child is a boy. What is the probability that the other is a girl?*

**Solution 1 (sample solution):** 

P(2 Boys) = 1/4

P(2 Girls) = 1/4

P(1 Each) = 1/2

First child is Boy =&gt; cant be 2 girls 

=&gt; P(Second child is girl) = P(1 Each)/(P(1 Each) + P(2 Boys)) = (1/2)/(1/2 + 1/4) = 2/3

**Solution 2 (my solution):**

P(2 Boys) = 1/4

P(2 Girls) = 1/4

P(1 Each) = 1/2

P (2nd Child is girl) = P(1 Each|1st child is boy)

 = (P(1 Each)*P(1st Child is Boy|1 Each))/(P(1st Child is Boy))
 
 = ((1/2)*(1/2))/(1/2)
 = 1/2

To me, 1/2 makes more sense as an answer, if we assume that the genders of the 2 children are independent of each other. But I also know that with these types of problems the intuitive answer is often not correct, as with the Monty Hall problem. Can anyone spot if/where I've gone wrong?"

45l8yi,0,2016-02-13,What would doing an internship at a software company teach me?,compengstudent123,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/45l8yi/what_would_doing_an_internship_at_a_software/,"I'm trying to decide if I should do an internship my summer or try to acheive genius by becoming smarter than I currently am, and learning more about things I don't know.

Exactly what would a software company teach me, if I were to do an internship?

I've written pretty good compilers, servers, operating systems, code mutation engines, and tons of other medium sized projects in my day (100-500k lines of code).  I know all the design patterns, test driven development, version control, code style, etc.  Since I'm in engineering, I've done 4 design projects thus far (design specifications, etc), so I'm good on the technical writing area as well

However, one area I could be improve in is algorithms... as an engineer I didn't learn much algorithms/data structures, only the basics (stuff like quadtrees, redblack trees, trees, hashes, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc) and basic algorithms.   Also, I kind of want to learn more about electronics (digital and analog) and feel like I could do some cool projects this summer, if I didn't have an internship.  Honestly, don't know if its snobby to say, but I feel like I'm better than anybody I'd encounter in the industry

What will do me more good? Do an internship or learn more math? I kind of feel like an internship will be a waste of my time. 

EDIT:  So, is this just my ego talking? Do people in the software industry do more advanced things than what I speak of, or am I correct to assume that they all suck, and spend 90% of their time writing technical documents, attending meetings, and the other 10% of their time writing in crap like ruby on rails with test driven development because they cant code and need to be treated like a baby?  I'm pretty sure 99% of people in the industry don't share the passion I do, and they're just there for the paycheck.  They probably go home and watch TV all night.  Not me. "

We've had problems since the last 6 months. It started with me not accepting her cigarette habit which (I feel) eventually pushed her to be drunk one night and end up in another guy's arms.

This obviously destroyed me, but I felt that I loved her and felt I could work through this. It was good for the next 2 months or so and then it happened again with someone else. This second time destroyed me even more, but I was afraid of losing her at this point.

The third time something happens is when someone tried to send her provocative messages and she tried to not go along with it, but ended up doing so. At this point I had enough and wanted out. She cried and begged me back and apologized so much that it would never happen again, so I believed her and tried to let her gain my trust back.

Later on, about a week before Christmas, we get into a big argument over something so dumb and in my anger I end up showing her that I had found these people's (the first two guys) full names, addresses, locations, work/school info, etc. and that I wanted to hurt them if I ever could. She thought I was insane, she ended up trying to work through this with me if I got psychological help (I did).

Later on, before New Years, she meets a guy (who we'll call Tim) who she texts with. She tells me about all of their conversations and the intentions are obvious. Two weeks later she tells me Tim is inviting her to lunch and a movie, and that if I was ok with that. I straight up tell her no that I wasn't because those aren't ""friend"" intentions. (This might have to be a culture difference maybe, as I am American and she is European). Later on we end up having a big argument about it where she finds out I had lied to her about a lot of things and she's really hurt about it. Our friends get involved and we end up trying to work through this as long as I don't lie again.

She ends up going to the lunch, movie, and even meeting his family, and keeps meeting Tim over the the next days/weeks. I notice she really starts liking him, like as more than a friend and obviously he likes her as more than a friend. I had warned her not to get her feelings confused and to cut contact with him if that was the case. I reach the point where I'm afraid of losing her again and tell her I bought the plane ticket when I actually didn't to, I guess, use that as leverage to keep her. She knows I lied and we end up taking a break from each other and give each other space so she can make a decision, me or him, but she keeps wanting to be in contact, so I don't mind talking with her.

It should be noted that I've never had sex before because I feel I want that with someone I love instead of just a random nobody. She also had never had sex before but it didn't mean to her what it did to me. Two weeks ago she tells me she had sex with Tim, and I'm horrified and angry.  So I tell her I never want to see her again and that she had made her choice. I completely cut contact. 

For about a week she tries calling me to my phone (we used WhatsApp and I had blocked her), email, begging me to talk to her, that she feels disgusting, that she's so sorry and that she needs me and never wants to lose me. Anyway she could contact me she tried. Until she finally went as far as contacting one of my close friends and I finally gave her the chance to talk to me.

She tells me she feels gross, bad, and that she wants to be able to work through this with me, but I feel this is enough. Over this past week I've been trying to tell her that I don't want to be with her anymore, but she'll start crying and telling me she needs me and I start doubting it a bit. I should also mention that she comes from a dysfunctional alcoholic home/childhood so I feel she developed a codependent relationship with me. 

This is how our last talk went. I start telling her how with my current college classes I can possibly land a really good paid internship, which I'll maybe get at the end of this year or next year. Then she starts crying and sniffling.

**Me**: ""Hey, what's wrong?""

Her: ""So does this mean no more 'study abroad'?"" (I had planned to study abroad in/near her country)

**Me**: ""I need to talk to you about this, I don't feel comfortable or happy anymore.""

Her voice starts shaking and she starts crying/sniffling more

Her: ""You don't want to be my buddy anymore? My best friend? My partner? You said in your letter we can go through thick and thin, that nothing would tear our love apart. So many things could but they didn't. I love you, I need you, I don't want to lose you. I'm so sorry, I feel so gross and disgusting. I'll do anything and everything just to have you again. Please. I just love you..""

**Me**: ""I love you too, but this is too much. It's too much pain and too much disappointment. I can't even look at you the same. I just don't want that.""

Her: ""I can't live without you. I need love. I can get it from Tim, but I don't want him. I want you. You are so much better in every way, I just wish I had you close like him. I didn't want to have sex with him, but I was angry. I was angry at you for lying to me. I wanted to hurt you like you hurt me, but I regret everything now. Just come here in summer for a week, day, I don't care. I just want to feel you like a real person. I want that so much. I want to help you through this, I want to help heal what I broke.""

I stay quiet, but she interprets my silence as me thinking about it and starts bombarding me with kindness, love, etc. so I just go to bed and we tell each other good night, that I'll continue that another time.

This is where I start having doubts. Various reasons. 

* First, I hate having to feel like I'll never see her ever, at the end I still remember how much I cared for her. Like the hell I went through with her, getting a job, raising money, passport, etc. was for nothing. I guess that's why part of me still wants to meet her, to sort of not have this ""I never met her"" in my head for a long time.

*  Second, I start remembering all of our wonderful memories, our laughs, us watching movies, playing games, looking for houses, exploring google maps, care packages, etc. and I start wanting to be with her in person. 

* Third, I mentioned she comes from a very bad family background and I fear with me cutting her out of my life she'll do something drastic. Especially since we've never met each other, it'll only add to that. I know she's not my responsibility, and I'm trying to meditate on that all the time, but I still cared for her at some point and I don't want to be the cause of her doing something to herself.

I really don't want this anymore, so how do I get through telling her without being affected by tears, sniffles, good memories, or regrets?

Thank you so much for any help :)

**TL;DR:** Want to break up with SO after so much stuff. She interprets me talking with her as me trying to work through it.  I don't want anything anymore. Every time I want to leave I get bombarded with love and kindness and it makes it hard to leave without any guilt. How do I go about it?"

Edit: I already know Twitter is apparently a ""dying company"" but contrary to popular opinion, I feel they'll be able to get back on their feet. Plus, this is just a summer internship so I am not too worried about that.

Thanks!"
45m2yy,8,2016-02-13,I (24F) feel like soon having to decide between breaking up or marrying my SO (26M) and it's driving me crazy,LanternLighted,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/45m2yy/i_24f_feel_like_soon_having_to_decide_between/,"**Initial disclaimers: I'm fairly new to Reddit, not sure where to post and I need to get a lot out so, sorry in advance for this long post.**

I've been in a long distance relationship for more than a year. He is my first boyfriend, because I never wanted to settle for less than someone with whom I really click and a serious relationship.
We met online, chatted for months, he flew to meet me in what turned out to be a really romantic week together. I had planned to move to his country for my end-of-study internship, so we lived in the same country for almost 7 months, even if not in the same city. His job allows him to work partly remotely, so he would live at my place 10 days a month for those 7 months on average. Thinking about it, it was a real crashtest because I had a roommate so that means we would live together mainly in the same bed room for 10 days each time (and we didn't kill each other ^^).
I had planned to stay in his country after my internship, but immigration legislation for his country got very strict and all of my attempts failed. So last autumn I flew back home and have been living at my parents since then.
He came to visit in autumn, I flew to visit him for the holidays. We are separated by an ocean and 6h time difference.

He has a permanent job that he likes. I just graduated but don't really know what to do with my life. Unemployment rate is high for young people in my country. I've enrolled in another university program taught remotely, to get some flexibility with travels and not to feel like I'm doing nothing.
Due to our long distance relationship and the 6h time difference, I've had a really messed up schedule since last autumn, despite being a nigh owl in the first place. I wake up and go to bed super late, can't get much motivation to do productive things during my days, I'm quite behind regarding my studies. I also wanted to enhance my skills regarding what I just graduated from, in order to get more chance to get a job, wherever I would look for one. I still haven't even started learning that too.
I feel like I'm doing nothing with my life, being jobless, penniless and being too lazy to study to get a better resume.
Due to his job, (and language barer anyway), my boyfriend can't (or don't want to, but I understand) move from his city/country.
At this point, I'm tired of all the immigration difficulties for me to go to his country, it seems doomed in advance to try to get there alone from my skills and diplomas, because I am a junior.
For some reason, I set a deadline in April, when I would basically have the answer for the last of my immigration attempts.
Then, basically the only option for me to be physically with him by moving to his country would be by marrying him.

The distance is hard, and all the uncertainty about the future is driving me crazy, I've been on an emotional roller coaster for months, from ""I should just dump him and get my own life"" to ""I can't stand it anymore, I should just use my sparing, fly to him and marry him already"".
We have been talking everyday for more than one year. I can't imagine him being out of my life suddenly (yet he once told me that if we need to break up, he wants a clear cut at once and never want to hear from me again because it would be too painful).
I miss him badly yet sometimes I can't help but resenting him for making my life situation miserable.
Our time together has mainly been some great memories, and if it matters at all, we have a very fulfilled sexual life when together (which may makes the distance even harder in comparison).

We are kind of the boring intellectual kind and we would often discuss articles we've read and exchange views on society topics.
I'm a feminist. Not the feminazi kind people seems to have in mind in his country, or at least that he does. I just believe in gender equality and can't stand sexism under its daily forms.
Lately, I've been wondering about my boyfriend views. I don't necessarily want him to be a feminist but I guess I expect a minimum of common believes between us, especially if we want a long term relationship.
Thinking about marriage as a last resort, I have paid attention to some of his views lately, like on how to handle finances, travels or how he sees work. I'm wondering how our difference in views regarding those matters should weight in a decision to marry. Same for daily life incompatibilities: he doesn't like to go outside, I like to try out restaurants and cafe and have missed it when living with him.
It may sound selfish but overall, I feel like I'm adapting to match his lifestyle and views rather than the opposite or a compromise.

I know he considers marriage as a valid backup plan for my immigration for us to live together. But he is seeing it as a purely administrative thing.
I decided to be honest with him. I told him that even if my last immigration attempts doesn't work in April, I don't think marriage would be a good idea if nothing has changed in our relationship then.
I've been honest on how it kills me to be uncertain about everything in my life. At some point he asked me if I wanted to stop. Even if I've been considering the option lately, I couldn't say yes then.
So we are still together, and he is to visit me at the end of the month.

For months I've been looking into wedding stuff. Paperworks, prices, rings, dresses, ceremony ideas, guests.
I don't think he is aware of that.
He was shocked the other day when discovering the average costs of a wedding in his country.
Marrying him would probably mean a lot of compromise from me regarding the ideas I had, because of timing, circumstances and costs. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying ""I want a princess wedding or nothing"", but an emergency wedding without most of my relatives and cuts on many many things due to budget is not really what I have hoped for.
We never talked about anything regarding wedding. We only talked once about what marriage would mean to us, and hearing about his view kind of broke my heart.
I think part of me is secretly hoping he will propose with a nice ring in a few months, but realistically he is totally not that kind. These days, he has been mentioning an article he read on how diamonds are a huge scam, some marketing bullshit that is not worth its ridiculous price. Ironically, I'm not even dreaming of a diamond ring, but that he wouldn't know since he's never been curious enough to ask about what i would like.

***To sum up:***

Sometimes I wish we could just live in the same country, together or not, and that I would have my own life with him being part of it, then everything would feel so much simpler.
Right now, my future plans have been depending on our relationship, I have put my life on hold waiting for immigration miracles, and I feel like I will soon have to choose between asking for a break up I don't want, marrying for the wrong reason in wrong conditions, or carrying on being stuck in my life and with a heartbreaking long distance relationship without a concrete deadline.

I don't know what to do, what I should do. I don't really know what I'm expecting from this thread.

I've read/heard those common advice like ""your first is rarely the one"", ""doubts mean don't, don't drag a relationship you don't feel certain about"" or on the contrary ""don't end a relationship just because it's getting hard"".
Basically I'm lost.

**TL;DR: Been in a LDR for more than 1 year, 2 different countries, time difference and immigration in the way, most solid option to be together is marriage, feel like I have to choose between breaking up or marrying for the wrong reason/not the same as my partner's.**"
45m912,3,2016-02-13,Deciding on a college to transfer to,ired_it,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/45m912/deciding_on_a_college_to_transfer_to/,"This is my last semester at my community college before I transfer to a 4-year school. I have applied and been accepted to a few SUNY schools, and one private university. 

The private university I have been accepted to is Rochester Institute of Technology. RIT is a school that I have always wanted to go to. The only thing that is stopping me is the price difference between RIT and SUNY schools. The program I am in at my community college almost directly articulates with a program at RIT, so my credits will transfer almost perfectly into the new program, give or take a few credits. RIT also has a co-op program, which to me sounds like a paid internship that is required. 

Another positive is that it is only a 15 minute drive from my home. Since none of the SUNY schools around here offer my program, I would be stuck going to one 2 hours away, and I'd be stuck trying to find housing. I would rather stay home and go to RIT, but I want to hear some of your opinions. 

Also, I will probably be getting next to nothing from financial aid from any of these schools because of some unfortunate things that happened when I was younger, I am left with a somewhat large inheritance that is supposed to pay for schooling. "

I have been in college for IT for 4 years now, was introduced to A+ material in high school but never took the exam, have been building my own computers and maintaining them, and I currently work in Tech Support for the DOE as an internship.

Anyway, I know renewal is I think every 3-4 years, so how does that work? It is the same price as a normal sign-up?

Since 801 and 802 are due to retire by June 30, 2016...what does  that mean for renewal if there was a special method for that? I assume I'll just have to go through 901 and 902 once renewal time comes around, right? "

Thanks for reading this. I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at Michigan State and I have an internship with Lockheed Martin in Baltimore this summer. The actual office location looks like it is in Windsor Mill. 

I have never been to Baltimore before, so the first time I step foot in the city I will be moving in! I am just starting to look for places to live, and Hampden seems like it would be a nice location. Since this is close to JHU, I figured I would ask for some advice. 

Are there many students that leave for the summer? I would possibly be interested in a sublet from a student. Would Craigslist be the best place to look for this? Do you guys have a JHU Housing page on Facebook or something?? 

Any other random tidbits of information would be amazing, such as places I need to see, restaurants that I should go to, things to avoid, etc, etc. 

Sorry for the long post! Have an awesome day :) "

Here are the facts:

* I have to pay ~$2000 in taxes
* I made ~$6000 in Quebec as a freelance web developer for about $1000 in deductible expenses
* I made ~$18000 **in Germany**, but I've already paid taxes for it, and actually get a small return on that amount
* I'm a full time student, and the money I made in Germany was for an internship

So in the end, I made about $24000, $6000 of which is taxable in Canada, and I pay more taxes than the previous 3 years combined, despite making more or less the same in total.

Am I missing something, or is TurboTax wrong? I'm about to go with my old accountant, because I've never had to pay this much and my situation didn't change at all."

45n3m4,1,2016-02-13,[Story] The Rek'tekhas Incident,Teddie109,VivetAstrum,https://www.reddit.com/r/VivetAstrum/comments/45n3m4/story_the_rektekhas_incident/,"A loud buzzing filled the air as dozens of pairs of wings fluttered, Mantodeans flitting from console to rigging to console. A tall figure glided through the centre of the cavernous control centre of the MHS Rak'tekhass, her claws gesturing rapidly as she hissed orders to the male subordinates clouding around her.

*“Draw the sails. Prepare for solar fulfillment.”* A pair of engineers veered off from her group towards the sail controls. The Captain flew up to the command console located at the core of the ship, where she could have an unobstructed view over her crew. She tapped a few buttons on the console and the image of an immaculately groomed, female appeared on the screen. The Captain placed a hand over her chest, bowing her head in a mark of respect for the Broodmother.

The Broodmother slowly clacked her claw across her breastplate. Report. The Captain raised her head.
*“Preparations are almost complete, Katassa, Launch is imminent.”* The Broodmother nodded after a moments hesitation. 

*“Good. The Mantodea shall finally be a spacefaring people. Take pride in your command on this historic day.”* The Captain repeated her earlier sign of respect as the image of the Broodmother disappeared from the screen. The male workers throughout the ship suddenly felt a change in emotion. Pride and determination spread through them as new pheromones were produced by the Captain.


Preparations were completed shortly thereafter and the MHS Rek'tekhass was blasted into orbit. Once there, her majestic sails unfurled and sparkled in the sunlight. The ship slowly began to move, propelled by the solar winds now buffeting the sails. Inside the ship, Mantodeans skittered between the rigging controls, adjusting the sails minutely into the optimum positions. The ship picked up speed, soaring out of orbit on a path towards the first moon, Tre'eko. A few hours later, the moon loomed large in front of the ship.


*“Prepare to enter orbit.”* The Captain hissed, flooding the ship with a new set of pheromones to urge her crew into action. The ship shuddered and she turned quickly towards the group of males fluttering uneasily around the port sail rigging. One of them rapt a claw across his exoskeleton in alarm. The ship shuddered again as the mechanism to reel the sail back in jammed. A squeal echoed through the ship followed by a loud bang as one of the sail supports sheared off. Fear and anxiety began to permeate through the ship before being swiftly followed by confidence as the Captain tried to maintain morale. *“Adjust starboard sail. We are on a collision course with Tre'eko!”* She clicked sharply, flying down to the controls herself. Males rushed past her, frantically winding in the rigging, pulling the sail and attempting to divert the ships course.


An investigation afterwards revealed the likely cause of the MHS Rek'tekhas crashing into Tre'eko with the loss of all hands was caused by a faulty gear in the port sail mechanism. It took 6 years before a ship was landed on the moon and the crash-site was investigated to confirm, and to intern the remains of the crew complement of the Rek'tekhas. Official reports released in the period after the investigation mission returned to Saaka revealed that no trace of the remains of any member of the Rek'tekhas crew was found at or near the crashsite. Despite several further missions attempting to determine what happened to the crew of the ship, no satisfactory findings were ever reported."

45n87w,1,2016-02-13,I would take my own life if there were a way that I wouldn't hurt my mother and my family.,Andocuments,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/45n87w/i_would_take_my_own_life_if_there_were_a_way_that/,"First off, I'm going to be a bit all over the place since I really don't know how to organize my thoughts and what's wrong with me - but it all comes down to me wanting to just be away from this world and place less burden on my family.

I'm not really sure where to talk about this, so here I am. Basically, all of my life, I grew up with no father. Now, that's not really an excuse. My mother and my other relatives have given me all the resources growing up so that my lack of a father figure wouldn't be a factor. I do not put any blame on to them, don't get me wrong - the point of saying that is because they've worked so hard to raise me. I love them to death and all they've done for me.

Now, despite all they've given me, I've done nothing with it. I'm 26 years old, and I basically do not know how to take care of myself. I do not have any ""life"" skills to speak of, I'm socially inept, I don't eat properly. In short, I'm just useless. Now, I've gone to school (my school was paid for - but school isn't as expensive in Canada as it is in the states), but I fucked up my first degree. My GPA was really bad since I spent more time playing video games than actually studying. Despite that, I was given a second chance and I decided to do a technical college diploma. Took it more seriously and I actually managed to land internships that gave me experience.

It's been a month since I've graduated, and I'm having trouble finding a job. Even with the experience that I have, the job market is pretty tough. I have an interview this coming week, but it's only a temp job. Still, it's no guarantee that I will get it and even if I do, I have to commute a total of 3 hours a day just to get to work. Better than nothing, I guess?

So what's actually wrong?

Well, I'm battling a League of Legends addiction. Even with how much I've been playing lately, I'm only Platinum 1 (which is top 1.5% of the playerbase), but honestly, it's not enough for me. If there was a way for me to not care about this game anymore and do something else, I would. I just don't have much willpower to start something new. I feel completely lost if I do anything. I can't do sports or weightlifting right now since I'm also suffering from sciatica. Gaming and computers is the only thing I know how to do, and I know I have to expand my skillset, but I just feel lost doing so and I lose interest after maybe 1-2 days of trying.

Anyway, I just don't feel like a useful person. I fucked up all the things that my family has given me. So many people in this world would kill to have their school paid for and do something with their life, but I just threw it away. I can't find another hobby aside from computer and games. I'm way too shy to put myself out there and I'm too sensitive of a person. Also, I don't want to even begin talking about my life because people will just judge me being so pathetic at 26 years old. 

I don't know. I just want my life to be over. I fucked up. Let me just leave. Please. Unfortunately, doing so will hurt my mom and I don't want anything happening to her. Fuck...

45ndxv,3,2016-02-13,I [19M] have a crush on a girl [20F] but she might be dating someone?,male_19,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/45ndxv/i_19m_have_a_crush_on_a_girl_20f_but_she_might_be/,"I am really confused right now. I haven't been with my ex-girlfriend for several months and I think I am ready to be with someone again. One of my co-workers that I've been friends with has really started to interest me. She quit recently to go to an internship for the semester about an hour away. We are both in tech related fields so I sometimes get ""help"" from her with programming over Skype or IM. She says she has been bored so on the weekends she has been coming home. Last week she went to see a movie at the theater I work at with coworkers Steve and Erica. She paid for food for the three of them with her card. Well today she came in again to see a movie, this time just with Steve. They bought one popcorn and one drink this time, and I'm assuming they shared it.  
I want to ask her to go with me to this car show that she told me she might go to next weekend, but I'm worried she is dating Steve and might even ask if he could come which would be super awkward. I've asked around and no one knows if they are dating or just friends. She does seem to be friends with a lot of boys. It just seems weird to me because Steve is 17 and a junior in high school and she is 20 (almost 21) and in her 2nd year of college.  
  
Should I go ahead and ask her if she wants to go to the car show next weekend? She has so much in common with me and she is super fun to hangout with. I thought about waiting for the new schedule to come out in a few days to see if Steve is working that day.


   
**tl;dr**: Should I ask out this girl to hangout when she might be seeing someone?"

45nt09,1,2016-02-13,Internship - only working/earning for 6 months of the year (tax),Snugglosaurus,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/45nt09/internship_only_workingearning_for_6_months_of/,"Hi /r/personalfinance Wizards,

Hopefully a simple question. I'm currently undertaking an internship in the US. I'm from the UK so I'm finding a few things kinda confusing with the system... hopefully you guys can help!

**In 2015 I was earning from the internship for 6 months of the year (June-Dec). I did not earn any other money in 2015.**

**My federal income tax is deducted directly from my paycheque. In 2015 I lost $7400 due to federal income tax. I just did a quick calculation (using some website called efile) and it estimated I should only lose $5050.**

Is there something I am missing? Is the company I work for calculating my tax based on annual salary? Can I reclaim the $2350?!

I will also be working for a further 3 months in 2016 before I return to the UK. Can I claim anything back on this also?

Thank you! Please let me know if you need any further info."
45nz36,1,2016-02-13,I don't know what to do.,crunchyybeast,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/45nz36/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Hey reddit. Didn't really think I would be bringing this up on the internet again (I've talked to some people about it) until I came across this subreddit and saw someone else's post. But here it goes.
I'm a 20 year old, and over the years I've been quite depressed, but nowhere near as much as I've been this past year. Last year was both the best and worst year of my life.. and the pain isn't leaving. Not even a little bit. My mom got me a dog for Christmas around three years ago (which was surprising, since we had lost our 14yo dog when I was younger and she told me she never wanted to have a dog again because she couldn't handle the pain of losing it) and we named her Nini. I was never a very outgoing person, and not having any friends where I live, I got really, really attached to Nini, reeeeal quick. At certain points in my life (vacations) , and since I didn't have anything to do or anyone to go and be with, I'd just stay at home for weeks, even months, messing around on the internet, playing with my dog and being with my family. Fast forward ~three years, and Nini gets sick. I still don't know exactly what it was she had, but she had lumps on some parts of her body. And even though she was noticeably getting weaker, she was still a happy dog and I believed she was going to be alright. I was wrong.  One day, I woke up and did what I used to do every day: get up and check on Nini (who had now been sick for the past ~2 months). I started freaking out when going through every division of my house and not finding her anywhere.. that's when I passed through the kitchen door and looked inside to see my parents just standing there with blank, and somehow sad expressions on their faces.. That's when they told me.. Ugh. She died while I slept. I immediately went into my room. The only things I did that day were cry, hugging my mom, and sleep. I couldn't handle that. I couldn't be awake. 
Adding to all this, while Nini was still alive, I went to Finland for some sort of internship, and there I met a girl. A girl who, in just a month, went from just someone I though was cute to the ""love of my life"". And even though people from all around the world went to that internship, I fell for someone who lived in the same country as I did. I even lost my virginity to her there. When we returned, after the internship, we both balled our eyes out, promising we'd meet up as often as possible. She had to go to the north of the country, and I, the south. She had told me that she'd have to go to Switzerland for  like three months to take care of her cousin, since his mom was gonna be very busy at work. I talked to her and my mom about the possibility of finding her a job where I live and have her come live with us. After a while she was thrilled with that idea, but she still had to go to Switzerland, so we'd have to wait. And even though we were so far apart, we still talked every day through text, facebook or skype. Until one day, when I log into facebook to see if she's on  only tp find out she has me blocked. I text her, no response. I end up finding out through someone else that she had posted pictures with another guy on facebook. I was heartbroken. Between the time she blocked me and the time I found that out, my head was so fucked that I even forgot to log into skype. When I did (after already being aware of the new guy), I logged into skype and I told her I knew. Wanna know what she told me? Something along the lines of ""Heh, good. At least I don't have to tell you now."" As IF she even planned to tell me.. A knife right through the heart. So basically, I was happier than I'd ever been, and in just a few months, I lost my best friend and the girl I loved. The worst part about all this? I think I suffered some sort of trauma, because even though Nini was my best friend for three whole years, I can't remember what she looked like. I just can't. I've tried over and over again but I can't. My mom has told me we have pictures, but I'm afraid to even look at them.. I'm afraid I'll get worse. Now, I'm done with school, I don't have a job, I feel no motivation to do anything.  The only things keeping me ""sane"" are my parents, a friend I see about once a week (if I'm lucky), and weed. I doubt anyone will actually read this until the end, hell even I wouldn't read this huge of a post. But if you did read until the end, thank you. I needed to vent. Have a good night, /r/offmychest."
45og28,1,2016-02-13,Fall internship in nyc?,ipodmaster8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/45og28/fall_internship_in_nyc/,"Hey everyone,

I would like to do a fall internship in NYC this year and was wondering if there is a list of companies to apply to and when they start accepting fall applicants? I go to a state school with a decent gpa and have a two internships (wellknown + big4) if that helps. Also, does Bloomberg hire interns year round or is just summer? Thanks!"
45owb7,39,2016-02-14,What are some companies that most people never heard of but make interesting products and have competitive salary?,yujinred,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/45owb7/what_are_some_companies_that_most_people_never/,"Before I did my research into Software Engineering jobs I have only heard of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, or Facebook. But as I got immersed into this CS world I learned that there are some many companies that does very interesting work. Example of which is Palantir, their work motive is very interesting and they pay very well but nobody outside of CS seem to ever hear of them. Then there are stories of internships of people who work in a start up developed by Ex-Google employees that pays super well as well as a indoor Jacuzzi. Or Jane St. or Two Sigma that uses machine learning to predict the stock patterns.

Do you know any companies that most people have never heard of but do very interesting work?"
45ox6a,94,2016-02-14,"Be very careful what you say in public forums (Twitter/Facebook), Hilary supporters are looking for anything to discredit Sanders supporters.",VintageJane,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/45ox6a/be_very_careful_what_you_say_in_public_forums/,"A friend of mine who works on the Hillary Campaign posted [this link about posts from Bernie supporters about John Lewis's baseless comments](http://bluenationreview.com/civil-rights-legend-john-lewis-trolled-by-bernie-supporters/). 

After reading this, I thought I would come to you guys and talk a little bit about what I believe the Clinton campaign is trying to accomplish over the next few weeks and how we are all responsible for limiting the ammo they have.

The Hillary campaign is desperate to keep propogating the ""BernieBro"" narrative. They are doing this to try to make minorities, women and LGBT people feel as though Bernie supporters are a homogenous, out-of-touch group of white men (to distract from the fact that those people are actually Hillary's donor base). Right now, creating divisive drama and creating a (false) image of what it means to support Sanders, is their best way of alienating voters in the South.

So, when you post publicly (where an unpaid Hillary intern or pro-Hillary reporter can see it), think very carefully about the words that you use and whose integrity you are calling in to question because insulting and making ad hominem attacks against establishmentarians like John Lewis or Gloria Steinem does less to hurt their reputations and more to discredit the Revolution. This is especially true if you are white and/or a man. Try to show that you are informed and respect a lifetime of service before you denigrate their endorsements and accuse them (however rightly) for being part of the Establishment. Also, unless you are very well-informed about a civil rights icon, consider that it may be best to avoid making commentary altogether.

More of these endorsements are coming (because oligarchs are deeply invested in helping other oligarchs maintain the power and money daisy chain). The worst thing we can do is to react poorly and to make our reaction the headline; because at that point, our drama becomes more important than blatant factual misrepresentation. At that point, you may as well have donated $5 to the Hillary campaign (those words feel gross even typing them). 

**tl;dr Don't feed the trolls when Hillary gets an endorsement, they want you to get angry and say things they can use against us. Tread lightly, respond thoughtfully/factually and acknowledge the great achievements of people even if you disagree with them.**

On a highway to hell,

~20-something woman and Bernie supporter."
45oyou,0,2016-02-14,TIFU by empathizing with a girl,TheGreySeawolf,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/45oyou/tifu_by_empathizing_with_a_girl/,"Obligatory ""this didn't happen today, but 4 months ago."" A little background for this massive fuck up of mine; This girl and I met a few years back through a post on Google+, and from there we talked for 3 or so years straight, every night we could. Fast forward 3 years and 5 million messages, she turned 16 and her dad allowed her to start dating. Long story short, we started dating, and so we could spend more time together her dad gave me a job as an intern at his non-profit company where she was also interning.

Here's where the real fuck up starts. On our way to Colorado for the first week of camp we were running (18ish hour van ride), she was pretty upset, because the one week anniversary of her younger sisters death was coming up (stillborn). Me being a very empathetic person told her about my own sister who had been stillborn, so she wouldn't feel alone. Except instead of telling her that she had been stillborn, I thought that it would be a good idea to tell her that she had died in a car crash (yes I'm a moron, I realize). 

Fast forward another few months of me bullshitting this story and keeping up the biggest lie I have ever told, to the last week of camp we ran. Going into that week I was dead tired from doing everything at these camps, and I was also coming down with the flu. On top of all of that, I was supposed to teach the science lesson as well. And as if it couldn't get any worse, I experienced night terrors for the first time. For whatever reason, I got it into my head that it would be a great idea to tell everyone that my parents had kicked me out (complete lie), and that ended up getting the organization I worked for involved. Really long story short; tried to lie my way with an even bigger lie about being too tired to think straight and ""mishearing my parents.""

After all this, I managed to piss off my gf's dad so much from all the trouble I caused that he ended our dating, and now she hates me (of course) and I have been banned from helping at any of the non-profits events.

TL;DR Tried to empathize with my then gf to comfort her, ended up lying to about 20 people for 4 months, got called out on it, lost job and gf.

STL;DR Got called out on biggest lie I've ever told."
45ozcw,12,2016-02-14,Are you happy with your career choice?,hooblydoobly25,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/45ozcw/are_you_happy_with_your_career_choice/,"I'm a second year engineering student. Prior to university, I had no programming experience whatsoever. Second term, I took a class in MATLAB. The class moved very slowly and only taught the bare basics of loops/control flow etc, but I really enjoyed it. Between first and second year, I taught myself the basics of R and got to use my knowledge a little bit during an internship. I am now almost finished LPTHW and am working on a chess program (in Python).

I really enjoy the problem solving aspects of coding, and the feeling of accomplishment when you build something that actually works. It sure beats editing CAD drawings. So I am seriously considering transferring to CS. But it will set me back by at least one school term, at which point I will be basically be stuck with the program unless I want to waste even more time switching into something else down the road, so I want to make sure that it is something that I really want to do before switching. For all of you who studied CS in school and/or are now developers, how satisfied were/are you with your degree and career? Would you recommend making the switch? Any advice you can give that would help me find out if CS is truly a good career for me?

TL;DR  What are the best and worst parts of pursuing a career in CS?"

I'm in the process of interviewing with AirWatch for a software development intern position and I wanted to see if anyone here has had experience either interning with them or developing for them. 

So far, the culture seems pretty cool and I've worked in Atlanta before so I definitely know/like the city, but it'd be nice to have a real person from here be able to tell me their own personal thoughts. I'd be interested in finding out about interesting projects, the tools used, etc. I do definitely plan on asking my interviewer about this, but extra information is always nice and appreciated!"

45pjfo,8,2016-02-14,Longtime Mac user considering purchasing a PC workstation,Andersang,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/45pjfo/longtime_mac_user_considering_purchasing_a_pc/,"(I really hope I don't get downvoted for being a Mac user here)

Some context: I've never owned a Windows PC before - just Macs. The longest period I've used a Windows PC was 7 weeks during an internship, on an aging machine running Windows 7. My current machine is a 2011 Macbook Pro 13"" (256GB SSD, 16GB DDR3 1600Mhz, Intel HD3000), a miracle because it has only been serviced once for a battery replacement, and I abuse it horribly from time to time (rendering 1080p in Premiere Pro, while having illustrator, photoshop open, and modelling in 3D Max on a Windows 7 VM all at the same time)

I'm currently looking into getting a PC workstation laptop, since my course in University will require me to do architectural renders from time to time. 2 Problems though:

1. I am very used to the gestures and 'Mission Control' functions in Mac OS X, especially the separate virtual desktops, and the 'hot corners'. Does Windows 10 have anything similar that's built-in? I do not wish to install too many 3rd-party softwares just to emulate the way I've worked in the past.

2. I haven't yet managed to find a workstation laptop that has balanced power and battery life. Battery life is important - I've often been in situations where my MBP has to last more than 5 hours. I'm looking at the Lenovo Thinkpad P50s, but I'm not sure about its reliability. Do you guys have advice or recommendations?

The jump between different OSes and ecosystems is going to be tough, but I'm all up for it if I need a different system to take on different jobs. Thanks in advance for all the advice! "
45qfgi,0,2016-02-14,Can't be straightforward to anyone,icequeen_knm,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/45qfgi/cant_be_straightforward_to_anyone/,"Hello all. 
There's something that has been bothering me since an incident last year, because I have a hard time speaking my mind straightforwardly and saying no.

The incident: Last year I was an electrical engineering intern in a multinational siderurgic. All my work partners were men, but I never had any trouble with that, and all of them respected me. I'm always playful and really easy to talk to, make fun of almost everything and life was great. 
One of my coworker always joked that he was interested in me ans stuff (he is engaged), and I always played along, like I always do. 
But then, one day (almost 2 years after I started my internship) his jokes started to get a.little more touchy, and he tried to kiss me in our workplace (FYI: intern + worker = both fired). I got sooooo frustrated and really uncomfortable, but he kept being pushy until someone almost caught us. 
The thing here is: when this happened, I didn't expressly say ""NO, STOP IT, YOU ARE BEING AN ASSHOLE"".

And that'a what I always do. I never say NO straightforwardly and clearly. If I did, maybe the situation wouldn't have gotten this far.

I have fear that by saying no I will hurt the person's feelings ans that she might never like me again. STUPID,  I know, but that's how my mind work. I always look for soft words to say so they don't break their friendship with me (even when they aren't my real friend)

I need to stop caring for what people think of me and their feelings and care more about mine. How can I work this out? Someone have the same trouble as me? Share your experiencies (in both sides).

**TL;DR**: My fear of hurting other people by being straightfoward is hurting me.

45qt3w,3,2016-02-14,FAMU vs UCF for Engineering?,4everrekt,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/45qt3w/famu_vs_ucf_for_engineering/,"Hey engineering experts of reddit, I’m having a little trouble deciding between two schools. I got offered a full ride scholarship to Florida A&amp;M, and a 14K scholarship to UCF and I wanted to choose between the two for either CS, EE, or CE. 
Some more info:
1.	Through dual enrollment and AP, I will have knocked out most, if not all, of the requirements of my AA by the start of Fall 2016.
2.	I will be getting Bright Futures, and probably FL Pell, so it won’t be *impossible* to afford either.
3.	UCF has a BS/MS joint program for just about every engineering discipline, so some of their scholarship could be used for grad level courses.
4.	The FAMU scholarship is valued at tuition, r&amp;b for 8 semesters, but I’m not sure if it’s only for classes at the undergraduate rate.
5.	I’m originally original from Orlando.

My question is, is the extra cost of UCF justified by the potential “better” opportunities for internships and the like? Or would it be better to take advantage of FAMU’s generosity and live with less of a financial burden before getting rekt by grad school costs?"
45r2hi,636,2016-02-14,TIFU by asking out two ladies for valentines,LeOneThatGetsAway,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/45r2hi/tifu_by_asking_out_two_ladies_for_valentines/,"First post in the sub, thought I'd share this.


I am in college trying to get valentines date. I am abit shy to ask someone out at the moment so I thought I'd fail. I asked this girl who is having her internship at out university; to my surprise, she said yes. I was so amazed how it went smoothly and how easy it was, confidence struck me hard so without hesitating and without thinking, I eventually tried to ask out my college crush. The conversation is getting bad and awkward so I am ready to be turned down, so I ended the conversation with asking her if she'd like to spend valentines day with me. All stars/planets/whatever must have been aligned that day because she actually said YES!! Damn I was so happy I felt invincible from drag downs that day.


I went home then recollected what on earth just happened today; and then, it struck me. I asked two ladies out for valentines day. Holy Fck what am I gonna do?! My mind became a mess. I don't want to suddenly bail on someone and I'm not a kind of person who breaks promises easily so at the end of the day, I said to myself, ' fck it Im gonna have two ladies for valentines'


Valentines day came, I thought of a plan while having breakfast.

I texted Ms. Intern. We spent Valentines day until 4pm. Ice skate, ate at a burger restau, movie, coffee.

I texted Ms. Crush. We spent Valentines day 4pm until 9pm.  Window shopping, movie, pizza and pastries for dinner, liquor, intimate talks


All is well, went home, peak happiness.

And then shit happened, I texted the both of them for an amazing day, the problem is, stupid me accidentally switched the events on both the ladies. Both of them got confused then mad after figuring it out. I explained it to them eventually.


Tomorrow Feb 15, I'll see the aftermath of this crazy valentines day for me. Wish me Luck.


TL;DR:

Asked out college intern, said yes; got cocky, asked out college crush, said yes.

All is well. Until I texted both of them for an amazing day, but I accidentally switch events on both the ladies.

They got confused then mad after figuring out what happened. Explained to them.

Hoping for the best or the worse tomorrow.



**Update:**

So I passed by the library to try to speak to Ms. Intern. Told her about the mix up and that I am at fault for being stupid. I told her that I had fun and she also did but I was not convinced that she forgave me for what I did so I asked her again playfully and again and again, until she jokingly said that I'd have to treat her every Friday and that I should hang out some more time in the library. I nodded, not fully aware/comprehended of what just happened, I guess I just wanted to leave now, like my typical shy side.


Going out for lunch, I saw Ms. Crush but she was talking to another guy and I thought I would not want to interrupt them so I just passed by them, they are so focused in their conversation, I doubt they noticed my face, but as I pass by them I overheard some of their conversation, it seems like the guy wanted to force her to tell him the truth. I do not know though if it was about the date or some other matter.

Later that afternoon, I saw her doing her paperwork in the open laboratory, I got nervous, my mind became blurred, she really looks amazing. I was a completely another guy at that moment, I fcking stuttered H-Hi.
I like to smash my head onto the table that time, but I have started it, and so I continued, explained again to her and my faults. She was upset for a moment when I said I asked her second, I remembered her 
confrontation with the guy earlier and so we talked about it and she said it was about how she feels about me. I tried to keep my composure and asked her about it so casually like a douchy guy who didn't care.
She readied her hand, I am ready to take a slap for what I just did being suddenly douchy, which is inconsiderate now that Ive realized about it. but she just tapped my face, and then held it; damn my face
was so red, I can tell because of that hot feeling in my ears. Cutting after that and all the drama, she thinks that I am a good man and a good catch but she wouldn't want to sully our new-found friendship;
 so yea, she only wanted to be friends; and yes, I just got shoved into the friend purgatory. I don't really get how girls think most of the time. But I am still young and maybe she meant that
we can enter a romantic relationship when we finish college. Maybe I'll just play along and still ask them out, but this time one at a time. I learned my lesson and avoid another TIFU.

One last thing, the last piece of the puzzle is that I didn't reveal to them each other's identity from the start, so they won't(?) figure out each other. "

---------------------------

**This was a very jam-packed month and was actually pretty good in comparison to the past several months of shock jockery. This post is a little long, so bear with me.**

* For the first time, O&amp;A have gone meta. ""Possum Kingdom"" by Toadies was played as a rejoiner and the boys reminisce about how they used to hear that song a lot back at WAAF.

* Opie said that about 20 years ago (1981) his grandma sued his mom. He's still bitter about it, and says he is glad she is dead. 

* Stinky rolled a joint for Rodney Dangerfield and they smoke on air. It's hard to tell, but I think you can hear Anthony coughing. Rodney says ""This is good shit."" Opie does not indulge.

* Here is every Lewis Black appearance. Anthony: ""Hey so there's a news story where a random guy did this silly thing..."" Lewis Black: ""HAS EVERYBODY GONE INSANEEEE?!""

* Stalker Patty called in complaining that somebody on the Opie &amp; Anthony message board photoshopped a picture of her beheaded on a train track, and it scared her. This perhaps marks the beginning of years of fan Photoshops, which I guess weren't a thing back then.

* The Yankee/Red Sox rivalry is actually intense and not contrived. I guess the Sox are visiting the Bronx for the first series of the year, and they did a huge “Red Sox haven’t won the series since (historical event) happened” break with some callers.

* Rich Vos is in studio, and he's hilarious. His stupidity isn't the butt of any jokes yet, and Opie actually treats him like a human being and a friend.

* Vos is abrasive and shits on people's personalities at a deep level, in a way that the show would come to trademark and master over time. The O&amp;A show in 2001 was somewhat edgy, I guess, but they didn't master the art of vicious roasting quite yet. They still sorta cared for people's feelings when the jokes hit too hard. Vos, however, is singlehandedly responsible for bringing a new type of savage comedy to the show. Check out any of his fights with Jeff Norris. There's a few fights on YouTube in which he savagely attacks the douchier aspects of Norris's stale 8 minutes of material. This is the perfect symbolic moment of O&amp;A moving on from fairly hack comics to whom they'd too often give the benefit of the doubt when they bombed, to new guys like Vos who are downright hilarious off the cuff and who will call you out on *anything*. Vos is able to articulate things that everybody else in the room was merely thinking. Maybe this is what people were talking about all along when they said the WNEW days were the best. Fucking hilarious. Oh, and by the way, the boys have now completely turned on Jeff Norris and openly mock him.

* Miscellaneous ads and promos: shock local news story saying that your neighbors might be swingers, ad for *Grounded for Life*, Linkin Park's ""One Step Closer"" is a rejoiner (fawk yeah middle school)

* Ant said he always stops by the local gas station whenever he sees high school girls doing car washes.

* Opie thinks it's funny how tourists and non-New Yorkers still think 42nd St. is a terrible area and continue to avoid it like the plague. Anthony says 42nd St. is pretty much Disneyland these days. I guess using the phrase 'Disneyland' to describe Times Square was actually a clever, original observation back then.

* May 7 - hilarious soundboard opening followed by their first ever discussion of ""I hate this place, nothing works here, the medications don't work, I've been here for 7 yaaars"" - check that show out, it's pretty good.

* Movie break! Ant loved *The Mummy Returns*, Opie loved *Memento*, they think *Pearl Harbor* and *The Fast and the Furious* look awesome, and *Jurassic Park 3* looks not so great.

* O&amp;A fire a truant intern over the phone after only three days of employment and tell him to say his last words. Opie says that some day it’ll be a trivia question for people to remember each fired staff member's last words, and Anthony says, “You mean like when Mark said ‘your mom’s box?'”

* The O&amp;A message board is mentioned, Opie says they kiss Anthony's ass a lot on there. Wackbag (possibly spelled Whackbag at the time) is mentioned as another competing fan site but nobody really posts there.

* Anthony is getting sick of Jon Stewart because he’s losing his cool vibe and becoming sort of a snob. He says new guy Stephen Colbert is hilarious. Daily show staff writer Paul Mercurio makes his studio debut. He would eventually encourage a couple to do anal in St. Patrick's cathedral and you know the rest. Apparently Opie still hates him for that. 

* Robert Blake murder happens, everybody thinks he is so obviously guilty 

* Mick Foley's show debut. He was much less of a weirdo then. 

* Steve C has been getting criticism over the new layout of the website, and the criticism is kinda annoying Steve.

Just wait until you get breasts.

* With 10 days to go in their contract, O&amp;A start the show with a long rant about how the company treats them like shit and they might not be back on the radio again. Both of them insist this isn’t a work, and Opie is particularly adamant that he isn't going to stick around WNEW if he isn't compensated fairly. 

* They hated the season finale of *The Sopranos*.

* The show's staff, as a 'supporting cast' of sorts, is boring in my opinion. Ben is boring, Steve C they don't make fun of yet, and Stinky is whatever. Psycho Mark got fired a few months ago but for some reason still hangs out in-studio every so often and just shrieks like a retard half the time. 

* Opie complains about EVERYTHING. The latest problem is that the promos for other shows on the channel are too long. He wants them under 30 seconds, not 40!

* Lady Di and Marion call in to win tickets to an NSYNC show for Lady Di’s 10-year-old son. They haven’t changed one. fucking. bit. Marion talks about herself constantly, Ladi Di lies and re-asks questions to she can think of lies, she takes everything literally, she drives Anthony crazy (much to Opie’s amusement), and interrupts constantly. Ant and Opie also ask her to respond to the message board rumor that she lost her job and has a drinking problem, but she denies it and they move on. They then ask them embarrassing sexual questions. On the topic of anal, Lady Di says “no comment”

* Keep in mind that Anthony Cumia is 40 years old during these broadcasts. In a kindergarten somewhere in New York, there is a 5-year-old student that will grow up into an alien-looking freak who ends up getting Ant sent to the clink for a weekend.

On Friday, a recruiter contacted me scheduling an interview with me for the silicon solutions team (hardware?) which I have never applied to.

In school, I am currently studying computer engineering so there might be courses that might show that I have experience in hardware (electronic circuits, digital systems, etc) but it is not really in my interest nor do I think I am good enough to interview with Nvidia for something like that.

However, I currently do not have any internship offers at the moment or interviews lined up. Should I risk it and go through the interview and hope that I might somehow get the job? Or should I tell the recruiter that I am not interested in this position and possibly help me seek out a software team?

Has anyone else experienced this before? Thank you very much."

Through college I worked multiple jobs, lived in a shit house with 4-6 other guys, took care of some of my family for several years, and all this while I was a full time student. Then, in 2012 during my first semester senior year my brother had a break with reality and attempted to kill me twice. After getting him into treatment I finished my semester and through a strange series of events involving my parents blaming me for my older brothers break with reality I lost everything I owned except my clothes, a mattress, and my dresser.

I dropped out with one semester left of school, took a job in sales at a very large national car dealership, became one of the highest sellers in the company, advanced to senior staff, helped write their training material, and started training new managers while doing financing for the company. About a year into this job I got married, paid off all of our debt, bought my wife a car, and set us up to be comfortable. After being married for a year I started really hating my job, since I no longer had to do something I hated and could actually go back to school.

After 2 years, moving up the corporate chain, I turned down a management position with a six figure salary at 22. I decided to go into the medical field, finish my degree, and go into occupational therapy. For the last two years I have worked at a law firm doing everything from research, finding people who needed to be served papers and were hiding, to handling personal business for the lawyers at my firm. This while i was finishing up my pre-med classes, married, and volunteering in my community tutoring kids in failing school districts ( there are a lot of them where I live).

This semester I have made it to the final batch of grad school applicants at my school of choice ( only about 10% make it into the program from what I am told) I have one last interview to jump through on the 23rd, I also have a back up internship doing community health research and treatment in poor/underserved communities in my city. The only two things I have left to complete are a physics class and an AP2 class. I quit my job so I could finish strong and get the most out these classes before I move onto something new.
However, I just have no motivation. I have never struggled with lack of motivation. I have always been extremely driven since I came from a very poor and unsupportive family. If I wanted something I knew I had to go get it myself. I just feel burnt. For the last week I have fallen behind in my classes when normally I am an 'A' student. I still want to go to grad school, I want to finish strong, but it feels like I am grasping at straws to find a way to move forward.

I am not one looking for sympathy, but any advice on the best way to keep moving forward would be greatly appreciated.  Just throwing this wall of text out there helps me feel motivated to keep moving forward. "

I'm currently in a not really known CS school and have 3years left until graduation. I'm going to be 31 when I graduate, which means I don't really have much time. Parents are getting old, I gotta get married, etc..

I've read some posts on here recommending full time internship to some college students taking some time off school - I was wondering if that applies to me as well. Of course, I want to graduate fast, but if the full-time internship can make up for my age, I'm willing to take a year off just to do that.

If I do have a choice between taking a year off to do a full-time internship or just study and graduate as soon as I can, what's a better choice for me?

Thank you in advance.

I'm 18 now, currently attending a community college. When I was 17 in highschool, I was caught shoplifting at a Target. The amount was around $300, so the cops were called and they read me my rights and asked a few questions. They took me home and talked to my parents. If I recall correctly, I was given a court date, but eventually they said I don't need to show up (Probably because it was my first and only issue with the law, I cooperated very well) The items were returned in perfect condition, and I paid the civil demand of $500 just in case. I've never heard anything about it since. I'm not sure if it was a misdemeanor, grand theft, petty theft

However, I was wondering if I apply for university, internships, jobs, etc., will it show up on any background checks or if they ask if I had any problems with the law, do I say yes? 

I thought juvenile records were expunged as soon as you turn 18 but that doesn't seem to be the case. 

If anyone can shed some light, that would be great. It was a one-time thing and I don't want it to affect me at all in the future.

-BS Materials Science and Engineering

-2 productive internships with a large aerospace company,

-Great extracurriculars in brand name ug institution, and great GPA.

out of college and in selective ph.d. program (~1.7 years in) -- found that the program has not been a good fit for me. Ideally, I would like to leave the program ASAP (no MS at this point) for full-time entry level employment, but cannot get past the initial HR screens at the aerospace company or elsewhere.

My most recent experience is my current research which I do not know is hurting me by being first on my resume. It likely is being viewed as irrelevant to what I am trying to find full-time employment for (closer to what I did in internships and my bachelor degree). It feels like I am trying to compete against individuals who have spent the last two years building relevant skills for these entry level roles. Still, I have emphasized the skills that I think are transferable and used the key phrases within the job posting to describe these transferable skills under the experience.

Applied to ~40 jobs since Dec, got phone screen for one, and didn't make it past.

I have found various roles to apply towards, but always am hesitant to apply since I need to develop a tailored resume to each job posting. This slow rate of tailoring resumes with slow return on rejection makes this seem like a unproductive period that is not giving me any feedback for improving my chances moving forward. I have reached out to my network of contacts, but most tell me to include keywords into my resume.

Have people who quit STEM Ph.D.'s successfully been able to get past these initial HR screens, interviews, and finally offered a job related to their bachelor's degree? If so, what can I be doing to better my chances of landing that first entry-level role?"

I accrued a lot of credit card debt by using my credit cards to pay for my last year of college and to help out someone who needed help. The debt is spread across two credit cards. One is at $6000 and the other is at $9000. I was thinking of spending nearly half of my savings on eliminating one of the credit cards and then keeping the rest of my savings on-hand for when I relocate for a new job. I'll be making a decent amount of money each month...I'm estimating that after required expenses like food, rent, gas, car, etc, I'll have about $1500 in disposable income each month.

Is my plan sound? My plan is to pay off the smaller credit card and keep the rest of my savings for emergencies, because this current job will last three months (it's an internship) unless I do well and get hired full-time afterwards. During this time, I was planning on throwing almost all of the disposable income against the remaining large balance on credit card #2.

I do have other debt (car loan and a student loan from the first three years of college) but right now I'm concerned with just the credit cards because they are higher interest balances.

I have used drugs for ~6 years now, but my use didn't really turn into an addiction until 1.5 years ago. I have smoked weed consistently for those 6 years, mostly daily, but with occasional 1-4 month breaks and sometimes only 1-2 times a week. I am very experienced with psychedelics. I wont list everything I've done, but I've tripped 100+ times and taken 1+ gram of mescaline and 1mg of LSD. Around 2.5 years ago, during my freshman year of college, I started dating a stoner girl with borderline personality disorder (BPD). I had no friends at the time and after taking cactus together I fell in love with her. We moved in together around a year later, at the start of summer. It was then that I really began to understand what BPD was. This isn't about her, so I won't go too into detail, but she would have crazy mood swings. Everything was either the best thing ever or the worst, and she would frequently fluctuate. This was often directed at me, as neither of us had any real friends besides each other. 

Instead of developing skills on how to handle her, I turned to drugs. First I started using weed as a way of creating a safety net around me, because I could handle her ups and downs and not let them get to me when I was stoned. When I was sober, I would just react poorly and inevetibaly make things worse, or get dragged down by her depression. I would like to add that up until I was around 17, I had pretty serious depression (that I did work through and mostly recover from) stemming from my parents divorcing at age 9 and my dad dying in a helicopter crash at age 12, so I was not the most stable person to begin with when I met her. Eventually we started fighting about my weed consumption, as she was now totally sober. This led to me hiding it from her and her finding out, which put further strain on our relationship. 

That is when I found benzos. On a whim I ordered 100 1mg etizolam, and soon discovered that they worked 100X better than weed at dealing with my SO. This was around 1.5 years ago. In the next year and a half, my SO got very serious about therapy and has improved a massive amount. I, however, have been on and off benzos consistently since then. I have only been physically dependent once, since I am very careful about when I take them. My routine is usually benzos every third day, weed every day, kratom 1-2 a week, dissociatives once a week, opiates 1-2 a month, and psychedelics once a month.

The thing is, I am 100% functional. I have a 3.8 GPA, have had, and will soon have, high paying CS internships, have my future planned out, and am very physically healthy. I just cant be happy sober. Things even go better in my relationship when I am drugged (and she doesn't know) because I say and do the right things. When I am sober I am irritable and just think about the the next time I can get high.

Right now, my plan is as follows: I will be sober for the next week. If I start to cave before then, I will smoke DMT (DMT has always been a guide for me, I dont really consider it like other drugs). If I can manage to get to next weekend, I will drop 50mg of 4-aco-dmt, which I think will help cement into me why I want to do this. After that I do not know. Saying ""I will stay 100% sober for 40 days"" scares the shit out of me, and I'd rather just start with a smaller time frame that seems more doable.

45vryk,6,2016-02-15,How to beat my drug addiction? all advice welcome. [xpost r/drugs],trains1408,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/45vryk/how_to_beat_my_drug_addiction_all_advice_welcome/,"I have used drugs for ~6 years now, but my use didn't really turn into an addiction until 1.5 years ago. I have smoked weed consistently for those 6 years, mostly daily, but with occasional 1-4 month breaks and sometimes only 1-2 times a week. I am very experienced with psychedelics. I wont list everything I've done, but I've tripped 100+ times and taken 1+ gram of mescaline and 1mg of LSD. Around 2.5 years ago, during my freshman year of college, I started dating a stoner girl with borderline personality disorder (BPD). I had no friends at the time and after taking cactus together I fell in love with her. We moved in together around a year later, at the start of summer. It was then that I really began to understand what BPD was. This isn't about her, so I won't go too into detail, but she would have crazy mood swings. Everything was either the best thing ever or the worst, and she would frequently fluctuate. This was often directed at me, as neither of us had any real friends besides each other.

Instead of developing skills on how to handle her, I turned to drugs. First I started using weed as a way of creating a safety net around me, because I could handle her ups and downs and not let them get to me when I was stoned. When I was sober, I would just react poorly and inevetibaly make things worse, or get dragged down by her depression. I would like to add that up until I was around 17, I had pretty serious depression (that I did work through and mostly recover from) stemming from my parents divorcing at age 9 and my dad dying in a helicopter crash at age 12, so I was not the most stable person to begin with when I met her. Eventually we started fighting about my weed consumption, as she was now totally sober. This led to me hiding it from her and her finding out, which put further strain on our relationship.

That is when I found benzos. On a whim I ordered 100 1mg etizolam, and soon discovered that they worked 100X better than weed at dealing with my SO. This was around 1.5 years ago. In the next year and a half, my SO got very serious about therapy and has improved a massive amount. I, however, have been on and off benzos consistently since then. I have only been physically dependent once, since I am very careful about when I take them. My routine is usually benzos every third day, weed every day, kratom 1-2 a week, dissociatives once a week, opiates 1-2 a month, and psychedelics once a month.

The thing is, I am 100% functional. I have a 3.8 GPA, have had, and will soon have, high paying CS internships, have my future planned out, and am very physically healthy. I just cant be happy sober. Things even go better in my relationship when I am drugged (and she doesn't know) because I say and do the right things. When I am sober I am irritable and just think about the the next time I can get high.

On to why I am posting this. Recently, I fucked up. Twice. I blacked out on benzos unintentionally and made an ass out of myself and was very hurtful towards my SO. It is obvious I am a drug addict, and I want to go back to how it was before.

I already see a therapist once a week, exercise most days of the week, eat very healthy, and am extremely opposed to psychiatric medication.

Five months ago I got my first tech job as a programmer. I've been employed before (summer jobs as system administrator and as technical support for 9 months) but I approached this opportunity with great enthusiasm because after all programming is what I want and love doing. I started as an intern and then got an offer for full-time employment and I agreed. The sad thing is I agreed only because I need money since I'm still an undergraduate and I wanted to lift some of the weight off my mothers shoulders (she's a single parent). But I don't like my job and there are reasons: in the last two months I haven't learned a simple new thing that will help me be better with my tasks; I have a very short attention span and when I have to work for months on a single thing (and there it not a single comment in the code) I get very nervous and depressed; the company has something like a framework and I'm afraid that if I spend years on it I won't be able to find a job after that, because I won't be qualified enough; the salary is small for the industry. I dread going to work, and can't wait for the work day to end. This is not beneficial for neither side in my opinion. I'm wondering if these reasons are good enough for me to resign in the end of the next month when my contract expires. I'm just not happy, I feel miserable.

45waec,2,2016-02-15,Bully-free in one go! (advice against male bullies),JavidanOfTheWest,bullying,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/45waec/bullyfree_in_one_go_advice_against_male_bullies/,"If you’re fed up with bullying and ready to take action, then you’re the reason I’m writing this. I will be sharing some insight and tricks that will work for sure, as long as you commit to them. I'll also try to minimize the risks and go into detail about bullies as well.

**Kindness is (sadly) perceived as a weakness:**

A bullying victim's most redeeming quality is often their kindness and their willingness to forgive. Do not think that you can make a bully like you by treating them with kindness and respect. Acting this way actually makes you their most favorable target. Do not befriend just to get them to stop bullying you. Only befriend people who are worthy of your friendship. Just know that kindness can be one of your greatest strengths, but even simple acts of kindness should only be displayed to help others back up when they're down on their luck or when it's someone worthy of being your friend, but never a bully.

**It does not get better with age:**

It only seems to get better with age because you’re always gaining more insight and knowledge, which you subconsciously (or consciously) display to potential bullies. As we age, it’s easier to create distance between you and a bully as well, which can give us the illusion that bullying disappears as we age. But the bully will just find a more accessible victim if you get out of reach, so it does not actually disappear. I’ve had many internships throughout my life and something I realized is that we only age physically, not mentally. During these internships I’ve seen a quite a handful of fully grown people doing what they always did. The only difference was that they now bully other fully-grown people. Even my mother got bullied intensely by a mob of middle-aged bullies just because she worked too hard. Hearing about that infuriated me since my mother is so kind to even the worst people, up to a point where I can only admire the strength it needs to be such a person.

**Bullies aren’t always bad people, it’s more of a social pressure mob mentality:**

Bullies are quite often powerless about changing their actions even when they’re conscious about it. People can bully others without even realizing it, and the way they treat you in the presence of others also affects the way treat you. It’s all a vicious circle which is hard to break out of once you’re in it. But it’s very possible to do so if you want it badly enough.

**Bullies (and how it’s all about mentality):**

Bullying is (often) not specifically about you, but it’s about gaining social status. Bullying often creeps up on the bully just as gradually as it creeps up on their victim. When you’re being bullied by a group of friends, you think their leader is the one that started it, because he’s the face of the group. But the problem is often someone else in the group. I’ll get back to that in a minute.

I’ve been bullied for a great deal of my life, up until I was 17. I’ve even been bullied by kids who would not stand a chance if I ever decided to fight back. One kid actually hit me in the face once while we were in a full school cafeteria. I stood up with anger and he literally ran as fast as he could while I gave chase. He threw over chairs as he ran past them to stop me from getting to him. And by the time I caught up, at that deciding moment, I had lost all the hatred and the anger I needed to once and for all get people to stop bullying me. So I ended up doing nothing to the kid, but I still felt great for doing it. Although shortly after, I reverted back to my bully-prone self. I had been given a few retries when I switched to different school or classes, but they all resulted in the same outcome. I realized that my kind and gentle attitude made me a bully magnet.

For the past 8 years I’ve been working on never getting bullied again and I’ve not been bullied for all these years since I decided that enough was enough. I’ve gradually changed into a passive-aggressive asshole who does not take crap from anyone, but I’ll be kind to anyone that reminds me of my previous self and I’ll always defend them as well, even against my own friends. And I actually end up being the group leader every single time I desire to be. Most of these groups consisted the popular kids in classes and what I see every single time is that they long for my approval. They have opinions, which they voice to the leader, who then decides if their opinion is valid or not. When they want to tell a joke, they don’t address the group, but they address the leader and in turn, they’ll have the attention of the whole group. So, the most disgusting thing I often see if when they share their unwanted opinion of an ‘easy target’, therefore laying the groundwork for bullying by wondering what the group leader thinks of that person. This is what I meant to further elaborate at the beginning of this chapter. This is how bullying creeps up on who is mainly considered the ‘main bully’ even when they’re not. Because if the group leader does not discourage the group member from voicing their unwanted opinion about the easy target, then this will often escalate to them convincing the other members of the group to share the same opinion about the easy target. And that is often how actual bullying starts out. So even though the group’s leader is seen as the main bully, he can actually just be the ‘face’ of the group.

So if you’re getting bullied by someone in a group, rather than the leader of that group. Then you can consider just walking up to the leader and speaking to them 1-on-1, telling them about that guy and how you know he can stop it from escalating. I can guarantee that some group leaders are far more understanding that you’d think resolving these problems by directly addressing the group leader can resolve the issue entirely, rather than trying to resolve the issue through school officials.

**Preventing future bullying and how psyche plays a huge part in this:**

When a group of people meet for the first time, they’ll immediately start to (subconsciously) work on establishing some kind of hierarchy between each other. People will immediately recognize any signs of weakness such as posture and will act accordingly. Not getting bullied starts from the very first time you meet someone, especially when it’s in a group setting. As soon as the hierarchy has been established, the bullying / keeping in check of those lower on the hierarchy will bear it’s fruit. If you end up at the bottom on of this hierarchy, you won’t even be able to achieve something as simple as walking next to the group-leader when your group decides to go somewhere. I can guarantee you that you’ll be walking in the back, thinking it’s your own choice, which it is in the case where you’ve gotten accustomed to walking in the back of the group. Okay, this social status isn’t a bad thing at all and it also isn’t the reason you’ll get bullied. But the attitude that got you placed in that social status IS the reason you’re susceptible to being bullied. Sometimes on the same day or in the same week, at some point someone in the group will start looking to secure their current or a higher status within the hierarchy at the cost of another person in this hierarchy (classrooms also have hierarchies). They will do this by picking an easy target (or a harder target depending on their confidence) within the hierarchy, and they’ll try to poke at the target with remarks so they can determine a starting threshold which ultimately leads to the feeling of bullying that will make their target feel miserable most of the time. This is also how others will either shoot down the aggressor (the harder target) or join in in bashing the easy target together with the aggressor, to further their own agenda. More confident guys will often pick the harder target (a potential bully) and will therefore shoot to the top of the hierarchy within a short time span. I’m sure you’ve seen this happen a few times, such as when a classmate become popular very quickly after transferring into your class. This is how they do it. This is how it all starts and it’s also the reason that you often hear about bystanders not helping out when a classmate / friend gets bullied. Because if they speak up, they will be confronted by the aggressor and unless they ‘win’, they’ll be more susceptible to bullying because their place within the hierarchy took a hit. There’s a lot more depth to it, such as when someone on the low end of the hierarchy challenges someone on the high end, then bystanders will butt in to bash on the one on the low end of the hierarchy, because it’s a safe way to secure their place, which means that the one on the high end of the hierarchy does not even have to say a word. This is why you might feel powerless when you decide to call out your bully on their behavior.

**On the fence-bullying:**

These are the kind of bullies who make you feel bad one day, but act like your friend on another day. They'll be especially kind to you when they need you, such as when they're paired up with you during a school or work assignment. These bullies are mostly harmless when you confront them and you can just calmly, but firmly give them an ultimatum telling them that you do not like the way they often treat you and that it confuses you. You can tell them that if they do not change their attitude towards you, you'll see them as someone not worth treating as a friend, regardless of their stance on the subject. From that point on the ball is in your court and all you have to do is to go through with it if they do not wish to meet the terms of your ultimatum. It’s not like you’ll lose a friend over it.

**The bully that threatens with violence to keep you in check:**

The only reason they threaten to resort to violence is when you did something they did not approve of, which is a step in the right direction. And in order to stop this bully from harassing you, you’ll have to make him decide that bullying you takes up too much risk, time &amp; effort compared to what they get out of it (in terms of social status / approval of others).

I once got into a fight with a classmate who pretended that he was calling all his friends and that they would wait for me after school, so his nephew could beat me up. I told him he either shakes my hand or I beat him up right then and there, before his friends and nephew arrived. And that I would beat him up every single time I'd see him, if he went through with this. He shook my hand and made a comment about how I was trembling in fear. But what he did not know that the adrenaline surging through me made me tremble, and I already had my fist clenched and I was so ready to throw him through the entire classroom if he did not comply.

A passive way of creating more retaliation-risk is to start working out as it does so much more for you than just make you look more dangerous in the case you’ll ever retaliate. This also makes him think twice before physically threatening you again.

An aggressive way of doing it is to work on your roasting skills, as in insulting/degrading/denigrating him so that each time he tries to make a quick remark that is directed at you, he’ll have to hope you won’t retaliate verbally, because that could hurt his status.

Another aggressive way of stopping your bully is to go crazy at a carefully planned moment and keeping up with it as long as he does not back off. You plan for this by standing up for yourself up to a point where you’re guaranteed to get insulted by him each time you see him. Then when a teacher is nearby, you confront him and tell him he annoys you. Or you drop the word “bullying” during your confrontation. He’ll either stay quiet and you can walk away while insulting him and dropping the line “And don’t threaten to beat me up after school under the protection of your friends, because some day you’ll be alone and then I’ll strangle you with your own intestines”. The teacher will probably intervene when you say this, which is just as good as them letting you walk after saying all that. Just make sure you stay calm and collected and smile at your bully. Nothing is as dangerous to a bully as a victim claiming to want to kill them with a smile. In case he does not stay quiet and provokes you during the confrontation, that’s when you physically attack him and try to do as much damage as you can. There’s no reason not to a chair or something else to hit him with, as long as you really put on a show. It also does not matter if he’s stronger than you because the teacher will break you up as quickly as possible. After that, you’ll drop that same graphic line that I shared earlier. And you’ll probably both have to meet with the principal. Make sure you do not apologize and be very vocal about his bullying and how you refuse to forgive him. Getting expelled for a week isn’t a punishment, it’s the best case scenario. And storming out of the principal’s office isn’t a bad thing either. Just make sure you make a scene on your way out and be sure to do it all with a smile. Because as soon as you’re back in school, nobody will try to mess with you as long as you don’t revert back to your bully-prone self. It sucks to be called the crazy kid, but unlike bullying, people won’t say it to your face. But you’ll also be surprised by the amount of people saying that what you did was justified. And you’ll now be given more space to develop into the person you want to be, instead of always being constrained by bullies.

You really have to ride the crazy train on this one. But if you’re forced to do this, then you have nothing to lose and everything to gain, while they have nothing to gain and everything to lose.

**The reason why I focus only on male bullies with this post:**

Even though women also have almost the same hierarchy as men, their ways of bullying are often less direct and more concealed / harder to pinpoint, and far more destructive.

**TL;DR:**

The process to stopping a bully is real easy, but preparing to undertake the process can be quite hard. Bullying isn’t so much about why the bully does it, but about why you’re chosen as the victim. To stop bullying, you’ll have to realize what makes a bully decide on you as the victim in the same way a criminal decides on who to rob. Criminals (in general) are deterred when the profit does not exceed the risk by a large margin. Once you realize that bullies often have something to gain from bullying you, of which the most common gain is social status, then you can deter them by lessening the appeal of bullying by decreasing the gap between the cost &amp; gain of bullying you.

Through generous scholarships, good faith money from Grandma, and sheer luck, I was able to complete my undergrad at a decent Florida university and have been left with no debt. I was able to start saving during school thanks to two well paid internships and now have good job in the infosec department of a very large company that, after working in other careers in other businesses, has proven to be a place I could see myself working at for at least the next decade. As a result, my current situation is as follows:

Here's what I have:

* $50,000 in a big bank savings account that earns a few cents every month

* A mutual fund (with administrative fees) of about $10,500 in pretty low risk investments, with irregular contributions
* An employer 401k of about $16,000 in divvied up into a mix of low and moderate risk Roth funds with a 50% match up to 8%, which I contribute to fully every paycheck
* A monthly take home of $3500, after taxes and benefits and contributions and all that
* Monthly savings of about $1500 of that take home money
* About $1500 of the monthly take home in a checking account at all times
* A paid off, two year old sedan
* No debt, outside of a credit card I use for buying all my compulsory stuff. I religiously pay the full statement balance
* Good credit with no blemishes on the report 

Here's what I *think* I'd like to achieve:

* A relatively low risk place for the majority of what's in my savings account that isn't just wasting away against inflation
* A place I can stick most of that money at once in a big lump sum (unless that's not a good idea). I plan to hang onto that savings account with at least a few months of pay in there for emergency
* Saving more per month, because I spend probably too much on food and crap
* Retirement as early as possible

Here's my questions:

* What are my options for less risky places I can stick the majority of my savings account into? This is the biggest question 
* all the advice and options I have gotten from the internet and people in my life has become overwhelming and I feel like I just need a big pros/cons list of every thing possible. I promise I've read the rules but I feel like I'm already doing everything suggested.
* Of the bullets I've listed above, is there anything I should change or improve on?
* Should I get a standalone IRA? I don't like the idea of being able to only contribute $5500 per year into it.
* Should I just move my savings into my 401k and/or my mutual fund?
* I've been reading about how credit unions provide good rates on... stuff. What stuff can/should I be considering putting my money into that's typically offered by a credit union?
* I don't have any inclination to start investing stocks and stuff myself because I feel like I care too little about making *a lot* of money to put in that kind of effort - I've no desire to learn how to start trading even as a hobby. Does my situation warrant a broker working on my behalf? Is that a stupid thing to suggest considering I'm shooting for low risk?
* Should I just go with getting a brokerage account some where? I *really* don't like the idea of keeping track of the ups and downs of where my money is invested.
* Is buying land a dumb option at this point? I like the idea because land is only getting more scarce. I wouldn't want it necessarily to flip for a profit, but instead to hold onto for personal use upon retirement. I realize land is a ridiculously complicated purchase, especially out of state.
* I've read from this sub's wiki that a financial adviser/planner is generally not encouraged, but does my case warrant serious consideration of one?
* Should I be considering a house or something? Either for personal ownership or renting out? I don't have a location in mind yet that I'd like to personally settle down in just yet.


tl;dr: Anything you guys can suggest to just help me limit my options to a couple of things that are right for me and this sum of money in my savings account would be really, really really really really really really really really appreciated."

45xjyn,10,2016-02-15,Education is a cult,redditadminsarecucks,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/45xjyn/education_is_a_cult/,"###Education is a cult 

by Daryl Withycombe

It’s late 2012, when I walk down the train station and find myself greeted by the sight of at least a dozen girls of upper-middle class background in identical clothing, hair coloured in various shades of blonde, aspiring members of a local student fraternity. What’s supposed to draw attention however, are the oversized diapers they’re wearing, complete with fake stains of feces and urine.

Living in a nation that was at the peak of its education bubble back then, this didn’t surprise me as much as it otherwise might have. I was used by then to seeing guys my age in expensive suits, swimming in the canals while a group of guys on shore yelled orders at them through a megaphone. I memorized the incident, not because it shocked me, but because it serves like nothing else as a painfully visible symptom of an unspeakable taboo: Education is a farce.

At the end of every year, a new group of graduates prostrates before their faculty staff, as one kid or another gives a lame speech on what kind of hopeless incompetents they were before they attended college and how they are now ready to become productive members of society. It is not unlike a cult, where members see themselves as worthless and hopeless, all of their value derived not from their inherent qualities but rather from the cult they joined.

Education is a sacred cow and Malala is our generation’s Mother Theresa. If there is a problem in our society, we expect that it will be addressed through education. Problems as diverse as teenage pregnancies, unemployment, overpopulation, homophobia and mass sexual assaults on the streets can all be solved most effectively through education, or so we are told. It remains a mystery to me how people ever managed to get by before we all went to college.

I’ve heard that many people, typically the babyboomer generation, remember college not as a time they spent in limbo memorizing a variety of facts they’d never use again, but rather, as the greatest time of their lives. This raises the question of what these people consider to be important in life.

If you’re into having meaningless sex with people you don’t care about while intoxicated, or doing fake work that’s stuffed into a shelf as soon as soon as it is graded because you’re presumed to be too incompetent to do real work, then college must be a terrific place to be. For much of my social circle however, college appears to have been a time of ennui, confusion and depression. This is the other side of the story that’s heard less commonly.

Perhaps college seems great to people, because the period that follows it for which college sets you up is such a miserable one. Because you have to spend four years of your life hiding your working class background by using borrowed money to participate in the opulent lifestyle of your peers, you’re left with a big debt to pay back. You can’t combine socially mandated alcohol abuse and factoid memorization with a part-time job, unless you’re doing a worthless major perhaps.

If you’re at the age where you attend college, you have dreams about the future. You once wanted to be a superhero or a princess, but by now you have become slightly more realistic. Now you want to be a historian, a fashion designer, a creative writer, a journalist, a psychologist, a video game developer, or something along those lines. In all likelihood, even that’s not realistic, so you will end up doing something else, something that HR decided requires a four year college degree to filter out applicants, yet never allows you to use any of the information you spent most of your youth painstakingly memorizing.

If you’re a guy, perhaps you will do tech support or customize software for big corporate clients. If you’re a woman, perhaps you work in human resources or answer the phone and welcome visitors. If you haven’t given up yet on whatever ambition you had, you might be doing some internship somewhere. You’re promised an actual paid job in the future that will allow you to pay back your debt, but it probably won’t happen.

If you have working class parents who meant well, they probably told you that you can do whatever you want as long as you work hard. They didn’t set out to mislead you. They had mediocre jobs themselves, that left them feeling unfulfilled and drained them of their mental energy. Hence you saw them sit in front of the television every afternoon and were impatient to leave the demotivating atmosphere you grew up in, trading a house you have to share with family for a concrete box you share with miserable drunks. They hoped your future would be better, because that’s the only thing that kept them going.

I’ve written this article too late, because by now, much of the above is becoming common knowledge. Most people now realize that what you’re told about your job prospects after college is a fraud, pushed by colleges that hope to keep their staff employed by drawing in ever more shmucks. If it was not a fraud, we’d have embassies around the world the size of Vatican city, as practically every soft major seems to promise to its students that you “can work at an embassy”. Another tip for young people: If your major claims that its graduates can be found in all sorts of jobs, you’ll be last in line regardless of where you apply.

What hasn’t been lost yet however, is the fetish for education that our society has, even as we come to acknowledge that college education is no longer a guaranteed ticket for upward social mobility. College education is still seen as installing virtues in our people, as being part of a process that people have to go through to become model citizens.

As the college bubble began to inflate further and the genuine value of a degree outside of its societal associations continued to decline, the explanations for why everyone needs to go to college became ever more broad and ridiculous. “College teaches you how to think critically.” “College teaches you how to learn.” Apparently people have to spend four years of their adult lives figuring out how to think and learn. Why this has to cost tens of thousands of dollars a year and how binge drinking, beer pong and college sports matches contribute to this goal is still somewhat shrouded in mystery for me.

College to me, appeared to be a haven of hypocricy. I have to think back of the far-left Poli sci student of bourgeois background, who scoffed at her roommate, because he’s an adult man who works in a store. Or, perhaps I should mention the son of a college professor, who laughed at me after he asked me what my parents do for a living. It is today more than ever, a playground for the crotch-fruit of our bourgeoisie, where they are instructed in today’s socially fashionable ideas they will have to parrot if they do not wish to be at the centre of tomorrow’s social media scandal.

Does college promote or discourage social mobility? The answer isn’t as clearcut as you might think. According to one estimate in the United States, 44% of children from bottom quartile income families with a 1200-1600 range SAT score graduate college, compared to 52% of children from top income quartiles with 800-999 SAT scores.1 Part of the problem is that students from poor families have a much greater chance of dropping out. Among the bottom quartile, 29% attend college and 9% complete college. Among the highest quartile 80% attend college and 54% graduate from college.

In the United States, trends like affirmative action for minorities in combination with legacy admissions for WASPs ensure that poor whites and asians stand little chance at the most prestigious colleges. It’s clear that in the United States, some simple changes to the system would make the system more meritocratic, but it’s not designed to be meritocratic, it’s merely designed to appear as such.

To some degree however, these are factors that are inherent to college. It’s a universally observed phenomenon that gifted students tend not to graduate college. In Canada, the estimate is that a mere forty percent of gifted children will complete an undergraduate degree or pursue graduate studies.2 In the Netherlands, a mere sixteen percent of gifted children will ever graduate from a university.3 In other words, even when you try to incorporate college into a meritocratic system, you’ll probably fail to do so.

It has to be noted here that even if graduation rates were perfectly equal for different social classes, it wouldn’t leave us with a meritocratic system. Why is that? The poor appear prone to select different majors than the rich. Wealthy parents understand what degrees are useful and the necessity of building a social network with other rich kids, whereas poor parents typically have no such idea. They struggle to tell apart a bullshit degree from a useful one and would rather not see their children dragged along to drinking societies.

Why do children from poor families fail to graduate college? Lack of wealth is one factor, but there are other factors involved too. One problem is the inevitable cultural difference the children encounter, they end up fitting in nowhere. Their accents stand out, their views on society may be too “cynical”. They find that their peers are buying houses and cars, while they live frugally in an effort to afford college.

Children from poor backgrounds intuitively seem to want to see their work sustain society, whereas children from wealthier backgrounds intuitively want to mingle with the right crowd and feel in charge. Volunteer for a small local charity if you want to understand how these processes work out. Volunteers from poor backgrounds will generally seek to be physically active, volunteers from wealthier backgrounds will want to sit around discussing things and invent new titles for themselves.

I doubt this has ever been scientifically investigated, but I can think of different potential explanations for this phenomenon. Children with poor parents grew up seeing parents who were physically active. Fathers fixed broken ceilings, plumbing and machines at home. Mothers made food, necessary purchases, cleaned the house and helped the children.

Children with wealthier parents didn’t see their parents too often. The parents hired people to do necessary work for them and spent a lot of time socializing with other wealthy people in formal settings. Thus we may expect children to be intuitively attracted to the tasks their parents carry out.

In addition, we have to note that a high level of intelligence does not per definition have to be correlated with the correct mindset needed to be part of the managing class. Children who lose the genetic lottery may be intelligent and interested in physical labor, or not so intelligent and interested in socializing and ordering other people around.

Now that we’ve established that college isn’t per definition meritocratic and probably can’t be reformed into something meritocratic, the question becomes what we should do about it. My suggestion would be to do away with the pretense of having a meritocratic society and instead build a society where most people feel as if they are in the right place. How would we go about this? It seems to me that we would have to deindustrialize our society on a large scale.

This would then allow us to have a society where most people would have to be physically active throughout the day, rather than having to compensate for a sedentary lifestyle in a gym. A low to moderate level of physical activity spread out throughout the day would be ideal. Nobody ever suggests that the conflict between full scale employment and automation has to be resolved by favoring employment at the cost of automation, but this to me appears to be the best solution.

The Japanese banned firearms to preserve their feudal society, why can’t we ban technologies that threaten labor that psychologically satisfies us? We might not miss the coal mines and the weaving sheds, but certainly there must be people who miss sailboats, goat herding and theatre performances. If you respond to this suggestion by declaring that we can’t reverse the tide, it merely illustrates that technology is a force outside of our control that can just as easily make our lives worse as it can make them better, which proves that continual technological progress is a tremendous danger.

I don’t personally agree with the value of meritocracy. I think social stratification itself is a major problem. A life spent bossed around by others is as miserable as a life spent ordering other people around. One man loses his freedom, the other his camaraderie and participation in the physical world. Still, it should be simple to make our society more meritocratic.

The first step would be to ban employers from asking for college degrees. Instead, employers should administer tests. If your job requires a non-specified four year college degree, certainly you should be capable of coming up with a test to test whatever knowledge learned in college is necessary for the job. Employers in the US seem wary however, because of Griggs v. Duke Power co, a supreme court decision that would obviously have to be reversed.

The problem of course is that most employers don’t demand a four year college degree because of the knowledge imparted, but rather to cut down on applicants and be left with dependable candidates from a similar background. Businesses want employers with college degrees and bourgeois backgrounds for the same reason Chinese companies hire white guys in suits to give speeches: It generates trust and the appearance of competence. Businesses can’t admit to any of this as they’re caught in a paradox, having both a social obligation to be diverse and a financial obligation to project a bourgeois image.

There is another problem here however, which is that governments have a motive to send all their young to college. College generates the illusion of social mobility, which keeps minorities and the poor complacent. In addition, it keeps the young off the labor market for four years and generates employment for staff, while encouraging students to continue spending money through large loans. The typical government won’t just throw money into the black hole that is education, it will figure out how to teach its public to demand ever more education.

This is all nice and well, some of you might say, but at the end of the day we’ll still need doctors, engineers and scientists, all skills you won’t learn by yourself through a library subscription. To preempt the otherwise inevitable remark, let me make clear that I’m not suggesting we could abolish colleges tomorrow. Could we reduce college attendance by 90%, with no harm to our way of life? Probably.

Those jobs that quite clearly do require a college degree tend to be excessive in ways people fail to understand. Healthcare is subject to diminishing returns, much of our money in healthcare is spent prolonging the lives of people whose quality of life has dropped so much that we are doing them a disservice by keeping them alive.

Much of our disease burden could be eliminated by focusing more on preventative care instead, by improving the quality of our diet for example. The explosion in psychiatric care costs is largely brought on by our modern excessively stressful lifestyle. Considering that 49.6% of medical students suffer burnout symptoms and 11.2% are suicidal, the medical sector effectively generates its own customers.4

The question that becomes important to ask by now is: When does this bubble finally burst? A variety of apocalyptic scenarios could be imagined that would make college education obsolete, but if business as usual continues, the cause of death of the college industry will be Moravec’s paradox, a problem that our policymakers seem to be completely unaware of.

What’s Moravec’s paradox? Moravec’s paradox is the observation by artificial intelligence researchers, that computers are much better at high-level reasoning than at low-level sensorimotor skills. In English, the computer isn’t going to steal Joe Sixpack’s job, it’s going to render our upper class unemployed.

We can teach computers to beat us at chess, gamble in the stock market, decide on medical procedures or issue financial advice much better than we can teach them to deliver mail, clean a toilet, recognize a person’s face or figure out the type of fabric you have in your hands. This makes perfect sense, as our bodies evolved over billions of years to carry out physical tasks, while our cognitive skills evolved relatively quickly.

Contrary to what you might think, you excel at physical tasks, you’re rather poor at anything that requires us to think. The same goes for all humans, including our policymakers who seem to have thought that computers would create numerous highly skilled jobs. What they have created is an overeducated generation, that has taken over the values of the bourgeoisie but will be unable to take over their jobs.

The white collar jobs our college graduates hope to take over tend to lead to depression and bourgeois ennui. A college educated womb has for this reason, long been known to be a barren one. Banks still need employees, but an autistic Phd graduate who programs trade algorithms for a living does not quite lend himself as a source of aspiration, whereas the men yelling orders on Wall Street still had a certain romantic appeal. Perhaps we should thus be thankful to computers, because they have saved us all the burden of suffering a bourgeois existence.

45y987,2,2016-02-15,Unusual Background in MSCS -&gt; How do I position myself?,CitizenKeen,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/45y987/unusual_background_in_mscs_how_do_i_position/,"So many questions in this subreddit seem focused on either 22 year olds entering the industry with a BS, or 30-somethings who went to code school. I'm a little in the middle and I feel a little lost as to how to best position myself.

I live in Portland, OR and intend to stay here. (My wife and I have strong family connections.) I went to Reed College (a local school) and majored in English Lit. I worked for years before going to law school. Worked as a lawyer for a few years before discovering coding. Instead of going to code school, I had a unique opportunity to pursue an MSCS at Portland State and am now in my early thirties trying to get going.

So. I'm in an MSCS program. I get data structures and algorithms, and I've done the requisite amount of C and assembly. But I'm also fascinated with Node and Ruby and Clojure. I've got a research position doing some database-related stuff (not super computer sciencey, but still getting me writing a lot of code).

So in the plus column, I've got a lot of related assets: real-world work experience, a strong understanding of corporate and IP law, I'm on the board for a local tech non-profit, etc. In the minus column, I've only been in tech for about two years, and even though I'm smart and hardworking, there's only so much I can absorb. I haven't had three undergrad summers for internships. I haven't had any downtime to do a lot of OS contributions (between three master's levels classes, my work, and my family, I'm pretty taxed out).

I feel like the bar for what I'm looking for is low. I don't care about big salary (~$50K is perfectly fine), I don't care about tech stack (Java and C# are as fascinating to me as Go and Rust), and I'm probably more comfortable in an enterprise environment than in a startup environment (though the beer and ping pong scenario would be nice, too). Mostly I just want to end up in a place with mentorship opportunities because I'm making up for lost time. The only real hitch is my lack of internships and I have to stay local.

**So how do I position myself?** I think I'm an ideal fit for the right company, I just need to find it. I'm looking for internships for this summer, but I'm focusing on companies big enough to absorb me in the fall if I'm awesome. I have a wide but shallow net of contacts (haven't been in the industry long enough). Unsure how to highlight what I'm awesome for.

Any tips?

(Resume [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ru77hw3gnn64syo/Emerson_Resume.pdf?dl=0) - I am pretty public about my username, but I redacted anyway.)


**tl;dr:** I'm a lawyer with most of an MSCS who wants a job or internship in Portland. How do I highlight ways I'm awesome?

**Edit:** Okay, so rebuild the resume. Got it, and thank you. But is there anything else I can do to put my best foot forward as someone with a unique skillset."

He agreed and we book hotels, airplane tickets, and concert tickets. He planned the itinerary for the weekend and we were both excited.


We arrived on the 13th, went out, had a blast, and came back to the hotel. We were going to do ""it"" before we went out again to sight-see around midnight, but he told me he felt dirty and that after sightseeing, he would take a shower and then do it with me. But, when we came back, it was late ~3AM, and he just ended up taking a shower and then falling asleep. Usually we would cuddle when sleeping, but I was upset and when he cuddled me, I left to wash up because I had expected you know. I washed up and came back to bed. He was already asleep cuddling a pillow, and whenever I hugged him from the back or tried to hold his hand, he would push me away saying, ""Don't touch me when I'm sleeping. I can't sleep if you touch me."" I was shocked because he never said that to me before when we slept together and usually when we sleep together, he would ALWAYS have his arm around me. I'm thinking, ""So, he would rather cuddle a pillow to sleep than his girlfriend. OK."" I couldn't sleep that night, because I was fuming.


The next morning, he knew something was up and asked me what was wrong with me. We checked out of the hotel, and had the rest of the day planned with fun activities to do on Valentine's Day before going to the airport that night (flight leaves at midnight). I told him what was bothering me, and he replied that if we want to do it, I would need to take a shower every time before we do it. I said OK. Then, he said, he would rather cuddle a pillow than me because the pillow was cold and felt nice, whereas I'm a body with heat and he was already hot.


I was upset by his response and ignored him (walking at least 10 steps behind him) while we were walking to brunch together, and when he stopped for a smoke, I walked and left ahead of him, and lost him. I left my cell phone with him, so I had to go to the lobby of the brunch place, and ask to call him. When we met up, he was upset, and I was still upset. He then finally said, ""You ruined this day. We're going to the airport now."" I was shocked. I apologized, and asked him to reconsider, but he is a stubborn person.


We ended up eating brunch in silence with his looking at his cell phone the entire time, and telling me not to talk to him when I tried to talk to him. He told me I could either go with him to the airport now, or I could stay and meet him at the airport later that night. I ended up just going with him to the airport, and he just slept the entire day until our flight at midnight. I was just sitting there trying to talk to him, but he wouldn't have it. I ended up just doing nothing at the airport, crying.


We talked after the flight, and he told me, ""I could've actually just had fun after what happened, but I needed to punish you. That's reality. You needed to learn your lesson. I told you multiple times to stop doing what you were doing, but you just completely ruined my day.""


I was shocked. He could have bounced back and had fun, but chose NOT to because I needed to learn my lesson?


I asked him, ""So if you do something wrong and I get upset, should I punish you too?"" He said, ""Yeah."" I mean no way would he be okay with that. If every time any of us made a mistake, we have a punishment, wouldn't it just create more resentment and a cycle of punishments? I asked him, ""Wouldn't it have been better to move on and try to enjoy even though it may be difficult?"" He just chuckled in disbelief.


OK, I learned my lesson: I know I was stupid for wanting to talk about what was bothering me during vacation and being so upset over something so little, and should have talked to him AFTER so our Valentine's weekend wouldn't be ruined, but I don't know. I feel like he was just taking it too far. He told me he didn't want to talk about this ever again, and that talking about it would just make us fight even more.


It's still bothering me. I'm back home (I live 3 hours away from him), and he's not answering his phone (probably asleep). I can't sleep or eat, because I'm so stressed. I told him I am stressed because of what happened, and he said, ""It's your fault this happened. That's on you. You cope with it."" So, I'm asking how do I cope with what's happened? 


**tl;dr**: Bf and I went on Valentine's weekend vacation, and when I got upset, he got upset, and stopped our vacation short and spent the whole Valentine's in the airport with his sleeping and my just doing nothing. Bf said he could've bounced back and had fun, but I needed a punishment and knew I would be affected. How do I cope with this?

EDIT: Wow, you guys are right. I was basically doing the same thing to him because I didn't like his response. I didn't even realize this until you guys pointed it out.

EDIT2: I texted him a detailed apology, and he said he still had fun regardless. He also told me he sent me something in the mail for Valentine's Day. I'm not sure if he understands what he did was extreme...maybe he does and he's just not telling me. Anyways, I am planning on working on myself and distancing myself a bit so I don't rely on him too much. I am also planning on calling my school's counseling services tomorrow to see if I could get some introspective/self esteem help. I knew I had self-esteem and insecurity issues, but I never really addressed it. I'm going to be busy anyway with my internship, research, classes, grad school apps and grad school entrance exam, so distancing may be easier. I feel a lot better. Thank you for your replies!"

You want to measure them in terms of extreme performance or in terms of extreme satisfaction. It's a time to try stuff--explore the possibilities.""  

(For context, Kelly dropped out of college and spent his 20s backpacking around Asia and the Middle East.  It seems to have worked out for him).

I have no friends and don't live near any family, so have no one to turn to. If just one person learns from my heartbreak and mistakes that will be enough for me. I'm not even sure if I'm asking for advice, a shoulder to cry on, or I just want to talk.

This will be quite long, so here goes.

I met my current SO almost 6 years ago now. We met online playing a social video game and very quickly became inseparable. We would play together and talk on Skype together. Now these Skype conversations were long, very long, I'm talking from the time we'd wake up, or come home from work/uni right up until we went to sleep. Some of these conversations were upward of 12 hours long. Is that unhealthy? Perhaps. Now we obviously spent a lot of time getting to know one another. We would spend hours talking, playing games and watching the same movie together. This went on for almost two years before we ever met. That's a crazy long time. So you could assume that we knew each other insanely well and we were really close. Now when we met I'd been going through some harder times, I don't know if I was depressed but if I wasn't, I look back and think I was definitely on that road. As a result, I was the sort of person to keep everyone at arms length and never let myself get too close to anyone. I sort of expected to be let down by people and didn't allow myself to get hurt. This fundamental flaw in my personality has led me to a world of hurt. I did much the same with my SO. I always insisted we were just friends and treated him in a way much less than he deserved. I never did anything out of my way to make him happy, or professed any feelings. I was stubborn, snappy and demanding. I didn't put myself out there for fear of getting hurt. That was just me, unfortunately. He made no secret that he liked me. Me just being there to talk to was enough to make him happy. 

At the time, he was living in New Zealand and I was living in Australia. After a bit over a year of talking, he moved to Australia, not to the same city, but the city where I dearly wanted to live. I can only assume this was for me, as much as he did want to get out of New Zealand, he had no real other reasons to drop out from his current uni, leave his job and leave his family. 6 months later, I decided to make the move to the same city, and we would live together. I had no money, no savings, nothing. I could never have done this without him. I was stuck in a town where the university didn't offer what I wanted to study. No one wanted to hire people over the age of 18. I also couldn't get any government help to move to the closest capital to study. I was truly stuck where I was living and had no light at the end of the tunnel moving forward. Helping me to move, and getting out of that rut, is probably the most self sacrificial thing anyone has done for me, and I do truly wonder what would have happened to me if I'd kept being stuck there. As you can see, he seems pretty great so far. Me? Not so much.

So after a very quick turnaround, we'd moved in together. As much as I'd denied having feelings for him, I think I did. Other people had commented on it to me before and assumed that I had liked him, so maybe I was the only person that couldn't see it. We soon started dating. We'd gone from only having talked online, to moving in together, to dating so soon after meeting for the very first time. It wasn't conventional by any means. Now you get to hear all about how I've taken advantage of his generosity and never shown any gratitude. He was working full time in retail to cover his living expenses and therefore was also covering mine while I got back on my feet. It took me 6 months to find a permanent full time job that I stuck with. 6 months of his one retail salary keeping us both afloat. I was 21 at the time so I was receiving a job seeker allowance from the governement, so I did contribute something, but mostly just rent and bills. The rest of the burden fell to him. When I was short of money, he covered absolutely everything. As it currently stands, I still owe him about $6,000. Things got better after I started working. I paid off my credit card. We took a small holiday to Sydney together and we were pretty much in our honeymoon period. Things seemed to be looking good. Though through this time, I never showed one shred of appreciation for what he'd done for me. He had saved me. And I being who I am, just took it all for granted. Even though I know how insanely stressful it was for him. Wondering if he had enough money for rent, for food, for bills. He did that for me.

It gets worse.

After working for around 10 months, we'd both decided that we needed to go back to univerisity. We hated our retail jobs and university was always the end game. So we chose a university and enrolled in the same diploma. This diploma carried on into a bachelor with a number of different pathways, but for the first year, we had every single class together. I think this hurt our relationship a lot. After both working full time, we were both suddenly spending all day together, 5 days a week. Now, you would think that you love your SO, you could easily spend that much time together. I thought so too. Our relationship became so argumentative during this time. We were simply spending too much time together in close quarters. On top of the stress of studying, he still had to work at least 20 hours a week to afford anything. I worked for a short while through studying but once again, was unemployed and let him pick up the slack where I fell short with money. From the honeymoon period, I also wasn't a very good girlfriend, not in the slightest. I've come to realise that I'm a very selfish person on top of everything else. I wasn't anything that I should have been for him. Sure, I stayed at home when not at uni and cooked and cleaned etc. But that was it. I never surprised him at the end of the day when he came home from work. I was never overly affectionate, just holding his hand, kissing him or cuddling him. I never made him feel loved, or wanted, or appreciated. And probably the biggest thing for a guy, I never initiated sex. Ever. This may sound like excuses, maybe they are, maybe the aren't, I'm just trying to reason it out with myself. First, I'm not happy with how I look and never have been, I hate what I see in the mirror and for this reason I do shy away from revealing myself to him. Though he has never given any indication that he dislikes how I look. Second, I do have PCOS. Whether or not this is affecting my sex drive, I really don't know. I've been on quite a number of different medications over the years and had a gyno that pretty much laughed at me the one and only time I brought up sex to him. I don't dislike sex with him, at all, I just never started it. He would always come to me and I would do it, sometimes begrudgingly. Now, he mentioned this a few times, about how he wanted me to start it and how it made him feel. He felt unattractive and unwanted and that I only did it to please him, and I understand that now. I just wasn't ever what he needed me to be for him.

So, back to the uni. Towards the end of our first year, things were getting bad. We were basically just two people living together at this point. We argued a lot. Then in came another guy. We still played the same game that we met on so we still played and interacted with other people on an almost daily basis. So one day, I met another player in a group that we played with. He tried to be welcoming towards me and we started to become friends. We did become good friends as we did have a lot in common and we did speak on Skype occasionally. My SO, HATED this. He got so insanely jealous of him and we began to argue even more. Nothing was going on and he was borderline asking me to not talk to this person. Which set my temper off like nothing else. I was livid. How could he be asking me to not talk to the only person I became friends with recently? That didn't go down well with me. But then this new friend did start to act a inappropriately to me. I knew he was interested and yet I still kept talking to him. He said sexually related things to me and I just brushed passed them and kept talking to him. I believe I was emotionally cheating at this point. Now things become a little bit hazy for me here as a lot happened at this time. This may not be in order. I approached my SO and said that I felt our relationship had gone stale. That I felt we didn't have a relationship and that maybe we shouldn't be in one. We hadn't broken up after this conversation but we soon would. We were both upset, but he more so than I. He also saw the written conversations between me and my friend and saw the sexual stuff that he had said to me. I think we were broken up at this point or on the verge of being broken up. He was furious that I let him talk to me this way. Especially with how non-sexual I had been towards my SO. I was furious that he had gone through my private conversations. Things really blew up. Things were not looking good. Our break up didn't exactly last very long, maybe it should have. I think within a week we were back together. Maybe we did need time apart.

Don't worry, I continue to be more selfish and unappreciative. Eventually I stop talking to this friend. In hindsight I should have stopped talking to him for my SO, but me being stubborn, I did it on my own terms. We hit the point where we were no longer studying together and had picked our own separate majors. We were finally not in each other's space all of the time. I continued to only half heartedly apply for casual jobs that we very much needed me to have. After another 6 months, my SO came to the realisation that he would have to put university on hold and continue working full time to pay for what he needed. As a NZ citizen he has to pay his fees upfront, whereas I don't. My fees go towards a student loan. So I didn't have to worry about the extra $8,000 a year in fees, he did. So for the next 12 months he has been working full time again and not progressing towards his degree, or his future. I applied for a scholarship for those in financial hardship and I did receive it, which helped a lot. I continued to study for these 12 months. Did I once thank him for putting his edcuation aside in favor of mine? No. Did I once consider that I should also put my education aside and start work again? Only if I didn't receive that scholarship. Did I once show any appreciation for what he was doing for me? No. Did I once act like the girlfriend I should have been? No. 

So the end of that 12 months brings us to the end of 2015. Through that 12 months I did the same as I always did. Not offering anything to my SO. Selfishly continuing to take, take, take. I was truly blind to what I had. I hit that point in my degree where it was time for me to undertake a paid internship. This paid internship would almost eliminate any money troubles we had going forward. I would work through 2016, while he studied. 2017 would come and he'd do his internship while I finished my last year. 2018 I would graduate and he would do his final year. Then 2019 we'd both be graduated. Starting with my internship, money would have never been a problem for us again. We were finally on the path to building the future we had always talked about. Getting married. Buying a house. Taking holidays. Having dogs. That was our dream. So I applied for internships and accepted an offer in November to begin in early January this year. From December onwards, I could feel something wasn't right. He was acting cold and distant towards me. We still argued but very infrequently. It honestly felt as though he was harbouring some form of hatred for me. At this time I think I also came to realise that our relationship wasn't really doing anything again. I made a few passing comments that we should do more stuff together, but never went any further than that. We'd moved back into a two bedroom apartment so that we could finally have some family come stay with us again, as we don't get to see anyone very much. My grandparents came to visit. His parents and sister came to visit. Our apartment is truly amazing. It feels like our first grown up home. Things were finally coming together for us. I thought.

Enter another girl. A new girl started working where he did. Now he's always been a friendly person, never hates anyone and is happy to be friends with everyone. So they start talking and texting, as he has done with almost every person he's ever worked with. Then they started talking a lot. Apparently they did have a fair bit in common. But he really was talking to her a lot. Even when his family was staying with us, he'd be texting her. I'd be home after work and he'd be texting her. We were watching the tennis and he was texting her. I was starting to get worried. Paranoid. Anxious. With how he'd been acting towards me and this, I was scared. I had reason to be. I did exactly what I got mad at him for, I went through his conversations. Though they'd gone past the just being friends. They were texting hundreds of times a day. They were basically acting like a couple. He was cheating on me. She'd moved store at this point so they weren't seeing each other at work. But he was cheating nonetheless. He was describing exactly what he wanted to do to her. Things he should have wanted to do to me. He was calling her sexy. Things he should have been saying to me. He was calling her babe. Something he should have been calling me. She sent him photos of herself in her underwear. He would lie at night in bed next to me, texting her, masturbating to her. Encouraging her to do the same. I was crushed. My whole world came crashing down. I felt sick. I still do.

This was two weeks ago. In that instant I'd pretty much decided that it was over and I needed to move out. I was searching for apartments and budgeting before I'd even confronted him about it all. I made plans to get myself out and cut him loose. Much like I did when we first met. Trying to get away and not let myself get hurt. Then he woke up and I confronted him. These last two weeks have been the worst in my entire life. I have truly woken up and realised everything that I had, everything I fucked up and everything that should have been. We've argued, we've screamed, we've cried. We've done it all. I've never been so heartbroken in my life.

I drove him to cheat. I'm not condoning the cheating, he should have spoken to me, he did tell the other girl that he was going to. I don't think that he meant for it to happen. But it did. Someone was finally paying him attention. Someone was making him feel wanted. Someone was willing to give him what he wanted and needed. I wasn't doing that for him. I just kept selfishly taking from him, assuming that he loved me enough to always be around. I made this happen. I accept that. He got led astray by wanting something that he should have had in the first place. I hate myself for this. He is the kind of person that tries to make everyone happy, ahead of himself. He never has a bad word to say about anyone. Never wishes ill on anyone. Never wants to hurt anyone. What kind of monster am I, that drove him to hurt me like this? I truly hate myself. I've royally fucked up. The funny thing is, I only realise a lot of what I've done now, or only now feel remorse for what I did. I already knew that I loved him. I already knew that I wanted to spend my life with him. But now, I realise just how much. I realise how horrible I was. I realise that he deserves better. 

We've talked a lot over the last two weeks. My emotions are all over the place. I keep swinging back from on extreme to the other. Sometimes I want nothing more than to stay and want this to work so desperately. I want to work through this. I still want to spend the rest of my life with him. He is my soul mate. Another part of the time I'm a mess. The thought of the two of them, what they did, what they said, leaves me so crushed. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. And I cry, wondering how I can move past it and trust him again. The other times I'm just empty. Moving on autopilot. I can 100% say that I love him and I want this. But he can't say the same right now. And that hurts even more. If we were to move forward we would both need to make changes. Big ones. To make this relationship whole again. To revive what we lost. To be there for each other. It's like a flick was switched for me, I'm so whole heartedly willing to make all the changes he needs. To be everything he needs. It's really been eye opening for me. Despite the fact that I was hurt so much. I can't help but blame myself for this. MY head tells me I deserve better and should leave. But do I deserve better? I treated him like my slave for 6 years and got burned doing so. He deserves better too. He should have left if it was so bad it drove him to cheat. 

Right now, we are still together. But barely. We're on a, break, I guess you could call it. We're sleeping in separate rooms and getting some time and space from one another. But mostly he's getting time and space away from me. He's figuring out if this is what he wants. If he wants to try and make this work. 6 years of conditioning might make him turn around and say he doesn't want this. Even if we begin to try, he may still turn around and say he can't do this. This terrifies me. Our relationship wasn't exactly a shining example, but I thought we were well and truly on our way to what we dreamed of. He is my whole world. I love him so dearly. The thought of losing him, well, I can't even comprehend the pain. And now, something I thought I had forever, might be lost. I've fucked up. I know that now. I accept that and I own it. I can 100% say that I am ready and willing to be what he needs. I'm adamant that I can change. I have changed. The rose tinted glasses are gone. I see everything so clearly. What we've both done wrong. What we both need to change. 

Don't do what I've done. If you love someone. Show you love them. The words aren't enough. If you appreciate what someone is doing for you, say it, don't let it go unsaid. The other person may think you're just being ungrateful. Relationships are not one sided, give as much as you take. You're both meant to be there for each other, as one unit, not one person bending to the other person's will. I've been the worst girlfriend to him and karma came to bite me for that. If this doesn't work out, I know that I deserve this and I know that he deserves better. None of this should have ever just been about me. Please don't fuck up like I did. Go show your SO just how much they mean to you. Apologise for any shitty things you've done. Make the changes you need to to be their world. 

My SO is a redditor, so he may see this, so I say to him... Know that I love you. I'm truly sorry for what I've done to bring us to this point. I forgive you for what you've done. As hard as it's going to be for me to move past this and forget, I do forgive you. Being cheated on has hurt me more than anything, but it pales in comparison to the thought of losing you. I hope you can forgive me too.

If you're still here, thank you for listening. I appreciate it.

I've met a lot of people cause of  my internship and done a lot of new things. I've been coming to the meetings late more and more and have barely been out in service. My parents have noticed and it finally came to header about a week ago. I basically brought many scandals recently and how I feel Org will keep pushing the armageddon. We had a long discussion and it basically ended with them saying that they think I'm confused would like to study more before I  make a final decision. So now I'm stuck in this position where I'm not in going to disfellowshipped but they are watching me then ever before now. Right now I'm wondering if I should just dissociate my self or move out. I'm just afraid of losing the relationship with my parents and having that conversation, they made it clear that if I'm living with them I can't just do what I want. At some point im going to have to make a decision and it really scares me. I feel like by the time I turn 20 this year, I'll no longer be talking to my parents.

45zi2p,3,2016-02-15,"Possibly getting back together with my ex[F 21], but things are going very slowly. Should I make a move or would that ruin it?[M 22]",soisos,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/45zi2p/possibly_getting_back_together_with_my_exf_21_but/,"**8 Months Ago**: My 2.5y relationship suddenly comes to an end. I discover that my GF has made a bunch of new, older friends at her new job (engineering internship) and has realized she is unsatisfied with the relationship. *I fully admit to getting lazy and being a mediocre boyfriend*. Things were never terrible, but they weren't excellent either. Very so-so. We hung out constantly but were so stressed from school and work that we let the relationship fall apart and become stagnant. While I was mostly okay with it, she suddenly was not, after a few weeks of talking about her discontentment, I realized there was nothing I could do to keep her and we ended it. I can say with 100% confidence that she didn't leave me for someone else and wasn't really interested in finding other people at the time, **she just wanted to be completely single during her first steps into adulthood**. TL;DR: **Relationship was stagnant, GF ended it because she felt it was only limiting her options**

A few weeks after, we started hanging out again. 1-2 times per week, we would just watch TV, get dinner, very casual. We have brief conversations over phone or text pretty much every day, and this has been going on for about 7 months. She's moved out to college but is still close enough by that we see eachother at least 2 times per month (I commute to a university from home). TL;DR **We immediately resumed friendship and it almost feels like we never broke up**

**Past 2 Months:**
 We've hung out every other weekend, when she comes home, and essentially spend the entire weekend together. Literally, I will go to her house friday evening, stay the night twice (we'll sleep in her queen-size bed, clothed, together. Occasional spooning/touching in the middle of the night but nothing explicitly romantic), and leave Sunday afternoon when she starts driving back to college. While hanging out, we'll watch TV shows and she's started leaning on my chest/shoulder while we watch. Each weekend, she takes it a *tiny* bit further and will let me put my arm around her and she leans on me more often.

#**Complete TL;DR**

**We didn't break up on bad terms. The breakup came somewhat out of nowhere, she suddenly felt trapped and decided she needed to end it. The relationship had withered and wasn't as good as it was before.  I (reluctantly) obliged and we've been friends since. Six months later, she's inviting me to sleep over and leaning on my chest. Never kissing/sex/holding hands/anything particularly romantic, but definitely more than normal friends**


#**My Question:**

I think she is clearly having second thoughts about the breakup and is considering taking me back. However, it's been almost two months and progress is extremely slow. My goal isn't to have sex with her or kiss her(neither of us would want to do anything too serious until we were actually dating), and I would most likely date her again if she wanted to. 

Should I be doing anything? Or do I continue waiting it out. **I don't want to make her seem like a bitch who is leading me on.** I am 100% certain that she has not been seeing anyone else and is completely aware of the implications of how she is treating me. However; I can only wait so long. I'm willing to give it another month or two, but eventually I need her to explain what's going on in her head. Do you think it's wise to let her keep calling the shots on this? Or should I start asking her to explain? I'm concerned that if I push her for an answer, it will become an ultimatum situation and she'll be forced to make a decision she doesn't want to. But I'm also afraid of letting it go for too long because it will make dating again feel weird (why did she wait so long?) or it will ruin our friendship and be very painful if she decides she doesn't want me back (months of hopefulness ending with rejection. Painful and awkward for both)

edit: I also feel like this whole ordeal has been a learning experience. I'm extremely regretful about my lazy behavior as a boyfriend and never want to repeat it. I was never abusive or aggressive, but I was under-attentive and used school/work as an excuse to neglect my responsibilities as an SO. The breakup was  a huge wake-up call and definitely needed to happen. I hope that I could be a good boyfriend a second time around, or at least in my next relationship should this one fail to happen."
45zjsq,10,2016-02-15,I feel like I'm failing,ZiggyStarcat,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/45zjsq/i_feel_like_im_failing/,"So I'm a full-time single mom of my 2.5 year old son. His father lives in another country, and even if he didn't he wouldn't be any help. I've been doing this alone since I found out I was pregnant. 

I'm currently in a master's program. I go to school from 2:30pm to 10:30pm twice a week (with a 1 hour commute including walking) and do an internship once a week that requires me to get up at 5am after not getting home until 11:30 the night before. 

I'm just so tired. My son is being a terror all the time. Throwing, hitting, screaming at the top of his lungs. I can't take it. I can only do my schoolwork when he is sleeping and I never get any time to myself. The last time my parents took my son overnight was over 5 weeks ago. They usually only get him around 4pm (bedtime is 7) and then bring him back a couple hours after he wakes up. They were supposed to have him last weekend but my mom texted me at midnight saying she was sick and couldn't have him the next day (never mind that she had just spent the whole day with her friends at a party-like sporting event). 

I'm so overwhelmed. He has time-out at least 7-8 times a day, sometimes more. I feel like when I wake up, I'm just counting down until his nap, then when he wakes up in counting down until his bedtime. I tried to talk to my parents about it and they just told me I like to feel sorry for myself, it's not normal for a person to be this stressed, and I need to see a therapist. 

I feel like this is never going to get better. I can't keep doing this every day. It's so hard. "
45zpcv,60,2016-02-15,My time at the Gaebler Children's Center.,Moloko-Plus,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/45zpcv/my_time_at_the_gaebler_childrens_center/,"I've only disclosed this story to 5 people I know. Two are my closest friends, two are my parents, and another is my therapist. That said, I've never spilled all the details, lest I look like a madwoman. 

In 1989, I received my PHD in psychology from Boston College, with a minor in child psychology. After two years of intensive internships, I found myself employed at the Gaebler Children's Center. The Gaebler Children's Center was a children's psychiatric hospital in Waltham Massachussetts. The GCC, as I call it for short, was built in 1955 and demolished in 1992. The GCC was meant for children with ""severe mental illnesses."" State health officials commented that the institution was closed for a lack of funds, but I feel that I know the real reason...

....

On a particularly frigid November morning in 1991, I began working at the GCC. My job was no more than ""assistant to child psychologist"", and my role consisted of checking the rooms, making sure the kids ""played nice,"" and acting as a counselor and therapist when the main psychologist was absent or sick.

The first week was fairly routine. I dealt with kids that had a wide range of mental disorders, from extremely debilitating autism, to kids with horrible anger issues, schizophrenia, and more. Granted, some kids, like Ivan Dyavol, were much more calm and even intelligent. Ivan was supposedly the son of two Russian immigrants with an undiagnosed form of ""anti social personality disorder.""

A week into my job, I opened the door to Ivan's room, only to find a 5 year old named Lucy lying on the floor, convulsing and foaming at the mouth. I disregarded Ivan and rushed to Lucy. I quickly brought her to the nurse who dismissed it as an epiletic seizure. Lucy, however, claimed she visited a ""dark place"" when she had her ""seizure."" When I asked her about the dark place she said she saw ""nothing but fire and darkness, darker than the night."" For a five year old, she was surprisingly articulate in her small description of the dark place.

Timid and admittedly scared, I walked back to Ivan's room after calming Lucy. Ivan was not in his room, despite the fact that it was at 11am, the time when all kids are confined to their individual rooms. 

I alerted the chief psychologist. She looked concerned and told me to check the baby monitor. See, each room was equipped with a small baby monitor of sorts. The baby monitor never delivered any sounds back to us, it just showed us the room in black and white. We were able to replay any moment of the day. We trawled through the archives of the morning, only to find that Ivan had been in his room the entire morning. We didn't even see Lucy having the seizure in his room. The head psychologist, normally the sweetest woman, turned her head at me after seeing the footage. She gazed at me and didn't blink, not once. Her stare was something out of a horror film. She simply told me;

""I think it's best we let this one go, Karen.""

That afternoon, during a small lunch break for the stable kids, I confronted Ivan. He denied that he had done anything wrong, saying that he ""briefly left the room"" to alert the Chief Psychologist about Lucy. When asked why Lucy was in his room, he shrugged his shoulders.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I lived a block away from the institute, and decided to use my key to enter the building at 11pm at night. It was the first day of December, and a light blustery snow was falling softly from the dark sky. 

I entered the building quietly and entered the office of the Chief Psychologist to fetch the baby monitor tapes. I replayed the one I had watched earlier in the morning, only to find more of the same.....That is, until I paused the monitor at about the halfway point. It was completely dark, completely blurred for a solid 15 seconds, before resuming to a sleeping Ivan.

Confused, I focused on the still frame. A small cross was on Ivan's wall. For a split second frame after the darkness, the cross was upside down, before resuming to its normal position. To this day, I've been told a gust of wind was probably the culprit. To this day, I deny that claim.

The next morning, I showed up to work timid and restless. I was told by my two co-workers that the Chief Psychologist had quit her job suddenly, and chose me as a replacement. She left me a note on my new desk that read;

""Hi Karen, due to personal and family issues I must resign from this position. I entrust you to look after the children here at the GCC.""

The note is still eerie for me to this day. Theres something unnerving about it that makes the hair on my neck stand. That same day, I received word that Lucy's parents had pulled her out of the Gaebler's Children's Center. I wasn't notified until she had already left.

That day at evening recess, every child stayed indoors because of the cold. Despite the fact that dead autumn leaves still lay on the ground, a fresh layer of snow had fallen, and the temperature was near 15 degrees fahrenheit with blustery winds. I looked out my window at the lightly falling snow. It soothed me to see the rusty old swingsets and trees covered in a light layer of snow. 

I then looked back at some paperwork. Ten seconds later, I looked back at the snow covered playground. I rubbed my eyes in petrified disbelief to see Ivan sitting motionless on a swingset. He had the most unearthly smile on his face, grinning widely and maniacally. I had to stop myself from shrieking.

That night, as I proceeded to leave work, I received a phone call on the building's main phone. I picked up and was greeted by Lucy's sobbing mother. She told me that Lucy had died that afternoon of a terrible epileptic fit in which she accidentally suffocated on her food. 

I hung up the phone and ran out of my office only to see Ivan walking eerily through the hallways in the West Wing.....

I didn't sleep that night, nor did I hardly sleep for the remainder of the month. I quit my job at the Gaebler Children's Center the next day. My co-workers assured me that it was all a bizarre string of coincidences. 

But, deep down I know something was off with Ivan in the worst of ways..."
45ztsj,0,2016-02-15,Feeling a little overwhelmed as a soon to be graduate and have a few questions,Bigblueduck,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/45ztsj/feeling_a_little_overwhelmed_as_a_soon_to_be/,"I'm a graduating (super) senior in marketing and I basically spent my last 4.5 semesters doing nothing because I was really depressed and anxious all of the time. I'm slowly building myself back up, but I can't get that time back so I feel really behind in terms of things I need to know. I didn't do an internship so I'm doing a class where I volunteer doing Tax Returns for underprivileged families for the required internship credit. 

The only problem with this is that it doesn't really give me any hard skills for getting an entry level marketing job. On top of this I volunteer with a local animal shelter (I'm trying to get to help with their PR but so far I've just taken care of cats). I've also volunteered with a local music festival as a volunteer coordinator of sorts and worked with my dad's startup doing market research (very little actual experience). 

Because none of these things were really marketing based besides working with my dad's startup, I don't really know what area of marketing I want to get into. I kind of threw myself into marketing because of my depression, and I do actually like it even though it's not my passion, but my lack of skills is giving me a lot of anxiety for finding a job. 

My dad used to be a recruiter and he's saying I'm fine and that I just need to call people and talk to them to get my foot in the door. But at the same time I feel like most employers only want a marketing major that has relatable internship experience. 

I've been having pretty bad anxiety about finding a job for the past few months and I'm at the position now where if I don't just act I'm going to fuck myself over. I'm basically frozen because I don't have a direction. I don't really know what area of marketing I want to get into, or even if I can get into it, because I haven't experienced any of it in an actual job.

Am I just being crazy? Will a company higher me even though I don't have hard skills or am I fucked? I don't want to go into sales, but if I have to I will. I mostly just want a reliable job that doesn't have crazy hours. I'm not someone that wants to make work his life. Do I need these hard skills for an entry level job, or is a willingness to learn them enough? How can I get an idea for what area of marketing I want to get into? 

Thanks to anybody that replies."
45zvpp,63,2016-02-15,"To my Brothers in your 20s, your 20s are NOT the new 30s",CoarseCourse,AsianMasculinity,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/45zvpp/to_my_brothers_in_your_20s_your_20s_are_not_the/,"Hey guys,

There have been a number of guys coming onto the sub, either worried out about how they are in their late 20s, but don't feel accomplished, or are in their early 20s thinking it'll never catch up.

I know that for a lot of you, dating and romance is the big focus of your lives, and I don't blame you. It's an important part of the human experience and we should all have a chance to experience its beauty and excitement.

However, I want to remind you that life is more than just dating. Life is what you live every day, and **you** have the power to build the life that you want. You are not stuck where you are now, you *can* choose what you want your life to be like.

Now, let's be realistic here. If you come up to me and say, hey, I want to be the next billionaire. I'd tell you it's possible, but if you don't have a plan to get there, it doesn't matter how positive you think. I am not suggesting that this is like The Secret, and all you have to do is imagine your success. No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I *am* saying that you have the power to build your life and make it a life you are proud and happy to live. Your 20s are an important period of your life. 

I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with TED Talks, well here's one that was shared with me a few years ago, and it was instrumental in changing how I approach my late 20s. [Meg Jay - Why 30 is not the new 20](https://www.ted.com/talks/meg_jay_why_30_is_not_the_new_20/)

As usual, I've transcribed what I considered the important parts:

&gt;30's the new 20, Alex say, and as far as I could tell, she was right. Work happened later, marriage happened later, kids happened later...even death happened later. 20 somethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.

&gt;But before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life. I pushed back. I said, ""Sure, she's dating down, she's sleeping with a knucklehead, but it's not like she's going to marry the guy."" And then my supervisor said, **""Not yet, but she might marry the next one. Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one.""**

Likewise, the best time to build the career you want is before you're invested in the career you don't want. The best time to build the body you want is before you're burdened with the body you don't want.

&gt;That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20. Yes, people settle down later than they used to, but that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime. **That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot**, and *we were sitting there, blowing it*. That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere.

This is the point of my post. Your 20s are a valuable time for development. Go out there and chase girls, but always keep in mind there is more to the race. Don't squander your 20s on PUA tactics and shallow hook ups at the expense of your larger development. I'd rather see you spending your time and energy to become a complete person, not just a parlor trick of human interaction. If you reach your potential as a person, the PUA version of you wouldn't be able to hold a candle to you.

&gt;This is not my opinion. These are the facts. **We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35.** That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and ""Aha!"" moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s.

The above excerpt is directed more at the younger guys, or the guys who haven't gone out much. Some of you guys are more concerned about what _can_ happen, rather than what _has_ happened. Your mind is a beautiful thing, but what you imagine is not reality. Go out into the world and get experience. Yeah, you might get shitted on from time to time, but you'll have some really great moments too. And those are the memories I cherish from my early 20s.

Go try something new, go do something different. Make some memories, get some life experience. There is so much to do and see out there. It might be lame, but it might just be what you were looking for.

&gt;**We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.** We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30. *We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood, which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself*, **now is the time to change it**. We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28, and things get tricky after age 35. So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options.

&gt;So when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain. It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become. **But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development, and our 20s are that critical period of adult development.**

Again, touching upon development in your 20s. A fair number of us are capable, intelligent people. We are used to being able to cram for a test, or really focus on learning something. This is all possible, and definitely, if you focus on developing a specific skill for a while, you're going to get really good at it fairly quickly.

However, personal growth is not linear, it is not regular, and it is not evenly distributed across skill sets. You might be a quick learner when it comes to language, but not as quick of a learner when it comes to physical tasks. In addition, some skills complement other skills and expertise in one aspect does not always make up for a lack of skill in other departments.

IOWs, you can be the best dancer in all of the US, but if you don't know your table manners, you probably won't get a second date. On a broader scale, yeah you might be a playboy at the club, but if the rest of your life is in shambles, you won't be keeping many of those women you meet and eventually, your lifestyle will catch up to you.

So, guys, keep in mind your larger development. These things take time to build up. Careers cannot be built in a year. The beach body you want will not be built in 3 months. The dream gf you want requires you become the dream bf she wants, and that will not happen easily, nor quickly.

So start now, and continually evaluate where you are and where you want to be, and **make daily, diligent, consistent efforts towards those goals**. Gentlemen, it is no longer a sprint, you are in the marathon now. Welcome to adulthood.

You might say ""But CoarseCourse, I'm still only 24! I just graduated college, give me a break!"" Haha, yeah you deserve a break (if you were really hustling in college. let's be real, not all of us did, and certainly very few of us were 27/7), but time waits for no man young grasshopper. Take a break if you want, but do not forget that time still moves on.

Alternatively, I suggest this perspective. Okay, you've got your degree/whatever success you have up to this point. Why do you want to stop now? Don't you want to keep building up your lead? Don't you want to be even better off in another 10 years?

Whatever you do though, please, do not become complacent. Your 30s are **not** the new 20s.

&gt;So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say, ""You have 10 extra years to start your life""? Nothing happens. You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition, and absolutely nothing happens.

&gt;And then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this: ""I know my boyfriend's no good for me, but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."" Or they say, ""Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine.""

&gt;But then it starts to sound like this: ""My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself. I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college."" And then it starts to sound like this: ""Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs. Everybody was running around and having fun, but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down. I didn't want to be the only one left standing up, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30.""

&gt;**Okay, now that sounds a little flippant, but make no mistake, the stakes are very high.** When a lot has been pushed to your 30s, there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time. Many of these things are incompatible, and as research is just starting to show, simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.

&gt;**The post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car. It's realizing you can't have that career you now want.** It's realizing you can't have that child you now want, or you can't give your child a sibling. Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room, and say about their 20s, ""What was I doing? What was I thinking?"" I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.

Some of you may be reading this and feeling like it hits a little too close to home. Some of you may even already be in your 30s and feel this way. It's still not too late. You can still decide to start building the life you want. Imagine it like building a house. You'll still get your house, just a bit later than others, and with perhaps more difficulty. But isn't having the house you want at some point still better than never having the house you want ever?

&gt;Here's a story about how that can go. It's a story about a woman named Emma. At 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis. She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment, but she hadn't decided yet, so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead. Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition.

&gt;Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap, and she sobbed for most of the hour. She'd just bought a new address book, and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts, but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words ""In case of emergency, please call ..."" She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said, ""Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck? Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer?""

&gt;Now in that moment, it took everything I had not to say, ""I will."" But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared. Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance. I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by.

&gt;So over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every twentysomething, male or female, deserves to hear:

&gt;First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital. By ""get identity capital,"" I mean **do something that adds value to who you are. Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next.** I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: Identity capital begets identity capital. So now is the time for that cross-country job, that internship, that startup you want to try. I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here, but *I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count, which, by the way, is not exploration. That's procrastination.* **I told Emma to explore work and make it count.**

It took me a long time to even figure out just parts of who I want to be. Some of it was learning about what I liked, didn't like, what I valued, etc. Other parts were about accepting who I was, or deciding to ignore societal pressures and follow my heart. I always knew what I wanted in those aspects, but just didn't let myself want them.

I am still figuring out what I want. It changes as I experience new things and learn more about the world and myself. Start this process now. You can't build the life you want if you don't know what you want.

&gt;Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated. Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport, but *twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work*. **That new piece of capital, that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle.** New things come from what are called our weak ties, our friends of friends of friends. So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed. But half aren't, and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group. Half of new jobs are never posted, so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job. It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.

The irony in where I'm sharing this link is not lost on me. This point to me, relates to our sub here. I'm not pointing to anyone in particular at all, but I say this more as a general caution.

It's easy for us to become caught up in our community here. I appreciate what we have here and I'm thankful for the space. However, we mustn't forget there is a larger world out there. This is a safe place and it's easy to want to stay. Use r/AM as a launch pad and go out there and make new connections. Get exposure to new ideas, new people, new things. We will still be here when you get back and what you bring back will be valuable for not just you, but everyone else too.

Conversely, we have a large network of weak ties right here in our sub. If any of you are looking for professional/social help, there's a good chance than someone here might be able to point you in the right direction.

Let's help each other become the people we want to be.

&gt;Last but not least, Emma believed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends. Now this was true for her growing up, but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own. I told Emma **the time to start picking your family is now.**

&gt;Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20, or even 25, and I agree with you. But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress. **The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work. Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you.**

This is a personal topic to everyone so I'll largely stay out of this, particularly given that a lot of you are more just focusing on dating in the first place. I suppose though, for some of the older guys that imagine starting a family some day, it's a reasonable point to address. It takes time and some mismatches to figure out what kind of person you're compatible with and want to be with. You might think you want the hot club girl at first, then realize you're actually more of a homebody, or vice versa.

&gt;So what happened to Emma? Well, we went through that address book, and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state. That weak tie helped her get a job there. That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend. Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums. She's married to a man she mindfully chose. She loves her new career, she loves her new family, and she sent me a card that said, ""Now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough.""

&gt;Now Emma's story made that sound easy, but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings. They are so easy to help. Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX, bound for somewhere west. Right after takeoff, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji. Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29, one good conversation, one good break, one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come.

I don't think so highly of myself that I think this internet post is going to be the catalyst for your future success. I do hope, however, that this is even just a small spark for you to consider where you want to be, what kind of life you want to have, to share with the kind of people you want to share it with.

I am here because I want all of my brothers to know they can have the lives they want, despite the enormous BS that is stacked against us. If this can help even one brother achieve that, it will have been more than worth it.

&gt;So here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know. It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex. It's what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day: **Thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood, get some identity capital, use your weak ties, pick your family. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. You're deciding your life right now.**

I am also wanting to start my company some day, partly because I believe I have the ability to succeed, partly because I want to create something to change people's lives; some friends and I are currently planning on an app that we would like to invest in and publicize. On the other hand, I landed an internship with Amazon for this coming summer. So that really makes me wonder which path do I really want to go after graduating college? Do I want to go into industry, join a gigantic company and start climbing the ladders? Do I want to start something small and turn it into something great? Or do I want to go into academia and study for 10 years hoping to have some kind of breakthrough?

For the first match, the players will be able to choose from the Normal stages. They either agree on one stage or they ban one stage after another in turns. I hope you can agree on one. Then they will both choose the stage which has been agreed on

After the first match, the winner of the first match will be allowed to ban a set number of stages. FOR 3DS: it will be 2, since there are not many. FOR WIIU: you can ban 4 stages as a winner. The loser of the 1st match will then decide on a stage which has not been banned by the winner. Both players will then choose the stage which has been set by the loser of the previous match

Same happens in round 3 if there is one

**Legal stages**

3DS: FD and Omegas, Battlefield, Yoshis Island, Prism Tower, Dreamland 64, Duck hunt, Clock tower

WIIU: FD and Omegas, Battlefield, Town and City, Smashville, Duck Hunt, Lylat cruise, Dreamland 64, Clock tower

If you have something against the pool or want another stage added, then we can discuss that.

FD and Omegas count as one stage

**Prize**

You get one of em fancy crowns, yo

**Schedule** 

For each round you will have one week time to complete your matches.

**PLEASE FOLLOW THE TOURNEY AND TRY TO MAKE PLANS FOR A MATCH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, YOU CAN NEVER KNOW WHEN YOUR OPPONENT MIGHT NEED SOME MORE TIME. WHEN YOU SEE A NEW THREAD FOR SMASHBLEM AS STICKY, AT LEAST WRITE SOMETHING SO I CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW THAT A ROUND STARTED, thanks**

The sign up phase ends on the **1st of March**, then the first round starts.

**Other Stuff**

This will probably the most important thing: stay in contact with your opponent, before and during your matches. Use Skype, Reddit mail or the comment section of each rounds threads.

Record your matches, just so you have proof of winning

Ask questions in the comments if you have some and if you sign up please check your reddit mail and this subreddit. People who not frequent this sub shouldn't sign up

**NEW STUFF** 

~~For the first time in fire emblem history Smashblem you get to use a Mii fighter. But only if you specify which kit you are using here in the sign ups. If your opponents see that you are using a different kit than the one you have signed up with, that counts as 1 lost game.~~ Well I mean since we'll be able to use the whole roster, I don't see why we you shouldn't be forbidden to use a mii fighter

Because this is so new in the lab nobody really has an in depth understanding of how to use the equipment.

I'm currently doing a study on the volatile aromatic (in the stinky sense) components on the essential oils of some plant material. I have used steam distillation to extract the oils and then used DCM to dissolve all components of the oil. I'm then putting 100ul of this solution directly into the GC.

The GC is equipped with a large volume cooled split injection port to aid in removing the solvent from the sample. 

My question is this: Is it safe to use the olfactory port when using DCM as a solvent? I know DCM is a recognised carcinogen and I don't really fancy putting a gas stream near my nose if its going to contain dangerous amounts of DCM.

I should note that I am somewhat building on methods that a previous lab worker was developing and then left so there's some things I'm doing which I can't really supply a reason for, just following what's been done before.

Any help received would be very helpful,

462is8,65,2016-02-16,Computer Science degree but not a programmer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/462is8/computer_science_degree_but_not_a_programmer/,"I am supposed to graduate in May with a BS in Computer Science from an ""okay"" public school in the midwest. My grades are good, a 3.6 cumulative GPA, and I don't dislike programming. Not at all in fact. 

Until recently, I naively thought that just good grades in my coursework would be enough to get a programming job, but the more I read, the more I know that's not the case. The idea of a technical interview scares the crap out of me, because I'm not that good with algorithms or certain programming concepts. At least not good enough to do them by hand. I don't have any internships. I don't have personal projects, not because I'm lazy, but because I feel like I don't know nearly enough to start anything worthwhile. I feel like the only thing I could write is similar to what I've done in classes up to this point, which are programs that have no real practical use in the world. The same goes for contributing to open source. What could I possibly contribute to a project that someone much more knowledgeable than I am won't have already thought of and done? I'm sure you can tell by now I also lack confidence in what skills I do have.

Anyways, this realization has made me think that with only 3 months to graduation, and nothing to show for it except a couple major course projects I'll be doing this semester, I don't have enough time to make up all that ground before I start interviewing. So maybe I should just forget about programming? Or is this feeling somewhat common, and is there a still reason for me to stick with it? As I said, it's not that I dislike it. Sometimes writing programs for school I can get locked into a zone where I code for hours and actually have to force myself to stop and do something else. 

This semester I'm FINALLY taking a Software Engineering course which apparently is more in line with what you actually do as a programmer, and I'll also be writing a group project in Python, probably some kind of messenger app. So perhaps that could help give me some confidence? But is that enough to have on a resume going into interviews?

But if programming isn't for me, what are the options (if any) for someone with a CS degree? I read about QA Testing, but can you get an entry-level job in that with just a CS degree and no testing experience? Or as a sysadmin, or some other related field?

Sorry if I sound panicked or crazy, but this has been a very stressful thing to come to terms with just months from graduating.

462sl3,43,2016-02-16,S@PS Presents: Smash Valley III ($1000 in Pot Bonuses) And Why You Should Come To It,ambitionK,smashbros,https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/462sl3/sps_presents_smash_valley_iii_1000_in_pot_bonuses/,"Hello all,

&amp;nbsp;

I just wanted to let people know about my upcoming event, Smash Valley III, as well as give a very detailed summary of what this tournament is and why you should come to it. I'll also be answering any questions that people may have on this thread, and I'll leave all the links and a summary at the bottom in case you would like to skip straight to those. 

&amp;nbsp;

First off, I want to introduce myself as the organizer of this tournament. My tag is Kal-El but I go by some other names on the internet like Ambition at some tournaments and r3gisteel on twitch. Since last spring, I've been cultivating the smash scene here at Penn State and turning it into something that my players can be proud of. We've gone from 30 to 40 people in a cramped room on campus to a regular 60-80 people per week in a less cramped room on campus. Our first tournament of this particular semester, S@PS Anniversary, had 70 entrants for Melee and 47 for Smash 4. We even had Boss from MD/VA come up to my surprise.  It's grown significantly since we've started and I continue to see new players each week. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's enough about me, let's talk about the Smash Valley series. The goal of the Smash Valley series is to bring high level players from all over the eastern United States together for a tournament experience that has the hype and quality of a national tournament but in the size of a regional (For now). For the first Smash Valley (April 2015), the most notable players in attendance were from Pittsburgh being Nakamaru and Machiavelli from the PGH Power Rankings. It was a really big step for us because it was the first time that we had big groups of people from out of region at our tournaments. I admit, it wasn't run too well on my part. I was still just starting out as a TO, and I made some big mistakes that I have since fixed. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Smash Valley II took place in September 2015 and for the second installment of our regional series, I decided to be ambitious and put both myself and the series out there for everyone to see. My team and I worked really hard with advertising, and we tried to make sure that as many people knew about this series as humanly possible. I took an internship over the summer of 2015, saved $800, and made pot bonuses for the 3 games at the time (Melee, Smash 4, Project M). The $500 Melee pot bonus definitely brought some attention to the tournament as we had 3 Top 100 players attend being DJ Nintendo, The Moon, and dizzkidboogie. The importance of this tournament to me can't even be described. Never had I once thought that players of this caliber would even pay attention to my tournaments let alone come to them. These weren't the only notable players in attendance either. New England's Sora and Twisty, PGH/NEOH's Silentswag, Carroll, S1, and Sweet were all in attendance as well. I won't pretend that it didn't have its issues though. The biggest one being crossover between games. Even with me limiting the amount of tournaments one could enter to 4, having 6 main events at a tournament proved to be rough on the players as there was too much waiting for people to finish matches in other games. We finished around midnight, but other than that it seemed that people enjoyed the second installment far more than the first. 

&amp;nbsp;

Smash Valley II Event for Reference: https://www.facebook.com/events/792042284249534/

&amp;nbsp;

Now we arrive at Smash Valley III. I've continually searched for ways to make the tournament experience even better. Unfortunately, the first step was removing Project M from the roster. While we have supported Project M since we first started, I really want to focus on the 2 biggest games right now being Melee and Smash 4. This is good news for players because the crossover between Melee and Smash 4 is very significantly smaller than that of PM and Melee. Removing PM opens up the schedule in ways that I've never had access to before due to running all 3 games. The second step was official registrations. All registrations for SVIII are done through Smash.gg making it much easier for players and for the TO team. We are right there on the featured tournaments page. The third step in the process was sponsorships. As of now, Smash Valley III has partnerships with Gaming Generations who has helped out with some of the biggest tournaments in history like Genesis 3, Evo 2015, CEO 2015, Apex 2015, and The Big House 5. We also have a partnership with OrderUp who will be providing food from many different places to attendants free of charge. I don't plan on stopping there either. Every day I'm contacting companies and businesses to see if I can get more things for this tournament and make the experience better. The next step was to create an environment similar to bigger, well known tournaments. So, we've added an array of vendors who are going to be selling things from art to custom amiibos to plushies and everything in between. We are also trying a 2 day format as we believe the entrant numbers will support it. We've also decided to increase the amount of the pot bonuses from $800 across 3 games to $1000 across 2 games. Melee is guaranteed AT LEAST a $600 pot bonus and Smash 4 is guaranteed AT LEAST a $400 pot bonus. As you may have guessed from my capitalization, there is a possibility that the bonuses will be even bigger than what I have currently. I've been speaking to top players from both games (Who I won't name until they've 100% committed/confirm) to give attendants the opportunity to meet and play against some of the best smashers out there. Finally, we are guaranteeing Round Robin pools for the singles games. Due to partnerships and the volume of setups that were brought to the last event, we will have more than enough setups to run round robin pools of *8* (May be slightly bigger or smaller) so that your tournament experience isn't limited to possibly going 0-2. I'm also lining up local players to house out of region players. This way, we can give free housing to as many players as possible. I've taken great amounts of feedback from both players and TOs from other regions who I look up to, and I'm confident that not only will this be a well run tournament, but it will be one to remember. I hope that this information sheds some light on our tournament series and that those who are reading about it for the first time will give it a try. If you have any questions about anything involving the tournament, who I am, logistics, or anything else, feel free to ask in the comments and I'll try to answer every question to the best of my abilities. I hope to see you all the weekend of March 19th and 20th here in State College, PA!

&amp;nbsp;

P.S. The schedule is going to be altered slightly so that the events on Sunday end earlier. 

&amp;nbsp;

~$1000 in Pot Bonuses

4634ga,1,2016-02-16,Help regarding off cycle recruiting at BB's,bogo908,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4634ga/help_regarding_off_cycle_recruiting_at_bbs/,"Hey everyone first time poster here!

After reading a few posts on here, I'm a bit confused about my current situation, hopefully someone can shed some light on it here.

Im currently a senior at a non target state school, with a pretty good alumni network.  I have a decent GPA(3.6) majoring in Finance, Accounting, and Economics, lots of experience, an internship every summer from my freshman year, at a startup, fortune 50 company, and most recently a BB bank within the securities division.  I felt like I was on track for most of my college career until this past summer when I wasn't able to secure a FT offer from the BB I interned with.  

Since then I've been applying to every BB position within front office and I haven't been getting any replies, consistently getting denied interviews.  

At this point most of the BB recruiting cycles are over.  Is there any chance of off cycle recruiting within front office at a BB?  If so how do I go about it?

463gvb,7,2016-02-16,Any advice on how to leave a toxic job?,toxicjobthrowaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/463gvb/any_advice_on_how_to_leave_a_toxic_job/,"Long story short, I work in a toxic environment. I don't want to give too many details in order to remain anonymous, but here's what I feel comfortable sharing -

It's a small company (me + one other employee, plus the two CEOs) work in the main office. There are a couple of offices internationally staffed by one or two people, but they focus on matters within their own country, and don't provide much support to the main office. 

There are way too many tasks to do in a day, and not enough time to complete them all. Myself and my coworker end up putting in many hours of overtime each week, which we don't get compensated for. Our bosses tell us that we can put those towards our vacation hours, but whenever we try to take a vacation it's ""a crazy time"" and we can't leave. There are no stable structures in place to ensure that everything that need to get done happens, and when stuff falls through the cracks there is hell to pay. We are often called in on the weekends for emergencies that wouldn't be an issue if there was more support and organization within the team. I've presented methods of becoming more organized and how to make the lives of everyone better, but my bosses typically brush that aside and say they'll come up with a better system, but they never do.

My coworker and I have asked for another employee, or even an intern to help, but our bosses don't want to hire anyone else at this moment. We don't get paid enough for the work that we do (I have a Masters Degree, and people who work in similar companies with only an undergrad degree and 1/2 the responsibilities make twice as much as I do), and it's a constant source of stress in my life. 

I've decided that I no longer want to work in an environment like this, and I am hoping to leave mid-March. I have a few job applications out, and enough in savings to hold me over for a few months until I find something else, so I'm not concerned about money. 

However, I do have a lot of anxiety about leaving. I am going to feel guilty for leaving my coworker behind to deal with this, and I have a feeling my bosses are going to try to convince me to stay longer to get through this season... I don't want to stay any longer than I need to. This job has become detrimental to my health, and I know leaving is the right choice. However, I am terrified for the repercussions. This is my first ""adult"" job (I've worked for over 10 years since high school, but this is my first full-time, benefits-earning job), so I don't really know what the best protocol is. According to my contract (which I never even signed, which goes to show how unorganized everything is) asks for 2 weeks notice, but I don't know how to stand up for myself and tell them that I'm not going to give them any more time past the two weeks. With past employees, they've convinced them to stay longer (like 6 months past their original plans for leaving). I'm also afraid that the last two weeks will become increasingly hostile, making my life a living hell until I walk out the doors for the last time.

Does anyone have any advice on how the best way to handle it? When I do talk to my boss about resigning, I'm planning on emphasizing that I'm leaving for my own well-being, rather than complaining about the company. But any advice about how to build up the courage to leave and not be manipulated into staying longer would be greatly appreciated."

I'm currently a junior studying computer engineering at UIUC. I have interned twice, once at a small-mid size Chicago start up and the other time at a ""Big 4"" company. I will likely intern at a similar company in the coming break. 

Keeping up with all my work while maintaining a decent GPA has left me fairly stressed out. I have some money saved up from internships and I'd like to take some time off to travel before jumping into full time employment. I've always wanted to go backpacking through Europe, but I was unable to do this after graduating from high school mainly due to financial reasons.

Assuming I graduate with a good GPA, decent side projects, the aforementioned work experience, and maintain my technical skills, how will taking some time off effect my prospects?"

463pdp,0,2016-02-16,I'm being replaced at my job.,SoftwareDevThroway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/463pdp/im_being_replaced_at_my_job/,"Hey guys,

I'm kind of just looking to vent and obtain general advice about my current status in my career.

So I am a student graduating in December and have been employed as a software developer at my university for the past couple years. I enjoy the job a decent amount, I've learned a lot, but really don't like my managers, they're pretty toxic at times and my pay puts me below the poverty line.

So I didn't want this position to be my only experience programming during school so I obtained an internship a state over for this upcoming summer. I did this originally while talking with my bosses with the understanding that I would continue to do my job here part time over the summer, remotely, so that they wouldn't have to replace me and I'd still have a job when I came back. I figured it also would be a good chance to make some decent money over the summer since I won't work more than 40hr/wk during my internship and will have a decent amount of free time.

After I got an offer for my internship a couple months ago they started talking about replacing me. I offered an alternative, that I would train a coworker (that currently doesn't program but is interested as he's in computer science as well) to cover for me over the summer. My coworker even offered to do this training off the clock simply for the opportunity to learn. The upper management has been considering this for the past couple months but ultimately decided they're replacing me, the job posting will be put up in the next month or so.

This is incredibly demoralizing for myself and my coworker, both of us have put a lot of energy and enthusiasm for learning and working here.  I feel like this decision has been made in such bad faith that I am kinda glad I'm getting out, but that has also made me feel entirely indifferent to my job as a whole. I'm burnt out.

With that all said, I'm looking forward to my internship but I'm trying to figure out what to do afterwards for my final semester. I don't think I can make it the entire semester without the little income I had, but I'm not sure I'll be able to find another software development job for just a single semester.  Will it look bad if I end up with a shitty retail job or something? How about no job at all? Any advice/encouragement about my current position would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

I am currently a college student who, for a class, has to develop a system for our HIMT internship program.

System reqs: This system has to be able to store documents submitted by students, and also provide a status report on which documents still need to be submitted and which ones cannot be submitted until a previous one is submitted first. Also, there needs to be a note function where the instructor can save notes or comments in regards to different students or internship sites. This system needs to be able to send reminder emails of upcoming dates or reminders for the instructor about other various items. 

This will be a single user system for only one campus.

What systems should I be looking at for low cost, easy to use database management software that will meet my needs?

As you may or may not know I intern at Greater Boston PFLAG which is an LGBTQ+ nonprofit that serves family, youth, and children of LGBTQ+ communities.  Also I do a lot of LGBT work and activism in my personal life, (so much so that I carry around educational materials in my wallet, haha). 

Anyway, I thought it'd be great to have a wall of positivity for people to look at (especially during the tough/stressful times).  So if anyone has any experiences with any of the PFLAG nonprofits or LGBT groups or other systems of support you've had (or know someone who has had it) to share in a card that'd be great.  Or you could share your story in the card about why you're active in LGBTQ+ rights, activism, or just as an ally.  Or even what inspires you.  

I'll put them up on the wall for people to read as our inspiration and to bring smiles to the office members.  (We had a death threat call last month which was...interesting...) The address is a public one on our website so I'm just going to share it here.

I knew this guy since my 2nd Year in college. But then got to know more about him only during my third year.
We have a lot of common friends, and during one summer four of us had planned to intern at the same company. I had a slight crush on him a little while prior to the internship, as there were those few times that we'd have deep conversations while traveling together, but those feelings intensified during the internship -where I could observe him a lot.
I really fell for his mind basically: I kinda have a thing/sexual attraction towards intelligent people. He maintains a blog and he writes really well(a lot of people have acknowledged his writing skills), he is, as per me, is pretty intelligent, quick thinking, and most of all he has a GREAT sense of humor. I am an Indian who has gone through a pretty rigorous and a wonderful education , so I know an intelligent person when I see him/her. So , yes I fell for the way he talks and his intelligence and I L-O-V-E-D having deep conversations with him. Plus he's moderately handsome too. We shared some common interests when it came to books , we used discuss topics that we read in books that affected us or life situations that had a major effect on us. We have a few common friends who actively participate in these discussions too, and I feel so proud when my crush discusses/debates. I on the other hand dumb myself down in front of him and appear like an innocent girl who's so amused, when I actually am not. To me he seems profound, in a way. I have another friend who is similar, much more profound than him and she is my best friend and we both know that there is a limit to his talking deep stuff( philosophical). He just gets disinterested at one point. So sometimes I get the feeling that maybe he's pretending to be profound or something, simply by the virtue of no one having had as much interest as him on such a topic.

 I read a lot , write some and I can relate to emotions fairly well. My crush on him was still there. I don't even know if this is a crush , its probably the longest I've had on anybody: 10-11 months. But for all his intellect and knowledge and humor and romanticism , he is a very emotionally unstable guy. 

I realized this late. It was like, one day we would be traveling in a bus having conversations that we hoped would never end , that we could talk more, and on another he suddenly behaves like I don't exist, he runs away, I can literally see he is uncomfortable being around me. For instance he whispers something into his friend's ears when he sees me smiling and walking towards him, and by the time I'm next to them , he and his friend would start speaking about some PC game . I would just feel out of place, and either stay there, standing like an idiot, bound by courtesy( which at that time, I receive none of!) , or lie that I have some work and go away. Eitherways, if I stay , its his friend who says they both wanted to go else where and won't use the same bus, and that they could not give me company. 

At first I thought it was a genuine reason. But once when I met them and they gave some reason not to travel with me, I said ok. But I waited. I wore a scarf over my head that day and stood at a corner of the street in the middle of a small crowd , waiting to see when they left and which way they went. After half an hour of waiting , I saw them leave. They went the usual way , the way I go , they boarded the usual bus, the same bus we used to travel together in. I honestly felt betrayed. I went home and cried. I felt bad because I felt unwanted by him. I felt bad that someone had to go to such an extent , to lie and avoid, just to not be with me. I felt bad , that I had made a fool of myself in front of everybody by dumbing myself down in front of him so he would like the ""dumb beautiful girl"". 
Some of my other friends could smell something fishy about me when in my crush's presence. So one day , these friends and I were chit chatting and the topic went to crushes, or boyfriends and ex's. At first I didn't tell them anything. Then  I was pretty vehement in not telling my crush's name . So they were like "" atleast tell us where he is from , and some special things about him!"" . I saw not much harm in it, and I said ""He is a good writer, he's intelligent and he reads tons of books....and  he is emotionally unstable or distant in a way"". my friends perked up when I told the last part. They suddenly got the confirmation that they had been waiting for so long. Then a guy came in close and told ,as a matter of fact-ly "" I know your crush. Its N"". seems everyone knew it and to add to this, my crush's ex was part of this friends group. I did not expect that they would get it so easily, I stayed calm though. I refuted ""nonsense, him and me ...No way!"". I lied.I stalled, and they were slightly doubtful. But hey this is sensational gossip to them and nothing stopped them.

In the following week , the guys from the group started teasing me and my crush when both of us were in the same place. I did not react, initially . Then me and my crush used to openly laugh it off. The teasing continued for 2 weeks more. I was afraid he would despise me, he would go distant and to the point he could make me and him become strangers. But I had to observe him , I wanted to have those conversations. At one point I showed up at the university library for a book, and saw my crush and I was about to smile to acknowledge him, but then I observed the people around him , the guys exchanging amusing looks and teasing glances at my crush and me, and then I just turned around in anger and despair and left the place, my crush looking at my back as I was leaving. The final expression on his face that I saw was of mischief and sympathy . It was as if we both understood what just happened there, only he thought it were all a joke and that I was irritated and left. Only, I was not. I was afraid of his very understanding, that it was really a joke , that my having a crush on him was so much a joke, that it was insignificant. That my feelings for him, whether revealed or not , would mean nothing to him.

I was embarrassed as hell. I really wanted to talk to him after. I never had the guts, or when I did he would not be ""available"" on purpose. 

The gossip died out, he talked to me properly for a day and then went on blatantly dismissing my existence after. Even when we were talking in a group and he and I were standing 2 feet away,he would move away, not have eye contact with me or give  one word answers in a boring manner whenever I asked him a question or tried to introduce small talk.

I observe him still, from a distance. Its never been like this for me with any crush !
I know that he changes girlfriends like he changes clothes. In one of our talks, he said that every girlfriend was just a fling, a platonic relationship with a person for the sake of having one, for fun. He is perfectly aware, that he is moderately handsome and he could get any girl he wants once he starts talking to her. I agree , his personality is magnetic, not just when it comes to girls but with anybody who's interested to know him.
Ha , I have written a whole analysis about him. But this post is already long enough.

So yeah , i started texting him a lot , to start a small talk and somehow get a chance to explain myself and this whole fiasco. But he would reply with one word answers and tell me he can't talk, he's busy playing some game on his PC. In the process I came out to falsely sound desperate, and now he doesn't even bother.

He jokes and shares eye contact with me when in a group, but then again treats me like I don't exist when its just the 2 of us standing 2 feet away. OH the countless awkward silences.If I even start a conversation , it ends in 3 lines. 

I still want to talk to him like I used to. I'm just annoyed that he doesn't care, that he doesn't even want to clarify anything to clear any bad blood. I'm just so insignificant to him, like an idiot who made herself be foolish in front of everyone.

I'm in such a rut, mentally and emotionally.This is the first time I've been through such a situation. I've never been in any relationship before, it was all one sided. I don't know what to ask of you people here on Reddit. This is my last place. 
I could use some help and advice from you guys...

Thank you very much for any help."

None of the companies I gave my resume to during Business Horizon has replied (not too surprising as I only spent a semester here and don't have any other experience other than A+ and Net+ certs), so I guess it's time for me to hit Indeed or similar job-searching websites.

I am wondering when is an appropriate time to apply for a summer internship. Also, how does the interview process work? Is it a basic interview or do they ask any technical questions? Am I too under-qualified to get a paid internship (I certainly feel so looking at most of the requirements)?"

I accepted it because I was getting rejected by many companies but it's a very crappy IT internship from what I can tell (they asked me no technical questions in the interview). It is a fortune 500 company but I doubt I'll learn too much.

I have a cgpa of around 3.3 but it seems like that is not as important. Up until now I just focused on my classes and have tried to understand concepts. I do well in Math/Programming courses but I'm no genius. I'd say I'm better than 70 percent of my class. (so better than average at least). But from what I'm reading, this is not enough as the competition is pretty high. I'm seeing sophomores with better internships and Juniors with their second internship at big 4 companies. Everyone on here is already ahead of me.

I have always aspired being a developer and coding interesting things that matter be it for a big or mid sized company. I truly love programming but it seems like the competition is too difficult. I'm just getting really stressed and feel like I should have done more when I thought I was doing enough.

tl;dr : Thought being in a top 40 school, having a decent gpa, graduating with a CS degree with decent/good understanding of concepts and a love for programming would get me the jobs I wanted.

Turns out I have no internship experience and not substantial enough projects (on top of that, my internship this summer wont help either).

I am in my first year of a program, and right now my GPA is far below what I apparently need to maintain to remain in the program. Last semester I took a course that I soon (but not soon enough) found out that I certainly should not have taken. I originally thought it would be interesting and that I would learn some valuable skills (which in fact I did). However, it ended up being a nightmarish time sink where I had to dedicate basically my entire efforts into it just to stay afloat. I eventually learned that it is common knowledge in the department never to take that course. When all was finished, I earned a C, which was a surprise to me as from the (very scarce) mid-semester feedback on grades, I had been scoring about as the rest of the class was, and given that a C might as well be an F. 

Based on department requirements, essentially, this semester I must earn straight As in two additional classes and research progress, or I'm gone. This is causing me so much anxiety and I don't know if I can do it. Even in undergrad my grades were not that high - although I never did this poorly - as I tended to just take classes that were interesting or valuable and focus more on research, so I don't even have former confidence to fall back on. The worst is that I know it is all my fault.

I feel so fucking stupid for not just realizing I should just take the easy classes, keep my head down and do my research and so fucking angry that this stupid class is going to cost me the PhD program I worked so hard to get. I don't have anything else. I never succeeded in getting internships in undergrad, couldn't get a job after, and have a bad time functioning in a rigid corporate environment. I don't see a future beyond this and I wonder how the fuck am I the only retard who fucked up like this? 

I don't know what I can do at this point and I've tried to stay positive and think ""I can do this, I just need to try really hard,"" but doesn't matter if you don't truly believe it, when it just seems almost impossible. Does anyone have advice?"

I searched this sub and found that the last time there was an engineering related post was almost a year ago so I’m not sure how things have changed since then.

About my situation:

•	I graduated with my degree in aerospace engineering about ~9 months ago and still cant find a job.  I have done everything I could think of, short of moving to California and walking into places.  

•	I keep updating my resume and have submitted it to r/resume for advice. 

•	I have submitted almost 100 applications to many companies, big and small.  

•	I got a part time job so I don’t have any excessive gaps in employment. 

•	After the first few months I stopped going after my “Dream Job,” and started looking for a foot in the door.

•	I have had a few phone interviews, including 5 phone/ Skype interviews with various people within one of my top 5 companies.
•	I have been asking everyone that I know for help getting past the “apply online,” wall.

•	I had what I though was a great amount of experience for a college grad (1 internship where I literally designed and built an unmanned aircraft by myself, a class competition that my team won, and a few research experiences) all relevant to my degree and what I want to do eventually.

•	My boss for my internship has given a good recommendation to places that have asked for it, and I have asked them to alert me if they hear about any jobs that I would fit in well. (The reason that I am not working for the company I did my internship with is because it was a research position at a university.

•	I have tried to utilize my alumni network; unfortunately my university doesn’t have a very good one for engineers.

•	I’m looking at possibly picking up a second job because life.

I feel like nothing I do is getting me through.  Am I doing something wrong? Do I just need to give it more time? Do I actually need to relocate to give myself a better chance? Any advice would be great.

465cqw,1,2016-02-16,Currently a junior in undergraduate school; due to some unexpected changes and irresponsibility of my parents I'm looking at a lot of loan debt post-graduation. Looking for general advice.,Devanitely,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/465cqw/currently_a_junior_in_undergraduate_school_due_to/,"Hey, r/personalfinance. I hope this is the right place to be posting this.

I'm going to go ahead and give the condensed version of my story for those who don't need/want the details. I am currently a junior undergraduate [20F] studying mechanical engineering at a private university, and due to changes in financial aid, lack of any parent help with tuition, and inability to transfer, I am racking up a lot of debt. I apologize if the way I explain it is inaccurate or confusing, please let me know if I need to rephrase something; I really have no idea what I am doing, and I'm very scared about the debt and how to handle it, which is why I am here for advice. I have been applying to as many scholarships as I possibly can, but this is also kind of difficult as I am in 18 hours almost every semester (and am currently), work two part-time jobs, and spend at least 70 hours during the week just keeping up with schoolwork. I can't really afford to pay anything myself either, I am a responsible spender and had saved up a lot from my previous internship and then had a breakdown with my car and had to do really expensive work to fix it :( So I have maybe $2100 to my name... So far I have only received one $2000 scholarship. I will say the one upside is that I have a solid, high-demand, decent-paying major for employment, and I am on track to receive a job after graduation (I had an internship last summer and will have one again this summer, and have a ~3.6 GPA). 

Looking at all 6 semesters it looks like my totals for loans are:

Federal Sub. Direct Loans: $13,500
Federal Unsub. Direct Loans: $6000
Federal Direct PLUS Loan: $29,226
SallieMae Student Loans: $16906
Discover Student Loans: $9200
Total: $74,832

At this rate, I am looking at graduating with over 100k in loan debt. I guess my question here is, how is the best way to handle this, either now (reducing next loans in any way, which loans to get next year, etc.) or post graduation? I will continue to apply for scholarships throughout the year and pray I will get one that is significant, but at this point I wish I had started looking into the best way to handle this much sooner. We chose to switch to a different company for our private loan this year, last year we had SallieMae, but after hearing how horribly most people thought of them, we switched to Discover. Now I am wondering how loan consolidation will work with the different private and federal loans; I'm afraid I already have a very loose understanding of how loan consolidation and forgiveness works. Can I consolidate ALL loans, federal and private, or can I only consolidate like with like (private loans with private loans and federal with federal)? What kind of payments will I be looking once I graduate? Is there any way this will eventually be forgiven?

Furthermore, when filling out the application for the Discover loan this semester, I discovered that my credit score is somewhere in the 600+ range, which just entirely blew me away. I am guessing this is due to the fact that I don't ever use credit (I have a debit card) and most of my credit is probably just tied to my loans/debt. I heard someone say that if you buy a store credit card at somewhere like TJ Maxx and just buy small things every month and pay the bills on time, this type of thing can help lower your credit score. Is this true/is there anything like this I can do to start getting my credit score under control? 

Thank you everyone so, so much in advance. Please help. To summarize: How do I handle/consolidate these loans in my best interest after graduation, how should I handle loans next year/should I handle them differently, what kind of payments should I expect, and any way to improve my credit score? 


*Long story* : Got into a top 20 private school as a senior in high school, in the financial aid profile (not official forms) they offered me about $54,000/year in financial aid for a ~$64,000 tuition. I was ecstatic, and accepted for attendance. Then my mom, spur of the moment (literally, pretty much) decided to get married before the actual forms were due, and my grant dropped to $50,000. Nothing too serious. So for my first year of school, in addition to my grant, I took out Federal Unsub and Subsidized loans, and also received money from Federal Work Study Program.  My mom helped me pay the rest for that year.

My second year, I again took out Federal Sub/Unsub and received Work Study, but my mom could not help me with tuition, so I had to take out Private Alternative Loans (from SallieMae) totaling to $16,906. 

My third year (this year)... everything went to shit. First of all, I should probably stress that my parents are the most irresponsible people on this planet. Months before the profile &amp; FAFSA were due, I sent them the forms to be completed (I was away and could not do them myself as I did not have the tax forms). They did not, and I almost was unable to go to school for the semester because the school received no payment. Once we finally got the forms in (BARELY before me not being able to attend), we discovered that because my mom could not afford to pay for my sister's college anymore either (and we could not put her on the FAFSA as a dependent because of this), my aid was reduced from about $50,000 a year to $13,531 a year.. I was crushed. This was literally less than two weeks before classes. I have a very technical major and it is very unlikely I would be able to transfer to another university without falling behind and staying in school longer (so transferring isn't really the advice I'm looking for, just ahead of time want to lay that out) due to the way my school formats the class progressions (ha.. probably do that on purpose).  As a result, we had to last-minute take out a Federal Direct PLUS loan of $29,226 to cover the cost of the semester so I could attend, and then once aid was added the extra amount of the loan rolled over to this (current) semester, and once this semester came around, I had to take out an additional $9200 to cover the rest of the cost for the year in addition to the Federal Unsub/Sub and Work study. I had heard that SallieMae was a terrible company for private loans, so for this year's private loan, we switched to Discover for the last $9200.  And that's how I am where I am."

Then I spend months looking at other places but got nothing. I got career service counselors at my university to look at my resume. A recruiter contacted to get training and it lasted like 5 months. I studied and practiced so hard. Now, the marketing people say that they cannot really market my resume because of my date of birth. Most jobs require 7 years of fucking experience and I won't get marketed. All my hopes of getting this job as a java developer got destroyed. Now, what should I do? I didn't do any internships during my college years. Now I am applying to internships and it is not that easy because there are hundreds of applicants and I'd consider extremely lucky if they called. I feel like I have simply wasted four years of college and the past 9 months and feel like all my hard work summed up to nothing. I am absolutely frustrated at this point of life.

I'm worried because I am not getting as many hours at work that I would like to get. I'm stressing because I have my taxes to send out, FAFSA to complete, car tax to pay, credit card bill, and then I barely have money for my personal interests (my car and clothes) let alone to go out and do fun stuff. I'm also really struggling this year with college and I don't even know what I want to major in anymore. I haven't even been to the gym in 5 days.

I think my biggest problem is college. I hate my school because no one wants to make new friends. I hate my classes because I'm a computer information systems major and they pack that major full of programming and math classes that I just can't understand. I want to get into IT management and I already did an IT internship to which I am returning this summer and I asked my boss what he thought and he basically said to major in whatever interests me and that the money isn't an issue. I thought of changing to business admin but I don't think I will like that either.

How the hell do I get out of this rut? I was doing so good for a long time and I think I burnt myself out. I'm barely scrapping by in my classes and I feel like an idiot because I don't get some of the concepts we are going over that everyone else seems to understand perfectly.

465qbn,2,2016-02-16,Columbia/Yale MPH,little_desi,publichealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/465qbn/columbiayale_mph/,"Hello all!
First of all wanted to wish the best of luck to those applying this year and hearing back. I wanted to ask a few questions about Columbia/Yale which are among my top choice MPH programs if anybody here is familiar with either program (current students/alumni?) who can offer some insights. 


Things important to me in a program:

1. Good epidemiology program with electives/concentration options in:Health disparities (racial inequalities), health equity. I heard that Columbia is really good as far as the epi department and variety of programs/options go. I've heard good things about Yale, but not entirely sure of the variety/availability in health disparities

2. Faculty/Classroom size/ability to network/connect
This one is probably huge for me-one thing I'm looking for in a program is definitely having good connections both with peers and faculty. I've heard pretty good things about Yale as far as this goes but kind of iffy reviews from Columbia

3. Location: 
I really like Columbia's location-in that it's easy to get around the city (I'm familiar with NYC) and that there's probably a lot always going on both within and outside the university in the NYC area like lectures, events, etc. Yale: I'm somewhat familiar with New Haven. I assume there's probably a lot going on within the university and if anything transportation to NYC is not hard? 

4. Job placement:
Another big one for me. I've heard good things from both schools. I know that NYC has a huge Department of Health that a lot of students intern at. 

5. Other things:
My program will be one-year long, I have a post-graduate degree in an allied health profession. Financially, both schools seem to cost relatively the same. Housing/getting around is another obvious concern-where do grad students live? Is public transportation easy? I have a relative who lives ~25-35 minutes from Yale (depends on traffic) and another who lives ~40-50 mins from Columbia (via commuter rail). From past experiences, I generally prefer living near campus vs. commuting insofar housing is affordable. 

Will probably have more questions!

He told me to study something I am passionate about and not to worry about the best major finance wise.

465zoz,15,2016-02-16,"On FA men, ambition, and society...",DerPhilosoph,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/465zoz/on_fa_men_ambition_and_society/,"So, as I admitted in other threads, I did look at various books and websites in my mid-20s up until about a few months ago concerning the state of marriage, dating, and LTRs in today's world - especially in first world western nations.  As such, I would like to ask some questions related to my experiences and perhaps yours as well.

Let me preface, hopefully not sounding too conceited, by saying that I have a Masters degree in an engineering field.  As most of you know, education is really pushed for in many asian households and I truly had an interest in science and experiments growing up.  After graduating undergrad, I held intern, technician, and engineer positions at a few companies.  However, what struck me in my mid 20s was something that is somewhat common in tech fields: **burnout**.  If you are in a STEM field, please feel free to comment on this...  I was so burned out that I felt I needed to take a break and focus on finishing grad school (which I was doing part time for about 1.5 years while working).

I am thankful that I have parents who still let me live at home - even if there is more stress than most families would have with this arrangement.  They are elderly and I do a lot in terms of caretaking for them.  Living with them is the only way I can currently work a part-time job through a staffing agency.

The questions below stem from new realizations I've had over the past 3 years or so as my looks took a sharp decline and I have struggled to get back into a field related to my education/experience.  *In fact, I am not so sure I actually want a job in a technical field anymore....*  I've thought about trying to start my own company, but don't really have any innovative ideas and even if I did, I don't have the funding for it.  I may look into learning a trade (truck driving, electrician, etc.).

1) Is there any reason for an UGLY FA man, never married, never fathered any kids, (and likely never will in the future) etc. to be **ambitious** anymore?  Why should I strive to have a stressful tech job when there will be no better chance of me meeting a life partner in the foreseeable future?

2) Do any of you also feel that life is just getting harder and harder for single people (men especially)?  Each damn year it just seems like it gets harder just to keep one's head above water...

3) Have any of you once had well-paying jobs, with good benefits, etc. but quit them because they were really stressful or detrimental to your health over time?

4) I have volunteered at several things in the past.  I have more than enough spare time, but why should I continue to volunteer in a community that does so little to address the growing numbers of FA?

EDIT: I mentioned my education and career field not to brag, but mainly to point out that even though some men (such as me) who have spent many years getting education may still decide to give up on trying to live life in a mainstream status quo manner.  I simply cannot ""un-see"" or ""un-read"" the research I have done over the past few years about relationships and thus don't see the need to try anymore as hard as I would have if I still believe in all the platitudes...."

I am continuing the telling of the MIL chronicles. These stories happened a few years ago in the beginning of my relationship with SO. If you aren't familiar with me hit up the bot and enjoy the crazy.  

This story is about the time i made my MIL and SIL cry, at least the only time i know about. 

We left off the story with my MIL informing me that my SOs duty station was to be Hawaii. He had told her not to tell me as he wanted to break the news to me himself. Well she ruined it and i was distraught. I just didn't know how we would make this work with that much distance between us. I was still in college and barely making anything being a server at a restaurant in town and he wasn't pulling in the big bucks either.  A round trip flight to Hawaii from the east coast is not cheap. In fact any flight to Hawaii is not cheap. I am trying to figure out how i am going to visit him in the year its going to take me to finish my degree. At this point in our relationship we had briefly talked about getting married and what that would be like. I like that we talked about it a lot before he asked me. I was still surprised when he asked, but not so surprised that i might say no. Fast forward through his 10 day leave between MOS school and leaving for Hawaii (the short version is it was a shit show and i barely saw him). I find out that i got selected for an internship at the capitol in my state and i will be interning for a Senator. I am actually really excited about this. Its an incredible opportunity to get to know people and get your name out there for when you graduate. Its also paid and i get 12 hours of credit at school. So i'm still on track to graduate in a year and i will be making a lot more money so i can save and go visit my SO in August after the internship has finished up. YYYaaaayyyy!!

Im happy for a little while. The waiting doesn't seem so bad now that we have a plan. SO plans to save and pay for as much as he can and i am focusing on affording the plane ticket. In this 7 months before i visit MIL, FIL, and SIL visit. They post a million pics on Facebook and even a video of them seeing SO as soon as they get off the plane, who the fuck would enjoy watching stuff like that on facebook. I am jealous and i'm not afraid to admit it, but at the same time i'm glad they are getting to see him as he was really homesick.  I am also glad that when i go out there in August it will be just me and him. In a year and a half we had never been together for 3 weeks straight without MIL. 

Hawaii time!!! I fly out there in August to spend 3 weeks of bliss with my SO. It was exactly that. MIL called and texted frequently, but he ignored her mostly and so did i. At about the week and a half mark he proposes to me on the beach during the sunrise. I said yes, and it was amazing. We call family and friends and tell them. He had called my mom and talked to her about proposing to me so she knew it was happening. SO told his whole family that he was going to ask me to marry him (god i wonder how they reacted to that). We spend some time just basking in the post engagement bliss in our little cabin on the beach. While we are basking we are talking about when to get married. We say oh lets wait until December when SO will already be home for my graduation. This way family and friends can be there. If any of you are familiar with the housing situation on a military base you know that you basically put your name on a list and wait for a call.  The housing list on the Marine base was 6 months. So if we waited to get married for a few months we still wouldn't be able to be together right away as i would have to wait another 6 months for housing to become available. I bet you know where  this is going. 

We decided to elope. 

A wedding isn't a necessity for me at all. We decided at our 5 year anniversary we will renew vows with a wedding like atmosphere (spoiler alert our 5 year is this august.....and a renewal aint happening, life gets in the way every time).  I don't want to elope without calling and telling my mom though. We are very close and i knew this might hurt her a little, and i hated that part of eloping. She understands though why we want to do it this way and she just wants us to be happy. My SO calls MIL and tells her the plan and boy does she take it well......NOT. She loses her shit and so does SIL they are both bawling their eyes out saying that they didn't think he was serious when he said he was going to ask me to marry him.  Now not only is he marrying me he wants to do it with out mommy dearest. MIL wants to fly out that night to be at the elopement or whatever you call it. I shut that shit down and say no i don't want those people ruining the last week i have with SO. Plus they really don't have a lot of money to begin with, but even if she had to steal the money needed she was going to find a way out there. 

But she cant get the money to come to Hawaii to ruin it. The heavens opened up and its glory rained down upon me on that day.

Oh and they accused me of wanting to elope so i could steal that special moment of her walking her son down the aisle away from her.........crazy crazy woman."

467dds,307,2016-02-17,He found me again,doiisback,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/467dds/he_found_me_again/,"English is my 3rd language, so keep that in mind when snickering at my less than perfect grammar…

When I was 20, it was really hard to find work in my home town. I eventually managed to get a job though, as a administrator. I don’t know what this sort of place is called in English, but I’ll describe it for you. People who commit very serious crimes, usually arson, murder or similar, who are belived to suffer from mental issues or personality disorders, are placed there instead of in a normal prison. You know what kind of place I’m speaking of? Yeah, that’s where I worked. 
I’m a rather petite woman, just over 50 kg and looking years younger than my actual age. Easy target, you might say.

I rarely interacted with the interns, apart from being the one to let them in and out of the gate when they had reason to be outside the facility, and then always escorted by the guards. 
There was one man, a short and broad dude from the Philippines, who always looked at me with the creepiest  smile you ever saw, eying my id-badge closely every time. 

I of course had no right to know what those people had done to end up in this place, but my boss felt the need to tell me about this guy. 


-Watch out for him, she said, he’s a serial stalker and arsonist, never let your guard down. People thing he is stupid,  but he’s not. He’s actually over average intelligent. 


The summer turned into fall and in September that year I left that job to go back to university. It wasn’t until two years later, in December, just before Christmas, that it happened. 
I was shopping for a bracelet for my sister, when I hear a whisper right next to my ear:

 -Hello, Josephine. 

I turn around and find myself eye to eye with the stalker/arsonist   guy. He had remembered my name too. 
I didn’t but the bracelet, I left in a hurry, certain that he had only been out on one of his short visits outside, and that the guards were close by watching. They to that, to let the interns train for being let out again, the give them freedom under a watchful eye one hour per week or so, to see how they handle it. 
I didn’t see any guards that I recognized, but I was sure they were there. 


I went home. My sister and I have on flat each on the top floor of an apartment building, and when we are both home we keep our doors open and kids and pets can roam freely between our homes. We were in my flat, decorating the Christmas tree when I heard the steps. Not the light steps of my niece, not the fast steps of my fiancé, it as the heavy, slow, determent steps of the arsonist. He had found me, and he was on his way up. I threw myself at the door, looking it shut. My sister had no idea what was going on, but I told her to take the kids, go into the bathroom, lock the door, call the cops. 


I stood by the locked front door, listning to the steps. I could hear him roam around in my sisters apartment. He had found her Christmas cards, and was reading the names of her children out loud. 

Then he started searching for something, while whistling happily. My sister, always a rock, was keeping the kids calm in the bathroom while I was listening to him merrily explaining that he needed tools, tools that could break the lock open. 


Since I knew who he was, and police knew who he was, they arrived very quickly and soon the situation was resolved. It turned out, that since there are too few places to keep those people, some had been let out early to  make room for those considered more dangerous. 
I guess he found me by chance that day in the store, and decided there and then to go after me. 
It was a frightening experience and if my boss hadn’t warned me so vigorously about this man, I wouldn’t have acted as fast as I did.

I'm doing my internship at an upcoming eSports company. My task is to configure dedicated servers and atm I'm looking to make a csgo 5v5 config but I'm still a bit unsure on what settings to pick.

**killcam**

this is 2 secs at esl and 6 secs in competitive. I might go with 0.5 secs as you can just see where you got shot from but that's it. 1 second still seems a bit too long. but 0 secs is super awkward when you die.

**damage dealt**

on faceit &amp; MM you can see damage dealt, is this game breaking or do you think it's just part of the game.
I'm personally pro damage dealt but I want to follow what the community thinks!

If you have anything else you think should be thought about feel free to tell me! I'm curious to what arguments you all have ;)

EDIT: What do you guys think about jumpthrow &amp; map banning in BO1/BO3 ?

First time poster. You guys have helped me a tremendous amount already, so I figured I should just be blunt with my question instead of using the search feature (which I tried for 10 mins to no avail).

I am from the NYC area and applied to all of the B4 when I was still a junior in college, anticipating that I would want the experience to go on and have an ambitious, lucrative career in our field. Two years later, my priorities have entirely changed and I do not want to be the CFO of a F500 company anymore. I would be totally okay being a staff accountant at any company, making slightly more money than I make right now, working 40 hours per week. My main priority is having a 40 hour work week at this point.

I am a staff 1 at B4 with about 6 months under my belt. I have passed all four parts of the CPA exam, but I am not licensed because my state does not recognize internships towards the one year of required experience. I have been in full-throttle busy season since Jan 4th, working between 70-80 hours/week + about 12 hours of driving per week as well. All of my coworkers who are the same rank as me (regardless of start date) are having similar, dreadful experiences and hate their lives - and I know my next client is super shitty as well. It won't be as demanding time wise, but the client sucks and the team is apparently pretty miserable.

I am consistently getting less than 40 hours of sleep per week and it is taking a huge toll on me physically and mentally. I can't remember things I just worked on the day before, I have been sick on and off for the past 3 weeks, and I am really just run down. This 7 week stretch is the worst thing I have experienced in my entire life.

So basically, as my title may have given away, I am wondering: is it even worth it to stay any longer? Knowing that I do not have any ambitious desires to go and make 6 figures by the time I'm 30 anymore, or hell, honestly, ever - unless I can do so while working 40 hours per week all the way there - should I throw in the towel? I am slightly concerned that if I reach out to recruiters, it will look really bad that I couldn't stay for even one year. I am also afraid that my firm may find out and fire me, which I really do not want to happen - but I have no premise to think this, I may just be paranoid. However, I honestly just want a staff accounting job that has a 40 hour work week and is not that far of a commute (which shouldn't be difficult because of where I am situated).

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking time out of your (likely very busy) day to read this and help me!"

Flight is tomorrow, please help!",rokueclipse,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/468059/17f_sg_flying_to_uk_19f_first_time_flying_alone/,"Hi I've posted before two days ago and only got one reply so I thought I'd try again. I've been panicking the past few days, having no strong proof to tie me back to my country, and have been imagining the worst case scenarios.. Getting a rude IO and being deported. Watching UK border force clearly doesn't help either.

This is what I posted: 

&gt;Hello! I posted last month in regards to what documents I should bring to aid getting through immigration. I think I have it all, but you can never be too sure.. He's made a call to local immigration and the officer said as long as I've his letter of sponsorship and my mom's letter, I'm good to go but still... Better be safe than sorry, right?
&gt;
&gt;So with me, I've got:
&gt;
&gt;-My passport, obviously, for starters
&gt;
&gt;-Two acknowledgment letters from my mom, to be extra safe
&gt;
&gt;-Photocopies of my birth certificate (I can bring that with me) and my mom's passport to authenticate her signature and my birth rights
&gt;
&gt;-Printed copies of my flight itinerary, flight booking confirmation with the date of my return trip
&gt;
&gt;-I've screenshots of my dad sending me money every month for January and February, and also for lunar new year so I'll have extra aid financial wise if required.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And as for his part:
&gt;
&gt;-A sponsorship letter, detailing his study details and acknowledgment of my stay with him
&gt;
&gt;-Rent payment proof, a statement of some sort from his landlord
&gt;
&gt;-Photocopies of his passport and student ID
&gt;
&gt;-Bank statement, and on the letter is another proof of residency, as it's been mailed to the address claimed on his sponsorship letter
&gt;
&gt;-Printed screenshot of his timetable (don't have a physical copy) with his student ID on the same screen
&gt;
&gt;-Screenshot/forwarded email of his next flight back to Singapore in summer (July 2nd 2016). It's confirmed.
&gt;
&gt;He also has confirmation of the coach tickets he booked for the both of us to return to his residency. He'll be there to pick me up, so calling him on the spot is an option for immigration. I'm thinking of maybe photocopying my mom's bank statement or bills to further authenticate her letter, but I'm not sure if it's necessary. 
&gt;
&gt;I've pictures of us proving that we've met before, but they're on my iPad. Should I print those out or is it okay for me to pull out my iPad? We've met at least 5 times before and the duration varies between 2 weeks to 1-2 months. It is possible for me to pull out my iPad, right?
&gt;
&gt;I'll be staying for about 8 weeks, and will have £500 with me. I turn 18 and he turns 20 this year. Any help's much much much appreciated!


To add on, I'm taking a gap year, and this trip is just to experience what he experiences and is a part of me growing up. I wanted to get a job for 2016, but decided against it as it's redundant to get one and then ask for a two months leave straight after. This trip was unplanned as we both didn't know beforehand that he had to stay back for Easter for an internship his mother arranged. We originally planned for a month because I get home sick easily but tickets are really expensive nearing Easter so I dragged it for two weeks.

My letters have both my sister and brother as witnesses and I've a really close relationship to my family and they're completely supportive of this trip and us in general. His family feels the same.

I'm really afraid they won't let me pull out my iPad and might think I'm lying. It's my first time alone in a foreign country and I really don't want to be detained in a room and get sent back. It's embarrassing and would be devastating.

Please do help. It feels horrible and I really need someone to calm my nerves.

Edit: for title, I meant to say 19M, sorry!!"

Hi again, last post got some attention, thanks for everyone who read it and even more to those who took the time to comment! I really appreciate the input!

So, yesterday the last thing that I posted was that my sister had seen the message but had not answered yet.  Well, a little bit after that everything just went south through Whatsapp, and besides that the orthography she used could give cancer (kInda writeeng likee diz, i cant evan) she just dug herself even deeper in dirt and frankly I AM done, I'm exhausted at this point and have better things to focus my energy on.

So, onto the conversation... I won't copy paste it because a) eye cancer and b) original is quite long (again, sorry, LONG wall of text):

**BC: me, S: sister, []: notes**

**S**: Beside the WTF factor that you have a long-distance with him, I already talked to dad, but I wished you understand that I get up like super early and get home SO late, I don't have like super easy like you, the rent its cheap and that time I went out was like once, a friend was in town and had like zero evaluations.
I'm so sorry about the docs **[sarcastic]**, they told me Sunday night...ok I admit that I don't do my dishes and need to work on that but don't know where they come from, I don't eat that often at home [hint for Reddit: those are from last weekend]. What really bothered me was that you refused to send the documents like I'm asking you to come in person and deliver them to me in my hand, and literally the only favor you have ever done to me was borrow me a couple dollars in January, have empathy and stop being so arrogant, I don't say anything when you use my honey that I bought myself, I hope someone does the same to you.

So, thank you for the favor and for giving me 5 minutes of your time even when all you did was send two things in a super forced way and under threats, like I wouldn't do that to you.

**[30 mins later...]**

**S:** Look, Im sorry, I promise to do the dishes half a week.

**BC: [To be clear I sent my ideas in paragraphs]**

- I never had any trouble sending those documents: I was in class and I'm still with evaluations. If you had told me Sunday night I would have sent them the very same night. Just like it doesn't take me 5 mins to send them, it doesn't take you one to tell me on time.
- My program being super easy? seriously? **[I got offended by this]**
- Refusing to give you money from my budget because yours was spent on parties is not being arrogant. I'm not superior to you.
- I don't eat honey. It's probably dripping on your cupboard, check that.
- I know empathy: I know how its like being with no free time [another hint: I don't go out on weekends because I'm studying] and so, I know that it's possible to get organized.
- Yes, it's not common practice how my relationship with my SO is right now, but we both agreeded on making it work. You tried to use something I trusted you against me, and although I can forgive, I won't forget. ANYTHING regarding him you will know it from someone else than me, but you're still invited to meet him because he wants to. Just tell me when you have the time. PD: you forgot to take out the trash. 

**[I give credit to Reddit for that last paragraph, several posts on this sub use that kind of approach, so I decided to do the same]**


**S:** you never told me about the trash!
And I never said anything against you, and I'm always shocked how mean you are just with me, the worst being that I'm used to it, other people have told me that **[so, huh, never said against me?]**
I promise to change the things about the trash and dishes, won't tell you to never ask me favors, heck, please ask me for favors [uh, no?], I will do them, I'm so not looking for revenge **[...what?]**, not because I want to prove something, but because I would be so tiring to take revenge on something not worth it **[...at this point I'm just confused]**

I'm sorry for what I've done: I admit I'm messy and will put aside whatever excuses for my lack of time, gonna change that for my own good and hopefully for you too, if you need anything just tell me.

**BC:** I know you're not out for revenge...that would be so weird for a couple docs I couldn't send because I was paying attention to my professor. If you want to do favors for me, I prefer you do those to yourself: be clean, get organized and start tracking your expenses. It's a good start. I get worried that you're priorities are wrong.

The ""mean"" behavior I'm displaying just might be, MIGHT be because of how you treat me. Isn't it surprising how it's only with you?

We agreeded on the trash on Sunday, you were on your phone. Take it out next time.

------

So, as of today, she had not seen this message, probably just ignoring me by now.
So...yeah, that happened yesterday. I just want to mention that it was hours before an exam, so yeah, it got me stressed and probably will affect my grade.

What's my next step? First, as much as I wish to move out right now (like, RIGHT now) I can't. Money is tight right now, but I know I won't have to share a house forever with her (don't share a room though...) and only until I get my degree and get a job I will be able to get out and never share a place with her ever. For now: patience. Period. 

2) I'm still gonna live with her, but for me she's just another roomate. No more no less.

3) I will tell my parents again (this behavior is not unusual) but I'm going to demand them to give her ALL of her budget. I'm done being more of a nanny than a sister, and like one of you said yesterday, she can live without a nanny or a manager. Big changes start with baby steps. 

4) Along with that, I plan to tell them about my SO. I got nothing to be used against me, but if my sister thinks she got leverage on me with that, I rather take the imaginary wind out of of her sails as soon as I can, although it's nice to let her dream a little bit longer... 

I got a killer internship on January thats gonna give me a badass resume, today I'm gonna see the nicest gentleman that is my SO, I managed to get a research position at my college and I'm also editor of a college magazine, so if something is gonna affect my grades or perfomance or even get in my way it's gonna be me, not meaningless drama from my sis. 

I don't know if I'm gonna have a third update after I talk to my parents, but hopefully they will open their eyes because mine feel sore by now. I'm done.

...sorry I sounded angry, I'm still fuming a little bit. It's not my nature.
   
**tl;dr**: Things went south on Whatsapp. I'm done with her behavior, will take measures incluiding telling my parents and will divert my energy on better things."

469pyy,2,2016-02-17,Internship Experience,kangarootime,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/469pyy/internship_experience/,"So I've been an intern at a fairly large company that's running a big operation (atleast from my perspective) There are quite a few distinct IT departments in the company but I'm interning in what is basically HQ tech support/hardware prep for new offices. Initially my internship was physically helping with office moves, moving the departments computers to a different area in the building, at this time there was also another intern, after the moves finished up they elected to keep me rather than the other intern.

Now that the moves are done my day to day is unboxing workstations to be prepped, setting up servers to make it easier for them to finish up, (loading ESXI but then leaving it) I do some support calls, and some machine imaging.

One of the things I have issue with is that my priority is learning and improving but I am basically just a gopher ex. Move this, unbox this, take this there etc..
I'm not sure how much experience I am really gaining but it concerns me as I am almost done with an AAS in Network Administration and feel very unprepared for this industry. 

One of the main things I am gaining from what I can see is a foot in the door, my boss and I have had multiple discussions about taking a position in his department when it is approved.
These talks were initiated by him and not me so that encouraging.

I have also talked to the head of another department about
potentially applying for a field position which seems like it would be enjoyable while I'm still young.

Which do you guys think would be better entry level experience? A field position or a mixture of Helpdesk/hardware configuration?

I know this was a wall of text and I'm sorry."

So I do IT Support for our states county offices and some private businesses, have been for the past 2 years and since I am only 23 and will be graduating college in May i am still technically an intern so I do just about everything the office needs me to do. New PC setups, printer setups, AD user accounts, Sheriff office tough books, and all the program support that goes along with these many great things. Jack of all trades, master of none type of deal. So I get a service ticket for a user I had just setup a new laptop for in the Sheriff's office, not a tough book for the car just a laptop for in the office. I had done a remote session to her current desktop the other day to see what programs she would need on the new one, file save location things like that, very simple and straight forward setup really. She also had a program on there that runs through the state ITD but is setup on their counties local DC, we will call it *PoliceInfoProgram*. So in this service ticket it says she cant log into *PoliceInfoProgram* for some reason.


So I call her:
&gt; Hey *PoliceWoman* this is *ITGuy*, I have a ticket that you cant log in to *PoliceInfoProgram*?

Her response: &gt; Yes I cant, did you do anything to it when you were logged in yesterday?

Me: &gt; No? I never even clicked on it, I just noted that it was there. And managed to get the link to it and install it on your new laptop like you requested, you cant log in?

Her: &gt; Nope.

Me: &gt; Odd, okay well lets double check your user name, password, let me try typing it **User name\ password error. Check Server Connection**   WTH? (Under my breath) Are you sure you are using the right name and password?

Her: &gt; Yes I use this one all the time, its the one I used yesterday and it worked just fine after you got out of my pc.

Me: &gt; Okay....odd, well lets give it the old restart the PC and see what happens, maybe it just needs to reconnect to the domain and server to fix it. (So we do that, still get the same error and I am very confused because at this point I only know how to install it do the PC and that they have their own login that they know and it works). 

Me: &gt; Okay *PoliceWoman* Let me talk to another tech that might know a little more, hold on.

I walk to the next cube over and describe the situation to *OtherTechGuy*

His response: &gt; Is the time on her PC the exact right time?

Me: &gt; Uhhhh, I dont know, i guess i never looked. That didn't occur to be related to this at all.

I sit back down at MY PC and I  have another remote session going on her PC, and sure enough..her clock is 5 minutes slow according to my phone. So I set it back to the right time.

Me: &gt; Okay *PoliceWoman* try it now (I have no hope for this fix what so ever) **IT LOGS IN PERFECTLY** No Fricken way! (My exact words over the phone) 

She says while laughing at the same time: &gt;What the hell?!

Me: &gt; No way that's what it was, I guess your time has to be synced exactly with the state server for you to log into the program. Thats the last thing I would have thought of or bothered to look at.

Her: &gt; Thats fine, Im just glad its fixed. I will have to keep track of the time next time it happens.

[Why do you feel the younger generation favors a comedic approach towards news?

It's a trend that's been going on for the last 10 years. I think a lot of it has to do with authenticity. I think sometimes they feel like they don't know if they can trust the actual news anymore.

Be yourself."" He said it several times and I just thought it was one of the coolest things.
[A few months ago, a segment from your show received a lot of flak about two of your contributors writing off the importance of discovering water on mars, and it came off as disrespect to your guest, Bill Nye. My question is, did you have any reservations when planning this segment? It seems like a pretty easy read to see that it would have gone poorly, but it still made air.

People are allowed to have a point of view. Bill Nye had a great time on that panel. He's been on the show a couple of times. People are allowed to have opinions. For the life of me, I really don't understand why people are so upset that someone would disagree with Bill Nye. I was on Bill's side of that, but still, who cares? It's just a conversation.

That happens more often than naught because we only have about seven minutes to talk about something, so I'm always left with the feeling that there wasn't enough said.

There have been a number of guys coming onto the sub, either worried out about how they are in their late 20s, but don't feel accomplished, or are in their early 20s thinking it'll never catch up.

I know that for a lot of you, dating and romance is the big focus of your lives, and I don't blame you. It's an important part of the human experience and we should all have a chance to experience its beauty and excitement.

However, I want to remind you that life is more than just dating. Life is what you live every day, and **you** have the power to build the life that you want. You are not stuck where you are now, you *can* choose what you want your life to be like.

Now, let's be realistic here. If you come up to me and say, hey, I want to be the next billionaire. I'd tell you it's possible, but if you don't have a plan to get there, it doesn't matter how positive you think. I am not suggesting that this is like The Secret, and all you have to do is imagine your success. No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I *am* saying that you have the power to build your life and make it a life you are proud and happy to live. Your 20s are an important period of your life. 

I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with TED Talks, well here's one that was shared with me a few years ago, and it was instrumental in changing how I approach my late 20s. [Meg Jay - Why 30 is not the new 20](https://www.ted.com/talks/meg_jay_why_30_is_not_the_new_20/)

As usual, I've transcribed what I considered the important parts:

&gt;30's the new 20, Alex say, and as far as I could tell, she was right. Work happened later, marriage happened later, kids happened later...even death happened later. 20 somethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.

&gt;But before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life. I pushed back. I said, ""Sure, she's dating down, she's sleeping with a knucklehead, but it's not like she's going to marry the guy."" And then my supervisor said, **""Not yet, but she might marry the next one. Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one.""**

Likewise, the best time to build the career you want is before you're invested in the career you don't want. The best time to build the body you want is before you're burdened with the body you don't want.

&gt;That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20. Yes, people settle down later than they used to, but that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime. **That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot**, and *we were sitting there, blowing it*. That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere.

This is the point of my post. Your 20s are a valuable time for development. Go out there and chase girls, but always keep in mind there is more to the race. Don't squander your 20s on PUA tactics and shallow hook ups at the expense of your larger development. I'd rather see you spending your time and energy to become a complete person, not just a parlor trick of human interaction. If you reach your potential as a person, the PUA version of you wouldn't be able to hold a candle to you.

&gt;This is not my opinion. These are the facts. **We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35.** That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and ""Aha!"" moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s.

The above excerpt is directed more at the younger guys, or the guys who haven't gone out much. Some of you guys are more concerned about what _can_ happen, rather than what _has_ happened. Your mind is a beautiful thing, but what you imagine is not reality. Go out into the world and get experience. Yeah, you might get shitted on from time to time, but you'll have some really great moments too. And those are the memories I cherish from my early 20s.

Go try something new, go do something different. Make some memories, get some life experience. There is so much to do and see out there. It might be lame, but it might just be what you were looking for.

&gt;**We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.** We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30. *We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood, which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself*, **now is the time to change it**. We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28, and things get tricky after age 35. So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options.

&gt;So when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain. It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become. **But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development, and our 20s are that critical period of adult development.**

Again, touching upon development in your 20s. A fair number of us are capable, intelligent people. We are used to being able to cram for a test, or really focus on learning something. This is all possible, and definitely, if you focus on developing a specific skill for a while, you're going to get really good at it fairly quickly.

However, personal growth is not linear, it is not regular, and it is not evenly distributed across skill sets. You might be a quick learner when it comes to language, but not as quick of a learner when it comes to physical tasks. In addition, some skills complement other skills and expertise in one aspect does not always make up for a lack of skill in other departments.

IOWs, you can be the best dancer in all of the US, but if you don't know your table manners, you probably won't get a second date. On a broader scale, yeah you might be a playboy at the club, but if the rest of your life is in shambles, you won't be keeping many of those women you meet and eventually, your lifestyle will catch up to you.

So, guys, keep in mind your larger development. These things take time to build up. Careers cannot be built in a year. The beach body you want will not be built in 3 months. The dream gf you want requires you become the dream bf she wants, and that will not happen easily, nor quickly.

So start now, and continually evaluate where you are and where you want to be, and **make daily, diligent, consistent efforts towards those goals**. Gentlemen, it is no longer a sprint, you are in the marathon now. Welcome to adulthood.

You might say ""But CoarseCourse, I'm still only 24! I just graduated college, give me a break!"" Haha, yeah you deserve a break (if you were really hustling in college. let's be real, not all of us did, and certainly very few of us were 27/7), but time waits for no man young grasshopper. Take a break if you want, but do not forget that time still moves on.

Alternatively, I suggest this perspective. Okay, you've got your degree/whatever success you have up to this point. Why do you want to stop now? Don't you want to keep building up your lead? Don't you want to be even better off in another 10 years?

Whatever you do though, please, do not become complacent. Your 30s are **not** the new 20s.

&gt;So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say, ""You have 10 extra years to start your life""? Nothing happens. You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition, and absolutely nothing happens.

&gt;And then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this: ""I know my boyfriend's no good for me, but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."" Or they say, ""Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine.""

&gt;But then it starts to sound like this: ""My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself. I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college."" And then it starts to sound like this: ""Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs. Everybody was running around and having fun, but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down. I didn't want to be the only one left standing up, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30.""

&gt;**Okay, now that sounds a little flippant, but make no mistake, the stakes are very high.** When a lot has been pushed to your 30s, there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time. Many of these things are incompatible, and as research is just starting to show, simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.

&gt;**The post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car. It's realizing you can't have that career you now want.** It's realizing you can't have that child you now want, or you can't give your child a sibling. Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room, and say about their 20s, ""What was I doing? What was I thinking?"" I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.

Some of you may be reading this and feeling like it hits a little too close to home. Some of you may even already be in your 30s and feel this way. It's still not too late. You can still decide to start building the life you want. Imagine it like building a house. You'll still get your house, just a bit later than others, and with perhaps more difficulty. But isn't having the house you want at some point still better than never having the house you want ever?

&gt;Here's a story about how that can go. It's a story about a woman named Emma. At 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis. She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment, but she hadn't decided yet, so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead. Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition.

&gt;Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap, and she sobbed for most of the hour. She'd just bought a new address book, and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts, but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words ""In case of emergency, please call ..."" She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said, ""Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck? Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer?""

&gt;Now in that moment, it took everything I had not to say, ""I will."" But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared. Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance. I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by.

&gt;So over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every twentysomething, male or female, deserves to hear:

&gt;First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital. By ""get identity capital,"" I mean **do something that adds value to who you are. Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next.** I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: Identity capital begets identity capital. So now is the time for that cross-country job, that internship, that startup you want to try. I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here, but *I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count, which, by the way, is not exploration. That's procrastination.* **I told Emma to explore work and make it count.**

It took me a long time to even figure out just parts of who I want to be. Some of it was learning about what I liked, didn't like, what I valued, etc. Other parts were about accepting who I was, or deciding to ignore societal pressures and follow my heart. I always knew what I wanted in those aspects, but just didn't let myself want them.

I am still figuring out what I want. It changes as I experience new things and learn more about the world and myself. Start this process now. You can't build the life you want if you don't know what you want.

&gt;Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated. Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport, but *twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work*. **That new piece of capital, that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle.** New things come from what are called our weak ties, our friends of friends of friends. So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed. But half aren't, and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group. Half of new jobs are never posted, so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job. It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.

The irony in where I'm sharing this link is not lost on me. This point to me, relates to our sub here. I'm not pointing to anyone in particular at all, but I say this more as a general caution.

It's easy for us to become caught up in our community here. I appreciate what we have here and I'm thankful for the space. However, we mustn't forget there is a larger world out there. This is a safe place and it's easy to want to stay. Use r/AM as a launch pad and go out there and make new connections. Get exposure to new ideas, new people, new things. We will still be here when you get back and what you bring back will be valuable for not just you, but everyone else too.

Conversely, we have a large network of weak ties right here in our sub. If any of you are looking for professional/social help, there's a good chance than someone here might be able to point you in the right direction.

Let's help each other become the people we want to be.

&gt;Last but not least, Emma believed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends. Now this was true for her growing up, but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own. I told Emma **the time to start picking your family is now.**

&gt;Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20, or even 25, and I agree with you. But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress. **The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work. Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you.**

This is a personal topic to everyone so I'll largely stay out of this, particularly given that a lot of you are more just focusing on dating in the first place. I suppose though, for some of the older guys that imagine starting a family some day, it's a reasonable point to address. It takes time and some mismatches to figure out what kind of person you're compatible with and want to be with. You might think you want the hot club girl at first, then realize you're actually more of a homebody, or vice versa.

Also, it's not just the time to pick your future family, but it's also time to make sure the friends you have are the friends you want.

You want a good circle of friends, true friends. If you don't yet know the difference, go out and meet lots of different people. There are good friends and bad friends. Learn to recognize the bad ones and hold tight to the good ones. Once we enter adolescence, our peers direct our self-development far more than our parents/family do.

Don't poison yourself, keep good company.

&gt;So what happened to Emma? Well, we went through that address book, and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state. That weak tie helped her get a job there. That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend. Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums. She's married to a man she mindfully chose. She loves her new career, she loves her new family, and she sent me a card that said, ""Now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough.""

&gt;Now Emma's story made that sound easy, but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings. They are so easy to help. Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX, bound for somewhere west. Right after takeoff, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji. Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29, one good conversation, one good break, one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come.

I don't think so highly of myself that I think this internet post is going to be the catalyst for your future success. I do hope, however, that this is even just a small spark for you to consider where you want to be, what kind of life you want to have, to share with the kind of people you want to share it with.

I am here because I want all of my brothers to know they can have the lives they want, despite the enormous BS that is stacked against us. If this can help even one brother achieve that, it will have been more than worth it.

&gt;So here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know. It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex. It's what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day: **Thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood, get some identity capital, use your weak ties, pick your family. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. You're deciding your life right now.**

Drop your thoughts below, and then go outside and start building your life.

46apjc,0,2016-02-17,Inside the mind of a (lifelong) Maryland fan.,[deleted],CollegeBasketball,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/46apjc/inside_the_mind_of_a_lifelong_maryland_fan/,"I've noticed alot of anger at the Maryland fanbase in recent months on this forum. Some of it has been understandable, while another portion of it seems to come out of a lack of understanding a Terp fans mindset.

As someone who's followed the Terps for more than a couple decades now, let me try and respond to common claims about UMD and its fans:


1. **""Maryland fans overestimate their program!""**

This is a generational thing. If you've only recently started following basketball in the last ten years, then you'd be right in assuming that UMD has not done anything. 

Maryland is *not* a blue-blood. No one could ever make that statement reasonably. But to pretend like Maryland is just an average basketball school is equally silly.

Basketball is the most important sport at UMD and has been for ~50 years. One of the greatest college basketball players of all time, Len Bias, was a Maryland standout. Many writers have spoken about how Len Bias was the only man to make Micheal Jordan look like a mortal at UNC. Alot of current fans don't understand this. Lefty's Maryland teams were amazing.

Its not just Len though. The 1974 team is also known as one of the greatest teams of all time. Their loss in the conference tournament was *the* reason the NCAA tourney expanded to include at-large teams. 

The program has produced two HOF coaches in our last 3 tries, Lefty and Gary. Countless greats... John Lucas, Len Bias, Tom Mcmillen, etc. Several electrifying players... Stevie Franchise, Juan Dixon, (currently) Melo Trimble. 

So when you see Maryland fans talking about the greatness of the program, its difficult to understand without understanding UMD history. 

Why are Maryland fans unusually rabid on this forum? *We've been starved for success for 10 years.** Listen, this is a program that won a championship in 2002 and rattled off 17 straight NCAA tourneys. When we fell off a cliff for nearly 7 years, it wasn't long enough to kill the fanbase off, but it was long enough to literally starve us of good basketball.

Theres no other sport to fall back on in Maryland. No one gives a shit about UMD football (thats starting to change). The Wizards have always been bleh. 

The Terps are finally back. They likely won't win the tournament this year, but being back where we belong is huge for this fanbase.

2. **""Maryland fans have an inferiority complex.""**

This is actually true, but there are a couple reasons.

Maryland's campus is kinda situated in a strange place. Its less than 10 miles from DC, but College Park isn't a nice city outside of the campus area (this is changing).

That said, the campus itself is gorgeous. So we've got this situation where we have so much pride in our campus and our school, but we never get full credit for it because so many people can't look past the surrounding city. 

So while other schools in the area (Georgetown, Georgetown) can brag about their nice high-city campuses, Maryland kids have to Metro in to be in DC. 

We can't fully claim Baltimore either because we're in between the two cities. 

So thats one cause of an inferiority complex. 

A second reason was life in the ACC. There's really no point in going into this since I think most people can agree that conference belongs to the state of North Carolina. Maryland was never really a cultural fit. Despite being south of the Mason-Dixon line, Maryland is *not* a southern school. 

Absolutely everybody is ecstatic about the B1G move, even though our football program is getting their asses kicked routinely. (This is changing, *fingers crossed*)

Lastly, we've never had a true rival as has been mentioned repeatedly. UVA has VT. WVU is annoying, but quite frankly, its a different cultured school and Maryland doesn't see them as equals academically and culturally, even though we're somewhat evenly matched athletically (MD basketball overall is better than WVU, while WVU football overall is better than MD).

(as an aside, the inferiority complex is a huge reason why Juan, Greivis, and Gary are so beloved. They recognized that chip on the shoulder, and they carried it too. Turgeon is a change of pace and its weird for us, same with Melo. We're not used to that calmness.)

3. **""Maryland fans are classless.""**

This is 10% truth, 90% bullshit. Yes, MD fans get incredibly rowdy at games. We've covered the inferiority complex which just makes the craziness at games fester.

That said, most of the stuff Maryland fans get called out for happen across the country. UMD is in the most media covered area of the world however, and it gets alot of press. 

People made a huge fuss about Maryland burning couches after winning the Natty, but never mention UCONN fans doing the same. Maryland fans get called out for calling Uthoff ugly, but no one made that big a deal when UVA fans chanted ""crackhead parents"" at Juan Dixon (an orphan). All this stuff really just adds on to the constant feeling that Terps fans have of not getting a fair shake and being disrespected ... the inferiority complex strikes again. 

Frankly though, Maryland basketball has long been the only outlet here. The DC metro area is really dedicated to high-paced life, always working and on the go. If you're a student at Maryland, between metroing to internships in DC, or classes, the only outlet to really let loose sometimes is a basketball game. (as mentioned, football isn't big here)

This is also a reason Maryland fans don't travel well compared to some of the basketball crazy fans in the Midwest. Maybe it sounds elitist, but theres a whole lot of other stuff on the minds of people in the DC metro area. So let the kids go crazy at a basketball game, sheesh.



**

Anyways, this probably won't change anyones mind about *DAE MARYLAND IS THE DEVIL*. But, I think many Maryland fans can relate. So I hope the other Terps fans on here will prevent this from getting *totally* downvoted to hell.

46b0mg,1,2016-02-17,Question about internship and asking for help,1110_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/46b0mg/question_about_internship_and_asking_for_help/,"Hello everyone. I have a question about the situation that I'm in in my current internship.

I'm a CS senior that will be graduating in May and I'm currently in my 3rd month of an internship as an SQL developer. I had one very theory heavy SQL class with very little application and the rest has been learned through codeschool/other internet resources and on the job. 

I feel like I'm barely scraping by with this work. Every task I get assigned is something that I feel as if I'm starting from rock bottom. I spend a lot of time looking at robust and weathered SQL queries trying to understand their logic/business logic. I finish some tasks simply because I take the work home and work extra so it won't be late.

My problem is that the person that I was instructed to go to for help started off with a tone that makes me not want to ask for help. The responses were short, blunt, and made me feel like I didn't spend enough time investigating. I really try to refrain from asking for help now because I don't feel good asking them, they are very busy, and I think I've asked too many questions already and am worried it will look like I can't do the job. I want to learn as much as I can and contribute but I'm in a constant limbo looking at crazy code and the tasks that go along with it.

Would anyone have some advice on how to best approach a situation like this? I'm still trying to do my best at making progress but I'm a bit worried now of someone noticing how slowly I'm working and pulling the plug.

Now i have gotten a new intern whom i would like to bring with me on an adventure to learn using React. We have build some boilerplates and small apps to get us started with the correct libraries. Now we're ready to start working on a real product which should work out fine - i hope, but while building i am wondering if- for example - the isomorphic part of the application will cope with a lot of concurrent users? Something like 10k cc users?

If we enable cloudflare page caching, might there be some unforeseen stuff? Will there be other things that could bubble up?

- I am extra sleepy and tired than most people
- I wonder why I am such a slow person like a sloth
- I am behind on studying and schoolwork because I can't seem to think clearly and function
- I feel like time is going too fast
- I don't have enough time to take care of myself. I'm getting sick.
- Talking to classmates suddenly reminds me of things I haven't done and accomplished, such as internships, proper class scheduling, scholarships, leadership, etc. It's hard enough for me to take four classes and study for them and manage to take care of myself.
- I'm getting trash from people for taking longer than four years to graduate.
- I'm afraid if I don't do my class scheduling correctly I'll be wasting more money on tuition. I'll feel more guilty for taking longer.
- I already know I have depression and anxiety, but I seriously need to be reevaluated for ADHD.
- I feel like I need to get back on medication and rely on it because I need something fast. Therapy just doesn't cut it if I want to pass my classes.
- I don't know what direction I'm going in and I just really need time to stop and let me take a break from everything.
- Everything just goes over my head and nothing is streamlined for me and I don't know where to focus my attention to. There are too many things that I need to do and I can't handle it.
- I just can't seem to keep up with the world's pace.

Sorry if this just came out like a complaint post. I'm just looking for support and closure on all my issues. What I'm not looking for are negative responses like ""get off your chair"" or something."

Or should we wait another couple years?,iwantitallrightnow,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/46bn1k/are_we_rushing_into_buying_a_house_or_should_we/,"Financially I think this is feasible, but I'm here to get advice on my plan thus far and how doable it seems.

My husband and I have been long distance for a year and a half. I've been working while he finishes up his degree. He'll be graduating the end of 2016 and have a job with the company he's been interning for the last 3 years. He'll be getting paid about what I'm making now, but in an area with a lower cost of living. We aren't sure where exactly the job will be, but it's in a region that we prefer to where I'm working currently. I'll be quitting my job so we can be together again. Ideally we'd like to buy a house and settle in without renting too long or at all if possible. This is also when we'd like to start trying to conceive since we're on our thirties now and feel like we've held of long enough. I really would like to avoid moving too much in a short time, and also it'd be nice to avoid renting)

Is it okay if we try to buy a house before I quit my job since I'll have worked here 2.5 years vs him technically(not sure if the internship will hold any weight since he's brought in about $10k a year from it) just starting his job? I'm in a different state, but financially things will be similar once he's working and I'm not. We wouldn't be doing this to show our two incomes, just mine, and only with the intention of getting into a home sooner.

I'm not sure if this is relevant, but just in case here are our numbers

In the next year my net should be around 36k(my husband will be bringing home more than this because right now I'm maxing out my 401k contributions because we can afford to, but I don't know if that will continue)

We have 40k saved as our emergency fund and 20k in other savings to use for a down payment and I expect to be able to save another 20k this year. Plus whatever my husband has saved. We are both veterans so we can get a VA loan and put 0% down. Also our debt is 0, no loans, just credit cards we pay of every month.

I feel like we have an okay cushion for becoming home owners and parents. But I also am trying to be realistic in my planning and not get too excited and rush things and make mistakes just because I'm happy we can finally settle down and stop moving (5 times since 2011!)."

46bzcq,6,2016-02-17,Family Responsibilities VS Personal Aspirations,demacho91,expats,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/46bzcq/family_responsibilities_vs_personal_aspirations/,"Hi guys.
Let me first give you a background on who I am. 
I am a 24 year old American born under South Korean parents. 
I’ve lived in South Korea, Mexico, New Jersey, and Boston growing up. 
My parents have been split for over 10 years now because their means of acquiring income forces them to stay split up. 
My family hasn’t been well-off for as long as I remember, and I have two younger siblings. 
One of them will be graduating college this May, the other will be going to college in two years. 
As for me, I graduated from a private business school and started a job in New Jersey, which I really like. 
(Both me and my brother received a lot of scholarships and grants which reduced the cost of education substantially) 
I still get paid an entry-level wage, but the job growth opportunities with this firm are tremendous and it seems like compensation will get really good from now on. 
Our family has no concrete plans on unifying again, and we have no assets (namely, a house). 
My father is in good health, but my mother got into a car accident recently, and has some health problems. She runs a small business and works very long hours.

As the firstborn of my family, I’ve made it my duty since I was a young kid to do well financially in order to be able to reunite my family. Truthfully, it put a lot of burden on me as a kid, and I‘ve only recently recovered from a long-time depression caused by it (and other factors like bullying, racism, social alienation, etc.) I’ve come to accept my reality as it is, and overall, my family is doing well. I live at home now with my mom and sister in NJ. My mom needs a lot of help around the house, and my sister is really busy with her studies (she’s actually a top notch student). My brother may return to NJ as well and look for a job here, but I don’t think I can rely on him too much for financial assistance for the family since he is looking for internships and plans on going to grad school. So I’m not sure if he’ll even stick around NJ.

My siblings were fortunate to move to the USA from Mexico at a convenient age. My brother came at the end of elementary school, and my sister came as a baby. I, on the other hand, went from Korea to Mexico mid-elementary school, and then from Mexico to the USA mid-middle school. They haven’t experienced sudden cultural shifts like I have. Has it been hard for me? Totally. But do I wish it had been different? No. I got the chance to heighten my cultural awareness, and develop language abilities that not many people have. Overall, I’m proud of how I’ve been molded as a human.

My problem is this: My family has pretty much decided to plant their roots in NJ. I, on the other hand, feel incapable of “settling down” To be blunt, I fucking hate New Jersey.

I cannot accept NJ as my home and I desperately desire to move far away from here.
I wish to move somewhere near LA. LA is the perfect blend of Koreans, Mexicans, and Americans. I feel right at home there. Not to mention the fact that professionally, I could be a great asset there since I am capable of speaking the corresponding languages, and have a deep understanding of their cultures. Also, the current company I work for has several branches out there, and I think requesting an internal transfer is totally doable.

I’m also enamored by the idea of moving to Europe (specifically Berlin) and starting a fresh life from there. I actually prefer this idea over moving to LA. I have close friends in both locations.

The idea of leaving everything behind and struggling to learn a new language and culture isn’t foreign to me. In fact, I WANT to struggle like that again. I’ve come to realize that it’s what keeps me happy. Something I say often to my friends is, “I never feel more at home than when I am lost”
I’ve discussed my desire to move far from home, but my mom plays the guilt card every time. I don’t need her to tell me that she needs help around the house and how she wants the family to live together again. Truthfully though, I turn 25 soon and living with my parents doesn’t make much sense to me, anyways. I agree with the part where my mom needs help around the house though. She also discusses plans to buy a house, and starting a mortgage under my name (so that financial aid for college for my sister will not be affected). I’m definitely against the idea of committing to a 30-year plan to invest in a home in New Jersey.

I have a vagabond soul. I always need to wander.
I cannot settle down, especially not in this godforsaken state of New Jersey.

So Recruiters are asking me for some keywords.

    * server
    * linux
    * terminal

46c0oa,1,2016-02-17,At university for sake of parents,illllllllli,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/46c0oa/at_university_for_sake_of_parents/,"I am currently in my second year of Computer Science at wha is considered a ""good"" university. 

Within my first month after starting this course I knew it wasn't for me. I told this to my parents even though I knew that they had been expecting me to do well. Their response was pretty much ""Don't care, do the degree for us as we are an academic family"". Almost everyone in my family has higher qualifications, at the very least a degree but masters and PhD in the case of my parents.

I went through the first year depressed, suicidal at points after having so many conversations with my parents about leaving uni (almost every two months) each conversation started with my explaining my situation and plan and ended with me in tears and I realised I had two options, finish my degree for the sake of my family, or leave university being classed as a drop out and move away from my family potentially lose regular contact with my extended family and parents/brother.

I scraped pass grades in every module in the first year, convincing myself that a pass grade was all I needed to maintain good relations with my parents.

Now in the second year, the work is really demanding, I'm not committed to studying as my only motivation is my parents and I'm afraid I may fail. My parents don't understand this because I've always been a ""good student"" and I was given a scholarship to study at my university for my academic excellence. I also have a really good software engineering internship lined up next year at a multi national company who I won't name. Academic excellence is one thing, but I have no desire to do a degree, I have worked most summers in various roles in the IT field and I have enjoyed it. I want to leave uni and be a ""drop out"" / ""failure"" and work in similar roles that I am qualified for and have experience in.

I'm worried about the potentially permanent damage I could do to my relationship with my parents and younger brother by leaving my course but I am also worried about becoming depressed and anxious with my mental health, I've noticed my personality and outlook on life change, I don't exercise anymore, I eat whatever I want, I take risks I wouldn't take in the past, I'm much more likely to get in an argument with random people and I don't really look forward to waking up on the days where I have class. I'm finding it difficult to make a decision as there are other factors at play, if I fail or don't complete my course, the scholarship becomes nullified so I will be left with a huge debt."

I'm 7 weeks into my design internship and I don't know really. I just feel like I'm not good enough, my friends at school in college said that my work was good, but I guess I'm just to harsh on myself because I can't help shake the feeling that they're just saying it to make me feel better and I don't really know what they think and to be honest I really never will. My employer said that he liked my portfolio when they decided to take me on as an intern so I guess I should take that as a positive thing but I really don't feel satisfied with my work. I look out into the design world, on dribbble, designspiration, reddit, graphic burger and other websites with designers work and I feel like my work pales in comparison. Visually I know what looks good, I can see the things I want to create but when it comes down to executing my ideas I feel lackluster and I feel like I'm not improving at a rate that makes me happy.

In other words, how did you guys feel coming out of college, fresh into the world of design not knowing what you know now?

What would you tell yourself back then, or how you felt? Did you worry too much? Were you too hard on yourself? If so how do I stop that?

Sorry for the incoherent rambling, I do that a lot, but I just need to let my feelings out and I feel like this is the only place I can get everything I need to say out.

I've lived here all my life, and enjoy my life here. I've been considering changing my career from that of which got my degree in (Tech to Health Profession). I have most of the prereq's for a medical career because I always had interest but wanted to give tech a real try because I liked it too. I always thought maybe I can make an impact in these environments. Job offer is in corporate big name company, but I've been very annoyed of corporate life from my internships. One of my internships was even with another branch of this company (in a different state from home). I feel like this is going to begin a long string of my moving from state to state, never truly putting roots because of how Tech/engineering roles are. I feel so dispensable. I try to get myself excited by it, but I simply can't get myself to become happy. I am more conscious now more than ever of what makes me happy. My friends, my family, my peace. I'm the oldest of 4 by at least 10 years and can't stand the thought of not being there for them. I had a rough path getting to this point where I'm becoming happy. I feel like I'm lining myself up for disappointment because I know a job isn't everything. I counted down the days until my corporate internship in another state was over. I was so happy to leave. It's not like I hated the people or anything. I just knew it wasn't for me. I feel like in my gut this isn't it. When I talk about it with friends (who are supportive of choosing whatever I want) I start tearing up because I feel like it isn't.

I want to move on my own terms and not feel like I'm forced to go because I'm anxious about my career starting. And with my recent want to become a Doctor, Nurse, etc. I feel like I'm just going to become depressed if I don't give myself the chance to see what I could do (which is much more affordable tuition wise in-state because I have a few classes I'd need to take). I've become very disillusioned with my career, I don't get excited by the thoughts of moving up a corporate ladder. I feel like throwing up at that thought. I feel like I'm going to live all my life behind a computer, not contributing more to the wellbeing of others when I know I'm capable of it. I want to help people. I want to feel like I'm helping someone get better. I don't want to be pushing profit margins. I'm trying to see the good in going, but my mindset was to go, get my 2 years of experience, and come back home. But if working for the company long term is not even what I want, then what's the point of doing it?

tl;dr: Got a job offer across the country where I know no one. Not really sure if this is the career path I want anyway and can't get excited about it. I feel trapped because it is an impressive job offer, but I don't think it's worth my happiness. What should I do? "

I'm stopping in today looking for some advice. I basically want to know if I am kidding myself trying to get into asset management/investment banking. I need to know if its time to pivot, press the reset button and get a second degree, or if its time to push harder to break into the industry. Feel free to be blunt I just want the truth, I don't want to waste anymore of my time or money pursuing a dream that is out of my grasp.

**Credentials**

I am about to graduate from a small/ medium University with a Bachelor of Commerce and between a B+ - A- average. I have been extremely active with extracurricular during school at case competitions winning 3 international competitions during my time at school. Case competitions really helped me get engaged at school and sparked a lot of my interest in being an analyst in either a consulting or investment banking field. Two of these competitions were Finance specific cases where I finished ahead of teams from more prestigious schools. I'm currently studying for the CFA level 1 exam in June of 2016. My glaring weakness is that I wasn't able to get internships during my time at school (same story, I aggressively pursued positions but never really got a sniff at an interview) so my experience is limited to physical labor jobs that helped me pay for my education.

**The Job Hunt**

Where my school is located (Ottawa) makes it hard to network with the types of companies (Scotiabank, RBC, BMO etc...) I would like to work for. These firms don't even recruit at our school and we are often looked down upon for not being students from top schools. I have sent out nearly 200 resumes and cover letters since the beginning of January, and have yet to receive even a phone interview. 

**What I'm Doing Now?**

Right now I'm trying to do everything I can to be an attractive candidate. I'm working on my excel skills everyday trying to become as proficient as possible. On top of studying for the CFA Level 1 I'm working at reading a book a week on business and finance topics in an effort to improve my knowledge base and critical thinking. This is all while finishing my last semester of studies.

**The Bottom Line**
 
I'm worried that my mediocre grades and experience is going to make it impossible to break into the industry. Realistically I feel like my only way in is through getting a Master's Degree, but I'm worried that even with a Master's Degree I will be looked down on for my lack of experience during undergraduate.

Realistically what would you do if you were in my shoes? I don't want to waste my time and money pursuing a career that I will never get a chance at. "

Enter Vegano Italiano Tours. An offshoot of Tierno Tours, in collaboration with eco travel agency Green Earth Travel, Vegano Italiano Tours offers visitors a unique adventure to discover the hidden treasures of southern Italy.

This year’s first trip kicks off with eight days (seven nights) along the fabled Amalfi coast in the Campagnia region and its lesser-known but equally enchanting neighbour, Cilento, birthplace of the pizza and Mediterranean diet.

“Cilento is a special treat,” says Gretchen Sheridan, co-founder of Vegan Travel Club. “It’s a hidden secret that only Italians and a few VIPs in Europe know about. It’s one of the last few real Italian hangouts.”

Tour participants will have the opportunity to make limoncello (Italian lemon liqueur) and enjoy lunch in an old villa located among lemon groves in Sorrento, followed by visits to the ancient Roman ruins of Herculaneum, sister city to Pompeii; the Monastery of Padula, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the largest antiquity of southern Italy; the extraordinary caves of Castelcivita and the historic center of Roccadaspide built in 1242 by Fredrick II. This was passed down to the Duke Ettore Giuliani, who will give the tour himself.

Accommodation comprises a beautiful bed and breakfast situated in Cilento’s National Park where guests can relax and enjoy the breathtaking views of lush forest and crystal clear waters.

All this comes with the added bonus of special guest Julieanna Hever, the Plant-Based Dietitian and host of Z Living’s health and wellness show, What Would Julieanna Do?

A registered dietitian based in Los Angeles and self-proclaimed ‘Italophile’, Hever will be cooking and showing guests how to make healthy, delicious, plant-based versions of their favorite dishes, using recipes from her latest book The Vegiterranean Diet. This will include traditional Italian fare such as pasta and, of course, pizza.

“I’m excited to offer my unique nutrition perspective after spending years studying the much beloved and acclaimed Mediterranean diet,” says Hever, author of the best-seller The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Plant-Based Nutrition. “I can’t wait to explore the unique and exceptional locations planned for this tour of my favorite country. To have local, fresh, and gourmet vegan meals combined with expeditions of gorgeous grottos, national parks, and historical temples sounds like a fantasy trip!”

46cgpu,5,2016-02-17,Europe &gt; Australia. 457 Visa - Company can't pay market rate salary. Suggestions?,belethcalwen,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/46cgpu/europe_australia_457_visa_company_cant_pay_market/,"Hello All,

Back in November a company in Adelaide invited me to go see them after I inquired if they may have any future positions. They didn't have anything at the time, but have now came back to let me know that they have a job, but that they are ""not yet in a position to look at a higher level role due to budget constraints"".
The position is exactly what I've been hoping to find and would match the supply &amp; distribution or procurement manager role if the issue of budget wasn't there.
I replied to his mail giving him a few job titles and let him know the market rate for supply managers I could find, and they have now invited me to come back to speak with them tomorrow morning to discuss if there are any options.

My questions to you:

- Can anybody think of ways to help the firm be able to pay enough to qualify?
I have been thinking of suggesting that I could work for 6 months on my working holiday visa either below market rate in a more junior role or even suggest to bring me in as an intern or so with very little/no pay.
My concern is that I don't want to jeopardize then looking as though I am not qualified to apply, as my background is not as rock solid as I would like it to be. 
(I have a masters in European Business, Culture and Languages and was a Supply Chain Customer Service Manager for 3 years - though the job description fits perfectly. I'm planning on receiving my Supply Chain Professional Certification from APICS to strengthen it further before then)

- Does anybody have suggestions for best websites etc to give them all the info needed while also not overwhelming them?

Thanks!"
46cibc,59,2016-02-17,"I'm an illegal alien, but I'm still human.",Nas_sombras,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/46cibc/im_an_illegal_alien_but_im_still_human/,"I've been wanting to get this off my chest for 16 years now, so apologize for the length. Throwaway obviously. 




I came to America at the age of four from a third world country (not Mexico). I grew up in a slummy street and my family had issues with big name drug traffickers because my father shut down a major operation on the border. I also wanted to join the US Military, my dream was to be an air force pilot from the day I saw an airplane. Naturally, we applied for a visa and entered the USA legally. When our visa expired, we knew we couldnt go back. I dont think there's any point in asking my parents whether they could have done more the ""right"" or ""legal"" way. They did what they knew was best for me, what anyone would have done for their family in their situation, as far as I know. 




And so, I grew up in America pretty much like any other poor kid, or at least I thought so. You see, aliens can't work without a social security number. My parents worked backbreaking labor jobs in factories and industrial cleaning with no car for under the table cash, and I went to school without knowing a word of english. By my second year in school, I was the best speller in class. By 4th grade, I had no more accent and was reading at the top of the district level. I had my eyes set on being the smartest, brightest person in my classes because I knew, even at that age, that my parents sacrificed so much for me. I didn't realize it was all for shit though. 




By my high school years my father had managed to get a drivers license from another state, and was using it to work as a pizza delivery driver for cash. He supported our family of 3 as the sole worker for the next 13 years delivering pizzas. My sophomore year of high school I got my first job in a kitchen where my dad delivered. I would go to school at 8am, leave at 3, commute by bus to work by 5, then leave at 11pm. On Fridays and saturdays, I would leave work at 3am. It wasnt fun or easy, but I was happy I was able to help support my parents. I also started saving up for college material. My happiest day being when I bought an Ikea desk that cost me $200. It was the most amount of money I had ever spent on anything, I still smile when I think about it. 




It wasn't until junior year that reality finally hit me. I applied to a dozen colleges for aerospace engineering and aerospace degrees. I got accepted into 5, but I wasn't eligible for any financial aid. Or scholarships. In fact, as soon as most schools found out I was undocumented, I was discouraged from attending at all. So I brushed it off, I figured I'd join the military and they'd pay for my college anyways, then I could become a functioning member of society and pay my dues for my family. So I worked, and then drilled with the Marine poolees in my spare time. My life became learn, drill, learn, work, and sleep. I walked into the recruiting office at the age of 17 proud of how far I'd come. I was a robotics competition vice captain, theater board member, straight A's, worked for a living, grew up in a military home. I scored 97 on a surprise practice ASVAB the recruiter gave me. I thought I had it in the bag, they'd pay me to join, I thought. Then my recruiter mentioned I couldn't get the clearance as a non-citizen to fly. I could possibly work as a plane tech for a few years, then have the chance to get naturalized *then* go to college only to have the slim chance of actually becoming a pilot. I walked out of the office both shaken and motivated. I would either fly, or nothing, so I chose nothing. My life goals for the first 17 years of my life were crushed in a single evening because I wasn't a member of this country, even though I was willing to die for it. So whatever, I moved on. 




Senior year I continued working, the stress caught up to me and my home was falling apart. Financial stress on my parents was affecting their health and my grades were suffering badly. I would have a major breakdown at least once a month because it felt like everything was out of control and it was hard to gain sympathy from my father when he was working so much harder. All of my friends were driving by now, all of them being accepted into colleges with scholarships and talking about who else would get in. I couldn't even afford my yearbook, or prom, and 3 AP classes were talking a toll on my physical and mental health. Come graduation, I was one of the few kids not enrolled in a college. I remember it being outdoors and pouring, we were soaked to the bone. Then the sun came, and a literal double rainbow formed over us. It was incredible, I think I still have a picture of it somewhere. 




A few months later, Obama's new initiative, DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) was announced. This program took kids who have been here for a long time as undocumented immigrants and gave them a social security number and work permit. The application process was rigorous and required intensive background checks, hundreds of pages of proofs of where I was at certain times, proofs of being a ""good citizen"", report cards, places of employment, and any tax documents available. I also scrounged up the $500 fee to apply for the chance of consideration. Several months later, I got it my answer. For the first time in my life, I was kind of normal, and it was literally the happiest day of my life so far.




I still couldn't afford college, but now I could work legally, so I applied to 84 jobs and internships over the course of 5 months. I still have the emails I sent out as reminders of where I've been, I bs'ed my way into anything I could find. Journalism, technology, marketing, sales, anything. In the meantime, I continued working in the  kitchen, as well as a brief stint as a knife salesman for two weeks (ugh, Vector, I was desperate). 




A few months later, I got two call backs from local tech companies. 4 months later, I was doing two simultaneous internships. One paid, one unpaid. Either way, I was working 15/hr at my paid internship, and I was learning a ton. It was my unpaid internship that made me who I am today though. By the time it ended it left me with a massive network of local entrepreneurs. These were inspiring people, immigrants from all over the world, people who knew the value of hard work. I was a young kid and hearing these guys throw around talk about million and billion dollar valuations was incredible, I didnt even care that I wasn't making money washing dishes and moving furniture as an ""intern"". 6 months later, I was hired full-time at a tech company based on what I had learned from them. 3 years later, and I'm working with a healthy salary doing something I love, I learn every day and I have incredible potential for growth. All my friends are still in college, while I have money to travel and I fully support my parents financially. 




**Regardless of this, it's still hard to be happy.** My parents still cannot work, I cannot vote, and I have no security in my future. Even though we pay our taxes (and have done so even when receiving cash), donate 10% of the little money we have the needy, volunteer with veterans, follow the law, fill out the census, protest for the rights of citizens who are more privileged than we are, and generally are all good human beings because we value goodness, we are still treated like trash. 



It's really something special being the most hated demographic people in this country. Both sides hate you for ""taking jobs"". You're blamed from everything to unemployment to terrorism to the trillion dollar debt. People even think that ""the illegal vote"" was what caused Obama to win. We can't even vote! I realize what we have done is a moral gray area, but it really does make you think. The car I saved up for to buy my parents has had its tires slashed, windows smashed, and had nasty notes left on it. I've been told ""I almost look like I belong here"" which is probably the nicest thing an American has said to me on this subject. Other alien families in my community are physically attacked, sexually assaulted, mistreated, and taken advantage of because most don't know their rights and don't call the cops. The internet is even worse honestly, everyone knows what illegals are like because they've seen some workers doing a labor job before. They think we're dirty subhumans who dont pay taxes and leech welfare. We're not, and I hope this helps someone out there get some perspective on us. We're just human. 



I don't really have a point to this, and I apologize for any lack of cohesiveness. I figured I could TLDR it for the lazy (or conservatives who hate me and wont read this anyways):



**ILLEGALS FACTS AND MYTHS**


1. Illegals cannot vote. Obama is democracy's fault, not ours, if you don't like democracy you're welcome to our shitty countries. 


2. Most of us pay our taxes yearly. In fact, many use their tax numbers are replacements for their SSNs, but its not super common. We're still contributing to the economy regardless, no different than anyone else. 


3. We don't benefit from welfare. I can't prove that we aren't able to get EBT, but honestly I never met another alien who has one, and the majority of us probably don't even know how to get benefits, including myself. 


4. The majority of illegal immigrants don't come through the border, nor are they Mexican. In fact I believe a good portion are Haitian or Chinese who simply overstay their visa. 


5. 40% of americans think undocumented immigrants dont deserve public education, yet from personal experience, out of the top 10 students graduating my high school, 4 were undocumented, one was valedictorian. Take that as you will. 


6. It's not as easy as ""applying for a greencard"". If it was we'd all have done it.


7. The unlucky ones who do get sent back are either served with a letter of deportation or have their homes raided under ""probable cause"". I've known a few people who were gone this way, but I never questioned the validity of the ""violent"" ICE raids. 

8. If you are deported or caught crossing the border, you have the chance of getting a nice vacation in [the Freezer](http://www.npr.org/2014/07/24/334041633/amid-wave-of-child-immigrants-reports-of-abuse-by-border-patrol). This is a private prison where you get to be penned in with other people, abused sexually/verbally/physically, or straight up disappear because no one gives a shit about you and you technically don't exist. 

9. [We aren't criminals](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/16/voices-gomez-undocumented-immigrant-crime-san-francisco-shooting/30159479/), and [in fact, we are less likely to commit crimes than citizens are.](http://immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/criminalization-immigration-united-states)

10. We'd love to be paid to build Trump's wall.

I am a 2015 Graduate with a Finance degree from a top 50 university on the east coast with solid internships in the investment space.

Following graduation, a personal family situation required me to move back home for quite a while following graduation and meant that I had to turn down a position I was offered in the summer. I was unable to work until December and since then I have been struggling heavily trying to find a job due to my gap in employment (Did not expect for it to be this difficult). With 2016 graduation coming up, the situation is becoming worse. 

Could I get some advice as to how I should proceed with my job search? Indeed/LinkedIn doesn't seem to be working for entry level positions and recruiters have been quite unhelpful (Outside of contract positions, which I am trying to avoid until now). 

To overcomplicate things, I am trying to find a job in the San Francisco area to start my career. Is it realistic for me to expect to find a job on the other side of the country given my current circumstance? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

But after this semester I'll have completed Computer Science I &amp; II (c++) as well as an Assembly Language course which are lower division courses. I don't have any side projects or anything extra curricular going for me. 

My issue is that I graduate Fall 2017 which only gives me one more shot at an internship for next summer. Coming into this major pretty late doesn't give me as many opportunities as if I started this as a freshman and I just really want some real life experience to prepare me for when I graduate.

With the right studying, is there any chance to get an internship at a reputable company for this summer? or should I try and find a more local internship?

I'm pretty sure having dyed hair does affect the chances of getting a job , but by how much? I was able to obtain an internship with my full dyed blonde hair at a small IT consulting firm a couple months ago and my manager didn't mind that I had dyed hair. He even sent me out to our clients with my blonde hair. So my question is if it is okay to  try to obtain a job with a bigger company with dyed hair? There are probably rules and regulations pertaining to this ,but I just really enjoy having dyed hair :/. Currently my hair is its natural color."

I smoked pot for the first time when I was a junior in High School.  By the standards of my school that was late.  I drank though, I loved to drink, and one of the first times I drank I had gotten kicked out of a summer school program that I loved.  That was my first big fuck up I guess.  Something like the summer after freshman year.  When I started smoking I smoked a lot, summer after senior year it was every day after work.  Something changed in me then.  I don't know what.  I went to school and flunked out right away.  Withdrew actually and then re-enrolled and restarted the next year.  Kept smoking pot.  Grades were good then they got bad and kept going down.  Graduated with a 2.8, which is really shit.  Teachers hated me, I was always late.  Immature.  First job I was so bad that the intern was given more responsibility than me and my hours were cut.  I got the job through a friend who was addicted to oxy and Heroin at the time and he was doing better there than me.  My hours were cut so bad that I could barely live.  The next job I fucked up so bad that I quit before I was fired.  Then I was unemployed for six months.  Then got another job.  Investment banking this time.  Fired after a year and a half.  Girlfriend is on the verge of leaving me.  Working a contract now, hate it, want a man with a AKA to pop out of a hallway and shoot me in the gut.  Doing poorly.  I always start well and for the most part I've failed up like Carly Fiorino.  About to hear about another job, actually interested in this one, but I was interested in all the others on some level too.  Don't know what to do.  Taking 15mg adderall a day. That sort of helps, but only when the work is interesting enough to keep me occupied.  Data entry is so fucking boring I go numb doing it.  I don't know, but I'm scared.  Don't want to fuck up this next one, because if I do, then it's time for a re-think because clearly something isn't working.  Always wanted to do military.  Started smoking pot heavily only after I was denied entry to the US Naval Academy.  Didn't do ROTC, never really saw the point.  Could still do it.  Could be an officer, but you know I would have to apply and my leadership experience isn't all that great and I'm a fuckup and if I join the military my girlfriend won't stay with me.  She's a great catch though.  Also I went through a horrible breakup a few years back with another girl and it was so painful.  I lost close to 20 lbs in just a few months.  I do not want to go through that again.  When we nearly broke up recently I started feeling those same things.  It's very bad.  I would find somebody else though, I know that.  I don't know my value.  I was tested after bombing college, my parents sent me to a psychiatrist.  Apparently there was nothing wrong with me.  Possible.  Apparently my IQ is 138 which is the same as Hermann Goring.  It's 1/177 people so I'm not a freak of nature, but up there.  I say this because I think it's tied to something else.  I'm cyclical.  I think sometimes that it might be bi-polar but I have a bi-polar brother and friend and I'm not as bad as them.  Sub-clinical.  I don't hate myself but I think about suicide a lot.  I don't feel particularly sad or disconnected or lonely.  I have lots of friends and am very close with my parents and sister.  I don't want to die because I'm out of hope or anything like that, I want to die because I'm kind of ""over it"".  I want to die because of the same feeling you get when you've fucked up the video game you're playing so bad that you're just disgusted and want to start over.  I don't believe in reincarnation but I like the teachings of buddhism.  I always thought and think that I would be so good in the military but I sucked at sports, am immature and I only think that because I imagine the person that I would be in the military is a ""turned on"" version of myself.  I know/fear that I would still be numb, indifferent, bored, apathetic me.  Because that's how this works.  You can't run away from you.  

My mom is an alcoholic.  I have been through bouts of Alcohol and drug abuse.  I started making a list of all the drugs I've taken the other day.  It started off as a funny thing, just to see.  By the end of it I was disgusted with myself.  I worry that I've fucked my brain, that I've triggered some defect in my brain.  That's why I mentioned the intelligence thing.  There was some article the other day on reddit connecting intelligence to mental illness.  It struck a nerve.  I don't know that I have anything, and in fact I wouldn't lay a bet on it that I do.  When I went in to get the Adderall last year, the psychiatrist said the survey indicated I had depression.  I told him I was just overwhelmed with work.  I don't think I'm all that smart, and besides who gives a shit how smart you are if you don't do anything with it.  My Dad sent me an article about grit being a determining factor of economic success.  I don't know that I have grit.  I often think of myself as a delicate sports car.  Never fucking works right, but when it does...it's good.  I never fucking work though.  Sometimes I think I'm supposed to go be a monk or something, a reflective.  People tell me I should teach.  I like talking, but teaching isn't doing.  I always say I like the military but the more I learn about war, the more I see killing, the less I want that in my life.   I don't want to kill someone.  I would, but I don't particularly look forward to it.  I like the idea of action and a dynamic environment.  
I'm laying down know and words aren't coming to me like they were before and I'm too lazy to go back to my desk.  I'm so fucked.  "
46d8p8,18,2016-02-18,CAPS is charging me for counseling when I'm already experiencing suicidal thoughts. What do I do?,ucscgirl,UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/46d8p8/caps_is_charging_me_for_counseling_when_im/,"I have been thinking about suicidal thoughts and I decided to go to CAPS. I knew that my pain was escalating each and every day that I struggled with a high point in my depression that my parents suppressed and told me that it did not exist. I used to be on antidepressants that really helped (just generic Prozac) but my mom told my psych that I didn’t need them so they cut me off when I was 17. I had huge side effects and even my psych said it was dangerous to stop me without gradually reducing my prescription, but my mom had all the say if I got more medication or not. 

So I told this to the counselor with my history, and she told me they would be willing to give me a psych that’s covered on my insurance but I would need to also see an off campus counselor, which is $20 per visit. I’m on USHIP right now but I literally cannot afford $20 each visit. Yes I know there are may be some existing payment plan but let’s say I go twice a week, that’s $160 right there per month. And let’s say they decide I need counseling for a year? You can already imagine. 

I thought CAPS was free and everyone advocates for it? I literally only need short term counseling because I have been in therapy before, I just have been hitting a rough spot right now in my life and I need some support. I know how to cope, I know how to distract myself, I just literally need a temporary support system for a bit til I get back on my feet. 

I don’t want to get my parents involved financially, since they’re going to not willing to. They believe that depression doesn’t exist. I already pay for my own car bills, my own student bills, my phone bill, etc. I know $20 isn’t a lot but it ads up. For the times I could be buying groceries or commuting to work, I’m worrying about this medical bill.  I’m an 18 year old girl and I know how to take care of my future, I already landed two internship positions and I plan to graduated before my class. I’m a grounded person, but I literally just am at a high in my life in a cycle of depression that I need to take action. 

Has anyone had experience with CAPS? I feel like I’ve been lied to, with how amazing and accessible this service is. And they even told me that counseling was free in the beginning and now they’re expecting a $20 co-pay per visit. They told me to sign up for financial aid aka pull out more loans, which I’m not ready to do when I’m already dealing with loans and a credit card bill. I make enough to cover my own expenses and this just more of something I need to worry about, also just making me more anxious. 

I just feel alone right now and I hate how this school is treating those who need help. I already pay for USHIP and I pay for the facilities, it’s not fair that they’re going to bill me more for a service I desperately need and they’re literally letting me gamble my life for it.

He started as an intern working in the lab power and infrastructure, got hired by our company for another department, and finally came back to our team as a full employee. Great guy, works hard, and I found out recently how well he can connect the dots. 

There is a division between our lab and the rest of the company. We own the lab network and infrastructure, and the company IT owns the network and infrastructure outside the lab. The cubicles have two network connections - most users connect to the corporate network behind their phone or a small switch on one port, and a handful connect their workstation to another port that connects to a set of floor switches hooked directly into the lab network. 

We've had tickets come in where a few users complain they cannot keep their SSH connections open between their machines in their cubicles, and their test/dev gear inside the lab. One in particular had us scratching our heads. IT checked their DHCP log, same IP every day. No errors in their logs, the DOS protections and the firewall logs didn't show any dropped packets. 

We moved him over to the alternate port, but the firewall is pretty strict on traffic coming out of the lab. The user finds he cannot live behind such rules and decides to move back to the corporate network, and we resume troubleshooting. 

One morning, my teammate comes by. 

&gt; Teammate: I figured it out!

&gt; Me: Yeah? What is it? 

&gt; Teammate: There are two outlets at every cubicle, one white and one gray. The white one stays on all the time, and...

I know where this is going. 

&gt; Teammate: ... the gray one turns off every night at the same time. It turns back on the following morning around 7am. 

&gt; Me: Was it his workstation? That'd simply turn off, not just drop the connection. Is he on a UPS? 

&gt; Teammate: No, his workstation stays on the white outlet. He's using a small switch on the corporate network, and that switch is on the gray outlet. 

Oh, for Pete's sake!!!! 

We tell the user the finding, he moved his little switch over to the white outlet, and never had a problem like this since. 

I've left the network in good hands."
46dal6,1,2016-02-18,"Should I change my middle name now? Or later, when I also change my last name?",throwawayncmmc,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/46dal6/should_i_change_my_middle_name_now_or_later_when/,"Lots of context: I want to change my middle and last name. I'm considering changing my middle name now so that next year I can ask my professors to call me by it. It's kind of important for me to do it before next year because I'll have all new professors next year (I'm a sophomore, and in my major all the 1000 and 2000 level classes are taught by the same professor, while all the 3000 and 4000 level classes, which I'll start next semester, are taught by the same different professor.)

My dad is also planning on divorcing my mom, but not for two more years (when my youngest sibling finishes high school.) When that happens I'm planning on changing my last name to my mother's maiden name, which I know she'll go back to, but I don't want to change to that until after they're divorced cause I feel that'd be weird. I'd also be done with college at that point, so it would be a fresh start where I wouldn't have to worry about my professors or classmates (there are three other people in my major and year, and we will be in all the same classes together, just the four of us, for the next two years) adjusting to or asking questions about the change.

I'm also kind of not planning on telling my parents about the middle name change. I'd continue to use my first name with them and probably my siblings as well, but my middle name with friends and in professional contexts. My current middle name honors a family member, and my mom would be very upset if she knew I changed it. My dad wouldn't like the new name I'm going with, for the exact same reasons I like it. I know I'm an adult and it's my name and my decision, but I'd prefer not having my mom cry and my dad yell if possible. I stay in the dorms in the school year and since I can only afford this school if I'm an RA, I'm not going to be settling into an apartment or house until I graduate. I'll spend summers partially in apartments, partially with my family (since I don't see them at all during the school year), unless I get an internship or real job or something. Since my address changes so much, I have my parents' house as my billing address for my bank, so my parents see my full name on the address for my bank mail.

**Pros of changing middle name now:**

* I can start going by it ASAP and pull the ""it's my middle name"" card instead of the ""it's a nickname I'd like to go by"" card, which would incite questions from my classmates as to why I didn't use it before (I did use it in high school, but second-guessed it when I started college)

* I'm impatient and I want to

* Avoids anxiety I'd get from feeling non-committal 


**Cons of changing it now:**

* I'd have to go through the process twice

* I'd have to figure out how to hide it from my parents until I get a permanent address for my bank mail to come to (or figure out how to get my bank to not put my full name in the address, potentially easier)

* I have two other nicknames in two other contexts. Too confusing?

**Pros of changing it later with my last name:**

* Only have to go through the process once

* Won't have to worry about people adjusting to it, since I wouldn't feel comfortable starting to use it until I change it

* Won't have to worry about hiding it from my parents

**Cons of changing it later:**

* I wouldn't feel comfortable going by it in most of my classes 

* Involves patience

* Waiting makes me feel non-committal and anxious that I might change my mind

* I'd spend the next two years getting more and more entrenched in the name I currently go by

Guide to names/nicknames:

I go by my first name with my family as well as with the classmates and professor in my primary major

My primary advisor knows me by one nickname that my teachers called me by in high school (one of them started it and it caught on through them talking and through my classmates) cause I panicked when I introduced myself and used that and then didn't change it cause I didn't think it would matter. My professors for my major are aware of it because they know her and she talks to them about me and uses it. My mom and two of my siblings are also familiar with this one, for some reason, and one of them uses it for my in private conversation.

My friends at this school know me by a different nickname, which was my marching band nickname in high school. I started using it in the marching band here, and some people who know me from marching band also know my friends from not marching band, and my marching band nickname has now become my general nickname.

My third nickname is the one I really want to go by and what my friends in high school called me. No one here calls me by it or knows about it, nor does my family. I'm starting a second major next year and could potentially go by it in those classes since I wouldn't know anyone. "
46dd6c,2,2016-02-18,Boyfriend [19/M] addicted to League of Legends and I [21/F] felt forced to break up. Don't know if I'm in the right to do so.,elerri,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/46dd6c/boyfriend_19m_addicted_to_league_of_legends_and_i/,"I [21/F] just need to vent to people about this. I can’t take it anymore. I feel so fucking isolated and out of patience I can hardly stand it. My boyfriend, now ex-boyfriend, is borderline fucking addicted to League of Legends. This isn’t the just ‘him playing for fun’ and me taking it too seriously kind of story. This is a borderline sickness addiction and he uses depression as an excuse for why he plays it so much. 

I am currently employed at my university, finishing up my last 2 years of courses and have a few internships under my belt. I am happy with my success in life at this point. That being said, I’ve been a gamer for years, since I was a kid. I haven’t really dated locally in a while because I guess that’s just how it’s worked out. I started dating someone long distance a year ago, and I was really happy to meet him. It felt really good to feel loved again, to fall in love. 
Despite how much I love this person, truly, inside and out, he’s always done some pretty questionable shit. Liking pictures of half naked girls on instagram (when I told him I was uncomfortable with that), being MIA when I was in the hospital and knew I would be coming home from a pretty serious check up (he said he was at the gym and didn’t take his phone, which felt like shit because he intentionally didn’t take his phone when I was coming home drugged up from a very uncomfortable procedure). This summer we broke up for a few days given my frustration about these things, and because he would not get a job no matter how hard I tried to encourage him. 

He ends up finding a job, and things are okay and we get back together. We have a plan about meeting in September and it was really exciting. All very exciting until I find out he’s lost his job about a month and a half after having it. I encouraged him to take a few days to think about why he lost it (he called in too many times) and then try to get back on his feet when he was ready in a week or so. The issue was that he didn’t get back on his feet, ever. He began to just sink into league, I made him a resume, I went over interview tips, I did everything I could to try and encourage him. It came to the point where I told him to get the fuck out and find a job or we’re over. I came home that night and he had been playing league of legends all day with his friends (my first red flag, this was one of many). It became very obvious he only cared about playing this stupid game. Don’t get me wrong, I play it too, and I have fun when we play together, but I couldn’t believe I was getting put second over a damn game.
At the end of September, the time we were supposed to meet goes by and I become very depressed. I haven’t been home across the country to see my family in a year, I feel like I’m not doing as well in school, and I feel like I have to nag my boyfriend to do anything, on top of some health concerns in my family and overall just not funnery. This on top of all his fucked up family drama which he just goes on and on about, and don’t get me wrong, I’m happy to listen, but if I ever told him what I thought he’d get mad at me and use me as his punching bag for his crap. I go to a counselor at my school and see what can be done in order to help me through this, and she tells me that if I am not getting better by the semester and don’t keep my grades up she will request that I leave the school due to major depression. I obviously didn’t want this to happen, my grades were still good and my work was one of my favorite places of all time. I felt horrible, and I felt trapped. I knew I had to work more on my personal health issues, and keep all these things up. I focused hard on school, and this led to a huge distance between us. He got mad that I wasn’t putting him first (this is something he said to me word for word) and he caused fights with me during my exam season. He left for vacation and I was in the middle of exams and I honestly couldn’t stand it anymore, so I broke up with him for a while because it was way too overwhelming during exams knowing I had so much riding on this. I could easily fake being okay to a counselor if my grades were high and I nodded my head and said I was better, but I needed the grades. Then he tells me I’m selfish for breaking up with him over his vacation, and goes to his friend and calls me a bitch etc. 

Following exams I went home to my family’s house, and was not able to spend much time with him. The time we did spend together was just fighting and that only progressed worse. There were moments of happiness, but it was a lot of fighting. More issues in his family, and I honestly just wanted to be alone. I needed space, and I knew I loved him, but I knew that being a therapist for his issues was just taking too much of a toll on me, so I tried to actively avoid heavy conversations while at home. This leads us into January, 4 months of him promising me he’ll find a job and do better by me. He also said he was starting online school again, but given that it’s online classes in order to finish his high school (almost 2 years late at this point), I told him I expected him to get a job. 

At the beginning of January I return to school and get really sick with a sinus infection and strep throat. I tried to take a Nyquil pill when I couldn’t get it down due to the swelling and began choking. I began to lose consciousness and left my apartment trying to frantically knock on neighbor’s doors to help me, but no one was home. I ended up being able to snap myself out of it and remember my medical training, and got on my side on the floor. I was able to open up my airway a bit breathing on the side, and thus able to get some air into me. My boyfriend was on Skype when all this happened, and heard the paramedics come into my door. The paramedic who examined my throat and did my blood pressure told me that if I didn’t lay on my side I would have choked to death. At this point, I honestly just cried my eyes out. I honestly felt my visioning blackening, and I felt so close to being gone. I finally get over that and fall asleep, and then I wake up to an e-mail from Riot about my league of legends account being banned for third party programs. I immediately thought “what the fuck!?” and didn’t know what happened. My boyfriend had been banned for the same thing, and used my account to play some skins sometimes, but obviously was using scripting programs on my account. It got banned, and I couldn’t appeal it to get it back – no joke, about 5 thousand dollars and 6 years on that account. If I had known he was scripting before that point I would have never given him my account, but I was stupid, and I let him borrow it thinking it would be okay if he played normal’s and tried skins. 
Recognizing that account sharing was a fully reasonable ban, and it was my responsibility, I handled the ban pretty gracefully in our relationship. I asked him to just get me a few skins for the champs I’d want. He agreed saying he would sell his account to make money for it, and then he’d just start a new account with me. Instead, I knew we had to sort this out in person. I offered to get a second job in order to afford plane tickets out here for him. He refused, said it should be him who should do it, but continues to play league on smurf accounts behind my back. He literally played on all his friends accounts, talked on his Skype about buying accounts, bought an account and didn’t tell me about it. So I didn’t even know he was playing on another account, which felt like he was hiding it from me. I confronted him about this and he just said he didn’t add me because the name is stupid and he didn’t want me to make fun of him (lol?). So I told him that was ridiculous, and that it seemed like he was hiding from me and he argued that he wasn’t. This turned into a full blown argument where I blew up and called him an idiot, and got really upset he still had refused to look for a job. He met me with things like “if I really wanted a job I could easily get one” and then proceeded to say I was spoiled and didn’t earn anything I have achieved because I come from a family that’s well off. He also insulted me, and argued that I had a pretty ‘trust fund’ to back me up, and that I can’t say I wasn’t gifted and earned the things I had. I ended up getting so mad I screamed and just hung up the call. He confronted me a few hours later apologizing, and saying that he’d get a job within a month or be gone. However, that isn’t even the issue anymore. Whenever we’re in Skype all he’ll do is talk about league, talk about the pro scene and LCS, and literally will go on for hours. It’s literally gotten to the point where the game legit sickens me because I can’t believe how much it’s taken over his life. 

I tell him if he’s serious about this relationship, he needs to prove it. I get home from work today and he’s on league, I go out and do errands and come back 3 hours later and still playing. He is still playing now. I hate issuing ultimatums, but I told him today if he cared about me more than that fucking stupid game he would delete it for a while and focus on making things right. His response to all of it was “goodnight”. At this point, I couldn’t handle it. Broke up with him and he told me “he can’t believe I’m doing this”. 

Am I wrong to break up at this point? I feel like I’m the only one who has been actively trying to participate in our relationship, and I feel like I am the only one who has plans for the future. I have been trying everything, I’ve tried being patient (I’ve waited 7 months for him to get off his ass), I’ve tried getting mad, I’ve tried encouraging him and doing the work for him, and I have tried everything I can imagine to support him. He talks about wanting to marry me and some shit, but if he honestly can’t get rid of League of Legends for a while in order to make things right with me, and get a fucking job, then how the hell is he expecting to marry me? I love him a lot when it’s so good, but when it’s not it’s like I’m a nagging mother and I don’t want to be this person. There’s also the additional problem that he hates it when I talk to any guy, and always asks who I’m talking too and gets paranoid but he makes comments about how attractive other females are, which makes me feel like he’s just shitting all over my feelings and then expecting me to be a cheater. Of course, there’s a lot more to this story and there is his side as well. When I talk to him about it (I’m training to be a counselor) he just tells me he’s depressed about where he lives and his situation and being unsuccessful and league is an escape. But I can’t buy this anymore. It’s been used as an excuse too many times. So I don’t know anymore. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

Thank you for reading/listening to this. I know it’s kind of petty and stupid, and a lot of my friends are telling me just get rid of him and you’ll be happier. I find this hard to stomach, I’m a committed person and when I commit I truly commit. Maybe getting some perspectives from some strangers will help me gauge the situation a bit more. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend basically refuses to get a job because he's playing league of legends. Got fed up with that along with months of bullshit treatment and now he's questioning me saying I have no right to break up with him. "
46doty,34,2016-02-18,Dumped a ton of water weight. Most insane weight fluctuation I've ever experienced. Back on track now. Hell yes. Water is important.,KetoCraziness,xxketo,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/46doty/dumped_a_ton_of_water_weight_most_insane_weight/,"Well I knew I wasn't doing something right.

I've been really hitting the gym to try to maintain my fitness after the conclusion of an internship that had constant manual labor (think barn chores: mucking stalls, stacking hay, riding and caring for a bunch of horses, 12 hour days). I've been on a steady workout plan since around mid-December. Had some weight fluctuations, but still maintained around the same numbers as before. To my dismay, I learned quickly that I had to reduce calories to be able to maintain though.

Anyway, the last month I've been hitting it hard in the paint at the gym. Added more weight to my lifts. Mixed things up with the exercises. I've added pilates and sprints and shit. I've got a competition to look forward to in a few weeks so my goal was to maintain muscle and hopefully drop a couple pounds if I can. Been really keeping up with eating as best I can manage. Very strict on my keto game.

The last two weeks though, I've been noticing that my more fitted pants have gotten tighter. What. Damnit. I even noticed that my face, neck, and area over my collarbones seemed... Puffy. I've been feeling great and stronger though in the last six weeks so whatever. But I drug my ass over to the scale to see what was up, and I had gained nearly ten pounds. TEN. HOW.

I immediately tried to figure out how I was screwing myself up. Went over journals. My eating was great. Water intake was good, salt was good.. I chalked it up to being currently very sore and was content with it. I kept chugging along and weighed one week later.. Still the same.

Miserable, I got in an epsom salt bath one morning about a week ago. When I got out I was super thirsty and drank a lot of water throughout the rest of the morning. It then hit me like a freight train that I really hadn't upped my water that much since I increased the difficulty in my training about a month ago. Rookie mistake! WHY did I did that to myself?!

So I kept drinking and drinking and matched my electrolytes too. Had a lighter workout that day and ate normally. Out of curiosity, I got on the scale that afternoon (AFTER eating). Bye bye six pounds. I kept up the new water/electrolyte balance for a few more days. Five more pounds fell off. It was magic. 

Weighed today, a bit over one week after upping water. Two more pounds down. I'm going to try to maintain now. I'm feeling better too. This is crazy. I was holding on to THAT much water. My poor cells. I had to pee more than I ever had in my life the first three days though. 

TL;DR: If you up your fitness regimen, up your freaking water/electrolytes so you don't hold on to water weight like crazy. Especially if you've been pushing it and experiencing DOMS frequently. "

Basically I'm looking for a little advice if possible.

I've have now been a sysadmin for 4 months with a small company. 
This is my first ever job in this role, I was a 3d artist but made the jump (Im working full time and doing my degree in I.T. Full time with the open university so extra time is extremely limited) . However I feel like I have been truly screwed over. 
During my Interviews I explained my background and where I felt I lacked knowledge (Computer Guy to friends and family, The odd computer shop job, Learning via homelab).
I was offered the job for a low amount, (13k) but it was explained to me that I would receive constant training and they would review my wage the following year.
However I'm 4 months in and well there's not been a single moment of training.
To add to this I'm contracted to work 35 hours a week with any extra time worked being unpaid. I wouldn't mind this however its  a huge amount of unpaid work due to entire weekends to trips to the datacentre and nights due to server errors.
I'm also expected to get myself certified asap (n+ , ccna , sec+) I honestly cant afford these on this wage. 
I work with 1 other system admin who is great at his job and looks at me as a burden (Which I feel like I am, theres only so much time I can learn extra stuff and he's far to busy to teach me).

Im not sure what I should say to argue my case to have my contract improved. I'm in a semi remote area so there aren't exactly I.T jobs everywhere .. nor do I see people taking the same gamble on my in a city job (I would honestly move if I had another chance somewhere).

Any advice would be fantastic! 

(sorry if this is a garbled mess reddit on a phone is a pain)

Edit: little more info

I'm not considered an apprentice or an intern

I'm older than 25 so can't be an apprentice 


Edit 2: currently being auto moderated,  will ask mods to restore my replies

Thanks for the input so far!

Edit 3 : I'll start replying tomorrow once my automodertaion has lifted.

To make a few more things clear however.

Its not every weekend im doing overtime just now and again (but it does hurt my studies majorly)

The overtime is not a standard length and I can sign in from home to do it etc.

Over all .. Its the lack of training that bugs me more than the wages.. If it was low paid and I had the whole overtime thing I wouldn't mind if I was getting trained well. (Just want to get good at my job asap, I hate feeling like im a burden to people because im clueless in some areas etc.)



Final edit: Spoke with bosses today , got a tiny raise ... Going to stay until I hit 6 months (to make it easier to get another job) and then leave... Again the promise of training was made, But its the same 4 moth old promise.

As an International student, I am not sure which university to pick for my engineering degree (Electrical/ Computer engineering). University of Alberta seems like an altogether better university but University of Victoria has mandatory co-op, which makes the chances of finding a job post graduation much easier. I want to work in Canada post graduation and I am afraid if I do not get in the co-op for University of Alberta I will not be able to find a job and will have to go back to my country. How difficult is it to get University of Alberta's co-op for an international? Does UVic surpass UAlberta since it has mandatory co-op and I will have experience by graduation? 

The problem is if I DO get co-op at Ualberta, it will obviously be better than UVic, but there's only a small chance I will get co-op, even if I work hard.

Also, if I do not get co-op at UAlberta, my Study permit allows me to work full-time on my own during summer. Will it be hard to intern on my own and get jobs and possibly have work experience in the summer?

I have excellent grades in A Levels and willing to work hard in first year but even then Alberta's co-op is not guaranteed.

Thanks in advance."

My research isn'T going anywhere right now, the idea comes from my advisor and I'm begiining to doubt it can actually be done as I've been at a standstill for a while. I'm not generating usable data, I'm supposed to be depositing a thesis in late April, and when I talk about the research with my advisor he constantly implies that we haven't even gotten to the meat of the research yet. It seems like he has a clear direction in his head but fails to communicate it to me, either that or he's just winging it.

This guy is a Big Deal in his field, and has many publications and brilliant students, but I just don't feel I'm being given enough support - like you have to be a star player to get some consideration, and I'm one of of the more mediocre students. Some other past students have felt the same way as me, where this advisor didn't made them feel supported when compared to the more ""productive"" students.

I'm pretty sure if I want to stay I'd have to take an extension, and the idea of spending another summer in school, doing this research is dreadful right now. I did have an internship in a major company over the fall and they liked my work and told me to apply for a job once I'm out of school; I just don't know if me dropping out would hurt my chances with them, and am scared to reach out and ask them. I'm just scared of moving in either direction.

If anyone has been through this I'll gladly take your experience. I just don't know what to do. Thanks a lot!"

I am a second semester sophomore and feel like I really haven't learned anything useful. The only thing I could really justify is that I know how to break down a problem better. Is it normal to feel this? I still have a bunch of computer science classes, I have only taken 7 and currently in 2, but I still feel like none of it is practical. I only have 3 more gen eds left.

* I don't know how to set up a network.  
* I don't really know what malware is. 
* I don't know how to do the most basic real life application. 
* If my wifi isn't working the only thing I know how to do is unplug my modem and router and hope for the best. I know there is stuff I can figure out using ipconfig in cmd but I don't know what it does.

I understand these are all things I can go and learn on my own but I am paying a TON of money for my education and I shouldn't have to learn all of this on my own. I plan on learning it all in my free time, but I feel like I shouldn't have to.

Maybe I feel this way because I haven't gotten into the more advance courses, but I feel like these questions should be answered in the introduction classes. The fact that I understand how to create a scheduling system but I was never taught how to set up my own environment is crazy to me. I understand these are more IT related compared to CS related, but if I don't want to code the rest of my life I feel like I am on the same playing field as I was in high school. When I go home for breaks I try to talk to my dad about what he is doing to learn more and I am completely lost. He often questions what I am really learning because he breaks it down as simple as possible without actually physically showing me and I am still lost.

Applying for internships is so difficult because I know I will make a fool out of my self when I don't even know how to use VMs, besides using the Windows remote connection application and typing in the server name the school set up for us. 

Maybe this is all just me ranting and I am in the wrong major but I was wondering if there is anyone else who feels the same way. I love computers so I know I want to work with computers, but maybe a CS degree isn't for me. 

**tl;dr:** I have been pursuing my CS degree for about a year and a half now and honestly feel like I haven't learned anything practical. Is it normal to feel this?"

I applied to graduate school and got into my top choice of university, and he ended up not applying due to financial reasons. We are in different fields, but both in the sciences (which is how we met) so in general grad schools good for me are good for him and vice versa. We had planned on applying to the same graduate schools and hoped something would just work out, but as I said before this did not happen due to financial reasons.

So, now he has to take a year off, and I am also realizing he is not very confident. In my opinion he is more knowledgeable in his field than I am in mine, and if he applied he would get into fabulous programs. But, now I am realizing that part of him does not think this is possible and it makes me sad. 

Anyways, long story short during his year off he wants to work and pay off his loans, but I really want to ask him to come with me and try to find an internship or something pertaining to his field. I think doing something like this will be more beneficial for him. Obviously, this is selfish because he can get an internship anywhere and I am ultimately hoping he will apply to the school I am going to. I am worried that if he does agree to this part of me will feel like had to big of an impact on his decision making and I will feel guilty. Should I not say anything and let him come to his own conclusions? And accept the fact that our relationship will end when I move?  

By the way, I really do love this man!"

As an International student, I am not sure which university to pick for my engineering degree (Electrical/ Computer engineering). University of Alberta seems like an altogether better university but University of Victoria has mandatory co-op, which makes the chances of finding a job post graduation much easier. I want to work in Canada post graduation and I am afraid if I do not get in the co-op for University of Alberta I will not be able to find a job and will have to go back to my country. How difficult is it to get University of Alberta's co-op for an international? Does UVic surpass UAlberta since it has mandatory co-op and I will have experience by graduation? 

The problem is if I DO get co-op at Ualberta, it will obviously be better than UVic, but there's only a small chance I will get co-op, even if I work hard.

Also, if I do not get co-op at UAlberta, my Study permit allows me to work full-time on my own during summer. Will it be hard to intern on my own and get jobs and possibly have work experience in summer?

I have excellent grades in A Levels and willing to work hard in first year but even then Alberta's co-op is not guaranteed.

Thanks in advance."
46ffkg,5,2016-02-18,Internship at addiction recovery center: supervisors worry it might get too personal,origanummajorana,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/46ffkg/internship_at_addiction_recovery_center/,"Hi all, I've just now stumbled upon this subreddit in search of some advice/ideas regarding my current situation. I'll be doing a year-long internship next schoolyear (for my master's in clinical psychology) at a center that treats patients with (illegal) substance abuse issues. 

I went to visit the center this week to meet my future supervisors and talk a bit about the internship. They were curious as to why I really wanted to intern there, and I laid all my cards out immediately: besides having smoked weed myself for many years (and having kicked the habit in favor of a more fulfilling life), my brother is still very much addicted to weed, and it prevents him from ""getting on"" with his life. Basically, I feel like addiction is something I ""understand"" and it just made sense to me to want to help others in that situation.

My supervisors, however, were immediately worried: the internship is quite a heavy load, and many interns have given up because it's been too emotionally challenging for them. They're especially concerned that I won't be able to handle it because I'll be constantly ""running into my brother"" there.

After some discussion they called me and let me know that they'll still take me on as an intern because it seems I'm capable enough, and that the whole issue will be dealt with openly and proactively. I think my honesty with them from the get-go helped them be assured that I'd be open with them if things got tough down the line. 

So... I'm meeting with them next week to sign some documents but I'm not entirely sure how to go about our next meeting. On the one hand I feel somewhat embarrassed that I hadn't considered this an obstacle until now; if anything, I thought I'd be better for the job because I've been around this behavior before. On the other hand, I want to convey that I just want to do my best and learn as much as I can from them. 

So... I guess my questions are as follows: have any of you had good/bad experiences with interns and what made them good/bad? What do you think I should say at our next meeting? Should I just be honest and tell them what I've told you? And lastly, what literature would you recommend on addiction? In regards to therapy itself I'm reading lots of Yalom, but for addiction I've only got Addiction and Grace by Gerald May. 

Thanks!"

However, for some reason, I find women who smoke unbelievably sexy. If they do it seductively and back it up with a dirty-talking mouth, then I'm INSTANTLY horny.

I'd love to play out something involving my smoking fetish today. One note: While I'm into the smoking fetish, I'm not so much a fan of the dom/sub dynamic, so no BDSM, torture, noncon, etc.

I've got a few RP prompts below that this can be worked into somehow, and I'm also open to any ideas you might have (if there's an RP you've always wanted to do that my smoking fetish fits into, I'm all ears!).

1) I'm a mid-level office employee and you're a newly-hired intern. We don't deal with one another much aside from short, polite acknowledgements. However, I do some video editing work for a few clients, and a shady one turns out to be an employee at a local chain of strip clubs.

In editing a video, I notice a VERY familiar face giving a lap dance and even sexually pleasing a customer. It's you, and I wait until we're alone in the office to let you know that I know about your dirty little secret.

2) I've just moved to a new neighborhood. I know absolutely nothing about the area, and you notice me moving boxes and spending more and more time in the area. Your backstory can vary; maybe I've moved in next to a college sorority house, maybe you're a MILF with a cougar's sex drive, maybe you're a cheating wife whose husband is never home. Alternatively, maybe it's YOU moving into a new place. The ideas are endless; either way, it ends with us having had multiple orgasms and with you covered in cum!

3) One of us is in town for business on a VERY short trip for work. We can figure out specifics on who does what; maybe you're a cheerleader/dancer for a visiting sports team, for instance. Either way, we wind up in the same spot, and the situation escalates quickly from there, since we're both looking for one night of naughty fun.

4) Any prompt you've submitted in the past that hasn't gotten the interest you'd hoped for; as long as it doesn't go against my ""dislikes"" list, I'm game!

My kinks other than smoking: Dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (seriously, the raunchier the better), partying/drinking (open to drug use), oral sex, group sex, cumplay, cheating, big breasts/titfucking, mild age play if it fits the story (nothing illegal, but anything from ages 18-40something is in play).

My dislikes: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, FUTA, incest, intense dom/sub situations, noncon, orgasm control.

Hope to hear from you today!"

So a little background on me.  I have graduated from a 4 year degree program in Software Engineering.  I didn't have any internships or coops and basically no side projects besides my senior design project.  The only real language we learned at my school was Java.  I tried to teach myself some other languages but I have not gotten very far with those.  I was able to get a job about 2 months after graduating college as a performance engineer and have been working here for about 8 months.

Now the problem.  I was hired on as a Performance Engineer which wasn't my first choice for a job but was the only offer I got so I took it.  I have not once written a performance script here and was basically pushed straight to QA once I started, and have been automating tests using Ranorex.  I have touched a max of 50 lines of code while being here and most of those were copy and paste.  I have told my boss that I would like more coding assignments and he said he would try to find me something and basically put me on another software that doesn't involve coding, and told me I should like it because it is more technical.

I knew I should of left about 6 months ago when I started to feel some what depressed working here but stuck it out.  Now I'm in a bind where I can barely get myself to go to work everyday cause I hate it so much, not really because of the job specifically but because I feel like I wasted 4 or 5 years of my life getting a degree to end up here. I feel like my skills have diminished significantly as a software engineer as well being here and I barely remember how to program at all.

I have debated going back to school to get my masters to specialize in an area, but I missed this years deadline to apply and I wouldn't be able to start school until next fall.  I feel a little bad about trying to get another job if I just plan to leave for school in a year anyways, but  I really don't think I can stay at this company that long without feeling really down about myself.

I'm not completely sure what I should do to get away from this job.  I feel like I have nothing to show on my resume and no good programming skills to showcase since I haven't gotten to work on any projects in such a long time, and I come home feeling so upset about work that I can't get myself to code very much on the side. I feel like I just don't know how to program anymore. I know I should probably power through that feeling but I would like some advice on what you guys would suggest I do to get out of this predicament.

TLDR: Hate my job because I am losing my skills as a programmer. It is making me depressed.  Not sure what to do. Please point me in the right direction."
46flg4,8,2016-02-18,"At this point, I'm really starting to believe that something is wrong with my metabolism.",dontsaytmr,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/46flg4/at_this_point_im_really_starting_to_believe_that/,"So I'm gonna tell you what I have done in the past quickly, and I'll keep it short before I get to what I'm dealing with now. 

* Graduated High School
* Lost 50 pounds (burned 600-800 calories a day at the gym, and did not eat after 5 pm. I was 18 years old)
* Kept weight off, but couldn't lose (this time doing it the proper way, no starvation. Only managed to maintain weight, and then at one point gained weight while actively trying to lose it.)
* Had seizure on new years 2014, MRI found to be abnormal, then off we go with trial and error with medication
* At the same time, I started college 
* Gained freshman 15, plus medication made me lethargic all the time.
* Fell out of exercise routine
* Gained 30 pounds
* Tried to lose weight but never got past 10 pounds eventually gained it back
* Found medication that works for epilepsy
* Tried to lose weight but never got past 10 pounds AGAIN eventually gained it back
* Class plus work internship at once, lots of stress
* Holidays
* Gained 20 pounds by actually eating like shit this time unlike previous time 
* Went Vegan (mostly for ethical reasons) only lost 8 and can't get past it 
* 21 Years old now 

Okay. It is really bothering me because I'm creating a deficit of 500 calories using the lose it app. I weight and measure everything I eat, and log everything I nibble on so I can be as accurate as I can. I was exercising three times a day, but even without exercise, the scale should, at least, be moving slowly because I'm creating a deficit.

My diet is composed of whole foods (besides bread, and white rice.) I rarely have meat alternatives or vegan cheese. I eat lots of beans, nuts, rice, avocados, tomato, lettuce, basically, anything you can grow I'm eating it. I don't eat crap anymore. Not even potato chips. I don't drink anything unless it's water or tea. I'm oil-free now as well, I avoid it as much as possible and I definitely don't cook with it.

I would be more then okay losing weight slowly, but the scale hasn't moved in three weeks. And this is why I'm posting here today to see if anyone has or is experiencing the same thing as me. I haven't been working out as much because I'm sick and I have an ear infection but I'm still making a calorie deficit off 500 calories a day. So SOMETHING, even half a pound should be coming off weekly. 

Both my mother and my uncle have thyroid issues, and my doctors always check mine when I go in, last time I got checked was maybe 6 months ago? But It was fine, so I don't know if maybe I might have issues with it now? My moms started acting up around my age.

I don't know if maybe it's my medication for epilepsy (Carbamazepine (Tegretol))?  But I just don't know what to do, and I know you guys aren't professionals but talking it out until I see my doctor (check up in mother f*** April) will serve as some comfort for me. I go to the bathroom irregularly for example sometimes I don't go up to three days, and then other times I start going up to three times a day for a couple days. Then randomly I get really hard stools that cut up my insides and it's just a repeat of this cycle. As a vegan now it's slightly better, and I feel like slowly it's getting better but It still isn't helping with weight loss. 
 
I really want to get slimmer so exercise isn't so rough on me. I really want to be fit I want to do endurance biking, running stuff like that. Weight training as well, I want to be strong because I'm so weak (I feel better now that I'm vegan I'm more alert and stuff like that, but I still have this weight holding me back)

Edit:
* Stats 
* 5'5
* 225.5 lbs
* Calorie intake: 1576
* (Used to be at 1600 calories, but since I lost 8 it went down)

Edit:
I just found out my medication causes fluid retention thanks to spurplebirdie.
I'll keep doing my thing, I won't give up and I'll still go to my appointment on April.

edit:
I wanted to experiment a bit so I didn't take my medication last night, nor this morning. And surprise surprise the scale moved XD "

The accusations are completely right and he's out of his mind in all the right ways. He's completely shameless and full of himself in an equal proportion. 

In his latest one, he was thanking the gardeners of the hotel for planting beautiful flowers and the angels for protection. I don't know how the two correlate and I'm not sure he does either. The fact that he records these charades is beyond me, just like how I find them amusing. 

DJ Khaled is known for many things, one being him coining the phrase, ""Bless up."" Essentially, it means ""Hello"" (I think). He also has, what he calls, ""keys"" which are keys to success. Khaled calls many things blessings and just vomits his thoughts on Snapchat in a barely coherent way. 

I'm thankful for Khaled reminding me of my blessings.

A while ago, I was jobless and getting married. Yikes. I actually jotted down my thoughts at the time:

&gt; April 8, 2015

&gt; I'm getting married in 116 days. I just got rejected from my dream job with an awesome company. There's a hiring freeze for the position; assumably, it's not in the budget. I emailed saying that I'd be willing to take a much lower salary but he's waiting for more answers.

&gt; I'm lost.

&gt; I'm getting married.

&gt; I'm jobless.

&gt; Shit.


I remember writing this down less than a year ago. I remember the interview that went well and left both him and I hopeful. I remember not hearing back from them and wondering what had gone wrong. Typed up an email and sent it on its merry way. 

A couple weeks after the interview, I had a response that the position was put on a hiring freeze. Man, that sucked. I thought this was the job that would complete me. I didn't know it at the time, but my job was the identity I was looking for. After all, when you meet someone, the first thing they ask is what you do. Why don't we ask about hobbies or movies? During free time, we ask about jobs. Just seems odd to me. 

Either way, this job I was in search for was what was going to define me. I needed something to show for my 5 years in college and something to be proud of, like ""I'm a blah blah at XYZ."" The response would be, ""Woah. How'd you get that position?""

Yep.
__________________
Let's rewind a bit.

During my time in college, I spent countless nights at the local Starbucks either watching a Mars Hill sermon or teaching myself the ins and outs of Photoshop. It was a fun time of relaxation and growth that I didn't realize would lead me to make money. Funny enough, I also wanted my own website to write out my thoughts. If people happened to read it then that would be cool. If not, whatever. 

I started messing around with SquareSpace and eventually created a blog which now redirects to my design website.

The thing is, I never thought I could actually make money at this type of thing. I always thought I was destined to make a living in an office job. 

So that's what I went for. I quit that position before the second day was over. It was a blessing to now know what I didn't want.
______________
I think that everyone could agree that when things suck, we wish they would be over as soon as possible without thinking of the possible self-improvement that the difficult situation would bring. I can honestly say that the job I quit before the third day was a terrible position and the people there made me feel unnecessary. All except for the one intern whose last day was that next week. He was cool.

I don't miss those days. I wish I wrote more about it while going through it. 

I'm extremely grateful that I have a wife and support that allows me to follow what I want to do and a God that has provided a path beyond me. 

Crazy to think that those nights spent at Starbucks until closing time would lead me to build a career that allows me to be creative. 

I don't get it but it's cool; I don't need to get it.

It would have been part time, and I would work my way from automated test scripts to writing code for their many products. This isn't a big company, but one of the bigger ones in my area. 

Well I had a phone interview, and then an in person one which I understood to be a tour since I was already likely to get the role. I got shown around, and no actual questions were asked by the interviewer. The phone interview was my only formal interview. I was told that the only thing I was waiting on for an offer was some new year budget approvals and then I would be all set to start in January. I waited excitedly but an offer never came. I tried calling and emailing, but got no responses. It was disappointing to say the least.

Well, now the company posted the position back for the internship.  I'm not sure if I should take the hint and move on, or try to apply for it again. I understand they don't have to tell me no, but it just seemed like such a sure thing. It seems that if they still needed somebody and still wanted to bring me on they would have just called me instead of posting the position again. Would I be annoying by reapplying, or would it be in my best interests?"

-
""You're quite a twisted son of a bitch. Aren't you?"" I laughed inappropriately and lit another cigarette; I needed it to soothe over my worries. I wasn't scared of him, I should have been, but I wasn't. I was going to die anyway, so what was the point of even living in fear.
-
""You're rather peculiar and I can't say that I've come across a soul as brazen yours. Why don't you fear Me? When people call me a son of a bitch, I usually tend to burn them alive.

I rolled my eyes and threw up my hands in forfeit; I was too exhausted to have the smoker's argument right now. ""Because I don't see the point.

I didn't care about the price; I was emotionally and physically exhausted from the lackluster life id lived. It was time to make a change. And it just so happened that Lucifer came along and offered it up on a silver platter. Five years wasn't so bad. At least I wouldn't have to endure my current bullshit any longer.
-
""April, you're making a deal with the devil himself. That in itself is not a contract signed by ink, or blood. It's closed by the combining of two bodies. One being a derivative of hell and the other - human. It's the complete and utterly forbidden act that taints the human soul to its core."" He folded his arms across his chest and looked at me; pleased with his argument.
-
""Are you hitting on me or something? Because that's out of the question. You can't possibly close a deal like that. That's not even a proper policy. If this is a business deal, then that's definitely sexual harassment. What's the number for Hell's Human Resources Department again?"" I stood up slowly and relied heavily on my seemingly bad attempt to provide comedic relief for a somewhat fatal agreement. 
-
He raised his eyebrows, ""oh and making a deal with Satan, in some dodgy alleyway, is proper policy?""
-
I rolled my eyes and sighed, annoyed at his valid point. He *was* right. This wasn't exactly some handshake and 'initial here'  kind of contract. This was a full blown 'handing over my soul' kind of contract. ""Is it mandatory with all the salesmen of hell?""
-
""No, theirs is usually sealed with a blood pact. Being the devil has it's perks."" He grinned mischievously, and shifted his weight slightly.
-
Just my luck, why couldn't one of those average salesmen have sought me out? Why did it have to be *him*. There was just one problem. Well no, truthfully, there were a number of problems with this situation, but I forced them all to the back of my mind and jumped head first off of a waterfall. There were two possible endings: I would swim or I would crack my skull on the rocks below and die. The only problem that seemed to nag at my lips was that I was a virgin and, before he pitched up, I was going to die that way. It's not to say that being a virgin is wrong and weird. It's just that I had never gotten around to being intimate with someone. And now, here I was, selling my soul, sleeping with the devil, and seeing gay porn in the form of Broc and Corle. It was a night of firsts. What the fuck was I getting myself into?
I cleared my throat getting ready to speak, ""Uhm so how does it work?""
-
He looked at me disbelievingly , ""the acceptance of the contract?""
-
I shifted uncomfortably; awkwardly folding my arms and stuttering as I formed words, "" N..no..NO of course not. I know what that is. I have sex all the time, hah I mean when am I *ever* not having sex? It's a wonder I can walk properly after all that...s...ss..sex"" I trailed off, just making things worse. I sighed and forced myself off of the topic, ""I meant when do things start happening?"" He was laughing at me. The friggin devil was laughing at me. I saw hints of red develop in the sea of green present in his eyes. 
-
""Oh well of course that's what you meant. What, with all the sex you're having, it's a wonder how you even remember to formulate sentences."" His tone was sarcastic and condescending and it irritated me. I shot a deathly stare at him. He finally got the hint and stopped laughing. Honestly, who knew the devil was such a dick? ""Volatile, aren't you? Well everything happens after the contract has been finalized.""
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
I won't go into deep, sordid details regarding my ""first time"" or reveal Lucifer's mannerisms and techniques in the bedroom; because, well....that's a bit too personal and I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about the whole situation. I will say this however, they call him the inventor of temptation for a reason. An *extremely* valid reason.
-
""And that seals the deal. Any questions April?"" His voice was sultry and husky as he spoke. He propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at me. His body was surprisingly warm, and tender to the touch; each part of it perfectly designed and hand crafted. The warmth in his caresses had taken me by surprise, and he had actually been gentler with his advances once he noticed that I had in fact, never been intimate with anyone before him; and had no clue what I was doing. He had guided me patiently through each motion as a lover would. At one point I had forgotten who he really was and saw him as just that - an intense lover.
-
My innards were in turmoil and my mind had started a war within itself. What the hell had I done? I was close to hyperventilating and tried to calm myself down. I blinked up at the ceiling, gripping my black duvet over my breasts; suddenly self conscious. My parents were away. My parents were away and instead of drinking till I passed out, like a normal human being, I was screwing the devil; *and* selling my soul. Dad would be soooooo proud. Hmm...... dad would lose his mind. That thought somehow made me want to do it all over again. I smiled up at the ceiling, lazily turning to look at those liquid lava eyes. ""A few. Your eyes have changed color.""
-
""Yes, I know. They change with my mood. What color are they now?""
-
""Orange. They were green before with hints of red, but now they look like lava.""
-
""Ahh green is when I'm calm and amused. Red speckles are when I'm enjoying myself and orange is when I'm excited.""
-
""Why are you exci......"" I looked away, noticing a cloaked figure standing in the far side of the room. It was just watching us. The musty woolen cloak hung lifelessly over it's body, shielding every part of it from my view. I could see absolutely nothing, just deep black spaces where his hands and face should be. It was as if a cloak had come to life on it's own will. Wide eyed and panicking, I backed up against Lucifer, speaking fast and tripping over my words, ""What the hell is that? Where did it come from? Can you see it? What the hell is going on here!?"" I don't even know why I had sought comfort in the devils arms, it just happened. Similarly to a reflex- I didn't control it.
-
""Calm down April, he is your little helper from hell."" He spoke calmly, stroking his hand down my arm. I was not expecting him to be this attentive to my needs. He was turning out to be a kinder person than the usual human ones. 
-
""*THAT* does not look like a helper. That looks like the grim reapers boss! This was not mentioned in the terms of our contract."" I huffed at him, shoving him away from me and keeping a cautious eye on the hooded stranger.
-
""He is your helper, because he is your reminder. As the years go by, he will get closer. Reminding you of the deal you've made with me and the time you have left. Nobody will see him besides you. I assure you.""
-
""And you failed to mention my creepy stalker before? That was honestly a son of a bitch move.""
-
""I am the devil after all."" He clicked his fingers and the figure was gone. His lips curled into a smile as he kissed my lips with his, whispering softly, ""He's gone now, it's just you and I here. Shall we go over the contract a few more times?"" His fingers tangled themselves in my hair. 
-
Somewhat relieved that my creepy stalker was gone, and distracted by the calmness that dripped from his every word; I egged him on a little. ""So do your eyes change to orange with every contract you sign?""
-
""Surprisingly not. Not every contract I sign is with an attractive young woman with a razor sharp wit and intelligent mind. It's mostly just old, graying men wishing for money, youth, big dicks and dozens of young, bouncy girlfriends. In those cases, I resort to the blood pact to sign off on the deal. His arm slid around my lower back, pulling me against him.
-
""My gosh, the Devil is one helluva smooth talker."" 
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
It's been 4years and 11months since I signed the contract with Lucifer. He has visited me at least once every 2 weeks, apparently to check on the progress of my remaining time. It usually always ends with us reviewing my contract over and over again. Oh shut up, I know what you're saying behind your screen, and I know. It's completely ridiculous to sleep with the devil. Let alone *keep sleeping* with him on a regular basis. But, in my defense, the temptation is downright impossible to resist. And he's just, *so* mouthwateringly good.
------------------------------------
Over the years, my business has flourished and my designs can be seen spearheading the best of the best fashion shows. Corle and Broc have gotten married (I know, I didn't see that coming either) and my dad, has finally warmed up to me. He's even gone so far as to say he's proud of me. My favorite of all - The animal shelter is doing splendidly, each and every one of our little children are well fed, played with and treated. Good things aside, the cloaked figure has slowly been closing the distance between us. As time has passed by, he's been muttering things in a different language, seemingly chanting the same things over and over again. I assume it's some sort of reminder. Similar to an alarm clock, except this one doesn't have a snooze button. 
------------------------------------
The colours have started to fade slowly. Once bright green leaves, have now dulled to lifeless black smudges over the years. I've started seeing people who are trapped between life and death, lingering around aimlessly. Others who can't see them, walk straight through the souls of loved ones that have past but haven't gone to the other side yet. I Stayed at my parents' place for the weekend of my deadline, somehow all the success of my wish, has made me realize, that all I really want - is to be with my family in my final days. I laid awake under a poster of a kitten rolling around a ball of yarn, tears welling in my eyes. It was my last night and the cloaked figure was right beside me. Bending over me and partially obscuring the view of the carefree ginger kitten. I breathed in deeply, and looked at the bedside clock. Two more hours before id be dragged to hell. I sniffled and picked up Pancake. His soft purring comforting me as I wept into his fur, holding him close to me and kissing him a few more times. I couldn't imagine not seeing him ever again. I stepped aside from the cloaked figure and made my way into the backyard where Whiskers and Pudding tackled me to the ground. They coated me in their wet kisses and refused to let me stand up. After a while they settled by my side as I watched the stars above. Their soft whining a sign that they knew something was wrong. Regret bathed me as I realized - i would never see any of these things again. The cloaked figure standing by my head, chanting the loudest it's ever been, didn't seem to phase both Whiskers and Pudding. My grief drowned out the deafening noise. I couldn't let it get to me. Not yet. I cuddled each of my babies again, kissed them on their noses and dragged myself back inside. My eyes aching from the tears that fell. I needed to say goodbye to my parents. They were asleep by now. I looked at my watch, one hour remained. The chanting getting louder by the minute; it wasn't just one voice anymore. It was many. Their voices causing all the nerve endings present in each of my muscles, to tremble. 
More cloaked figures had made their way towards me. Circling me. Their voices turned from chanting to screaming. Bloodthirsty screams that pierced my ear drums. Tears streaked my face as I sunk to the floor infront of my parents' bedroom door. I started screaming, rocking back and forth on my haunches. I pleaded loudly, begging for more time to say goodbye. I couldn't believe it was almost over. I couldn't believe id traded in whatever time I had left, to settle a silly underlying feud with my dad. I knelt down, touching the floor, my body exhausted from the wailing that riddled through it. The cloaked figures started to reach out to me, their long robes covering the light above. I still couldn't see their hands. There were still no bodies beneath the woolen masses. I clung to one last hope. Lucifer. Irrational I know, but I thought that maybe I could somehow make another deal with him. 
------------------------------------
Just as the robes brushed against my body, I looked down at the floor, and closed my eyes tightly; trying in vain to drown out their maddening crescendo. I licked the tears off of my lips and pleadingly whispered, ""Lucifer please.""
I didn't expect him to come. I mean why would the devil answer a house call. It was unheard of right? Well in that moment, of being tugged back and forth, I decided that it wouldn't hurt to try. I'd be dead anyway. 
The tugging stopped, and Satan's Little Helpers were gone. I opened my eyes, breathing heavily as I cautiously looked up and down the passage. The beige walls were undisturbed. They were all gone. 
------------------------------------
I rushed back to my room, irrationally locking the door behind me and pacing frantically. I didn't know what the hell was going on and I was talking to myself. My ripped and hanging clothing, matched my tousled hair and swollen eyes. I was losing my mind. Surely I had to be losing my mind? What if it was all a hallucination, and it was my hard work that got me to where I am now? What if my mind made up the whole ordeal with Lucifer? What was real? What do I believe now? But most importantly, how do I know which version of the story to trust? My mind was a war zone; possible reasons for my demise were rocketing back and forth and ricocheting off of the perimeter of my brain.
-
""You called?"" His voice snapped me out of my thought process. I stared at his now purple eyes- a clear sign of his irritation. I looked at him briefly and continued to pace.
-
""No, no, no... You can't be real. This can't be real. My mind is playing tricks on me. I'm going insane."" I paced frantically, insanity had reared it's ugly head and obscured the line between reality and fiction.
-
""I assure you April, it's all real."" He placed his hand on my shoulder, and forced me to look at him. The purple soon faded to blue - eagerness.
-
""I'm not ready yet. I don't want to go to hell. Now yet. I'm not ready for an eternity in some overcrowded sauna."" I pulled myself away from him and chewed on my fingernails nervously.
-
""Oh it won't really be an eternity. You're my pet, so I'm offering you a choice that the others don't even have the luxury of making. You'd go through the mandatory ....lessons... And soon become an intern of hell itself. My personal intern. After which you'll graduate into the perfect student. You'll go out there, and recruit more people just like you to fill the pit with souls and troops. Think of it as climbing the corporate ladder- forever. Only in this instance, your boss would literally be the devil.""
-
""You want me to collect souls for you? Hahahaha oh that's a good one."" I started laughing again. It was clearly a joke. No way he could be serious about something as tremendous as that. Was this a figment of my imagination? 
- 
""I don't understand why you're laughing April. It's actually an easy out compared to what will happen if you refuse my kind gesture."" He sat on my bed, neatly folding his arms and watching me as I started pacing again.
-
""That's crazy. I can't. Those are innocent souls! You can't possibly expect me to just jump on the band wagon and start recruiting for you.""
-
""Innocent? Humans are far from innocent. They rape, murder, torture and steal from one another. Yet I am the bad guy for wanting to control their population."" He ran his fingers through his tousled hair, trying to keep himself from getting visibly agitated. ""Plus, If you don't, you'll get thrown into the pit and have your innards carved to pieces. At the end of it, when all that's left is complete mush, you'll be sewn back together again, only to be ripped apart in a number of different ways. Time is nonexistent in Hell, April . And considering you are my pet project, I'd be there personally to oversee it all. So, as you can see, you could choose to be my student, or choose to be my chew toy."" He smiled and shrugged nonchalantly.
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
I'd like to say that I chose the high road and endured endless torturous punishments for my crimes. But I didn't. I chose to be his student. After everything I'd been through, all the rejections; taunting and snide comments had lured me into the blackness. People were cruel. And nothing would change that. They consume and destroy everything they touch. What better punishment for their selfish nature, than an eternity in hell?
------------------------------------
He didnt kill me that night or drag me to hell for that matter , instead he trained me. I was still human. A part of me at least. A very small part at that. He let me keep that part, and the animal shelter as a reward for all the souls I've brought to him. He fed me on his blood, making me stronger each night, allowing it to fuel my blood lust and hate towards mankind. I wasn't a demon. I wasn't a vampire. I was the darkest form of life that walked the earth. I was an unrestrained human being, with no barriers to cage my mind; that fed on the suffering of others. 
Soon enough he let me do as I wished. As long as the numbers were rolling, I was free to have what I wanted and do what was necessary to have it.
------------------------------------
Human blood, was sweet. It tasted like chocolate brownies lathered in caramel sauce and doused in chocolate ice cream. It was pure heaven to me. I savored the little ones especially. They were impossibly sweeter. Lucifer doted on me, feeding my every whim and watching as I grew in experience. I could see the warmth and pride in his fixed molten gaze. The warmth that once filled my life, was now replaced with a cold, demented mind that lacked a withholding soul. 
------------------------------------
I had finally belonged. I was no longer alone. I was respected and loved for what I had done and would continue to do. Not a single judgmental glance would come my way. I was his star player and I knew it. Nothing could stop me. Not when I had this kind of power. He had appointed me as his right hand, to rule over and supervise all of his puppets that walked the Earth, while he ran Hell. A perfect harmony if you ask me. A perfect blending of sensuous chaos and lust.
------------------------------------
As I lay here on my bed, in the same black bedroom; looking up at this screen. I can't help but smile. It's clear my little toys have done me proud. If not, would any of these other stories even be here? I'm not a complete monster, I've kept my family alive and thriving; and I even visit them occasionally, similarly to what I was doing right now. Never forget where you came from, right? 
-
""Good evening April."" His seductive voice caressed my skin. This bond between us was inevitable. 
-
""What brings the royal highness himself into my little bedroom?""
-
He slid on top of me and brushed his lips along mine. ""I have a present for you.""
------------------------------------
That night, just as he uncovered my eyes, he whispered in my ear, ""happy 10th year anniversary Darling."" 
In front of me was a small house. There were three bedrooms, that housed three siblings, whose parents had died when they were very young. Apparently Lucifer had held each of their contracts. One of them had made a deal for successful careers to be thrust upon all three of them, whilst another had wanted a home to house them all; thus freeing themselves from the foster system that had failed them all those years. The remaining one, the youngest, had signed a contract that resulted in the death of their last recorded foster parents. It was said that they had endured years of abuse and torment at the hands of a seemingly average husband and wife. 
------------------------------------
They were all each other had in this world. They were beautiful young adults aged between 22 and 28. Two boys and one girl. I felt Lucifer watching me, waiting for me to notice what was going to happen. And then I saw it, the windows were opened and I could see the entire scene play out, as if on the set of a Broadway Show.
The three siblings were watching tv in the front living room, behind them was a kitchen and immediately to the right, was a bedroom. I watched excitedly as one of our puppets stood behind the couch they were on. It was the one we always used when culling the young adult population, because it never failed. There's just something so creepy about a young murderous child.
------------------------------------
It was a short, 9 year old, little girl whose skin was grey and covered in bruises and cuts. Her arms were magnificently broken at awkward angles and her legs were bowed. She was clothed in a flimsy black dress that bared torn flesh through the holes. I smiled as I admired my personal work of art. She was barefoot and the hem of her dress dripped with blood. It wasn't her own blood of course, because her wounds didn't bleed. My gaze fell onto her spectacular bloodshot eyes. One had been gauged out and dangling from it's socket, while the other was partially covered by long, thick, flowing, black hair that brushed her ankles as she walked. She had a gaping slash roaming from her ear, through to her collar bone. The skin flapped with the rhythm of her steps. In her mutilated hands, she wielded a piece of a broken mirror that was streaked with blood.
-
""Here comes the best part my love."" He whispered in my ear and stood behind me; gripping my shoulders in his hands. 
-
The young girl stepped closer to the three unsuspecting siblings, raised her hand and brought it down into the throat of the eldest boy. The sheer look of horror that crossed their faces was utterly divine. I could taste their fear. The girl had started screaming and flailing her arms frantically. The remaining boy had to drag her across to the bedroom. Locking the doors behind them. I walked up the bedroom window, watching intently. They could hear their predator scraping at their door. The boy turned to the window and saw me. He begged me to help them. His eyes grew wide as he saw a smile stretch across my face. Their bedroom door swung open, and the girl limped towards them, dragging the head of their brother behind her like a lifeless rag doll. She opened her mouth and threw her head back, shrieking with laughter and blocking their way out. 
-
""Let the sister live. She will be my own pet project."" I whispered softly over my shoulder. His warm hands grasped my hips and held me closely.
-
""Anything for my Love.""
- 
Our puppet made her way to the remaining boy and cornered him. His sister frozen with fear as she watched her carve into him like a turkey on Christmas. With each swing, I watched the sister's face. I could see it. The last inkling of faith in humanity, fading. The warmth had drained from her body. She had become the epitome of loneliness, vulnerability and anger in a matter of minutes. I could see the light in her eyes burn out and the insanity settle in; She was now ripe for the picking. 
-
I turned to lucifer and slid my arms around his neck, kissing him softly before whispering, ""You never cease to amaze me darling."" 
-
We kissed passionately. The scene unfolding behind us; a perfect background to the intensity that followed. 
------------------------------------
The young sister, ironically named Mary, would later become my apprentice, and soon my colleague. Over the years we have watched as our puppets stalked and tormented ""innocent"" people, and drained the humanity from their very being; a recipe that ensured the best possible apprentices suited for life in Hell. After all, my priority, was to recruit only the best as Hell's troops. 
------------------------------------
Together, we came up with ingenious methods in trapping the human soul and ripping the faith from their pathetic bodies. I never let her feed though. Not just yet. I was depending solely on the unpredictability and pure irrationality of the human mind. Its remarkable just how fragile the mind is. All that it requires is a little nudge in the right direction, and there you have it - The Perfect Weapon. So I ask you again, can you truly trust your mind? Or would you rather risk living in the unknown, where nightmares are often written of as little tricks of the imagination?"
46go8l,0,2016-02-18,Is a masters degree worth it?,poliscicomputersci,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/46go8l/is_a_masters_degree_worth_it/,"I'm a senior at a top school for CS and I have the opportunity to complete an expedited masters at the same university. It would take me 4 quarters instead of 6+ like a usual masters degree would (some people finish in 3 or even 2, but that would mean no time to work/TA/etc, which I really want to do to help offset the cost). I've gotten into the master's program and applied to a couple scholarships, but if it means putting off getting a job for 18 months and possibly having to take out a (small) loan, is it worth it?

The main benefits I see are a chance to learn more advanced material across a fairly broad area of computer science and the ability to take on another summer internship which will let me get more variety once again. I have no undergrad loans (university financial aid) but if I don't get the scholarships I've applied for, I'll probably have to take out a loan."

Can I ask some questions?,mrguy08,supplychain,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/46h2zg/recently_got_a_masters_in_logistics_looking_for/,"Question 1: How important is location? I live near New Orleans and have a lot of friends in the city so I was hoping to work and move there. I thought it would be a decent place to apply because of the Port and everything but my job search so far hasn't turned much up. I've only been applying for a few days though admittedly.

So, if New Orleans doesn't pan out, where should I be applying?

Question 2: Given that I have a Master's in Logistics, but limited professional work experience, what kind of positions should I be applying for? Most stuff I see listed online is either the higher managerial end of the supply chain, or really basic stuff like driving a truck.

Question 3: What sort of starting salary should I be looking at?

Question 4: Will it be necessary to intern somewhere before getting a real professional job?

I don't have a lot of money now, and would rather not intern if I can help it.

Question 5: Now that I have my degree, what skills should I work on developing to make myself more attractive to future employers? In addition, is there certain software that I should learn about?"
46h7uf,11,2016-02-18,"Me [18 F] with my boyfriend [20 M] of 4 months, feeling like I'm being used? Advice needed",throwaway34565478,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46h7uf/me_18_f_with_my_boyfriend_20_m_of_4_months/,"I grew up with a family that gaslit me all the way until I left for college. I have trouble understanding when I am actually responsible for things or not, so please bear with me.

My boyfriend Aaron and I met last year in college. I was dating somebody else at the time so we were just friends but my ex and I broke up near the end of summer. I did not fully get over my previous relationship by September so I may have 'rebounded' to Aaron. We began dating in November and up until New Years nothing felt off about the relationship.

Then he said our relationship was 'planned'. He purposely found a place near the school so I would stay over more often, and eventually 'fall in love with him'. This made me uncomfortable so I asked some friends about this. The next time we met, I caught him going through my phone and laptop. He was upset that I 'brought our problems to other people' and 'they didn't know us like we did so they had no right to judge'. I tried to explain to him that I was just asking for different opinions but he asked me to not tell my friends anymore about our 'relationship problems'. I did not ask in public over social media or anything, I just wanted input from friends to better understand..

Another thing that has been confusing me is that Aaron has told me multiple times that the *only* way he feels loved is through physical affection. He firmly stated that he could not sleep without me and got nightmares if I was not in his arms at night. I have a bad habit of completing work and studying at night, but it has never affected my academic performance. If I asked him to let me have a night to work, he would take this as me not loving him. The next day he would ask 'why we fought last night and if I wanted to talk about it'. I have asked him to see someone about this but he said that he has seen 4 different professionals and they have done nothing for him.

Aaron also does not have anybody he considers himself to be close to. He has used personality tests (think Myers Briggs) and research articles to explain that only ~5% of his personality is capable of loving, so it goes to his family, and me (his SO). Everybody else in his life is not worth keeping because 'for the right price, everyone eventually leaves and has zero loyalty.'

At the beginning of our relationship, he had a 'best friend' of 2 years, David. David always gave me advice about Aaron, including everything mentioned above. He immediately went low contact with David, and only talked to David to brag about how he was doing in school, or about internships (David is struggling whereas Aaron has already found one).

When he went through my phone  and laptop, he read the entire conversation between David and I. When I asked why, he said his previous girlfriend left him for his best friend (different person), and he did not want to let it happen again. He also told me when his ex left him for his best friend he tried to OD on pills, but his mom found him in time and he was saved. Knowing this has made me feel incredibly guilty and unsure of what to do.

I recently confronted him about being insecure and controlling, so he looked these up as well and found that he fit their descriptions. He says he wants to work on it but everything is still the same, and I don't know what to do. It feels as though I'm being used because I'm being too nice. It's beginning to negatively affect me, my friends and even school faculty have been checking up on me to make sure I'm okay.

**tl;dr**:

* My boyfriend believes that nobody else has a right to 'judge' our relationship when I ask friends for advice
* The only way my boyfriend feels ""loved"" is through physical affection, nothing else gives him the same feeling.  He constantly references his personality type (i.e. Myers Briggs) to explain everything.
* He also only cares for his own family plus me (as in his SO) and nobody else

Do my feelings of being used make sense? Where do I go from here?"

- Use pirated software, it is OK.
- If you ever decide to leave us without a long notice, you will be given a bad reputation, we know people around here and they know us.
That's not how you are supposed to do it! (Knows nothing about the subject)
- Use your equipment for work at the moment, since you are just an intern for now, you must prove yourself worthy of it. (Designing and programming using a 4 year old PC connected to an extra high res screen that my computer can't even run without stuttering and lagging)
- He tells me how to do my work, he knows nothing about it.

Here is a (long) story detailing my current situation:
I am a junior at my university's honors college (studying Business Management and pursuing a certificate in Intl. Trade &amp; Investment). I have a 3.59 GPA, very involved with a student-led Investment Portfolio managing real money (E-Board member), and other personal entrepreneurial project. Currently, I am being onboarded for a big investment/private bank as an intern down here in FL with the possibility of making the position a full-time one for the summer. I had two interviews with them, and two days after the second interview, they called me saying that they want to onboard me and give me an official offer. So, they sent me an e-mail with the onboarding application. Here, they are asking me to list my employment history (volunteer positions as well if I choose) along with supervisor names and contact information.

Here is my issue...

I left my last paid job (outside of private tutoring, which I can't reference because I am not allowed to list my clients as references) near the end of October. I was working at my state's largest utility as a customer service representative while taking 15 credits in college. I had started over the summer (May) and at that point I knew it was definitely something I didn't want to do for the rest of my life. When the school year started, I started learning a lot more about what I wanted to do (business and finance), and my classes became a lot more demanding. On top of that, the divorce that my parents are currently going through started getting really bad. My dad was the bread winner of the household, and he cheated on my mom and moved away for a promotion my mom was going to go up state with him for. He left her with all of the debts since she had good credit and had her use her 401k to pay off the debt while he hid his for the longest time. He is still paying the mortgage, but he stopped helping me out financially and is trying to force my mom to sell the house. At this point, I started to get sick from all of the pressure coming from home, school, and dealing with customers at work.

At the end of September, I started to get interviews for a lot of big finance firms (got flown out for New York for a BO gig at one of CS/GS/JPM/ML). I explained to my supervisor the situation, and how I needed to take/swap those Monday and Tuesdays so I could have the days off. While being recruited for the on-campus call center job I was at, other students and I were told about how people moved from their positions to other big companies, and how they understood that we are students pursuing bigger dreams than call center jobs. So, if we had something school-related or internship-related that we wanted to pursue, we could always ask for the time off. The problem is, my supervisor considered me being flown out to NYC for an interview as ""vacation"" and wanted me to use my remaining vacation hrs for them. Management declined me request, so I went to the main recruiter who made the promise of the time off for important circumstances (coincidentally he was my supervisor's boss) and he completely understood and overrode the declined request for me so I could take time off for the summer internship interviews.

Shortly after, I left the customer service job. There was too much stress going on in my life, and it was being reflected in my call center metrics. While my quality and soft skills were good, my time available/unavailable, taking unauthorized breaks (during the time my parents were feuding really bad, I had to miss a day that went down as an unscheduled ""occurrence"" because I got a fever and the next day I tested positive for UTI, not to mention, during training over the summer I needed to miss time for oral surgery, and even with two weeks notice it still went down as an unscheduled ""occurrence""). School was taking it's toll on me, and I was coming in later than 8AM (my start time). The problem with this is that we had a call center metric that measures the first 30 minutes of your shift, whether you are there or not. Eventually, I left, knowing that I not only wanted to deal with the stresses in my personal life, but also wanted to gain more experience in finance. My supervisor's boss understood completely why I left and even offered me a letter of recommendation if I ever needed one. He loved how good my quality was on my calls, and understood that I had more in store for my future with the interviews I had. My immediate supervisor was more focused on my metrics and pretty much said I had to leave for my sake because my performance was getting worse as time went on with the situation at home. Some other stuff went on that forced me to leave (my university questioned some of this part-time on-campus job's practices with their student recruiting, work schedules, broken promises, etc. but that's a story for another day) but at the end, he completely understood whereas my immediate supervisor wasn't so cool with my performance leading up to that time.

Fast forward 4 months later, I need to get a reference/confirmation of employment from my former company. I e-mailed and called the supervisor who liked me (my former boss's boss) a week ago, and he hasn't gotten back to me. Since this onboarding application is time-sensitive (needs to be done by 2/23), I went over to my immediate supervisor and asked her if I could use her as a point of contact. She said I definitely could for employee verification, but she questioned whether or not they would ask her about my performance (tardiness/metrics) in the last couple months leading up to my leave. I have no idea what they'll ask during the onboarding or what the two background checkers would want to find out, so I told her that I didn't know what they'd ask if they contact her.

My question is: should I go ahead and put my former immediate supervisor's information, since her boss (the one who completely understood my situation when I left and even offered a reference when the time came) hasn't returned my call or e-mail? I have until 2/23 to complete the onboarding application with former supervisor information, but the firm wants to go ahead and onboard me ASAP. My former immediate supervisor did not think of highly as me as her boss did and would surely give the finance firm her piece of how my performance declined in the last month or so if pressed about certain things, but at this point I may have no choice but to put her as the contact reference for my last job given the time constraints. Or, do I go ahead and put the guy who liked me more's information even though he hasn't returned my e-mails/phone calls in over a week? What should I do?

Thank you in advance!"

Was just wondering whether I could get your thoughts on what my best course of action is.

I'm a senior at my 'average/nothing special public school' in the midwest with no real internship experience. I'm thinking that I want to get into Software Engineering after I graduate. 

However, after this spring semester I'll still need to take English 102 and Speech 101 to graduate (kek) in December 2016. But I also have the option of staying at my school over the summer, finishing off my those two classes then, graduate, and then just look for a full time job. 

Do you guys think this would be superior to landing an internship over the summer (hopefully) and taking the extra semester in the fall? I don't really have any significant projects done at the moment (still in Senior Project and Software Engineering courses) and with no internship experience I was worried that finding a good full time job would be difficult.

Thanks!"

46j65x,16,2016-02-19,My theory on what Frank owed Sam (Spoilers),Drfapfap,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/46j65x/my_theory_on_what_frank_owed_sam_spoilers/,"#Tl;Dr at the bottom


So, as we find out in the season one finale, Frank killed Lila for Sam because he owed Sam. 


Owed Sam what? What favor could Sam have done him that warrants taking someone's life to repay?


The first scene to look at is ten years prior, where we find out that Frank, at the time of Bonnie's internship at the Keating Law Office, held the position that Bonnie holds in the present day. As we're shown in the flashback, Bonnie is much better at keeping track of and organizing files than Frank is, and she actually takes care of Annalise while pregnant. Frank would understandably be afraid for his job.


After that, we discover that Sam was giving Frank instructions that involved private details about the state of their unborn child, behind Annalise's back; ""Sam told you not to let me fly until I'm cleared by a doctor""


So clearly, Sam and Frank, by this point in the show, have a relationship that already exists behind Annalise's back, and one strong enough for Frank to ignore a direct order from Annalise: ""I told you to book me a flight to wherever it is that case was happening"".


Lastly, we have a scene confirming a long time theory about Sam being Bonnie's therapist, and Annalise's line about, ""Don't worry, he'd never talk to me about your sessions, even if I asked,""



So my theory is that, Frank, aware that Bonnie has a very high chance of taking his job, either convinces Sam to break patient confidentiality with him to get dirt on Bonnie, breaks into his office and takes some files on Bonnie, and Sam chooses not to rat on him, or option three, Sam tips him off to the existence of the tapes. Either way, Annalise catches him at some point during his shady criminal magic, but instead of firing him (this is a much more motherly, forgiving Annalise), she recognizes his usefulness in other ways and transitions him into the role he has today, while transitioning Bonnie into his role. 


This scenario would account for how Annalise had the tapes of Bonnie's childhood in the present day and had seen them (she takes them from Frank, and presumably views them before returning them to wherever they came from), why Frank is so eternally loyal to her (stealing confidential tapes of your co-workers from their therapist will put you away for a long time), and what Frank owed Sam that was worth killing someone over (one way or another, enabled him to obtain illegal dirt on Bonnie). 


Tl;dr: Sam helped Frank protect his job from Bonnie, very illegally."
46jje1,9,2016-02-19,Is there any way to make a compromise for the future for me [26/F] with my now ex[31/M] in our already unconventional relationship after 3+ years?,ThatGenesisSong,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46jje1/is_there_any_way_to_make_a_compromise_for_the/,"Hi, I made a throw away account (and a double entendre homage to the Genesis song) because I really have no idea what to do. This is very long and I apologize, I am going to try to make it detailed and understandable. In order to do that I need to start at the beginning. 


A few years ago I met a guy at a party who I just hit it off with immediately. Previous to that my ""relationships"" with men were very dodgy. I have always had a lot of hesitance toward intimacy, and men that I met were either ready to pounce, or just REALLY did not click with me. I used to joke to my friends that I was just too weird for a relationship. But this guy was so different. It was electric when we met, like I knew him already, but had just lost him through time. It was like the universe was talking to me (I believe in synchronicity/serendipity/the universe talking or whatever you'd like to call it). I got dragged away from the party, but not before I gave him my number. He messaged me early the next morning and so it began.


We began seeing each other on the Sundays, partially because he was a young professional and I was still in school, and partially because I lived an hour from him. I started to get to know him, and I really fell for him. I loved that he was intellectual, and that was the basis of our relationship in the beginning. He took it slow with me, and it was a pace I liked. He told me that he looked forward to seeing me every week, and that it was the one time that he could relax and have a good time. I told him I counted down the days until I could see him again.


After initially meeting some of his friends in that first year he called me his ""special friend"" to them, which bugged the crap out of me, and made me really push to have a better label to our relationship. It was a little shocking to both him and I when I accidentally blurted out to a friend ""This is my boyfriend *so-and-so*"". He was definitely surprised, but did not argue the fact, since at this point we were consistently seeing each other for over a year on the weekends. 


Fast forward further in the next year, where I wanted more seriousness. I told him I thought I loved him as I was leaving his place, and he said that he always expressed love through actions and not words, even with family, and he hoped that I had felt that love. I was sad to hear it that way, but happy that I knew he loved me too. I could feel that he loved me, and I had always told me friends before that that he had been showing me that he loved me.


In that time I was finally beginning to get comfortable enough to want to be intimate with him. It was a little odd to me that he never pushed for it himself, but figured it was partially because we only saw each other once a week, and our relationship had progressed much slower than a conventional one. At the same time I had inklings before that maybe something was wrong, but I ignored that instinct.  I guess I knew him intuitively more than I thought, because when he dropped the bomb on me, I was shocked about it, but secretly more shocked that I kind of already knew and that it was true. 


It happened when I finally asked him if we could try to get intimate on a trip we were going to take. He seemed okay with it, positive even, and I was excited. He was very short in texts all week, and when he finally came to pick me up for our trip, he asked me to take a walk with him before we left. We walked and he told me how much he cared for me, and how much I meant to him, but that intimacy was not connected to love for him, because he was hurt badly as a child, and was now a broken man. He said that the idea of it was painful for him, but he did not want to tell me because he loved me, and he was afraid I would go away and hate him if I knew. That was the first time he actually said ""I love you"" to me, with tears streaming down his face. I hated the fact that I was right inside. That he had been abused and taken advantage of as a child. I was so hurt by the person that did it to him. They took away his life, his happiness, everything. It was no wonder why I would only see him infrequently- he drowned out all other free moments to think with work. I found out that he went to see a doctor (I am assuming a psychologist) when he was young, but I did not find out much more. I did not want to pry. 


I started to do research on abuse survivors and how they handle situations like relationships and intimacy. I really hoped that maybe he could get some help as an adult. This was all done in private, as I wondered what would happen to our relationship, and where it would lead. Time became a blur and we continued to see each other. I think we both grew complacent in the strange relationship we had. 


That summer I went to a bonfire with some friends where I met another really nice guy. I liked that he gave me attention, and seemed really interested, but the whole time I just wondered what was the future of my and my man. I started getting anxious, impatient, and a little hostile towards my guy. Finally I came out with it to him. He asked me if I wanted to stop seeing him. Of course I didn't want to stop seeing him, but I wanted to know about what the future entailed for us. I asked him to talk to someone, and he said he was very happy, and digging up the past again would hurt too much. I told him I wanted to get married and have children eventually, and having intimacy in a relationship is kind of required on both parts (this was not the first time I told him I wanted marriage and kids). He said he never thought about either of those things in his future, but he would do his ""research"" and try to see if he could see things from my point of view (he is very analytically driven). We said we would see each other in the meantime, make the most of it, and talk about it at the end of the summer. The summer ended, and I became so entrenched in my internship early in the fall that I did not have time to think about that conversation that seriously. I was lucky if I had one day off in the week to myself, and in those times I wanted to do nice things, like be with my family, my friends, and see my guy if I could. At the end of my internship I had a family emergency that forced the thought back further into my mind, and through New Years I was preoccupied as a caretaker. In that time we saw each other a little bit, but he seemed to distance himself in conversations. We no longer cuddled, he kissed me differently than he used to, and I just did not feel the love, even in actions from him. Finally, when I heard nothing from him on Valentines day I messaged him and said I thought that we needed to bring up the discussion again. He agreed. 


We met earlier this week and talked. At first he was very cold and told me he did not want to see me again. Which caused me to storm out, and get very emotional. But I knew that was not like him and I needed to get more explanation. We met again 30 minutes later and had a real conversation. He said that he really loves me (present tense), and he kept saying that he loves me- he has never said it that many times before. He said he tried very hard to see the things I wanted, and see if he could mold himself to want the same things. He wants to make a positive impact on the world, and some people do that by having children, but not him. I said that I never wanted to change him or his aspirations, the things I wanted were meant as an addition to the dreams we both already had. I told him that I had silly visions of us, and our child/children- specifically a boy that he could share his love of cars with. I think that upset him a lot. 


I asked him if we could still be friends, and he said he would love nothing more. He was nervous that I would hate him for his decision, and he doesn’t want to lose me in his life. We both sat and cried awkwardly and silently in a little booth of our public meeting spot. I finally asked him what he was thinking and he said that all he could think about was the next time he could see me. That just tore me up inside. Here is this man, that has pushed every other form of potential happiness out of his life, and now he is pushing me away too, but yet he doesn’t really want to. He said it wouldn’t be fair to me if he didn’t do this, and he wants me to be happy above all else. He said he was being selfish by hanging onto me the way he did, and that this is the only right thing he has done this entire time. I asked him, wouldn’t he be upset seeing me with someone else, and his reply was “Of course, but I want you to be happy”. We decided that we could be friends, but we needed some time apart with absolutely no contact so that we could figure ourselves out, and so that we wouldn’t potentially fall into our old ways. We arranged a date- 60 days from that day. I have been counting down since we left. 


I just want to iterate here that this man is not a bad man in any way. He is the most altruistic person I have ever met. He stops to ask strangers who have broken down on the road if they need help or a ride to the gas station. He donates his time and money to organizations, and he tries to help his friends and family in any way he can.  And I do not think he is broken like he says he is, but I know he is badly hurt. 


Without more details its hard to make our love sound unique or powerful, but it really is. As cliché as it sounds we are cut from the same cloth; I have never met someone as likeminded as me, we share similar interests, and our difference compliment each other. Its as if someone molded us from the same clay. I cannot explain this deep-rooted feelings that I have. I probably sound like a real whack job, but I know that God, the universe or whatever force brought us together for a reason. We even originally grew up just across a bay from each other, but did not meet until we went hundreds of miles away from where we grew up. I feel like this is a sick joke that someone is playing. We both finally find someone that we love, but neither of us can have the other. Its cruel, really.


Now, redditors, here are my questions. Do you think that he can heal from his trauma after all this time? Is there a way I could approach trying to have him get help again? Is there some sort of argument I can make to get him to understand that although it hurts tremendously to bring up the past, getting therapy would help him to ultimately heal?


I know that now I am being the selfish one, and I know that it is a long shot, but is there any way that we could make both of our lives mesh with the things we want? Is there a ‘magic’ formula that can help us to both achieve happiness while maintaining a romantic relationship? I know I am being extremely selfish in asking this, and I’m sure that the right answer is to just get over it and move on, but I just can’t seem to convince myself that that would be the right thing to do. 


Please help, and please be gentle, these wounds run deep for me too. 


**TL;DR**: I have met my perfect match but he has been badly hurt in the past, and it is ruining his future relationships. Is there any way I can get him help that he will accept and are there any ways to salvage a romantic relationship from the things that we both want (him no kids no marriage, me the opposite)? "

I'll admit some went better than others, and each time I encounter a new question. However there was one or two where I felt I did well enough. One of which, had a job description that matched what I did at my internship right before I graduated.

So i have no idea what is going on, I don't know if its my inexperience because I only have one internship in HR, or i'm just not what they're looking for. All positions are entry level HR stuff and I graduated with a HR degree.

So if anyone out there can tell me what I am missing? Any tips or suggestions would help, because I feel I have done the necessary steps to prepare for interviews."

0:00

once again bellamy says how they been fighting and whatnot. and how people are broken and searching and whatever.

oh yea last episode they pretty much promised to slaughter the peace

dude the black man is lucky the mountain blew up or else he might not have become chancellor.

clark is a hero! she brutally murdered the hundreds of people in the mountain


they're surprisingly bloody

i think black man is named pike so i'll call him pike

but for real, the only reason we have pike as the bad guy is because we know the grounders enough. you'd think the people of arkadia would be informed about that

and wanheda and heda see the deaddies

intro crediting scene things

does this mean war? finally? after 5 episodes

Whoa they killed off indra. probably

okay black man is pike confirmed.

oh maybe indra isn't dying off

clark probably think heda is overreacting. but for real that's 300 innocent people murdered

why don't the grounders use guns yet

oh shit kane is starting a rebellion group

except the rebellion is the good ones this time

and this is how kane gets put in prison from the season 3 premiere. why was that in the preview in episode 5?

my quality keeps changing

Bellamy has regrets? wow

remember when bellamy had a gf for 2 episodes. remember that life that might've been saved. 

wtf kane murdered innocent people too. or atleast planned to on the ark

lincoln and bellamy gon fight and lincoln gone die

raven's drama is kinda boring

wahh wahh i want to do something but now that i got shot i can't do shit

How did felonious make it to the ark safely that easily

aren't there dangerous grounders

oh cool jaha ain't taking shit

so who is going to go to city of light?

baby raven is going to of course. she isn't injured in the city of light. kinda like the grandpa in the spy kids 3

oh murphy is dead in the middle of the road

and by dead i mean taking a nap

without a shirt

dude those some nice shoes

wow good job robbing a man trying to do a job. 

he was only stealing from a dead man

dude so many black people are in power. or were. thelonious and pike. black man in charge

and they get to talk

and jaha is being neutral. jaha is thelonious i think. the names

jaha gets some super power lady to tell him the answers

and the lady is just going to be vague and not superintellignet. that's cool

dude look at all those grounders. I wonder how many have tried to kill the 100.

yeah they kinda voted.

arkadia is kinda the warmongering bad guys

21:45

murphey story continues

and he wants to keep moving

but she wants to leave

oh shit the relationship is breaking up

wtf does interened mean? I assume it isn't making someone an intern

that triggerhappy extra is going to die soon

oh cool some extras are getting into the wonderland

nope it's raven getting into wonderland

raven is the key to the extras though

jaha is living in happy town

jasper is someone who needs happy town.

everyone could use a little happy town

oh internment. it's like what america did to the japanese

do people even want to be protected by someone who salughted an innocent village

and wanheda is back in the arcade

27:30

yay clarke isn't the leader. 

just give them the warning

there's no way they're going to change

this season can't end without a war

yea grounders have been pretty untrustworthy since forever

dude they're both brutal murderers.

whoa maybe clark is going to realize that the grounders are untrustable also

that got intense

clarke was wrong. bellamy wasn't good enough 

is bellarke going to be a thing

are they going to kiss

stop

stop

stop

oh cool.

wanheda is the new prisoner of the arcade.

dude just take the pill already.

it's raven or jasper who is going to take the pill and i think it's raven.

that reminds me that the runaway guy has a pill also. Maybe he might take it

better have a quick talk with mom

34:21

Murphy is going to take another nap

and this time it might be permanent

good luck finding someone on someone's knees

oh shit he's going to take it

and he has gained invincibility

and now lincoln has some friends in the prison

WAR WAR WAR WAR WAR AWR AWR WAR WAR WAR

ffs if there isn't a war this season is so dissappointing

not everyone dies in wonderland

wtf there has to be a war

i really wish heda was overthrown. lexa is heda. 

raven's gon take it

or she might just kill herself or something

that's always an alternative

and she took it

she's goign to wonderland

and it's goign to transition to wonderland as she walks

and it's going to be amazing

everyone is going to wonderland

ALIE is the true hero of this season. 

END

Y'know, at this point I think Pike is actually in the right. They can probably take out all of the grounders with their guns, but once the grounders learn how to use guns, they are fucked. They have like a billion times more people than arkadia and now there is like 0 chance of peace. Maybe short term, but not long term.

There's pretty much 3 sides to this story right now:

War for Arkadia (""the bad side"")  
There's some people who are obviously on one side: Pike and Bellamy. Also possibly Monty because of the father story and the similarity to the dead gf of bellamy. Of course there's also the grounders who want war. Lincoln probably also wants the war to happen now that he knows what happened to his people. 

Peace for Arkadia (""the good side"")  
Clarke, Kane, Abby, Octavia, probably the doctor's helper. These people want to stop the war and believe in peace for some reason. And of course people not dying is good. Lexa is turned to this side after 300 of her people got murdered. There was peace for a few months and they think it can stay that way.

Wonderland  
Jaha and his followers: pretty much just raven at this point. But Jasper is going to end up taking it. These people pretty much have no input on the war and are just sideplot. While the other two sides argue and whatnot, this side will keep on growing and soon be another great force, but at the moment, it's small.


Other than those 3 sides, there's also murphey's story. His goal is to live or something and he travels the world with his gf. except he gets captued alive and held hostage so he can help people go to wonderland. "

46krwg,6,2016-02-19,"My [22 M] Girlfriend [21 F] 2.5 years, broke up with me yesterday. Trying to figure out how to proceed",somber_sloth,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46krwg/my_22_m_girlfriend_21_f_25_years_broke_up_with_me/,"So yesterday my girlfriend of 2.5 years left me. Over this past summer we had been broken up as I was dealing with an anxiety disorder and depersonalization while in long distance and was basically told by a councilor that our relationship was a problem. My anxiety was so bad that I was contemplating very dark thoughts and wanted to do anything that could make them stop, it was a very dark time for me.

Since then I have moved back to the same city as Jessika, we are both in engineering internship programs at our college so every other semester there is the possibility of long distance. After our break up over the summer a lot of issues came out of the woodwork for her as well, she began dealing with some childhood issues and started on antidepressants. 

We started seeing each other again the day I returned and we both knew that things would have to go slow, we were both still very much dealing with our own issues and couldn't fully commit. After ~ 3months we started to get serious again, I love this girl more than anything and although there were still rough times I thought it was going really well. I have been putting in a constant effort to grow and mature as a person to be the best me for both herself and I and she could really see that. However, yesterday she said she was unhappy. She loves me just as much but the downs were out weighing the ups, she is very sensitive at this time as she is dealing with her issues and I really hurt her when I ended things over the summer. I understand that this is at least 75% my fault and I take full responsibility for my actions, depersonalization has really fucked with me and my emotions and I know that has effected her in a negative way, I want the best for her.

So I basically came here for generic advice, to know that other people have lost who they considered their life partner, how to move on from it? She said it may not be forever but I know that the best thing to do is to consider it as such. I really still want to be a part of her life  but for now I've removed her from my facebook feed and snapchat as it hurts too much. Oddly though I feel very numb, as though I need to remind myself that we are no longer together and then the hurt comes... I also am unsure if I should take time to feel sad and upset or if I should continue on full steam ahead. I am currently working two jobs as an internship and a bouncer and took next friday off to spend my birthday with her, but as thats not happening I think I will just work.. 

I don't have many friends to talk to in person in my current city as most have never been in a serious relationship.

My apologies for the rambling, the generic post and poor writing (that's why I'm in engineering). Just wanted to talk to someone.
   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend broke up with me, considered her a life partner. What to do now..."

46l8g6,1,2016-02-19,[22/m] My (24/f) Girlfriend told me she believed she is worthless and sometimes contemplates suicide yesterday night [LONG],Isuckatbeing,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/46l8g6/22m_my_24f_girlfriend_told_me_she_believed_she_is/,"So a little background first I guess. Me (22M) and my girlfriend (24F) have been together for just over a year together. We are both from the same school, and that is how we met. At the time, she was happy and radiant, was doing very well at school and felt accomplished but something was lacking : she wasn’t express her creativity. She was hardworking, driven, motivated and focused. The school we are both in probably has something to do with it, because it is a very competitive environment, where we are pushed to become the absolute best in our field of work.

Around that time she decided to do something risky that I supported whole heartedly, and change her expertise in our field of work to fulfil her creative needs. At that point, she was ready to risk losing the respect she had earned. 

I knew from the start she has had depressive phases in her life, on in particular where she dropped out of High-School for a year. She had almost no self esteem and school anxiety. But know she believed in herself because everyone believed and looked up to her.

Last summer, we both went to New York for 6 months internships. I was lucky, and landed an great internship that probably is going to change my career (we both pretty much the same thing now). She wasn’t that lucky, and her internship didn’t go very well. Where she worked was not very prestigious and it was her first work experience after “transitioning”. She struggled a little, which she wan’t used to at the time, and most of all, her tutor absolutely destroyed her self-esteem and trust in her capabilities. He was mean, abusive and was not a good manager at all. She would often come home broken and there was nothing I could do. She would often compare herself to my luck and how I had this amazing experience etc… I know for a fact she is a very smart girl, with a very high IQ, and I know the reason the internship did not go well was not because of her lack of capabilities but the managerial issues in the company. Plus New York City was not a City she was happy living in. I don’t know if this was due to her work or in a more general sense. 

Those times were very tough, she would say she is a worthless piece of shit, that she knows nothing, that she hates herself, and what she has become. That because of this bad experience she has lost at life and will never be able to achieve her goals. All the self estime she had managed to nurture by believing she was great (-er), poof, gone.  She thinks too much and is not able to set her mind at rest, which becomes exhausting for her. She is sometimes very gentle and caring, but most of the time demanding and snaps at me for small problems she get’s frustrated with. I usually let it slide and try to talk to her, becomes I know when it happens it is because she has something causing her disarray. 

Anyways, after this poor experience, we had to come back to our home country, and it was time to find another 1 year experience. She had several offers from places she would have loved to go but they all fell short and ended in a very good place in my opinion but she is not happy about, plus it is not exactly the kind of work she wishes to do. This did not help, AT ALL. She needed validation and appreciation, she needed to be nurtured by a tutor and finds herself alone most of the time at work. Her mood has been worse, and health too. She is always tired, her skin has been worst, and says she is ugly and worthless etc. She is very hard to manage and anything can make her tick.

We had a big fight 2 weeks ago (we have been fighting a lot recently) where she ended by deciding to sleep on the ground and not in the bed with me. I woke up in the middle of the night with her snobbing out of control, and when I came to see her she was in full panic attack for about 1 hour. I noticed later on she had scratch her forearm enough to leave a visible mark for weeks. This ended like most fights end, by her breaking down and saying she feels like she is shit and is sorry and doesn’t understand why she reacts like this, and feels like she is the shittiest girlfriend, that she is lazy at work (she has completely lost interest in her work and direction and career focus).

I also think I am over protective and giving, that is just how I work. Right now, she lives at my place because she has not found her apartment yet. We have been living together for around 7 months and i know she needs her personal space because she likes to control her direct environment and this might also be a cause of her stress.

This brings us to yesterday night, where I went to drink with my coworkers. When I got home, she got angry because she thought I had forgotten to go grab her pill. I had in fact not forgotten, and she started sobbing and saying she is sorry for being such a piece of shit. At one point she burst into tears, and said she thinks about suicide everyday, and she ones to find a way make her head stop driving her nuts. I don’t think she would actually do it, bu I was heartbroken to hear this is what she thought of herself when I know she has the potential for so much. I was drunk, and I don’t think I handled the situation in the best way. I need your advice.

In 2014 I worked a temporary job that ended in November, which set me up for what would become a bad year (2015), with me accepting the first job I could get, and working it (at minimum wage) until this past January. I was fired in the 3rd week of January. The good news is that I just got a paid internship in Manhattan starting next month. I accepted, but the bad news is I have some money problems that I need to take care of before I can even start that position:

a) Subway ticket for going through the wrong door in a hurry = $125 (will have record in NYC if I don't pay it by appropriate time)

b) 2 weeks commute = $158

c) 2 weeks lunch = $100

My family is poor and I've run out of money. If anyone has any idea how I can get the money I need, I'd be really grateful for any advice given. I feel trapped and I want to get out of this.

Best,

I have no idea where to even start with this. 
I guess the beginning of when the problems started happening ~4 months into the relationship. (January of this year).

From the beginning of this year to now, my girlfriend and I have been fighting/having disagreements everyday about something really stupid. And its a cycle that repeats itself and leads to me getting angry and frustrated with her and myself that I start hitting door frames and headboards, start brushing my teeth and then decide to throw the toothbrush so hard it bounces off from inside the sink and hits the ceiling while leaving toothpaste everywhere. Or close the dishwasher so forcibly that I cut myself on the sliding mechanism. 

We're in the same major, so logically I try to help her with her career path. But she doesn't like that. I told her the job market is super competitive in our major, and the market is so saturated that you can easily be replaced with someone else, assuming that you get a job in the first place. Its even worse for women in our field and that only makes me worry more. She has a high GPA when most people don't, that's already good, but kids from high school can apply to the same positions as us and do the same job. Every minute you're not working on your skills, there are 100's that are. She says she wants to learn things on her own, but she spends her free time not learning things that helps her land a co-op placement. There was also an instance where I had to justify to her why she should go to her own class. She thinks I'm controlling, but I'm not trying to be controlling, I'm just trying to give her the best path of success. I'm a year ahead of her in school and have done 3 work placements... and starting a paid 16 month internship in May. I think I know what I'm talking about. 

I don't know about other people, but my entire life is about efficiency. I streamline my life so I stop wasting time where I don't have to, because it adds up. I tell her that but she doesn't listen to me. 

She procrastinates her work and plays games until midnight, and since her work isn't done, and then she can't come over/I can't come over to cuddle and sleep with her every night. This irritates me because she spends her time playing games instead of doing work, when work is the thing that is keeping her from spending the night with me. I feel like her game is more important than me because she would rather spend time doing that than finish her work quickly so she can come cuddle. Cuddling while doing her work also doesn't work because she doesn't like me looking at her screen or watching her work because it makes her nervous. I need to cuddle every night to de-stress myself when I'm stressed with school work and a part - time job, but if she doesn't come one night I think I'd die. 

Once she said she'd come over at 9.30pm, and then I kept messaging her every hour to ask what she was up to, and she said she was packing and she was on her way over. But then after 7 hours of waiting and getting my hopes up, she decides not to come over anymore. She said that she was talking to her friends online... but can't she come over and do that here? That day I just felt like dying. I was angry, frustrated and sad... cuddling is probably the thing I look forward to the most everyday, but it got ripped out of my hands.

I get really sad and angry because she failed to deliver something she told me she would do. She says things that she would do, but fails to perform on multiple occasions. She says she ""forgot"" but I expect her to back everything she says, it doesn't matter if it's not a promise. When it is a promise, then I expect even more with 100% certainty that it is going to be done/happen. I want to cuddle and sleep with her in my arms every night, not because for sex, but it makes me feel comfortable and connected... but she says that's clingy. I like cooking then eating breakfast and dinner with her every night, but that's not what she wants. 

We did a love language test together and:
My love language is physical touch (11/12), followed by quality time (9/12), acts of service (5/12), gifts (3/12), words of affirmation (2/12)
Hers are physical touch (7), quality time (7), words of affirmation (7), acts of service (5), gifts (4)
My MBTI type is ISTJ... she did a test too, but her results varied, but if I can recall correctly, I_F_.

I can't express or receive love when she isn't physically present. I need her to cuddle me or touch me or I don't feel loved/comforted/cared about/feeling like she belongs to me and no one else. I feel the need to hold her hand, make out, hug pat her head and stroke her head/hair/entire body because that's the only way I know how to give and receive love.  

And when we are physically together, her attention is not on me. It's on her anime, phone, games, YouTube, talking to other people and it hurts me. I don't care what we do but can't she put everything down and just look at me? Or just cuddle and talk and not do anything? That kind of thing gives me butterflies and makes my heart race... which is why I always sleep in because I feel like that's the only time where she wants to cuddle and spend all her attention on me.  When she's cuddling with me and she's on her phone reading or playing games, it bothers me because I feel like she doesn't enjoy the moment like I do... I can spend 20 hours just like that. 

I don't know why she doesn't understand that I want her in my bed every night and then wake to her in my arms every morning. Why can't we spend all 365 days cuddling? I thought we were supposed to be a team... Her and I vs. the entire world, but I don't think she shares that view with me. 

The moment I don't stay over at her place, I get this different vibe from her on IM... like she's a different person all of a sudden. She messages me starts disagreeing and starting fights with me... but in person, she's never like that. So I rush over to her place (2 min walk) and break down. For that time being, we cuddle and make food and everything seems OK, but the next day, everything repeats again.

She also talks to her friends online regarding our relationship and then they ask for validation or justification of why I am still in a relationship with her. Why do we feel the need to justify love? It doesn't make any sense to me. 

I don't know why I come off so clingy... maybe it has something to do with my childhood and past experiences... I was physically and verbally abused as I child, and also bullied at school and everywhere I went (sports leagues). My ex - girlfriend left me and starting dating my best friend the day after we broke up. That was 7 years ago, but I'm over it. 

---
**TL;DR;** : Fighting/disagreeing everyday for the past 1.5 months because she doesn't like cuddling every night, don't know what to do and we don't want to break up."

I'm kind of feeling worried about my hair test which is coming up soon, and I thought this would be a good place to post.

Five weeks ago, I found out that I got an internship for this summer. Great right? But of course with that comes a drug hair test.

So obviously I immediately stopped smoking. They haven't scheduled my test yet, but it's probably within the next month or so.

Do you guys think that I should go through the trouble/possibly destroy my hair and try the Macujo/Jerry G Method? Or do you guys think it should be enough time that my hair should naturally be clean by then just by getting frequent haircuts?

Does anyone have any experience with hair tests? What did you do to prepare, and did you pass or fail?

Thanks.

Right now, I can graduate with only CS next semester by taking a single class. It would be a really relaxed semester (literally 1 class), I could pay for it out of pocket (no loans) with the money I make from my internship this summer, and I would graduate in December. For a Math minor, I can tack on 1 additional class next semester, still probably pay out of pocket (albeit quite a bit more), and still have a somewhat chill semester. To graduate with both majors, I would have to stay an additional semester, take out more loans(I'm ~$20k deep right now), and take 3 classes both semesters, or some combination of 4 and 2. 

I'm curious as to what you guys think. Would it be really beneficial for me to finish both? I'll have 2 internships by the time I graduate (one at a small defense contractor working on drones, and this summer I'll be at a prop trading firm), great experience, and a great GPA regardless.

46oiit,1,2016-02-19,LOR opinions?,beyondfocus,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/46oiit/lor_opinions/,"Long time lurker here, I know a thread for letters was just posted but I need some help. I am applying this cycle and am gathering my letters of recommendation. I want to cover all my bases so let me know what you think.
My primary letter for a majority of schools I am applying for require the usual 2 science and 1 non science. 
My first science professor is an Anatomy professor whom I am close to and have taken two other engineering courses with him as well and working on an developing an internship program with him.

My second science is a biochem professor whom I received an A+ in the course and also have done an honors project for the class as well, but my relationship with him isnt as strong as my anatomy profossor but regardless I don't doubt it will be a strong letter.

My non science is a upper division religions class I am taken and also doing an honors project and will complete my honors thesis with her during my senior year. I have a really good connection with her and expecting a strong letter.

My next letter comes from my research PI who hasn't taught me in any classes but I have been in the lab for about 2 years and worked on successful projects and conferences and grants with him. Strong letter.

I have a letter from an MD that I shadowed and am close to, I know some schools don't require it, but my in-state schools require an MD letter.

I have another letter from a tutoring center I have been working out for 5 years. I am chief instructor and my relationship with her is amazing, the letter is extremely strong as my job requires me to work well with both kids and parents, while also lead over all the assistants. 

I also have a letter from the volunteer coordinator at which I volunteer at. I have been at the hospital for 5 years and logged 600+ hours and have received a scholarship from the hospital and am active in assisting the program. Her letter as well is a strong one.

Now my problem is that this is 7 letters. I am afraid that might be too many letters and I don't want to push it, but I find it difficult to not use one of the letters. If I could not use one of the letters it would definitely be my biochem professor but seeing as I need another science professor I cannot.
Any advice on what to do? Thanks in advanced.

46onbh,1,2016-02-19,"I [23M] broke up with my girlfriend [23F] of 1 month, but I don't know if it was a mistake.",ChezTenny,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46onbh/i_23m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_23f_of_1_month/,"We met on an academic competition team, and started dating after the competition ended. I've never fallen for a girl so hard before, and everyone who knows her thinks she's an angel. She's intelligent, kind, caring, affectionate and really cute too. 

But we started having problems early. With the intent of starting the relationship on an honest foundation, I told her that I had hooked up with another girl also on the competition team back in October. She then tells me she's done the same thing too, with another guy on the team a week before we started dating. We've since had moments where we were at the brink of sex, but she'd stop it, saying she wants to wait. I understand that past conduct with other people shouldn't set any precedent for a new relationship, and that girls can and have every right to treat relationship sex and a one night stand differently. Regardless, the recency of it (1 week) admittedly made me jealous and made me wonder if there wasn't feelings involved, even though she promised me there wasn't (context: everyone on this team grew quite close, like a family). Plus, when all our clothes come off and she tells me that she wants it and then stops it, it's sexually frustrating and eventually I just stopped caring altogether and just dealt with it with some lotion and a box of tissues. [edit]: I didn't argue with her about wanting to have sex. I argued with her about the teasing, the recency of her last hookup, and how it just seems like inconsistent behavior given the timeline of events. 

I'll be graduating next year, and she is graduating this year. I was going through a lot of anxiety in terms of landing a promising internship, and I talked to her about the stress I was feeling from the uncertainty. On the other hand, she has a full time job lined up for her after graduating, and she's in a good spot financially and career-wise. Maybe it was a mistake to talk to her about this in the first place, but the way she gave advice was as though she was patronizing me. For example, ""Don't be so negative, that attitude will get you nowhere!"" and ""You don't have to worry about money, I can always pay for our dates too."" I know she was trying to be helpful, but hearing those things just made me feel emasculated. I told her that her way of trying to support me was making me feel like a loser and inferior to her. And sure enough, another argument ensued. I told her I feel inadequate when I hear words like that, and that I just wanted her to be my fan and cheer me on. 

A few days ago, I got an interview request and aced a midterm, so I was feeling pretty good about myself. She came over the next day, but from the moment she arrived, she was just on her phone and distant the entire time. Since we were sitting next to each other, I noticed that the moment her phone buzzes, she'd pick it up instantly, and I'd catch a glimpse of the same Facebook messenger bubble before she angled her phone away from me to reply. When I asked who she was talking to, she said, ""Oh it's a friend I met in first year. We took a bunch of classes together and he's helped me through some hard times back then but he's out of the country so you don't have to worry about him!"" Now, whenever I text her, she takes a couple hours to reply (which didn't bother me at all, I'm not needy) but I thought it was weird that she was willing to respond to this guy with such haste that apparently I wasn't worthy of. Also, I hadn't given any impression that I was worried (I was on cloud 9 having secured an interview and aced an exam). We went to watch a funny movie, but afterwards she was just distant again. So I started to get concerned that something was bothering her and asked her about it. She kept trying to change the topic, blowing off my question, forcing laughter and smiles and it was just so obvious she was hiding something. 

It ate away at me, and when we got back to my place, I told her that I knew she wasn't telling me something and that it was getting to my head. She kept playing dumb, saying she didn't know what I was talking about. It went on for so long to the point it got frustrating and I asked to see what she was texting this guy. She reluctantly obliged, and I read how she was pretty much making fun of me and complaining about me to the other guy. ""Omg he was so jealous (of the other guy she hooked up with)"" and ""LOL no I wouldn't sleep with him (me) so he's mad."" Believe me when I say, I know it was 100% wrong to check her phone. I've dated my share of girls, one of which I dated for 5 years, and I never ever had an urge to invade their privacy. But a toxic, nagging feeling just created this nasty urge to check, and even though all I wanted was to trust her, her playing dumb really got to me. And reading how she was talking about me to this guy friend really sucked, especially since she was so eager to reply to him all day. Especially more since all I do all day long is sing praises about her to anyone who'd listen. I felt betrayed and embarrassed.

For each or those above arguments, I usually did most of the talking and it made me feel like an overbearing manipulative asshole every time. Each time, she would give me this guilty look and say things like ""I've never met a guy who cares so much about me and makes me feel so wanted, and I never meant to hurt you."" and ""I know we can work through this, you just have to have faith in me and give me time to be good to you. I'm doing my best"" Still, she was so eager to talk shit about me to this other guy. I told her that it's not like me to invade someone's privacy, and that I was absolutely disgusted at myself for going into her phone. I told her this relationship was turning me into a jealous (her hookup), insecure (""career advice""), controlling and paranoid (checking phone) person, and that I was scared of and hated what I was becoming. I told her we should end it, and she tried for hours and hours to change my mind saying ""you're the most amazing guy I've ever dated"" and ""I need you as much as I know you need me too"" and I bombed my interview which the next day because I was so sleep deprived and upset. I couldn't even focus on preparing for the interview because I was too preoccupied and emotionally drained over the breakup.

Did I do the right thing by ending it? Was I being too harsh/over sensitive? She wants me back - should I give her another chance? 


**tl;dr**: Dated a girl for a month, fell for her like I've never fell for anyone before, but we kept having arguments. I was turning into a jealous, insecure, controlling boyfriend, and broke up with her out of fear of the person I was becoming. She seems to genuinely like me, so did I make the right choice in ending it? "

46oup4,4,2016-02-20,"Be an actuary now, or be an actuary later? Can I plan to be a career-changer",infinitevindaloop,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/46oup4/be_an_actuary_now_or_be_an_actuary_later_can_i/,"Background: Graduated college (CS Minor, Econ BA) in December. Currently studying for P and FM to take in May and June, trying to catch the summer employment wave for recent college grads who have passed P and FM. Underemployed and financially constrained at the moment. 


I've got three career chases going on right now: 

1.   Job that will pay my expenses while I study for exams in my college town, 

2.   Entry-level, nation-wide actuarial internship search for once I pass my exams in May and June,

3.   Entry-level jobs as analyst or specialist, targeted to the metropolitan area I've networked the most in, as Plan B to Plan Actuary


If not for my determination to pass these exams and become an actuary as quickly as possible, I would be getting better employment at the moment. I have contacts at a couple companies that I have been putting off for this career path. Currently I am living in and was planning on living in my college town until everyone else graduates in June. It's a good study environment, and I still think it will be financially possible with my savings, as long as nothing bad happens. Still, it's stressful because I know my money is running out, and I no longer have money coming in to pay my expenses; in fact, I now have to pay that money back. 


I fear that if I get a non-actuarial, full-time ""real job"" that gets me a livable income, I'll be inundated by the hours, training, and changes associated with starting your first real job. Because I'm in a small college town, as far as employment goes, any real job I get is going to require moving. Moving means packing up stuff, getting a new landlord, learning a new area, getting involved with activities to make friends, and otherwise transitioning, which can be really stressful. A big move would set a lot of people back on studying, and I know it would set me back. I'm afraid that if I move on, I'll miss out on an opportunity to study for exams before ""real life"" hits. A lot of people tell me to enjoy it while it lasts. However, my finances are so strained right now that I stress over whether or not I want to eat dinner with my friends at the dining hall. I am starting to feel tied down by these exams, like they're keeping me here, like they're keeping me in poverty.


I've talked with a lot of actuaries, and I'm really drawn to the career. The combination of skill sets seems like a great fit for me. I really want to do this, but I know that before I even start a conversation with a company or a recruiter I need to have both exams passed. I'm putting a ton of pressure on myself to get these done before summer so I can have the best chance of getting started on my career asap. I'm already 2-3 years older than everyone else in my class.


What worries me though, is that if I don't pass the exams in May and June, and if I don't get an actuary position soon after, I'll be wishing I had gone for the non-actuary positions. Even after passing the exams, I could be unemployed for a while. A lot of the summer positions are interviewing now and I don't have the exams passed to get my foot in the door. For me right now, becoming an actuary is going to be a significant financial risk.


So I guess what I'm asking is, for advice. Should I try to look for a real job, take a break from studying, come back to it after I settle in, and then try to transition to being an actuary? Or should I push through this post-college slump and study super hard for these exams, converting my nerves over my underemployment and dwindling finances motivation? 


If I go work as an analyst first year out of college, can I still be an actuary? Is it okay to put off studying for exams until I'm financially stable with a different job? Up until writing this post, I was blaming myself for not being focused enough when studying, but now I'm starting to wonder if my study environment isn't as good as I thought it was, after all. If thoughts of if I can afford to eat dinner tonight are distracting me from studying, then maybe this isn't a good time in my life to be an actuary. I spend  time looking for temporary work in my area, and my amount of time applying for and strategizing for ways to make money is cutting into study time. Are thoughts like these normal distractions,. and do I need to get used to pushing through these kinds of thoughts in order to be an actuary?  

Should I try a different ""career"" so that I can be financially stable, and then make my move? That is, should I plan to be a career-changer?


Thanks so much in advance if you have any comments!

I don't know what to do and she has no idea she's the one who keeps my intense depression away. God this feels bad,throw17299,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/46p9yq/my_close_friend_has_stopped_talking_to_me_and_is/,"We're both 21 and working and met at work. Met only a couple of months ago but we grew close very quickly. She felt she could share all the deep dark thiings that she shared with pretty much no one else, and so did I.

A few days ago, her uncle died after a long battle with Alzheimer's and she was pretty broken up about it for a day or so, during which I tried to talk to her and be a friend, but she didn't feel like that so I gave her some space for a couple of days.

After these couple of days she showed up to work and seemingly normal with pretty much everyone except me. She stopped having any meals or coffee breaks with me, and stopped hanging out at my cubicle or in any way interacting with me beyond a hello, and I have no clue why.

What she doesn't know is that she's one the very few reasons I even bother showing to this hellish internship I have to stick out for 6 months. Hanging out with her and listening to her stories and sharing laughs are what make it worth while to wake up in the morning at all. I've told this to no one, but I've been extremely down and depressed the past 3-4 weeks and it has severely affected my work performance.

And now today I see her all the way over at her cubicle chatting and chilling with the same bunch of people she used to chill with, and behaving and functioning seemingly normal, except for the fact that she's pretty much ignoring my existence at work. I don't think she knows how fucking gut-wrenching it is for me, and I didn't confront her about it because I think it's still too early in her stages of grief.

It feels like all the walls are closing in, and nothing is going well in life and only sadness all around me.

It's probably worth mentioning she used to, and maybe still has a thing for me. I never reciprocated because I just thought of her as a close friend, which I guess she eventually adjusted to.

I want my friend back. I fucking miss her and it physically hurts and turns my stomach to see her ignore just me, and it's fucking frustrating to be so damn helpess right now.

I don't know what to do. I want my friend back."

46pon2,5,2016-02-20,Rollerblades that double as Ice-skates? / Customizable rollerblades? TLDR,jimykurtax,rollerblading,https://www.reddit.com/r/rollerblading/comments/46pon2/rollerblades_that_double_as_iceskates/,"Hey there! I used to rollerblade a lot (agressive/street ones) when I was a kid. I did it well and I loved doing it! but I grew, the trend went away and for years I never touched it again.
Im now way older, my awesome rollerblades didnt fit me anymore and I gave them away to a kid from a less privileged family.


I came on an internship to Poland, and here cold being way more prevalent than where I come from, I got to try Ice-Skating for the first time, and I loved it! Reminded me of my good old times rollerblading and I wish to do it again!!


My big problem is that I have very sensitive feet, and nearly ALL cheaper iceskates/rollerblades wich I try end up hurting me either on my ankle bones (With this sticking or hard plastic parts or something like that) or the base of my feet gets tired and tender really quickly and I cant handle more than 30 minutes of this conflictuous torturing fun.



So I wanted to buy something that is, above anything, confortable, and wanted to know if there was the possibility of having shoes wich I could remove the lower frame of weels and attach one for ice skating whenever I would change, because I dont exactly wish to have to purchase two pairs of big-ass shoes and have them laying around.
Im also looking more towards big-wheeled rollerblades as Im more aiming for speed and making larde distances rather than going back to tricking, but maybe if these rollerblades have to possiblity of a customizable frame I could then also in the future replace with different frames for different wheel sizes? Anything like this?






***TL DR:*** Speedy(large wheeled) but most importantly confortable rollerblades that could double up as ice skates (by changing the lower frame?). Basically roller blades that can have the lower frame be customized when I feel like using different sized wheels (or most importantly ice skating blade)

Thank you everyone for the attention!! Im comming back to this world so there are a lot of things I don't know about so please forgive if I say any dumb things :P"
46q83a,5,2016-02-20,The last few months I feel like I’m dragged into a big black hole of depression,pericondor,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/46q83a/the_last_few_months_i_feel_like_im_dragged_into_a/,"The last few months I feel like I’m dragged into a big black hole of depression. I really want to do anything to keep me out of it. I need some advice…
I think it all started in the early days of elementary school. I had one good friend, and kind of ignored the rest of the kids in my class because I did not feel any connection. My friend did not pass the year when we we’re eight years old. So I had to continue elementary school alone in my class of people I didn’t like. Fortunately after a year or two I had been able to make some friends. But there was something missing, I still felt like an outsider and not really part of the group. Sometimes I was really angry about random stuff at home and on school so I started crying.  There was one point (11y old) at home where I was so angry that I broke a banana into in front of my mom, and said something like “this is what I am going to do with my life”. At that point my parents send me to some kind of “handle-your-situation-in-peace” class. I was supposed to learn what to say to people when they do something I didn’t like. Those sessions felt very stupid and didn’t help in handling my situations. 

When I was 12y it was time to go to high school. First year was the most horrible time of my life. Where in elementary school everyone at least let me be as I was, people on high school started to bully me all the time. Every time I did something people tried to make something humiliating of it. I had some friends, but they all went gone or even started bullying me when the “cool kids” started to make fun of me again. This also really influenced my grades. I was always above average in general learning and actually pretty smart when it came to math and stuff. There was a point in the second semester where there was a 40% probability that I would fail my year and had to do it over.   Again my parents took some action, and put me on an after school homework class. This was horrible, but at least my results improved drastically, and I passed the year, still being bullied but at least I survived the year with those f*ckers. 

The second year of high school was a lot better. I made two new friends, which were kind of like me, but the difference was that they had friends in school. Friends who became my friends after some time. I don’t know what happened to me personally, but suddenly I started to feel happier in school! I became more confident and the bullying actually stopped, lesson learned! I started playing guitar, got my growth spurt, grew long hair and was still successful in school. You would say the shy guy was gone if you’d saw me back then. There where some minor issues which a lot of guys had at that time: getting girlfriends. Lot’s of people in my class started to have girls at that time. I think almost everyone expect me (did) have a relation at that time. On some moments that made me feel an outsider again.

When I graduated high school I started engineering school. This is where I realized two things. 1. I had potential to become a good engineer. And 2: I had also potential to become a workaholic and ignore all my friends in that process. A few month’s in I only spoke a lot to my original two friends, the rest of my high school friends were out of sight, out of mind. At engineering school I made quite some friends, and also in my home town I started chilling with people. Still those people weren’t really good friends.

At this time 18y, I still had no girlfriend, or even kissed a girl (beside once being drunk as fuck). I also didn’t play in a band, so I did not have proper motivation to play a lot of guitar. I also started to lose my hair really rapidly, this was really harsh for me at that age. In conclusion, I really had two sides: in one side I had friends, was good in school, on my way to a good carreer. But on the otherside, I felt miserable about a lot of things.

The thought of more self-improvement crossed my mind a lot when I was reading on the internet. It seemed to make you way happier. I did read way too much, and did way too less to actually improve myself. I tried reading a lot about picking up girls, but failed to apply it. Tried gym, but was not consistent. Tried Healthy eating, but failed. Meanwhile I started getting really really bald so I felt kind of horrible again. 

 Luckily when I was 20y I finally decided to shave my head. This was a kind of trigger for things to get better. I started traveling more, went to gym 6 times a week, started eating healthy, did nofap (streaks were not that good, but on average I did good!). Picking up girls was still an issue but at least I improved myself in spare time by going to the gym!

When I was 21y I fucked up something in my lower back during fitness. I couldn’t figure out what it was and my physical therapist couldn’t either. This made me really sad because I felt being punished for all the hard work I did. And in the following months I stopped doing all the good habits I started..

At least there was one good thing going on, I got admitted for studying abroad for a semester. A fantasized a lot about making new friends over there so I was really looking forward to it. That was a new trigger, I did commit to improve myself again! The first few months abroad were good if I think back. However, the last couple of months I felt outside of the group again. Let me explain this; In the first months no one really knew each other so everyone had to make their friends. But in the months after I started seeing how everyone was improving their friendship bonds, while I was still small-talking with most of those people. Since I still couldn’t do weight workouts, I bought running shoes and started running in my spare time. This also backfired at me, resulting in a painful right knee. Over time I got less committed to maintain my self-improvements because I felt it didn’t matter. 

While I’m typing this, it is one month ago since I returned from aboard. The situation only got worse. I am barely speaking to people apart from the people I see in my 40h/week internship. In my spare time I’m browsing the internet with no purpose, sleep way too early and watch too much TV. I still try to do self-improvement but I keep giving up after a week.

I don’t want to be unhappy, but it feels like I’m supposed to be like this. Does anyone have tips to overcome/handle what I’m going through?

I thought that the experience would be able to pull me through, but applying out to summer internships many of the applications have required boxes that ask for certifications, thus essentially preventing me from really applying to these opportunities.

So I was hoping I could take some time during this semester to sit down and study for like a month or two and try and get A+, Sec+, Net+ as a cert spree... is that logical? possible?

I'm familiar with most of the concepts as I have taken some introductory networking classes, hardware classes, and I'm finishing up this cybersecurity class on technologies and policy management. I've found some great resources here as well as Messer and Mike Meyers that I do plan on going through over the weekends.

I'm sure I could get A+, but I'm not sure about Sec+ and Net+ because I see there are people here that have been in the industry longer than I have and still struggle so I'm not sure if it's even worth the money if I'm probably going to fail.

Considering CompTIA are typically the gateway and lowest tier cert, I might as well be getting them eventually."

Sometimes I can't get home properly because buses aren't running (they're all I can afford) so I have to walk halfway in the early hours. Some comes from my parents, who I now owe ~£3000. I have absolutely no savings. 
I can't work more because I need to try and focus on revision for my final exams at uni. I don't get student finance anymore because I've already had to suspend my course twice because I've been so ill. This year is my final chance. 

Then today, my boyfriend tells me that he's unhappy with our sex life. I blame myself, my libido has dropped to next to nothing. 

One of my friends has a mortgage and is getting married next year. Working her dream job also. Another is living the dream abroad and has just landed a good new job meaning she'll stay out there for good and I'll barely see her again. Another has £17k+ in savings and a good job. Another has found her purpose in a teaching job. Another told me the same day I found out about my flat that she got an internship with Microsoft. My boyfriend has a good job and the people there love him. He's on his way to a PhD. Another friend has just completed his masters degree and has landed a £35k per year job. Another friend who didn't get a great degree has now even got a good job. 

I can't be happy for any of them. I'm drowning in my misery. I have nothing else. This is my life, and apparently the best thing I can do is accept it and get on with it. "
46r5wz,5,2016-02-20,I [21 M] think my relationship with my GF [21 F] is dead.,NightKnight11291,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46r5wz/i_21_m_think_my_relationship_with_my_gf_21_f_is/,"My GF, Sarah, and I have been dating for almost two years now. We are both in college, and she will be graduating next year, one year before I. I have been in one long term relationship prior to this one, but I am Sarah's first boyfriend, first kiss, first everything. We are currently living in an apartment together, and are in our lease until August, where we already have leases lined up for separate apartments.

Last fall, her internship had her living a few hours away from our University, and we only saw each other once every other week or so. When this semester started, everything seemed fine the first week, and then things came out.

She told me that for awhile she hadn't been feeling like I hadn't been as affectionate, or thankful, as I could be towards her. So I decided to change. I had noticed it too, and had already planned to change myself, and thought it was good that it had come out of the closet finally. However, she said she had been feeling it for awhile, but just hadn't decided tell me until then. 

For the past month and a half, I have been acting much more affectionate, grateful, and anything else I can be to better our relationship, and myself as an individual. 

What she didn't immediately tell me was that she hadn't really been feeling any romantic feelings towards me either; she had mainly just had the feelings of friends. Because of this, the most ""coupley"" things we have been doing the last month and a half have been hugs, kisses, and an ""I love you"" before going to bed.

I have felt like we have been getting better, as there have been more kisses, hugs, and what not, but I don't feel she feels the same way.

From the talks we have had about the whole situation, Sarah says that I have done nothing wrong, and I have given her everything she has ever wanted in a relationship; her feelings just faded, and she hadn't brought it up sooner than she had because she was hoping it would fix itself. She says she has just been feeling more comfortable around me, friend wise, and that she is still only really comfortable giving kisses and hugs. 

She is not sure what is wrong, or what she wants to do, or anything, but we have yet to come to any decisions of break up or not, so we can see what we can do. I truly believe that her feelings for me are still there, but she just may be used to being independent from living alone for 6 months (plus she has always had a fairly independent personality). She says so far, her romantic feelings haven't come back, and that she is trying, but just doesn't know when/if it'll happen. 

I've told her I really need her to believe in Me, Herself, and Us, if she wants us to work out, and that she needs to help me fix Us because I can't do it alone. 

I just wish some more progress had been made, or we knew what to do to help us.

tl;dr: GF feels no/barely any romantic feelings towards me, and isn't sure when/if they'll come back. Anyone else have experience with this? Can we still save this?"
46ratl,0,2016-02-20,Honesty in job postings/how do I move forward in the face of discrimination?,GretchenR,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/46ratl/honesty_in_job_postingshow_do_i_move_forward_in/,"The following is an open letter I recently posted to mainstream media editors and their human resources management teams. Although it is directed to them specifically, it is reflective of a systemic problem that covers the job market spectrum. My questions to anyone kind enough to respond here are what do I do? Go back to living a double life? Give up on my career in the hope of finding one more amenable to my identity (if it even exists)? I am at my wits end. 

Let’s be completely honest with each other for a moment.

I wish to my ever-loving God I had not been born a transgender individual. I wish that reparative therapy had worked, or that I had stayed closeted or that I had succeeded in an attempt at suicide in 2001 so that I never would have transitioned to female.

It is killing my career.

I have put in two-and-a-half years as a journalist covering the LGBT community in Chicago. I have already received two major awards and I’m up for three this year. My investigative work set a woman on the road to freedom after sitting in the Cook County Jail for four years without a trial. My features on individuals, politics, protests, crimes arts and events helped garner the paper consistently high social media shares. I organized a job fair for LGBT youth, forced Rahm Emanuel off-script during a pre-election interview along with the senior adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu when I was covering LGBT life in Israel and I was constantly asked to sit on panel discussions thereby elevating and furthering my paper’s name and reputation.

So, in the fall of 2015, I figured it was time to make the move to mainstream media. How hard could it be? Just because the stories I write for my current paper have an LGBT focus doesn’t mean I cannot cover or pitch those that don’t. Just because I have grilled everyone from the mayor to state and federal representatives to aldermen on issues affecting the LGBT community does not mean I can’t do exactly the same thing on a broader spectrum.

My one-page, succinct cover letter was never constructed without taking the time to thoroughly research the publication and even the person who gave the addressee her/his first job in journalism before asking for the same faith once demonstrated in her/him.

Most of the time, it was never even acknowledged.

I didn’t worry at first. I figured that my application was getting buried under a deluge of feisty Columbia grad students all willing to work for one economy-sized bowl of Spaghettios per annum.

But then those few who did interview me always had the same concern. “Can you write about something other than LGBT issues?”

I never even had to pause before answering that question.

I wasn’t out as transgender when I applied for my last job and my resume had a 90 percent response rate. Now I was down to three out of every hundred at best.

Of course, it suddenly occurred to me. My name is now all over Google. “Transgender journalist wins Lisagor Award”, “Gretchen Hammond transcends as transgender journalist”- all red flags from the top to bottom of even the most cursory search.

So I tried a social experiment.

I sent my cover letter, resume and clips to two major organizations advertising on journalismjobs.com. After two weeks, I submitted exactly the same cover letter, resume and clips only this time with everything, including the byline on my clips, changed back to the name I was assigned at birth. Thanks to some equally crafty alterations using a PDF editor, I took out all the LGBT references in the articles and even gave my newspaper an alias.

Imagine my surprise and dismay at our hyperactively evolving, but supposedly progressive profession when, without fail, the human resources manager or editor in question tried to get in touch with Jonathon asking for an interview.

When I called them out on it, I received defensive responses that were variations on the following theme:

“Rest assured, we at ___________________ do not discriminate against LGBT individuals. As a matter of fact we have a transgender employee. We intend to launch a full investigation into what happened here.”

The rest was silence.

Yesterday it happened again. The good news is I am back to a 90 percent response rate. The bad news is there is no going back. 

So respectfully I request that if you don’t want to hire a transgender reporter just say so in your job posting. 

Most of your publications are in states that do not have gender identity discrimination protections anyway. You’re not going to be on the wrong end of litigation. Are you worried about the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)? Sure, they have a few cases meandering aimlessly through regarding gender identity but, right now, it's all about interpretation so you won't need to lawyer up beyond a free, 15-minute consultation with 1-800-SEWERS: specializing in personal injury and defamation on the Food Network.

Are you afraid that one of the aforementioned feisty Columbia grads at Buzzfeed is going to pick up on it and give you 800 words worth of a click-baited dressing down?

Yes it will get shared and you’ll probably get some nasty comments from the armchair-activists who float around social media looking for an argument they can call their own. 

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) might get off their collective, well-suckled, lackadaisical asses to send out a half-hearted press release and you might even get a persnickety call from some GLAAD intern who has been unceremoniously yanked away from a perfectly enjoyable Hulu binge-fest of Grey’s Anatomy in order to tell you what a naughty no-no it is to discriminate and to point you in the direction of their transgender 101 guidelines updated from about three hours ago.    

That is until Caitlyn Jenner, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or the South Dakota legislature provide them with another scandalous, bright and shiny object.

So what do you care? In fact, 24-hours later, is anyone even going to remember?

So just be honest. What are you so afraid of? Moreover, what are you ashamed of? Transgender individuals are en vogue right now as the enemies-of-freedom, so why not jump on the bandwagon instead of sneaking between the wheels? 

When it comes down to it,  you are worse than the HR folks at the Westboro Baptist Church. At least they are up-front enough for me to know that an application for a position in their public relations department might not make it past the red-flag keywords they’ve programmed into their self-aware Taleo human resources version 9.0.

So I am simply asking you to have the courage and honesty to add “must NOT be transgender” at the end of your job requirements. Hey, you can even use microscopic print or a voice-over by some guy who used to be an auctioneer for Red Bull.

That said, if you are willing to give me a chance, I can assure you I have been through every last surgical procedure so I am not going to cost your company or cause lasting damage your health insurance rates. I look and sound like a woman so I am not going to make anyone uncomfortable in the rest room. If it does bother anyone, believe me in the past eight-years I’ve learned how to hold my bladder and, if you are worried about the reaction of your readers, I will legally change my name and so erase every single one of my past achievements.

As Shakespeare might have put it, I have eyes, senses, organs, dimensions and passions which extend to walking my dogs, reading voraciously and working out to episodes of The West Wing—only recently discovered because there was nothing else on Netflix outside of the SciFi Channel's latest re-edit of Sharknado's Greatest Bits. The rest of my life is my work.

I am just as human as you but don’t for a minute imagine that a 73 percent job discrimination rate nationwide towards transgender people leaves any room for personal integrity, dignity or the uncompromising journalist. 

Giving up at least two of those traits is therefore a fair trade. It's clearly either that or find a glue-on mustache and go back to living a double life. 

I just want to do the work I have proven time and time again that I do so well and that I love. I want to engage in the continual learning process that drives me every single day. I want to satiate my addiction to journalism.

That’s all.

With what I am willing to sacrifice on the altar of appearances, with how far I have come yet how far I am willing to go, why is that asking too much?

If any of you have the courage and honesty to respond to this post, then I would be as pleasantly surprised as I am currently in awe as to just how hypocritical some iron-plated defenders of the First Amendment actually are.  Of course, I could name names but I just can't seem to sink to their level.

I wonder how we stack up against each other morally?"
46raya,12,2016-02-20,What's your opinion on the level of trust with new IT employees?,cosidian,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/46raya/whats_your_opinion_on_the_level_of_trust_with_new/,"Yesterday, I was offered a full-time position (As a desktop support analyst) at my internship, starting once I graduate. Yay! It comes with the assumption that, given an appropriate amount time and displaying some level of competence, I'll be given bigger and better duties related to the AD, file servers, routers, scripting, hardware projects, etc. in addition to my regular duties. With any luck, it'll turn into a jr. sysadmin position.

While discussing the details of this with the sysadmin at my branch, he mentioned it took him 3 months before he even got access to the firewall / router passwords. Keeping in mind, he's currently the only sysadmin in this part of the country for the company. Our office has about 90-100 users, all of which deal with some confidential information about our customers. The head office is 2300km away. He was hired as a sysadmin.

I was a little taken aback by what he said. Is that considered normal for most companies? I would assume, during the course of your normal duties as a systems administrator, you might need access to those devices. Not having access to those devices might impact your ability to do your job (At least for that 3 month period). 

What you guys think? Do you trust your new employees right off the bat with your IT systems, or do you wait before introducing them slowly. How long do you wait until leaving them to their own devices?

RELEVANT COURSEWORK

Community Planning Analysis - In this course I learned about the community development and planning practitioners’ techniques and tools that are used to gather, analyze, and present information and data. This course provided me with an introduction to a broad
range of analytical methods and techniques used in the field to understand communities. I was able to learn how to
obtain data, select and use the most appreciate analytical methods (with an emphasis on computer applications), and
present the observed results effectively. The topics that were covered included primary and secondary data collection,
basic methods of descriptive statistics, demographic models, populations projections and forecasts, economic
analysis, housing indicators, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, and community asset mapping and zoning. The class
is a mixture of lectures, small group exercises, and hands-on computer labs and over the course of the semester through
the use of various analytical tools- I developed a portfolio of a community near my college - historic
Strawberry Mansion, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

Global Preservation Practice - In this course I was introduced to the agencies - regional, national and global – that are operating in the fields of architectural conservation, preservation, and adaptive reuse. I was able to study case studies while I learned
techniques that would assist in the development of a knowledge case of the contemporary practice. It was in this
course that I was introduced to UNESCO and the concept of protecting our world heritage.

Research Methods for Architectural Preservation - In this course I was introduced to the resources, sources, and methods of investigation that are particular to historic
preservation and development techniques. I was able to gain a knowledge base of techniques that are employed in the
physical, verbal, and quantitative documentation of structures, buildings, and sites. I became acquainted with archival
resources, methods of graphical recording and annotations, and the preparation of narrative and quantitative records.
In the second half of the course I was proved with an overview of the physical processes that affect the stability of
buildings, structures, and sites and the range of available remedial actions.

Green vs. Gray: Improving and Sustaining Urban Ecosystem - In this course I explored the urban ecosystems and the methods of improving and sustaining urban environments
using the city of Philadelphia as a living laboratory. I learned about urban ecology, urban field experiments, and the
work required to sustain green infrastructure within a city landscape. This is a community-based learning course
where I engaged in ten hours of field work and environmental stewardship. I volunteered with the Mill Creek Farm
community garden and a creek clean up at Cobbs Creek both located in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

46rpee,8,2016-02-20,My classmates and I [22F] are struggling to get our other classmate [31F] to communicate about scheduling issues.,tripping_right_now,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46rpee/my_classmates_and_i_22f_are_struggling_to_get_our/,"**TLDR; I commute to an internship site with three classmates. My older, less mature classmate finishes her work the same time as everyone else, but doesn’t want to leave the internship early when we’re given explicit permission to do so. When we brought up this issue with her yesterday, she got defensive, began to cry, and insisted she didn’t want to talk about the issue. How can my other classmates and I effectively communicate our concerns and growing resentment to her?** 

**Background:**

I am a 22yo female in my final year of university. This semester, I’m required to participate in an off-campus internship; I love the internship site, but unfortunately, it requires a 1.5 hour commute each way. 

Last semester it was determined that I, along with 3 classmates, would be going to the same internship site. My classmates Sammy [22f] and Billy [22m] are funny, kind, very intelligent, and my close friends. We agreed that commuting wouldn’t be an issue; we decided to split costs and driving equally and were all happy with our plan. 

Our other classmate, Kathy [31f] is also a final year student in our program. She’s done our 4-year program as a part time student over the course of 8 years, and is admittedly, not a very motivated student. She initially appeared to be very sweet, giving, and shy, but after commuting with her for 5 weeks I’ve formed a very different opinion about her. To keep this short, there are mainly 3 things I find highly dislikeable about Kathy:

1. She is uninterested in participating in a conversation unless it’s about her. I wish I was exaggerating when I write that every conversation we have, whether its about current politics or the color of the sky, she blatantly turns the conversation towards herself. For example, one morning we were discussing a popular local bagel place, but Kathy felt compelled to interject with “Well this morning I made a sandwich! It’ll definitely be the best looking lunch in the break room today!” And we’ll just say ‘Oh, okay’ and continue with the conversation. 

2. Kathy really likes to generate pity from others. I have a very, very low tolerance for ‘woe is me, my life is so terrible’ attitudes. But every single day, Kathy will find something to one-up us about in regards to her supposedly crappy life. For example, one morning I was driving all of us to the internship; Kathy arrived at my house ~5 minutes earlier than our scheduled departing time. It happened to be raining, so a minute after she arrived, I went outside to invite her to sit in my warm car or come into the house. Kathy’s response was, “Oh don’t worry about lame old me, just waiting out here in the rain. This is just my life, always being forgotten and ignored. Just me, waiting all alone in the rain!” She was and always is 100% serious. 

3. Lastly, Kathy sees no issue criticizing the three of us, but gets very offended when one of us tries to criticize her. Sammy, Billy, and I have no problem saying something like, “Hey, you’re technique looks shitty. Want some guidance?” and helping each other out. On multiple occasions, I’ve told Billy to slow down when he drives, and he always says absolutely and listens to me. Kathy, on the other hand, responds very defensively. She LOVES to tailgate other drivers on the road; every time she does, I tell her, “I think you’re too close to the other car. Can you please stop tailgating and slow down?” Kathy always responds angrily and insinuates that the three of us just like to hate on her specifically. 

Long story short, I’ve been growing very impatient with Kathy. I’m tired of her grumpy, selfish, and entitled attitude she carries about herself. The internship site we are at has taken note of this, so it’s going to really hurt her in the long run. 

**The Issue At Hand:** 

We’re scheduled to leave the internship at 3:30, but all 4 of us are scheduled to finish our work at 2:30 every day. Additionally, nearly every single day after lunch, our supervisor says to us that we should leave early if we’re done! Woo-hoo! So yesterday, on a Friday, when we were told we could leave early and hit the road, of course we were eager too. We told Kathy at 2:00 that our supervisor said we could leave early; Kathy said she couldn’t and kept working. We were all surprised and peeved, so at 2:30, we told her again that we were all given permission to leave so we wanted to (and Billy was the driver this week, so he called the shots). Kathy said that she wanted to stay to do homework questions and get “her” work done. We all sat around and did nothing for an hour (with real employees saying “Get out! Go start the weekend!”) until Kathy was done. 

When she finally wrapped up her work and the four of us gather up our possessions to leave, Billy approached Kathy and asked if we could talk. The three of us calmly told Kathy, “Hey, the four of us are being told that we can leave at 2:30 every day. We’re growing more and more upset that you don’t want to leave the internship early, and instead want to sit around and do our homework here instead of at home like we’re supposed to. If three of us are done and you don’t want to leave, that’s not fair. Can we come to a compromise about our schedules so that maybe we can stay until 3:30 Mon/Tues/Wed, but Thurs/Fri we can leave early like we’re told we can?”

Kathy actually freaked out. She immediately got angry and yelled, “I work so much slower than you all, I’m sorry you’re all just so much better. I can’t leave early if I have more work to do, I don’t understand why you guys don’t work more. I’m trying my best and I’m sorry you guys can’t see that.” We tried to assure her that no, this isn’t about her technique, but about when the supervisor tells us to get out, we sure as hell want to. She got even more upset and stormed out of the room, slamming the door.

When we got to Billy’s car (where she was waiting), we all got in and on our way before Sammy brought up, “Hey Kathy, we’re not angry. We just really want to talk about this because it happens every day, and that’s not fair.” The rest of the conversation was totally pointless. Kathy stared at her phone the whole time and kept repeating “I’m a slow worker and need more time, you guys are just so much better than me I guess. I’m not talking about this.” We really did want to talk about why Kathy was uninterested in leaving early when we’re all done with our work and when we’re told, by a supervisor, that we are allowed to leave! Several minutes into our commute home, Kathy started to cry. It got very awkward very fast, and the conversation died. 

I do not know how to bring this up again. I have no issue talking about this with Billy and Sammy, but Kathy literally shut down when we tried to assure her that we didn’t want to attack her or discuss how she works. Of course there are some days where our supervisors says, “Sorry, you guys can’t leave early today, there’s still more to do!” which is fine by me and part of our program. But when this issue of leaving early comes up every single afternoon and Kathy won’t even communicate with us about it, I don’t know what to do. "
46rsm6,85,2016-02-20,[WIP] Skyrim Workforce - Get A Damn Job!,Shadowheart328,skyrimmods,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/46rsm6/wip_skyrim_workforce_get_a_damn_job/,"Are you getting bored of fighting dragons? Is saving all of Tamriel becoming annoying? Ever wanted to live the life of someone whose sole purpose in life isn't to help every single living being in all of Skyrim and kill giant, overgrown, flying lizards of death and destruction? Well if so this future mod will be the one mod that will solve all of those problems!
 
**Preamble (Why am I doing this again?)**

My name is Dane (aka Shadowheart328) and I am working on a mod that will change the way you play Skyrim. In all my playthroughs of Skyrim I have never actually completed the main quest, in fact I never really got as far as the delphine quest, in all honesty I didn't really want to be the dragonborn of legend, my character's are generally thieves, hunters, or rangers why would they care about (or even want to) fight a dragon? Well with a mixture of alternate start mods I was able to fix this problem, however, I was now faced with another dilemna, how was my character going to gain vast amounts of wealth or live the life of a miner/farmer/hunter when the game didn't really set  up any ways to accomplish this? Luckily for me a mod was created by Lifestorock called Jobs in Skyrim. This mod allowed my character to go through the game being a hunter by just accomplishing small radiant quests that paid well enough. Through this I was able to roleplay characters like necromancers, hunters, thieves, and more without having to resort to joining guilds or being the dragonborn. Fast forward a couple years however, and Jobs in Skyrim has been abandoned and pulled from the Nexus, due to the bugs still left in the current version I had no choice but to abandon it too, and that left me heartbroken (or at least I tell myself that.....) and in search of another mod that would allow me to do the same thing. Unfortunately I couldn't find another mod that would allow me to do that so I decided that I would take it upon myself to create such a mod, and take it a step further (and by step I mean an Usain Bolt Olympic sprint...heh Jamaican pride...).
 
**What This Mod is and Does**

If you read through my little preamble, and survived the corny jokes then you sir or mam (no discrimination here) deserve both a cookie (I will bake it myself) and an explanation. In the shortest way possible to describe this mod Skyrim Workforce allows the player to actually get a job and work in Skyrim. However, I decided to make this much more immersive than in it probably should have been. The player will get a new item called the resume' which documents all of their skills and allows them to add different personality traits to their character. The player can then give this resume to the many new employers that will be available within the game, and if their skills qualify them, get hired by said employer to work a certain job. The player will work 5 - 7 days out of the week and will be paid either weekly, biweekly, or depending on the job at the completion of a contract. Like the real world players can be promoted (earning new benefits, titles, etc.), fired (and go home crying), and get benefits! So have I piqued your interest yet?
 
 
**How Jobs Will Work**

Similar to the way that jobs of Skyrim did it once your character gets  the job he/she wants they will report to their employer and be given a bunch of radiant quests to complete. Your character must accept a minimum number of radiant quests to work on per day between the hours of 8am and 10pm. These quest will vary greatly for example as a guard you can be given a radiant quest to patrol part of city for a certain number of hours, during this time random encounters may or may not happen thay you have to stop ( robberies, people in need of help), or you can get gate guard duty and guard the gate of a hold stopping suspicous people, or bandit/animal raids. You can continue asking for jobs once you complete the minimum threshold. Remember failed quest count in your minimum number but do decrease your performance.
 
**Features**

*Wage System*: 

The player will be paid at a certain time of the week depending on their salarty type (weekly, biweekly, or contract). Weekly payments happen every Friday or 5th day since joining. Biweekly payments happen every 10 days or 2nd Friday. Contract payments happen at the end of the contract, and is generally given to you by the client you worked for. The amount paid is not based on hours worked, instead every job will be given a base weekly payment that is increased by a percentage of itself based on your job position (intern, veteran, senior, chief, etc.) which will finally be added by a performance number. This performance number is generally 0, but if your job performance for the week is oustanding you can have extra added onto it, however, if your performance is unsatisfactory the number will be negative thus decreasing your wages. What this means is that you should have a decent pay that increases with promotions, but decreases if bad jobs are done.
 
*Performance Sytem*: 

Because the player is given a number of (failable) quests or random encounters in a day. Each job requires a certain number of quests completed to be concidered satifactory, by completing the bare minimum you will be concidered a good worker but will recieve not extra bonus pay. If you complete more quests than the amount concidered satisfactory then you will be concidered a wonderful worker and will recieve bonus pay. However, if you fail more quests than what is concidered satisfactory you will be concidered a poor worker and will recieve less pay because of it.
 
*Promotion System*:

 If your character has consistently high performances each week, then eventually the player's character will state to him/herself (see still no bias) that they should ask about getting a promotion. This will start a quest that will have your character speak to his/her employer about getting a higher standing within their job, this will lead to them getting promoted, a different title, and new benefits. If you have a high enough position you can even request to have your salary type changed (for weekly and biweekly jobs only).
 
*Benefits*:

When you get hired for a job your character is given what is called a benefit. Benefits range differently depending on the type of job your character has, for example a guard may get decrease buying prices within his hold, prepaid inn expenses, and/or free food for breakfast, lunch and dinner (great for those primary need mods). These benefits can increase in what they allow based on your job position (for example as a regular guard you may get a 15% buying decrease in your hold and free in expenses, however a senior guard will bet a 55% decrease along with the house of Breezehome for his benefit).
 
*Firing/Quitting System*: 

Of course like any job in the real-world you can be fired from your job. Getting fired occurs if you recieve to much negative performance consitently for weeks. This can happen by failing quests a lot or showing up to work late consistenly. When this occurs you will recieve a letter detailing you to go to your employer who will strip away your titles, and give you are quick farewell and some leaving cash. Of course if you decide that you no longer want to be Treasure Hunter for archeologists and the winterhold college, you can always quit and become a farmer.
 
*Resume*: 

You will be given a resume at the start of the game by opening it you will be asked a series of questions that will help determine your characters personality (introverted, violent, extroverted, shy, etc.) as well as documenting your current skill levels. Once that is completed you will be given a quest to apply for a job, in this quest the player will find an employer for a job that they want in this example I will use a guard job. The player will go to the guard recruiter and ask if show them their resume. Each job has a certain skill bar that you need to have ( don't expect to be an alchemist if your skill in alchemy is just 10) and in some cases personality traits (a loner will probably not do so well as a soldier in a regiment, but may be well suited for being a hunter). If your character passes these skill bars and personality bars then they will qualify for the job and get it. To prevent players from abusing the system and just changing their skills mid game (you console hackers) the recruiter will periodically ask your for the resume to see your updated skills (so update it frequently). 
 
**DISCLAIMER**

This is understandably a very ambitious project and certain features may or may not be doable with the creationkit. Also I am a full time computer science student currently taking: Computer System Fundamentals, Programming III, Data Structures, and Database Management so know that my schoolwork and grades come first before skyrim modding. Know that I do not expect to complete the mod this month or the next and am instead aiming for an early to mid summer release. Please bear with me if you see notice that I have not posted any updates in a while, I am probably still alive but am just busy slowly torturing myself with math. ;D

I will post, my modding updates here. This is basically a copy paste of a Nexus forums post I posted a while back, but haven't updated it due to work, school, and life, I am much more active on the reddit anyway so I will make all posts here!

If you want to help with the mod, provide suggestions on jobs, or the quests you may want to see in a job. Also know that in the coming months I may be looking out for voice actors to fill in the silence!

Thank you for taking the time to read the post!

46rufr,2,2016-02-20,Why can I not decide what I want to do?,gooby_pls2,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/46rufr/why_can_i_not_decide_what_i_want_to_do/,"Disclaimer- I am 17 years old, and this is all over the place.
 
Since my freshman year of high school, I've tried to find what it is I would love to do for the rest of my life. My logic is/was that if I found that in high school, I could get an early start on whatever my passion turned out to be and maybe become great at it. Reading around, it seems like starting when I did was even too late, as a ton of great people started before they hit double digits. I played soccer for 12 years, I still do. I played competitively for about 4 years and last year I transferred from a team I had played on for 9 years into one of the top teams in my state and in the nation only to find that I had loved playing with that team more than I loved playing soccer. Except I don't even know if that's true, I think I might've just loved to be the best. Either way, after years of training hard outside of ""regular"" practice to become better and better, I gave up in only six months on that team because I dreaded going to practice so much that I would go so far as to drive all the way there only to decide I was sick. I don't know if this means soccer isn't my passion, but if it is, I fear it is too late now. It seemingly was always too late for me in soccer- I went competitive a year late, my birthday was in the later part of the year so I was younger than most people, and I never really got into it until that final year. I love the sport but even if I did want to do it for the rest of my life I don't think that's an option now, and I am not backing down from it, or I don't believe I am. I just truly don't think that is what I wanted out of life or not what I want now. Maybe I'm wrong. I do miss it but when I finally got off of that team it was such a weight lifted off of my chest. I think it was definitely for the best, the combination of that and my situation with various relationships at the time was spiraling me towards depression (I believe at least, this was a self-diagnosis completely). I'm not normally a sad person, reading this you might think I sound like I suck but I just want to make it clear that I am very happy, almost all the time. I'm just worried, because I cannot live a ""normal"" life and be satisfied. I don't think I am a special snowflake or anything along those lines, I just can't imagine ever feeling like I didn't miss out on life if I accepted some regular office job.             Anyways, afterwards I tried to find something else I loved to do. My dad works in Investor Relations for a big company, so I began to learn about the stock market. Every day, I would come home from school and  educate myself on economics and the workings of the stock market. My plan was to become some big-name, incredibly successful investment banker, hedge-fund manager, or something along those lines. But I knew deep down I didn't care at all about the stock market or investing, I just wanted to be rich and after landing an internship and discovering that I absolutely hated it, I dropped that as well. Then, I learned about  music production. I began to produce music on my own and I really thought I had found it, I love music so much, I listen to it constantly. I was taking hours out of every day to listen to two new albums a day and use the notes I took on the production and any samples I thought were worth trying to flip into a new sound to make my own beats. Then I thought I should get into singing and rapping over my own beats (I am white and live in Suburbia, which definitely will affect how I am perceived in the industry). That is where I am at now, and I feel like I have spread myself so thin. I just don't even know if I like music production. I really do love rapping, but 17 is a very late start to what is sure to be a massive uphill battle of a career and that's if I can even begin to develop some sort of technical skill. I really thought I would have to bring in my own sort of production style like Kanye did to really stand out and make people pay attention to me in the music industry.
       Now I feel like I want to go into stand-up comedy. I love funny things, I've been told I am very funny by people who know me well and those who don't, I've watched countless stand-up specials and I am confident in my sense of humor. I love being funny and I know I love being funny but I just don't know if I can give up music, giving up another ""passion"" again for something I might start to get tired of in six months. And I'm scared because I don't even know where to start, I can't think of ways to practice stand-up other than watching it and writing it. I've never liked to do anything you can't practice because I like to think I am making myself better at whatever it is I love to do. I don't want to try making music and comedy, though I do love Bo Burnham, because I don't think I have enough talent in either area to be able to successfully divide my time between the two. To be clear, these aren't the only things I have tried, well, I haven't really tried stand-up, but I have tried things like programming, cooking, writing, even playing video games professionally(this didn't go very far because the time investment was just not worth it to me to spend the rest of my life in front of a screen). To be honest, I haven't found anything I would love to do if I thought I couldn't get rich from it. I've read countless self-help books (reminder that I do have friends and do have fun) and explored being an entrepreneur. I'm happy with how I look and with the relationships in my life. I just want to know what I want to do. To top it all off, I try very hard in school and do quite well, but I don't know why because I have never felt passionate about anything academic, which would be so nice because it sounds much more structured to me. All of my ""passions"" seem to involve such high risk and reward ratios. I know the top comment for this post, if there is one, is going to be something along the lines of ""calm down, you have plenty of time"" but I don't want to calm down, nor do I feel like I really have plenty of time. We have such limited time to make any kind of impact, or even have any fun with our lives, not meant in a morbid way, but like ""why not get started now?"" It really is important to me to be great at something and the longer I take to find that thing the less likely it is that I will be great. Anyways, sorry for the mess of a post this is, the run-on sentences, over-using commas, formatting, grammar, etc. I just need that off my chest and if anyone has any sort of advice or wisdom or anything I would love to hear it because I am lost right now. Thanks for reading."
46s19k,0,2016-02-20,"First year comp sci student, what can I start doing on my own to have enough experience for an internship as soon as possible?",coltsarethebest,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/46s19k/first_year_comp_sci_student_what_can_i_start/,"Hi, 
   So I'm a first year comp sci student at a fairly highly ranked uni(top 25 in the world- although I know this doesn't mean anything really). I'm halfway through my first comp sci class and doing very well(80 average 90+ in my comp sci course), but since it is in a stripped down functional language I know I need to start learning a real language on the side. I really want to get an internship as soon as I have enough experience, so I'd like to know the best route to take outside of classes.

I am interested in learning swift and making iOS apps but from what I've read(on this sub/elsewhere) it seems like Java/c/c++ are more sought after for internships? Is this true? I will be taking a Java course next term so maybe it would be smarter to put all my effort into that? Or would it be better to know both? 

Also, at what point should I start applying for internships and not be wasting my time?


Thanks so much!"
46s38d,82,2016-02-20,"20 year-old engineering student from Ontario. I hate everything, I am bad at everything, I don't know what to do. I am so lost.",jesuispas,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/46s38d/20_yearold_engineering_student_from_ontario_i/,"I am in year 2 of Electrical Engineering (EE) at my uni. My whole world is falling apart. I don't like anything anymore, I don't have the energy, the motivation or the intelligence. 

I used to be a somewhat exceptional student a couple years back in high school. I have always been very depressed and did not have the luxuries of many other youth (social life, good friends, money). I have always been socially awkward and anxious. So ever since grade 2, I've been basing my self-worth from my performance at school. That's been pretty great until I came to university. 

Alone, hundreds of miles away from family, I'd started to struggle. I managed to complete two semesters with good averages and managed to get 2 internships (which were irrelevant to my degree). Currently, I am back at school and I can't do it anymore. My grades are flunking, and I am beginning to realize that all my effort in school will come to mean nothing. I don't have any passion. I will most probably crash and burn this semester and lose all confidence. I might not be able to finish my degree due to my crippling depression. I probably will never get a good job in a field I like (I don't like EE and I don't know what I like or if I like anything). I will end up disappointing my parents and likely eventually ostracized by them. Then, I'll be alone and isolated for the entirety of my remaining existence.

Maybe I am not articulating this right, but I feel I'd built a shell to protect myself from my depression and innermost fears about life. Now the shell is broken, and I don't think I'll be able to handle it.

I am not going to commit suicide or anything, but I just wish I wasn't me.

TLDR; I have no passion, no friends, no happiness. Used academics to build wall around myself and that wall is now broken. I feel crushed."
46skrk,1,2016-02-20,Really want to work on myself but feel like I can't,ps1203,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/46skrk/really_want_to_work_on_myself_but_feel_like_i_cant/,"I'm a college student who has had problems with MDD and GAD since high school. I also have SLE and I'd like to get reevaluated for ADHD-PI (unfortunately every time I got screened the pros always said it was my MDD and GAD that was clouding my brain, but I really do think ADHD medication will help me focus).

I really wish I could take a break from life and work on all my health issues. I feel like I can't though, because I spent most of my high school days in bed at home and went through a remedial program my senior year to get my diploma on time. My family says now I have to continually apply myself and be in college full-time, that I had enough time to ""screw around"" in high school. 

The last few years, I noticed I don't have problems with easy classes, but when I take a difficult class like biology, chemistry, calculus, accounting...all my symptoms trigger.
So for the most part I haven't been getting treatment since graduating high school because I've been doing all right. Now I think I haven't solved my issues really. Though, I'm not sure if there is a cure for disorders?

Other reasons why I feel like I can't are because everyone else is moving forward and if I stop I'll be moving backwards. Everyone around me is graduating, getting jobs, leadership, internships, scholarships, awards, etc. I only have enough energy to attend class and put in enough effort to complete assignments and projects. Forget about having good study habits and work ethic for exams :( (which I really wish I could fix in a snap).

Ok, rant over."
46sla6,2,2016-02-20,Wanting to leave my PhD program. Mistake?,Tmrmcc,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/46sla6/wanting_to_leave_my_phd_program_mistake/,"Now I know only I can decide what to do with my life; I am just hoping to get some outside perspective.

So here's the scoop. I graduated with my BS in Biochemistry May of 2015 - almost a year ago. I started working in a lab specializing in plant biochemistry/metabolomics as an undergraduate Jan. of 2014 so all in all I went into grad school with a little over a year of lab experience. It was very good experience as well; very hands-on from the very beginning and I was given my own project and was able to work fairly autonomously. There was even promise of a first-author publication from my research, although the manuscript is still in the works.

I felt pressured into graduate school. I knew from the very beginning that I had no desire to go into academia but from the endeavors of my colleagues I convinced myself that getting a PhD would be the next logical route and would be a jumpstart for a solid industry career. But honestly, I chose grad school as the next step because I did not know what else to do or what I wanted to do with my life (I know, one of the worst reasons to go for a PhD!). I guess I convinced myself that I was passionate about plant biochemistry so that is what I stuck with. I applied to 5 PhD programs and interviewed and was accepted in to 4/5. Do to the nature of my personal life (serious relationship etc.) I chose to stay at my undergraduate institution and join a program which actually housed my undergraduate lab. Much of the pressure I felt to go to grad school and, specifically, join this particular program, was from my undergrad advisor actually. 

Since I’ve been here, I’ve been looking for reasons to stay, and something to be passionate about. But it is just not happening for me. I am finishing up my third rotation and I’ve realized that none of them felt like a good fit for me. My first rotation advisor gave me no direction and left me floundering while expecting me to develop an LC-MS method with no prior method development experience. No one in the lab was experienced enough working with this specific piece of equipment as well to give me much useful help. It was 8 weeks of pulling teeth and feeling unproductive. I really liked the advisor and lab members of my second rotation, and gained some good much needed molecular biology experience but I was very uninterested in the overall scope of the research.

I was really hoping that my final rotation would go better than it has been but it has been the least productive yet, and I do not really like the lab atmosphere. It has been 5 weeks and I’ve yet to do any lab work. There is a policy that you are not allowed to do any experiments until you watch someone perform the experiment, do the experiment together, and then have the experienced person watch you. Great! I think that is a great idea! But there has been ~0 structure regarding making this happen. As a result, I have been learning nothing aside from the 4-5 papers I have been reading each week. And that has grown very old, very fast. Oh, I guess I should mention too that the program I am in is very unique in that classwork is very deemphasized. We are only required to take 1 class (period; not per semester), and are encouraged to take only what we feel will fill any necessary gaps to reach our career goals. I probably would have been better suited for something with more structure…

Since I started in this program, I had been questioning myself as to whether or not it was the right decision to go to grad school. But I wanted to give my rotations a chance and try to find somewhere to see myself for the next 5 years. But I just can’t. I see the passions and experiences of the other students in my program, and most of them have a Master’s already, took some time to work after undergrad, or had an internship prior to starting in this program. I just do not see myself as being ready for the commitment needed to be a successful PhD candidate.

Finally, my boyfriend of 4 years and I are planning to get engaged in the next couple of months and he will likely be moving after he finishes his Master’s in Mechanical Engineering. If he has his way, he wants to move to the SF Bay area. I obviously do not want this to be a deciding factor in my career choices, but keeping this in mind along with everything else, it is really starting to feel like the perfect time to work in industry for a bit and then see where the wind takes us before I commit to anything else. I feel like I can spend time in a more structured 8-5/9-5 work setting and really reflect on how I want my career to take shape and maybe even go back to school later on. 

I’m almost certain at this point that quitting is the way to go for me, but I am curious to see what others think. Am I just getting swept up by imposter syndrome? Maybe I am just looking for validation, I don't know. Thank you for reading.

Disclaimer: some rant ahead.


**My background:**

I'm a 21 year old electrical engineering student in one of Canada's top 3 engineering schools. I have excellent grades; my GPA is 3.91/4.00, I'm one of the directors of my school's robotic club.  I got an incredibly interesting internship after my first year with a professor who went to MIT and that's been ""coaching"" me since then, a part-time university research job in robotics for this year, as well as another internship for this summer and an interview with the Canadian Space Agency, which most people would kill for (metaphorically of course) and multiple studying bursaries (not sure that's the right word in english?)

I have very good friends and a great close family. People usually say I'm very smart and think I'm relatively funny. I sincerely think I look decent and I've been working out 3-5 times a week for the last year. 


**I have pretty much anything I could want...yet I still feel incredibly lonely and pretty much unhappy**

I don't think I'm particularly burnt out or anything. I recently started playing guitar again after 5 years of not playing trying to see if I'd like to get back into it. 


I think I might just feel lonely (haven't really been with a girl in about 2 years now) and I think it gets to me. I know people say you have to learn to be happy by yourself before you can be happy with someone else and that's one of the reasons I've been alone for a while now (been working on myself a lot); however I don't really feel much better. I'm trying to get out there more and meeting new people, but it's kinda hard to meet interesting women as an engineering student.



I'm not sure what to do to feel better. I honestly don't really know why I feel that way.

**TL;DR** Have pretty much anything I could want, yet still unhappy. Wat do?

Have any of you been through a similar situation where you were unhappy without really knowing why? How did you get through it?

Thanks a lot! Hoping this is an okay place to talk about it, I don't feel like I really have anyone to talk about stuff like this in real life."

Recently, I went through a rough break up with my girlfriend of 3.5 years who I've been with since high school. I really appreciate the time we had together, but juggling my commitment to her with classes, internships, and staying close to friends that go to Texas State, I became complacent with not becoming a part of this great community in UT Austin.

Now with so little time left in my career, I am looking for advice for joining student organizations for meeting friends and, possibly, even try dating in the college scene. As for what type of organizations I'm looking for... um... try me? A few things about me: I'm a Christian, I love STEM, sports, and video games, I'm honestly kinda funny sometimes, I love volunteering when I can, and I want to start going to parties.

I'm leaning towards IT, because computers are something I feel like I have a passion for.

I feel like I'm somewhat proficient with computers; I'm usually the go-to person in my family if grandma is having computer problems (google is the solution, 9 times out of 10), and I recently finished my own personal rig, which I had a blast doing. 

Now, having sort of the minimal experience that I've had, where would be some good places to pick up a bit more knowledge? Cybersecurity, massive computer infrastructures, and things of the sort really interest me, but I know *nothing* about them. 

I know there's going to be internships and college (and that time is coming along for me quite soon) but I have no idea where to start prior to that point. I'd like to brush up a bit more before then and get ahead of the curve.

So, what would you guys recommend?"

The third (and last) year of my degree, however, is lingering on my mind, and I would really like to finish it.

However, that's proving to be difficult. My university doesn't offer much in the way of timetable flexibility, and though they record lectures there's things like workshops, tutorials, etc. that I'd miss out on due to it being in the middle of the work day. Additionally, I've discovered that there's a *lot* of group-work assignments in all of my third year classes, and I feel like I'd be hindering my team mates by not being present for some of the class content.

I've been considering transferring to a university that does a lot of online/distance content, such as [Deakin University](http://www.deakin.edu.au/study-at-deakin/find-a-course/computer-science) or [Charles Sturt University](http://www.csu.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-computer-science) (I'm Australian). I'm not sure about the quality of these courses/universities, though, or if the ""prestige"" of an institution even matters, particularly when I'll have a few years work experience up my sleeve by the time I finish.  Problem here is that I'm not sure how much credit will transfer over and things like that, so it might increase the time I have left at uni.

tl;dr: Stay at my local university and deal with the stress of missing out on course content, or change to a more distance education-friendly university and possibly stretch out my degree a little longer? Or something else?"

46v5f9,7,2016-02-21,Typical Teenager issue..?,gooby_pls2,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/46v5f9/typical_teenager_issue/,"Disclaimer- I am 17 years old, and this is all over the place.
Since my freshman year of high school, I've tried to find what it is I would love to do for the rest of my life. My logic is/was that if I found that in high school, I could get an early start on whatever my passion turned out to be and maybe become great at it. Reading around, it seems like starting when I did was even too late, as a ton of great people started before they hit double digits. I played soccer for 12 years, I still do. I played competitively for about 4 years and last year I transferred from a team I had played on for 9 years into one of the top teams in my state and in the nation only to find that I had loved playing with that team more than I loved playing soccer. Except I don't even know if that's true, I think I might've just loved to be the best. Either way, after years of training hard outside of ""regular"" practice to become better and better, I gave up in only six months on that team because I dreaded going to practice so much that I would go so far as to drive all the way there only to decide I was sick. I don't know if this means soccer isn't my passion, but if it is, I fear it is too late now. It seemingly was always too late for me in soccer- I went competitive a year late, my birthday was in the later part of the year so I was younger than most people, and I never really got into it until that final year. I love the sport but even if I did want to do it for the rest of my life I don't think that's an option now, and I am not backing down from it, or I don't believe I am. I just truly don't think that is what I wanted out of life or not what I want now. Maybe I'm wrong. I do miss it but when I finally got off of that team it was such a weight lifted off of my chest. I think it was definitely for the best, the combination of that and my situation with various relationships at the time was spiraling me towards depression (I believe at least, this was a self-diagnosis completely). I'm not normally a sad person, reading this you might think I sound like I suck but I just want to make it clear that I am very happy, almost all the time. I'm just worried, because I cannot live a ""normal"" life and be satisfied. I don't think I am a special snowflake or anything along those lines, I just can't imagine ever feeling like I didn't miss out on life if I accepted some regular office job. Anyways, afterwards I tried to find something else I loved to do. My dad works in Investor Relations for a big company, so I began to learn about the stock market. Every day, I would come home from school and educate myself on economics and the workings of the stock market. My plan was to become some big-name, incredibly successful investment banker, hedge-fund manager, or something along those lines. But I knew deep down I didn't care at all about the stock market or investing, I just wanted to be rich and after landing an internship and discovering that I absolutely hated it, I dropped that as well. Then, I learned about music production. I began to produce music on my own and I really thought I had found it, I love music so much, I listen to it constantly. I was taking hours out of every day to listen to two new albums a day and use the notes I took on the production and any samples I thought were worth trying to flip into a new sound to make my own beats. Then I thought I should get into singing and rapping over my own beats (I am white and live in Suburbia, which definitely will affect how I am perceived in the industry). That is where I am at now, and I feel like I have spread myself so thin. I just don't even know if I like music production. I really do love rapping, but 17 is a very late start to what is sure to be a massive uphill battle of a career and that's if I can even begin to develop some sort of technical skill. I really thought I would have to bring in my own sort of production style like Kanye did to really stand out and make people pay attention to me in the music industry. Now I feel like I want to go into stand-up comedy. I love funny things, I've been told I am very funny by people who know me well and those who don't, I've watched countless stand-up specials and I am confident in my sense of humor. I love being funny and I know I love being funny but I just don't know if I can give up music, giving up another ""passion"" again for something I might start to get tired of in six months. And I'm scared because I don't even know where to start, I can't think of ways to practice stand-up other than watching it and writing it. I've never liked to do anything you can't practice because I like to think I am making myself better at whatever it is I love to do. I don't want to try making music and comedy, though I do love Bo Burnham, because I don't think I have enough talent in either area to be able to successfully divide my time between the two. To be clear, these aren't the only things I have tried, well, I haven't really tried stand-up, but I have tried things like programming, cooking, writing, even playing video games professionally(this didn't go very far because the time investment was just not worth it to me to spend the rest of my life in front of a screen). To be honest, I haven't found anything I would love to do if I thought I couldn't get rich from it. I've read countless self-help books (reminder that I do have friends and do have fun) and explored being an entrepreneur. I'm happy with how I look and with the relationships in my life. I just want to know what I want to do. To top it all off, I try very hard in school and do quite well, but I don't know why because I have never felt passionate about anything academic, which would be so nice because it sounds much more structured to me. All of my ""passions"" seem to involve such high risk and reward ratios. I know the top comment for this post, if there is one, is going to be something along the lines of ""calm down, you have plenty of time"" but I don't want to calm down, nor do I feel like I really have plenty of time. We have such limited time to make any kind of impact, or even have any fun with our lives, not meant in a morbid way, but like ""why not get started now?"" It really is important to me to be great at something and the longer I take to find that thing the less likely it is that I will be great. Anyways, sorry for the mess of a post this is, the run-on sentences, over-using commas, formatting, grammar, etc. I just need that off my chest and if anyone has any sort of advice or wisdom or anything I would love to hear it because I am lost right now. Thanks for reading."
46v8y4,66,2016-02-21,The lives of white people,adminscantbanme,european,https://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/46v8y4/the_lives_of_white_people/,"Be born. Play a little. Go to school. Do well, get high grades. Start receiving homework, spend most of your days studying. Learn about all the evils caused by white people around the world. In the weekends, drink alcohol. Go to college. Pick a useful major or a useless one. Learn more about all the bad things white people, males and heterosexuals did. Alternatively, spend your days staring at numbers on a screen. In the weekends, drink more alcohol and mingle with the right people. With a glass on wine in your hand, learn the correct opinions to have from your peers, to appear like your family is part of the middle class. Don't disagree with them. 

Build up a debt. Go abroad for a summer to some third world country, so that you have something to put on your resume. Watch local people behave self-destructive and cruel towards each other, tell yourself they behave like this because they're uneducated. Build a well that gets taken over by the local warlord by the time you're in your plane back home, or babysit some orphans so that the local staff can sit around procrastinating. Feel like you made a difference. Graduate. Do an internship, watch your debt grow further, hope you find an actual job. 

Look in the mirror, see that you're aging. Realize you're an adult now in the eyes of children, whether you like it or not. Use a dating site for ""educated"" people. Put up a photograph of you in the third world country with some random local children, to show you're a good person. Drink overpriced coffee with a bunch of people you never see again. The algorithm finally ends up introducing you to someone who ""fits"" you. Tell yourself it feels the way as your first crush did. Move in together. Buy a dog or a cat. Post pictures on Facebook, watch your friends and family jokingly refer to the pet as your ""child"". Feel unnerved for a moment, but decide to disregard it.

Realize the two of you tend to get into arguments when you see each other too much. Start working longer days, to get increasingly more money. Don't go home in the evenings but stay at work instead, because you don't want to confront the emptiness. Have a threatening encounter in public transport, decide to commute solely by car from now on, even though it violates your principles. Tell yourself that these youths would never have bothered you if they had better job and education opportunities. Buy a house together in a surprisingly white neighborhood. Tell your acquaintances you chose to live here because you like the ""quietness"".

Delay having children, as it would harm your careers, which the two of you now derive your self-worth from, or delay having children because you're not sure whether or not the two of you really fit together. Perhaps one of the two of you doesn't feel happy in their career and goes back to college to get a particular master's degree which gets you a job that's more fulfilling or better paying. Go on a bunch of overly expensive journeys together to far away places. Hope that spending a lot of money makes the work feel rewarding, find out it doesn't. Realize you're forty and miserable. Decide to have a child after all. It takes longer than you thought it would, but eventually pregnancy results. Hope the child doesn't have autism/down syndrome/something else that could happen because you waited too long. 

Take a few weeks off work. Decide to officially get married after all. Go back to working, send the child to a daycare. Feel guilty when the kid starts to cry one morning because he doesn't want to go but wants to stay home with mommy instead. Spend every weekend from that point on engaged in ""quality time"", which typically means going bowling or playing minigolf. Look in the mirror again, feel old. Spend thousands of dollar on cosmetic surgery, or spend thousands of dollars on a motorcycle/big boat/big car. 

Finally get that prestigious management function you were hoping to get. Hear that your company is going to merge. Get laid off. Find out that the ""network"" of colleagues you thought you had built up couldn't care less about you. Spend months desperately applying for anything you can find. End up with something far less prestigious, feel embarrassed when you meet old acquaintances. Wave your child goodbye as they head out to college. Live frugally until retirement. Realize you have a bunch of money now. Go to a bunch of overly expensive bed and breakfast hotels together. Have a nasty fall, break something. 

Decide to stay at home more. Notice one of the houses in your street is now rented out to immigrants. Look online, find out the other houses in your neighborhood are sold for surprisingly low prices. Watch TV. Don't go out a lot, because you feel scared outside. Realize all you have to look forward to on a typical day is your favorite TV show. Discover your pension is cut because the stock market performed worse than anticipated. Step over the guilt, vote for the party white trash normally votes for, that you used to make fun of at the office parties years ago. 

Watch more TV. You start to forget things, but the two of you laugh it off.  Call your child, ask for help with the remote control. Call again. Receive a very simple cell phone and a very simple remote control. Realize your child is annoyed when you call again. Go out in the middle of night to ""go to the supermarket"". Get locked in your house. Forget to turn the gas off while cooking. Go on a journey with your child and your spouse. Figure out you they left you at a nursing home. Get into an argument with your spouse because you wish they'd visit more often. Wonder why your child rarely visits. Have a moment of lucidity, realize your child went off to college in another city and decided to stay there because they found a job there. Realize the cycle repeats itself. Die."

46vq7j,3,2016-02-21,"My experience with ""The Creative Group.""",penguinzrocknroll,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/46vq7j/my_experience_with_the_creative_group/,"**This is a LONG rant**

Okay, so a bit of backstory about myself. I graduated last December (2015)  from William Paterson University in NJ. My degree is a Bachelor’s of Studio Arts with a concentration in Graphic Design. I also graduated with a 3.5 GPA if it matters.

Anyway, after graduating I obviously began looking around for jobs in my field on all the job searching websites like: Indeed, Monster, Dice, Snag a job, Career Builder, Zipfile, Simplyhired, and even Craig’s List. After a few months of applying and having no responses, I get very discouraged and begin to stress myself a bit. So I contact my school’s career services in hopes that they might give me advice or even place me in an internship or something like that (the “career services” website claims that they “provide employment and mentoring connections” which I can now say is untrue) . The only thing the career services helped me do is help me figure out how to word my resume and also update it so it’s current.

 The career adviser then recommended me to a place called “The Creative Group.” For those of you who don’t know, The Creative Group is a “recruiting agency” that helps place people in the art and design field with companies that their skills suit. So, my career adviser recommended me to The Creative Group of Saddle Brook NJ and  this lady named Kara, saying that she had connections with the college or something like that. So I emailed and called Kara for about a month before giving up because she never contact me back, It was only later on when I began to complain to them that I found out that Kara was on sick leave and only recently came back. And I was like wtf? Even the receptionist failed to mention that Kara wasn’t in and she didn’t offer to connect me to anyone else, instead I was leaving voicemails and emails in a person’s mailbox that wasn’t there! So fast forward a few months later, I’m still applying on my own through various job sites and attempting to freelance through Fiverr because I don’t know what else to do. Then, I get a call from The Creative Group from a different recruiter, her name was Megan. She tells me that she saw my resume online through some job finding website and was interested in talking with me in person about my qualifications and such. Obviously, I was excited to hear back from them, even if it was from a different person. So I set up to interview with Megan at the most convenient time for the both of us. I believe that the interview went over pretty well, Megan explained how The Creative Group works and how people get placed/picked for a certain job and it seemed to make sense. So I pretty much emailed her every week or every other week asking if she had anything available for me or jobs that sounded interesting to me on The Creative Group Website. She would rarely reply..and it got to the point where she didn’t respond anymore: no phone calls or emails, even though I regularly tried to get in contact with her. 

It got so bad, that I tried to reach out to a different branch of The Creative Group (In Woodbridge NJ)  just so I can talk to or get help from anyone else. Still, the results where the same, they rarely pick up their phones and almost never email you back. So, now I was dealing with two branches with the same exact results. I was really stressing myself out at this point, I was still applying to jobs on my own, only to get rejected or never called back and it felt like The Creative Group wasn’t helping me in the slightest. As a side note, before I contacted The Creative Group of Woodbridge I remember applying to a company called Winco through Indeed, they called me in for an interview and tested me on my skills with Photoshop and InDesign (I guess I was too slow with InDesign because they never called me back).. Why do I mention this? It’s because when I called the Woodbridge Creative Group, the lady, her name was Kristin asked me if I had any interviews recently. I told her about Winco, and she asked if I got that interview through the Creative Group.. Implying that job posting was in their system, but no one at the Saddle Brook Creative Group told me about it...so I told her that I found it through Indeed.
 
Continuing the story, I’m so stressed out about not having a job in my field, I’m pretty much crying myself to sleep or waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety, applying to any full time  jobs through all the job posting websites I mentioned because I can’t fall back asleep. I pretty much call The Creative Group asking to speak to the manager, his name is Sam,  and I try to hold back my tears as I explain to him all the stuff that has happened to me so far. He seems sympathetic and asks me to send my resume to him so he can mention it to all his employees and maybe they can do something about it (what a joke). I also begin contacting the complaints department for the Creative Group to complain about the Saddle Brook branch because it is the one I have dealt with the most. So the complaints department process your complaint and sends it up to corporate and someone SHOULD contact you within about 3-5 business days… So..does anyone want to guess what happened? Well.. I contacted the complaint department for a whole month (calling them once every week) because I never heard back from corporate..like ever. I even asked the people who were processing my complaints if they had the number for corporate because I was tired of complaining to them and getting nowhere.

 I was also talking to Sam a lot asking him what I should do and complaining to him about his employees Kara and Megan. It was at this point that I learned that Kara was on sick leave and Megan no longer dealt with placing people as freelance and only did “salaried” people, which meant like you had to be hired by The Creative Group first before they could place you. So obviously, I asked Sam why I couldn’t be hired by The Creative Group and be placed as salaried because I was looking for a full time job anyway.. He gave me some stupid excuse that I don’t really remember. I also remember telling him that I had a part time job, and he had the gall to tell me that it might be because of my part time job (in retail)  that I’m not getting any callbacks from his recruiters. He goes on to explain that companies want someone who can start right away (aka: you’re unemployed). 

I still think his excuse is bullshit. Anyway after a bit more complaining I get to talk to the manager of Robert Half (The Creative Group is part of Robert Half..this was in Saddle Brook too). His name was Rory, I sent him my resume, but the same result, I have yet to hear from anyone. The funny thing is around this time, I actually decided to look up their reviews on Yelp and saw that I wasn’t the only one that was very dissatisfied with them. Other people complained of the same thing: No one picked up their phones no matter how much or when they called, that they were never told that the recruiter they were calling left or was sick so they left voicemails for weeks, etc. There’s also this lady named Gretel on yelp, apologizing to people about their terrible experience with the creative group. She’s a customer service rep, however instead of reaching out to you, she asks you to forward your info to her so you can speak with the president or whatever. I don’t really know how to forward info on yelp, so I haven’t done anything..Though based on the negative reviews...I’m not going to bother.

 So a year, later I finally wised up and gave up on The Creative Group, I have a possible job opportunity lined up for myself right now. Obviously I found it on my own, I’m just praying that the 2nd interview goes as well as the first did. "

I've gotten admits from A&amp;M and Virginia Tech so far, I applied for the MS EE program. I believe they're both very strong in terms of power electronics research, but A&amp;M is ranked higher overall (like #12 for graduate EE rankings), while Virginia Tech is ranked #21 (or something close to that). 

I wanted to aim for R&amp;D or design after school, like Sandia or Los Alamos National Labs. However, after comparing the career fair companies between the two, the National labs that visit VTech are slightly different than the ones that visit A&amp;M (VTech has like Lincoln Labs and Oak Ridge, east coast lab stuff). I'm not sure if this is a regional thing or if I'm going to lose opportunities by attending VTech over A&amp;M. Does anyone have any insight in regards to this?

The reason I'm considering VTech is because they offered me a Bradley Master's fellowship that covers all tuition/fees, and a graduate TA position with stipend (24.3k). Both are good for 2 years as long as I maintain a 3.5 grad GPA and find my thesis advisor (I applied for a thesis for all schools) by the second semester. Does this seem reasonable in terms of the requirements? I'm sorry if this comes off as a stupid question, I'm not really familiar with this.

One thing that kinda put me off A&amp;M is during the graduate invitational (when they invite down their ""top pick"" US students for a campus/lab tour), I was having trouble asking to just volunteer in a lab. The professors don't seem to want to deal with Master's students, even if we applied for a thesis option and were accepted already. I was going to self fund A&amp;M (and I still expect to if I choose to attend), and all the current graduate students recommended us getting on our thesis projects/advisors ASAP due to just the competitiveness of just finding one. I was seriously considering going to a nonthesis at A&amp;M just because of how much difficulty I had at the graduate invitational just to ask for a volunteer position to help out in the lab (and hopefully contribute while getting a good idea for a thesis).

About myself: I did my BSEE at UT Austin, 3.6, graduated in 3 years as of last Spring, have been at Texas Instruments since. I have no research experience and did two internships at HP.

Cliffs: Is VTech worth the incentive due to the fellowship? They seem to want me more but I'm wondering if I'm shutting out opportunities by attending a (slightly) lower ranked school. Is the difference minimal and I'm just overthinking it?

If it matters, I've also been accepted by ASU and Michigan Ann Arbor so far. No way in hell I can afford either of those two though (Texas resident, and Michigan is 45k out of state just for tuition).

Thank you for taking the time to read this!

I presently live in upstate New York in a region where the economy collapsed in the early 1970's. Seventy percent of the population in my hometown is on some form of public assistance. I learned systems programming on my own (had little to no income, couldn't afford school, have no degree, and couldn't afford to relocate). When I was in my late thirties, a project at one of the top research labs in Japan needed help on a system I had become familiar with, so I solved a few things for them and they offered me a job. I stayed there fourteen years, had a lot of adventures, met some very close friends, and even married my favorite one...:-)  Given my experience with life, I figured the good times wouldn't last forever, so I decided to make up for lost time as best I could. I made an excellent salary there (to me at least).  For the thirteen years I was there, I saved 50% of my gross (not net !) income every year and banked it.

Sure enough, one day there was a management shakeup, and they replaced all the experienced lab personnel and scientists with cheap grad students and interns. Given that this was Japan and not the US, it was of dubious legality to say the least. I fought it for over a year with the help of a Japanese labor union and won a modest settlement. I was the only one who did.

My wife and I had to arrange for a permanent U.S. resident visa for her, an overseas household move to America from Japan as soon as possible, and find a place to stay when we arrived.

When my parents passed away years before, they left behind the family house. I had hoped to be able to use it until I could find a permanent place for my wife and I elsewhere. When I returned, I found that the remaining residents (family) had become hoarders years before, in addition to neglecting badly needed maintenance. The house had been virtually destroyed and was completely unfit. My wife and I had to stay in a hotel for several weeks until we could find a short term apartment. We stayed in the short term apartment for a month until we could rent a townhouse just outside the main part of my hometown, most of which had become unsafe to reside in during the years I was gone.

Immediately after arranging all this, I had to undertake a lengthy legal process finally resulting in a police raid and condemnation which forced the residents out for a year and a half. Shortly after, my wife's appendix burst and we had no medical insurance. (This was before ObamaCare). I had to pay cash for everything.
This area does not have reliable public transit, so I also had to buy a car. I had to pay cash for that, as I was not working and could not get a bank loan. Having been gone for so long, I also had to get a new driver's license from scratch, including driving school to get back up to speed. The old license had long since expired, and driving in Japan is not to be recommended.

The regional market is very slow.  The regional professional associations have just about all gone inactive or disbanded altogether so networking opportunities are challenging to come by, but I take advantage of every opportunity I can.  The closest active hacker/maker spaces are two hours drive or more from here,  which would be an interesting option for getting involved if they were closer.

I've been been back here for several years now. Despite being almost sixty, I'm not ready to retire from life and would like to stay useful.  I'm still looking for work but not really overwhelmed with offers.  I've still got most of our savings left, but I'm coming up somewhat short on ideas.

Thoughts would be greatly appreciated.....:-)

46w6og,3,2016-02-21,Finally got an offer for the summer! After months of applications and interviews I thought I would be excited for any relevant CS work... but I'm totally underwhelmed by this offer.,yonoyo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/46w6og/finally_got_an_offer_for_the_summer_after_months/,"Ok, to start off I am a Junior in a top 10 CS school looking for an internship. I have been applying since last summer and I've had a dozen or so interviews, most of which have been on campus through the career portal. Needless to say this has been a terrible process for me, as my GPA is kind of low (&lt;3.0) and I've had my two absolute hardest semester last fall and this spring. I had my 4 latest interviews last week, and I received my first offer ever yesterday! I said I would be grateful for absolutely ANY relevant work experience this summer, but I can't help but to feel underwhelmed.

First of all, the position is software testing and the starting pay is 10/hr. I am currently working a menial college sales job, where most of my coworkers are high school dropouts. I currently make 10/hr plus commission for every sale, so I will ultimately be taking a pay cut... I understand its software test at a small, newish company but many friends who are interning are pulling in 20+/hr. Would it be appropriate to ask for more starting, like 12/hr just so I don't have to take a cut? 

Also, they asked me if I wanted to quit my current job and start immediately, choosing my own hours during the semester. I'm interested in starting before summer, but I would like to get decisions from the other companies I interviewed with before I make any commitments. I already replied to the offer and asked for a deadline, requesting at least another month so that I can hear from the other companies. 

I guess I'm just asking if I'm handling this the right way. Either way, I will take the position because the experience is more relevant than my current sales job."
46xbgh,187,2016-02-21,BumHam: Something Borrowed,dumgril,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/46xbgh/bumham_something_borrowed/,"We did it guys, BumHam is gone, high fives all around. 


Well not really, he actually lived about 45 miles away but the Family thought it was best to give him a pre-paid bus pass rather than a vehicle. Gram paid for a telephone to be installed in his apartment so she could check on him and listen to him complain about walking to the bus and starving 'cause the cafeteria closed during his last class of the day.


Before long things got quiet and Gram was itching to meddle. 
""He had a girl there, his age this time, she wants to pay his bills that's okay"" Gram relayed over the phone tree with her Sisters. I think a small part of her was relieved but mostly she worried. ""The house was clean, they look happy. I did ask if she was knocked up, they laughed so that's a good sign.""


BumHam became a rare sight with his new girlfriend. BabyBro had graduated high school and got a job working with Uncle. MiddleBro was nearing a degree and was seeing to a local internship. Before long I was the only one stirring things up around the place making Gram sick thinking about me driving the property on an ATV Uncle had fixed up as my middle school graduation gift.    


In usual form BumBum called to interrupt the peace.


""He said they filed for a marriage certificate"" Uncle said teasingly ""Probably knocked her up.""


""Probably"" Gram agreed.


and they were right.


A bouncing baby meal ticket - er girl - again. 


At least, this time, BumHam was properly married and his wife wasn't without means. She dropped school to go full time at her job. Bummy continued going to classes, wanting to ""be home for the baby"" when it arrived. 


Just in case Gram collected what remained of the baby stuff from the previous encounter. A crib, stroller, the works. She hauled it out there and wished them luck, simultaneously marveling at the thought of them making it and bracing herself if they didn't. 


They did.


At first.


A year would pass, BumHam often came home for *visits* when the responsibilities of being a Husband and Father became too much. If he spent more than a day getting comfortable in front of the TV Gram would chase him out the door and to the bus stop with some pocket change and a scolding.


It became routine until one day Gram receives a call from the County Jail. 


In less than a month BumHam would serve time in Jail, have a restraining order placed against him, divorce papers served, and probation issued to his residence. Since being locked up for your own doing isn't a legitimate excuse for missing class and he had no job BumHam just beached his self in the apartment until the electricity went out and eviction proceedings went through. 


Gram gets another call from County, this time from a Sheriff Deputy, having been dispatched to remove BumHam from his place of residence. After being given the sob story about being on probation and unable to go elsewhere the Sheriff takes BH to the Manager's Office to call someone to take responsibility for him. After getting a hold of Bummy's Probation Officer she's on her way.


The two meet at his apartment, the Sheriff takes leave allowing the Officer to take over on the promise he'll have him out. With Gram in tow BumHam leads the way upstairs to get his things. The door sweeps a mound of discarded trash behind it, stopping short of the wall. BumHam is stepping on or over a carpet of trash around the living room. Neither her or the Probation Officer enter. 


Ham makes his way from a far room with an armload of clothes. 


""Is that everything?"" Gram asks concerned.


""I don't have a bag"" BumHam confesses.


Gram bulldozes through the mess and into the kitchen opening cupboards left and right. The place is empty with the exception of the trash. ""I'll be right back, is that okay?"" Gram asks the PO. He asks how long and she tells him she's running to the store next door. He nods and she's off. 


Returning with boxes of garbage bags, a broom, and a dust pan. She scoops whatever she can into the bags attempting to tidy the room with a ferocity while BH gathers his clothes in the bedroom. He settles for two bags full and decides he wants nothing more. By then Gram has accumilated four bags of her own in the living room to be discarded. BumHam begins to decend the stairs with his garbage bags and she asks, ""Where are you going?""


""I'm getting in the car"" he responds puzzled. 


""You're taking out this trash. Put your bags away and get back up here. She furiously sweeps to the PO's amazement and makes her way into the bathroom. ""Jeezus Christ"" she can be heard muttering. 


""What we gotta' clean up for?"" BH asks upon entering ""They're just gonna throw it all out anyway.""


""Because goddamn you, this is *your* mess, how embarassing"" she says poking her head out the door to emphasize that her eyebrows are knotted.


""They're probably going to charge you for clean up anyway, maybe you don't want to spend your time here"" the PO reasons.
Despite herself, Gram agrees he's probably right and leaves the bathroom to make BumHam carry what they have gathered already to the dumpster. She thanks the Probation Officer for his time and patience and promises to deliver BumHam straight to his Father where his probation term will be carried out. 


**Back Home**


Uncle has been trying to figure out what's going on and scrambling to ready a room for a Son he is not prepared to deal with again. 

After talking with his, now, ex Daughter-in-law he finds out BumHam pulled the same deal, expecting to be waited on and getting pissy when he wasn't the center of attention. What he didn't realize is that he was dealing with a Woman this time and one who paid the bills. His only card to play was that the apartment was in his name, so she'd call his bluff and leave, and he'd have to tend to his own slough without any comforts a home caught up on bills provides. 


BumHam hadn't been coming to visit, he'd been coming to freeload.  


The Ex apologized for not coming to the Family, Uncle stops her there, none of this is her fault we all know how he is. She is at once relieved but through tears tells him she's pregnant again and pretty far along. She is ashamed of herself and sorry to put this on anyone. The entire incident that put BumHam in jail was him trying to beat an abortion out of her.


By the time she leaves, and Gram arrives with BH, Uncle is ready to kill. 


...So BumHam is staying with Gram temporarily. "

I have been given an internship offer from Harris Corporation. The position is as a Test and Integration Engineering. They'll give me a great pay, and relocate me to Palm Bay, Florida. They gave me this offer a week ago and they need an answer by this Monday.

I applied for a Developer internship with Bank of America last November. They flew me out to Charlotte, NC for a leadership conference / interview. I got a second interview a week ago and it went fairly well.

My issue here is that I would much rather get the Bank of America internship, solely because I would be doing more of the writing code, but I wont hear back from them until the end of the month. I notified the Recruiter of my offer, and he called me saying that I was a strong applicant, but they are meeting on a specific day and cannot get me an answer any faster. I asked the other company for an extension, but they said they couldn't.

I would just accept the offer and wait to hear back, but I was connected to both opportunities through an internship program. They do not allow me to do that. In fact, once I accept the offer, then Bank of America gets notified and they pull my application before the decision making process.

What should I do? Should I play it safe and accept the offer? Or should I decline it and take the risk for the company that I really want? Please lend me any advice you can.

I was considering UC Davis since I had a friend who went there and I really enjoyed the campus. Plus I lived in Sacramento for a few years and I had a good time living in a ""big city"". I'd like to get peoples opinions on other schools though, specifically they're engineering programs.

I have all my gen ed done. All 3 semesters of calculus, 3 semesters of physics, differential equations, linear algebra, the advanced circuits class, beginning and advanced java, C/C++, a computer architecture class (logic, state machines, machine language, x86 assembly). ~3.5 GPA...could be up to 3.6 by the time I transfer.

I don't have any internships or participation in clubs because of lack of time, but I have documentation of countless ""DIY"" projects I have done in my own time (mostly custom electronics, microprocessor/FPGA stuff...and a few metalworking/woodworking projects. .if that even matters). I also have a resume of work experience from 2000-2012. 

I know my GPA isn't great but I also know quite a few people with worse grades. I completed a few classes right out of high school but dropped out after a couple semesters to work full time. This is why my GPA can never be a 4.0 because I have some C's that I can't get rid of from my first two semesters in college before I got serious.

I'm 34. 

Any help would be appreciated. It seems like there are a lot of knowledgable people here with a lot of experience.

I know that iOS once had the majority of the market. But recently android has surpassed the iOS. However it looks like the tools that iOS programmers use lets them develop apps twice as fast as android developers. Furthermore iOS programmers tend to make more money.

Is it still a good idea to specialize in mobile development and iOS in particular? Will iOS still be big in the future? Is it still one of the fields where you can get a good job if you have the portfolio to show for it even without a CS degree? 

I'm still a CS student, however a lot of people on this subreddit claim that it's hard to find a job without an internship or projects to show for it.

46y2hd,9,2016-02-21,[help] can scar tissue be called a 'liver nodule'? I think my vet is scamming me.,stuffyteddybear,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/46y2hd/help_can_scar_tissue_be_called_a_liver_nodule_i/,"Hi Guys,
My dog had a liver lobectomy done back in 2014 of January, diagnosed as Hepatocellular Carcinoma. I've been continuously doing rechecks and just last month her ALT were elevated to 214. Nothing else. We do an ultrasound and it shows a mass of around 2.4X2.7cm.
Immediately I asked to get this removed, however my vet said because of the location (pressed up against the diaphragm and next to the major liver vein) she cannot do it and that a specialist has to do it. So she called the specialist and he said there should be no problem doing it but he would want to do an ultrasound as well. I agreed and went to him the next day where i SPECIFICALLY ask that I only want this done if it's possible. Which he said he will tell me once he does the ultrasound.
After the ultrasound he calls me and tells me there is enough room and that he is going to go ahead with the surgery.
After the surgery he calls me and saids it turns out the tissue shown in the ultrasound was more of a scar tissue from the last surgery and a bit of inflammation. There was a bit of a mass growing but he was able to remove the whole mass with just a biopsy alone.
This was great news!
That was until I picked her up and read the report. On the report it states that, during surgery they reported a 2cm smooth mass (nodule) and that treatment was ""exploratory laporatomy"" and a punch biopsy of 5.5mm was done on the liver nodule.
Does this mean he lied to me? Did he not take the whole mass out?
I was asking the 2 interns he had with him during the surgery as he was not there when I went to pick up my dog. They told me that the reason why the whole mass wasn't removed was the location. Which is something my specialist did not bring up at all...
I feel like I just paid 5k+ for putting my dog through hell for no reason. They didn't even remove the mass and did exploratory surgery... With biopsy. Which is exactly what I did not want to do."
46y55s,2,2016-02-21,"My experience with ""The Creative Group.""",penguinzrocknroll,angry,https://www.reddit.com/r/angry/comments/46y55s/my_experience_with_the_creative_group/,"This is a LONG rant

Okay, so a bit of backstory about myself. I graduated last December (2015) from William Paterson University in NJ. My degree is a Bachelor’s of Studio Arts with a concentration in Graphic Design. I also graduated with a 3.5 GPA if it matters.

Anyway, after graduating I obviously began looking around for jobs in my field on all the job searching websites like: Indeed, Monster, Dice, Snag a job, Career Builder, Zipfile, Simplyhired, and even Craig’s List. After a few months of applying and having no responses, I get very discouraged and begin to stress myself a bit. So I contact my school’s career services in hopes that they might give me advice or even place me in an internship or something like that (the “career services” website claims that they “provide employment and mentoring connections” which I can now say is untrue) . The only thing the career services helped me do is help me figure out how to word my resume and also update it so it’s current.

The career adviser then recommended me to a place called “The Creative Group.” For those of you who don’t know, The Creative Group is a “recruiting agency” that helps place people in the art and design field with companies that their skills suit. So, my career adviser recommended me to The Creative Group of Saddle Brook NJ and this lady named Kara, saying that she had connections with the college or something like that. So I emailed and called Kara for about a month before giving up because she never contact me back, It was only later on when I began to complain to them that I found out that Kara was on sick leave and only recently came back. And I was like wtf? Even the receptionist failed to mention that Kara wasn’t in and she didn’t offer to connect me to anyone else, instead I was leaving voicemails and emails in a person’s mailbox that wasn’t there! So fast forward a few months later, I’m still applying on my own through various job sites and attempting to freelance through Fiverr because I don’t know what else to do. Then, I get a call from The Creative Group from a different recruiter, her name was Megan. She tells me that she saw my resume online through some job finding website and was interested in talking with me in person about my qualifications and such. Obviously, I was excited to hear back from them, even if it was from a different person. So I set up to interview with Megan at the most convenient time for the both of us. I believe that the interview went over pretty well, Megan explained how The Creative Group works and how people get placed/picked for a certain job and it seemed to make sense. So I pretty much emailed her every week or every other week asking if she had anything available for me or jobs that sounded interesting to me on The Creative Group Website. She would rarely reply..and it got to the point where she didn’t respond anymore: no phone calls or emails, even though I regularly tried to get in contact with her.

It got so bad, that I tried to reach out to a different branch of The Creative Group (In Woodbridge NJ) just so I can talk to or get help from anyone else. Still, the results where the same, they rarely pick up their phones and almost never email you back. So, now I was dealing with two branches with the same exact results. I was really stressing myself out at this point, I was still applying to jobs on my own, only to get rejected or never called back and it felt like The Creative Group wasn’t helping me in the slightest. As a side note, before I contacted The Creative Group of Woodbridge I remember applying to a company called Winco through Indeed, they called me in for an interview and tested me on my skills with Photoshop and InDesign (I guess I was too slow with InDesign because they never called me back).. Why do I mention this? It’s because when I called the Woodbridge Creative Group, the lady, her name was Kristin asked me if I had any interviews recently. I told her about Winco, and she asked if I got that interview through the Creative Group.. Implying that job posting was in their system, but no one at the Saddle Brook Creative Group told me about it...so I told her that I found it through Indeed.

Continuing the story, I’m so stressed out about not having a job in my field, I’m pretty much crying myself to sleep or waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety, applying to any full time jobs through all the job posting websites I mentioned because I can’t fall back asleep. I pretty much call The Creative Group asking to speak to the manager, his name is Sam, and I try to hold back my tears as I explain to him all the stuff that has happened to me so far. He seems sympathetic and asks me to send my resume to him so he can mention it to all his employees and maybe they can do something about it (what a joke). I also begin contacting the complaints department for the Creative Group to complain about the Saddle Brook branch because it is the one I have dealt with the most. So the complaints department process your complaint and sends it up to corporate and someone SHOULD contact you within about 3-5 business days… So..does anyone want to guess what happened? Well.. I contacted the complaint department for a whole month (calling them once every week) because I never heard back from corporate..like ever. I even asked the people who were processing my complaints if they had the number for corporate because I was tired of complaining to them and getting nowhere.

I was also talking to Sam a lot asking him what I should do and complaining to him about his employees Kara and Megan. It was at this point that I learned that Kara was on sick leave and Megan no longer dealt with placing people as freelance and only did “salaried” people, which meant like you had to be hired by The Creative Group first before they could place you. So obviously, I asked Sam why I couldn’t be hired by The Creative Group and be placed as salaried because I was looking for a full time job anyway.. He gave me some stupid excuse that I don’t really remember. I also remember telling him that I had a part time job, and he had the gall to tell me that it might be because of my part time job (in retail) that I’m not getting any callbacks from his recruiters. He goes on to explain that companies want someone who can start right away (aka: you’re unemployed).
I still think his excuse is bullshit. Anyway after a bit more complaining I get to talk to the manager of Robert Half (The Creative Group is part of Robert Half..this was in Saddle Brook too). His name was Rory, I sent him my resume, but the same result, I have yet to hear from anyone. The funny thing is around this time, I actually decided to look up their reviews on Yelp and saw that I wasn’t the only one that was very dissatisfied with them. Other people complained of the same thing: No one picked up their phones no matter how much or when they called, that they were never told that the recruiter they were calling left or was sick so they left voicemails for weeks, etc. There’s also this lady named Gretel on yelp, apologizing to people about their terrible experience with the creative group. She’s a customer service rep, however instead of reaching out to you, she asks you to forward your info to her so you can speak with the president or whatever. I don’t really know how to forward info on yelp, so I haven’t done anything..Though based on the negative reviews...I’m not going to bother.

So a year, later I finally wised up and gave up on The Creative Group, I have a possible job opportunity lined up for myself right now. Obviously I found it on my own, I’m just praying that the 2nd interview goes as well as the first did."

I'm a surgical resident in a busy hospital. My life is busy. I'm on shift pretty much every day 8-6 and on the days when i'm not, it's because i'm working 8-8 or overnight. This happens once every couple of weeks. Basically, it's a pretty standard rota for a surgical resident reaching the end of their training. 

I met my husband when I was in medical school and he was studying business. We hit it off after a little while - no insta-romance! - and decided that we wanted to be together after we graduated. He's kind, sweet and caring. He makes me laugh. He always has time for me. Luckily, my allocation worked out near him and we were close together. 
The first few years were pretty hard because I was working pretty insane hours and had little time or energy for anything that wasn't medicine. I was obsessed with being a good doctor, I didn't really have much thought for anything else. I know I didn't put him first, and we had a few little tiffs about it but we always managed to work it out. If i'm being brutally honest, I thought he just didnt understand - he's a lot more lax toward his job, even though it brings in fantastic money and he has a lot of free time (he runs the family business). That's not to say he doesn't work hard, it's just that I didn't get the feeling he understands what I needed to go to be able to survive in my job, you know? It sounds callous when you write it like that, but I hope you know what I mean. 

Things were difficult, because a major issue was the fact that I was always at work when he got to be at home when he finished. Looking back on it now, I think he was quite lonely - waiting for me to get back when i'd often have to spend an extra hour at work or go in early. There were weeks when we barely saw each other despite having moved in together. But I thought we were doing OK despite it all, and he proposed to me and we got married. I didn't get much of a honeymoon because I couldn't get the time off work, but we took a few 'mini honeymoons' afterwards when I had a week or so off at a time, and things seemed OK. I have two children and those were the two best years because I spent a good amount of time on maternity leave and we got to be together as a family. I could see in his face how much he liked having me around the house and he sat me down one evening and asked if I would consider going part time from then on, toward the end of my second maternity leave. Unfortunately, in the country I work in, residencies are long - 7 to 8 years - and this would delay my completion for another 5 years! The whole point is to get through it fast so I can be around afterwards, not drag it out even longer. 

I always thought it would get better as I went along, but now i'm no longer an intern and i'm a resident, things got worse. I don't get any time to see him. I'm always at work. I have to be there now because i'm so far into the training i'm almost at the end and stopping and retraining as a different specialty would take years I don't have. 
I barely see my children. My husband does everything. I have enough energy to make them their lunches in the morning, but he has to pack it all and take them to school and bring them back because i'm never there. My husband went from asking me to come home every night to just being happy when I came home to now not seeming to care. I know it sounds dramatic, but it's true. It happened so slowly I didn't even realise. He used to text me every day during my shifts at the start, and bring me little treats. Eventually that stopped and he would just wait at the door when I got home, like a little puppy. It breaks my heart because I know there were many, many nights when I got back and I was so fed up with work and life in general that I would head straight for the sofa and basically ignore him. Eventually that stopped and now when I get home there's noone waiting for me. They're all happy to see me, but I feel like i'm intruding on happy family time. The kids are already unwound from school, they're playing or eating by the time I get back. My husband used to try and initiate sex with me every night and every morning and I would always say no because I was too tired and never in the mood. Now he doesn't try. He just gets into bed and kisses me goodnight. I haven't been held in bed for about a year, and I didn't even miss it until recently when I realised it wasn't happening anymore! 

I don't know what's brought on this realisation. I just had a moment mid-appendicectomy when I realised that I haven't had a conversation that wasn't about medicine in years. This was three weeks ago. I went home and realised all the things i'd taken for granted just weren't there anymore. Noone to hug me when I got home unless I asked for it, which I rarely did. My kids love me, but they always go to Dad first for things which is heartbreaking. My husband smiles at me and I think he still loves me but I don't know what to say to him anymore. He went out with a few friends last night and I got home as he was getting ready to go. I feel nervous in my own house now, watching him get ready. He looked good. I didn't realise that he was exercising and getting into shape. He wore clothes that I didn't recognise, but I know they aren't new. I wanted to ask him a thousand and one questions about his day and what he had planned but I couldn't. I just smiled at him and told him to have fun and I watched him laugh on the phone to his friend and leave. 
I didn't sleep all evening. He got into bed and went straight to sleep. I don't think he's cheating but I just feel like nothing. 

I don't know what I'm asking for. I have made such a mess and I don't know what to do. 

TLDR - I ignored my family for years. Now they don't need me.


EDIT: Thank you all so so so much for your words. Thank you for not assuming I was a heartless bitch and understanding where i'm coming from. I really really appreciate it. 
I've actually got a day off today (on call weekend) and so i'm taking your advice on board and seeing what I can do. I wake up earlier than he does anyways so I took /u/ceebee6's advice and made him his coffee. I'm glad that I still remember how he takes it! He was quite confused when he woke up and saw me basically standing over him with a grin like a serial killer holding a cup of scalding hot coffee but he seemed to appreciate it. I tried to engage him in conversation while he was getting ready but he didn't seem massively perceptive. He never was a morning person but it still feels different, you know? Or maybe i'm over analysing things. I watched him brush his teeth and do a little dance to some music like usual. It made me laugh. He's very cute. I didn't have the guts to follow him into the shower though :(
I offered to iron his shirts but he just laughed and asked what's gotten into me. I haven't ironed his clothes for about 10 years. I don't blame him for saying no. But I liked the shirt and tie he wore. He always dresses well, even when he's at home during the day. I quite like that. 
I asked if I could join on the school run and he said yes (albeit slightly confusedly) so that's something nice :) I would very much like to ask if I can spend the day in the office (home office) with him but I think that would creep him out too much based on how he's reacting for the rest of today. I don't want to push it too much and make him wonder what's going on - or worse, if I've done something bad i'm making up for like an affair! I shall browse amazon today and see if I can find a nice little model that he might like. It's hard to tell. He keeps them in a drawer somewhere and never puts them out, even though they're actually very well done. I snuck off to have a look while he was in the shower :p 

While he was downstairs getting ready for the day and packing things up to go to school, I went and gave my kids a big hug. They're so happy to see me that I feel like such a fraud. I don't deserve such love. 

I know it wont be easy but I can do this.

46yhjx,1,2016-02-21,EE Major w/ CS Minor Looking Into a Career in Software,SpartanJones,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/46yhjx/ee_major_w_cs_minor_looking_into_a_career_in/,"Hi everyone,

Some background info: I have 1 more year of college left (graduating December 2016) in the USA...California to be exact. I'm an EE major who has taken two programming courses, and saw it more as a hobby than something I'd do for a job, until recently. I explored everything that EE has to offer, and honestly no field or subfield of pure EE sticks out to me. This is why I picked up the CS minor, because the software world is very appealing from my point of view.

 &amp;nbsp;

Now, hopefully this doesn't come off as arrogant, because I understand that switching from an area that is largely hardware based to an area that's largely (or entirely) software based can be a humbling experience. I've done a lot of research on this topic, from viewing tons of threads on this sub and other places. A tldr; of my research is that it is not uncommon for EE majors to commit to software development, and that was reassuring to me. That's not to say it will be easy, the journey will take a lot of dedication and effort.

 &amp;nbsp;

In terms of my experience, I have one internship at a semiconductor company that has been ongoing from 2014 - present, so about 2 years. The two programming courses I have taken are Intro to Java and an FPGA course that dealt with Verilog (found it to be boring). My interests at the moment are Java/C++ and mobile app development. (Leaning towards Android) 

 &amp;nbsp;

Finally, onto my questions:

 &amp;nbsp;

1) Are these optimal courses to take?



For the two upper division CS courses I have to take for my CS minor, I plan on taking data structures &amp; algorithms and object oriented design. I chose these because they are important topics, and difficult to self-teach.

 &amp;nbsp;

2) What's the best way to build employable skills?



As I mentioned before, I'm interested in C++/Java, namely app development. I will do more research on how to dive into this field in particular, but I also wanted to ask you guys right now while I have the opportunity. I'd like some advice, even general advice, of habits or anything I should be doing to get myself closer to landing a job. I'm looking for the most efficient way to learn, since I only have so much time until I graduate. I'm willing to put in the time to make this work, not just doing the bare minimum, but becoming great. 

 &amp;nbsp;

3) What is some good insurance?



Allow me to explain what I mean by this. Let's say that things don't work out, or that I need more time to build up my skills enough to get employed. I don't want to be unemployed post-graduation, so what would be the fastest way to get employed in a software related field such that I can gain employment experience while honing my skills to the point where I can eventually become a developer? A QA role? I'm trying to think of some way I can gain relevant experience even if it's a lower level job. I don't want to be the newly graduated EE working at Radioshack or Frys, who works on his software skills at home in hopes of landing the job that he may never get.

 &amp;nbsp;

4) What do you think overall, based on what I've presented to you guys?



I'd like to hear any additional comments you guys have, if any. I'm staying optimistic, but I'm not reluctant to shy away from reality. I don't want it to seem like ""guy walks in with CS minor and thinks he's hot shit"" or ""guy takes intro to java and thinks he's the next Bill Gates"". I understand there is a lot to learn: books to read, code to write, interviews to study for, etc. , and that is why I seek to improve myself each and every day.  "
46ymd5,1,2016-02-21,"[Profile] Strange background, realistic for M7?",MBAthrowaway614,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/46ymd5/profile_strange_background_realistic_for_m7/,"I’ve never been promoted in a professional capacity, worked for a major company, or earned a lot of money. Still, I have high hopes. Are they realistic?

**Background**  

*Work experience:* After undergrad, went to graduate school in engineering at a top 3 program in the field. Changed majors to do this. I originally intended a PhD, and in three years of graduate school published four papers, two of which were co-authored with international teams, and was co-inventor on a patent that subsequently was licensed out to a startup. My funding source required an industrial internship which I chose to fulfill at an early-stage startup that has become very successful over the last three years. During my internship, I recommended a key process change that dramatically decreased energy cost for production and solved a key QC problem that “saved the company,” according to the founder/CEO. This was in the first several months of the startup’s existence, so the opportunity for impact was outsized---I regularly presented to investors and the CEO, and was the only engineer of my type working for the company at the time. 
  
After that, I was inspired to leave graduate school and create my own tech startup, for which I recruited three partners and which I bootstrapped from savings. This startup in the planning phases got to a top 75 selection in a business plan competition with 1300 entrants and won an honorable mention in a social impact venture competition. Since then, we've successfully launched our first product, currently sold in three states, and am developing more. I don't really like investment if I don't need it, so for product development capital I've taken up a part time job at a local national lab as a physicist.  
  
Totals by time of matriculation: 3 years grad school, 3 mos internship, 4 years' startup, 1.5 years' physicist (unless I withdraw before then, but the money and flexibility are really helping me expand my business). I also tutor local university students in calculus, chemistry, physics, and biology in the evenings to earn some additional cash.
  
*Extra curriculars:* I'm the youngest president of my local alumni club in the club's history, having earned the spot less than a year after moving here by serving in another officer position. Our club serves about 500 alumni and I am responsible for orchestrating events with a total of 1-2k attendees over a calendar year. We also provide minor scholarships to students from the area and perform acts of community service, while sponsoring summer students from the university to work for a local nonprofit. 
  
I am also working with my local university to launch their first iGEM team, for which we have already raised about $25k and recruited our team, PIs, and graduate advisors. This was fun because it basically started with cold-calling professors until I found someone willing to take up the mantle of PI, and working with this person has been terrific. 
  
In graduate school, I was president of my department's graduate students' council and served as a representative to the university's larger council. 
  
I am also serving as a merit badge councilor for the local Boy Scout council. 
  
*Undergrad school/major:* Top 20 USNWR school (think Rice, WUSTL, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, Berkeley), majored in physics with a concentration in applied physics and a minor in Chinese. Not sure if relevant, but also completed honors program and won a full scholarship. 
  
*Other education/coursework:* MS in engineering from Flagship Public U, but top 3 program in the field. I also have taken several MOOCs from Stanford and Wharton, but no certificates. No idea where these fit; I just enjoy watching lectures before bed.  
   
*Race/nationality:* White, American
  
*Sex:* Male
  
**Stats**  

*GMAT Score (include breakdown!):* Haven't taken yet, but I usually do pretty well on standardized tests. Got a 2350 on the SAT, a 35 ACT, and 800Q/650V GRE (about 5 years ago). Goal is 720+.
*Undergrad GPA:* 3.7, graduated *cum laude*
  
  
**MBA Info**  

*Goal of MBA:* After my MBA, I would like to work in business development or product management for a large high-technology firm like Genentech, Cargill, Raytheon, etc. I would also consider launching another startup if it felt like the opportunity was there. 
  
Regarding my current startup, I am going to sell my shares to my partners and serve as an advisor during my MBA years. I believe that this is the best strategy to enable it to grow, and I may return to it post-MBA if the other partners and I agree that it is the best course of action at that time. 
  
*Target schools:* Harvard, MIT, Ross, Wharton, Stanford, Booth, Kellogg, Haas, Tepper, Darden. These are schools for investigation right now and I'll eventually wind up paring the list down a bit. Suggestions would be helpful. 
  
Sorry for the long read, it’s been a winding road. I’m currently 28 and will be applying this fall. Who do you guys think would be the most logical choices to ask for rec letters? What other advice can you offer?

I'm the guy who posted here recently asking for tips on how to succeed at my iOS Engineering internship.

I have now been working this job for about two weeks. Week 1 was fine because it was mostly about getting set up and getting to know the code base (that was difficult but I feel more comfortable with how the code works now). Week 2 was really unsatisfying and disappointing. I was working to integrate a new feature and on MANY occasions did I find myself just struggling and struggling and struggling for hours upon hours...  and since I am in a business environment now, with deadlines, it made me stress and feel uncomfortable. I literally spent the entire week on this feature in particular, when I was supposed to develop two other features as well in the same week.

Long story short, I am really disappointed in myself and would like some advice on how to proceed... I'm thinking of working more hours but to be honest, I am really starting to feel comfortable with a job that ends at 5 every day (after having worked from like 9 AM to 9-11 PM for like 4 months straight before this internship, a 9-5 is nice. I can just come home and do other stuff, like game or work on side projects and keep learning).

My biggest problem is that every now and then, the CEO of the startup will ask me how things have been going, and I will have literally nothing to say other than ""oh man, I've been struggling a lot for like 6 hours to get this sub-feature to work..."", and I just hate having to say ""I did not get anything done, but I tried"".

There isn't really a senior dev I can ask questions to, but they are hiring one very soon.

So yeah, the most annoying and deeply uncomfortable part of this is having to say to my boss that I haven't made that much progress.... and the fact that it took me 5 days to make one freaking feature when I had planned to make 3 in the same amount of time.

Please help! I am ready to work hard (already doing my best) and really want to succeed in this internship and really learn as much as possible to become a great iOS dev, but am kind stuck right now.

Advice ?"

46ywkn,1,2016-02-21,How do I (26F) divorce an acquaintance (26M) that won't leave me alone?,skippah,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46ywkn/how_do_i_26f_divorce_an_acquaintance_26m_that/,"I met Matt during an internship in the summer of 2011. He was fine, a little abrasive, but I didn't know anyone else at that company and we kept each other company. 

-

We also went to the same university, so when we got back we hung out a little bit, never alone. I don't know how to say this nicely, but he wasn't my favorite person in the world. We were really acquaintances and when we got back to school from the internship, I wanted to prioritize my actual friends. 

-

He was running a school club, and asked if I'd join, promising me it would look good on my resume and help me land a good job. I joined but pretty half-heartedly. We didn't really spend a lot of time together and at the time, I would not have considered him a friend.

-

One thing about Matt though, is that he didn't really have a lot of other friends. He's very abrasive, to the point where he can be an asshole and it drives people away. He's very condescending of other people too, and thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread. 

-

Once we graduated, i DID land an awesome job. However, Matt seemed to be taking a lot of credit for that job, saying he guided me to it, me joining that club looked good on my resume, and will say things like ""You're so lucky to have me as a friend.""

- 

A couple years go by and we maybe get lunch once a year. One summer, I'm in between boyfriends and he asks to meet up for lunch. He starts hitting on me and it's very creepy and awkward. He was still being subtle, not directly asking me out, and I made him aware that I was talking to another man. 

-

Again, another month goes by with little contact. We maybe text once every other week. I'm actively dating the same man, but we're not official yet.

-

One day I was go-karting with some friends and didn't have my cell on me. We were out for hours. When I got back, I had three (three!!) missed calls from him, a looooong voicemail, and some texts saying ""Call me immediately when you get this."" 

-

My friends and I were out at the bar, so I didn't want to be on the phone with him. His voicemail was long, just saying ""Call me immediately; it's important."" I text him saying ""hey, i'm out and about, what's up."" And he messages me back this long, winding text that asks me out at the end. 

-

I have never flirted with him or expressed interest in any way. It doesn't bother me that he went out on a limb and hit on me. It's just the way he did it, demanding that I call him, even when I told him I was out with friends and couldn't talk right now. And he was so pushy and anxious. 

-

Anyway, he went dark for a couple months, and then started back up with the infrequent chats. The thing is, I'm been really busy at work and don't want to get lunch with him anymore. I've been making excuses for a couple months now, saying I'm busy that week, and hoping he'll get the point. But i don't want to be stringing him along.

-

Is it possible for me to completely drop him as an acquaintance? I would honestly rather have lunch alone than catch up with him. He's so negative and condescending, and I'm tired of it. How do I tell him that I'm no longer interested in being part of his life without being mean about it, and without lying or coming up with an excuse?

-

It's hard because he didn't do anything that would make me hate him. I just don't like him as a person. It wouldn't kill me to get lunch with him once every couple of months, but 

-
   
**tl;dr**: I have had an acquaintance that keeps wanting to get lunch with me and be friends. He's condescending and abrasive, we have literally nothing in common, and we don't even talk that frequently. There's a chance he may be interested in me too. What can I say to him nicely to make him leave me alone, forever?"

Considering how much the tech industry is growing and the increasing demand for those with coding skill grows, and my interest in software, hardware, mechanics of computers, coding, etc. Makes learning this skill seem like a logical choice.

However, I'm a little late into my undergrad, so I have a choice. Maybe you guys can help.

**Choice 1: I change my major to PR and go to my city's coding boot camp in the evening after graduating while working a part time job**

**Pros:**

*Easy to change major, won't affect me in school that much. PR plays to my stengths and love of interaction with others.

*Coding boot camp would give me two big skills under my belt

*Coding boot camp is definitely cheaper than more university tuition. 

*Boot camp where I live gives certifications, aids in job search process, have had nothing but positive buzz and success stories lately

*Could potentially use either skills to eventually break into the video game industry, a very exhaustive industry but one that I love.

**Cons:**

*Would ultimately take more time

*Bootcamp around me is still relatively new

*Would be quite difficult to find a job to help pay the monthly payments of rent and tuition to coding bootcamp and give me evenings off for class...maybe they can compromise? 

**Choice 2: Change major to CIS (Infomation Systems)**

**Pros:**

*BS degree with University contacts and exclusive recruiters

*Would learn not just coding but business and IT backgrounds and be a better job candidate

**Cons:**

*CIS degree is different from my currently enrolled college. It IS possible to change but it is a DRAG to do so. It's hard.

*CIS degree would definitely prolong my time in university, wouldn't graduate on time

*I could maybe reach credit surcharge limits...which could be quite bad.


**Notes:**

*I have prepaid college credits and a state scholarship

For either choice, I'd be trying for internships both as a college undergrad and recent grad, working to fill out my resume with experience. /r/findapath has always given sound advice in the past, so I was wondering what advice everyone could give about the two choices, and which one would be better to follow?

I'm trying to make sure I can get a decent entry job not terribly long out of college, but also one I can enjoy and not dread every day. The job market in the US sucks hard right now, so being a transfer student I'm trying to make the most of what time I have right now, so that later on down the road I'll have an easier time finding work.

Thanks guys. Sorry for the long post. Hope it's readable. I did this all on my phone."

They asked me how I bought it and I did not lie to them I straight up told them I had a fake id since I remembered seeing one of the undercover cops walk out of the store when I was at the counter. 

I ended being charged with:
 (1) Illegal possession of an alcoholic beverage.
(2) possession by minor of false or fraudulent identification
(3)def  knowingly making false statement of age
(4) furnishing alcohol to minor ( since when we left the store we put the alcohol in my friends bookbag. 

They gave me a ticket with these charges and a court date. However on the ticket they have section were you can basically just admit and not have to go to court and pay a fine I think. This was my first time ever getting  in trouble with the law the cop said if I go to court they will lump the 4 charges together and I will probably have to do some community service and a class or something.

 However, I was planning on studying abroad next year and if I have these charges on my record it will probably fuck me up over when I apply for my visa so I need this to be off my record. Should I just admit or should I  go to court. If I go to court is it okay if I get a public defender or should I try to find a defense attorney to pay ( I am low on money). Again this is my first offense ever and cannot afford to have this on my record! It will seriously fuck me over I am a good student with a 3.6 GPA and a bright future and I don't get in trouble. I have tons of scholarships and internships lined up. It was stupid but I need to figure out how to sort this out HELP!

While my school ranks #1 in CS in the U.S. Ranking, I will only have minor in CS and major in social science. My GPA is really low (2.8), but I do have some internship (big corp) and research (data science related) experiences. 

What are my chances against Master in CS for West Coast schools such as Stanford, UC Berkeley, and San Jose State University. The master does not specifically have to be in CS, but it needs to be data science related (so I guess any where between CS and Statistics).

Thank you in advance."
470973,3,2016-02-22,I have a spinal cord injury and I can't afford surgery to fix it and I'd rather be dead than slowly watch myself get paralyzed.,MillionDollarSmother,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/470973/i_have_a_spinal_cord_injury_and_i_cant_afford/,"I was just chatting on a suicide prevention line, and I know they have limited resources, and had to end our chat, but I'm still having really strong suicidal urges. 

I have a spinal cord injury from a car accident several years ago, and I need surgery so that the paralysis and nerve pain don't get worse. My insurance is denying coverage for the better surgery, and even when they do approve it, I can't afford my maximum out of pocket fees. I'm a PhD student, so I have all these deadlines breathing down my neck, no money, and no medical leave available to me for my crappy teaching job. So even if my surgery is approved, I'm looking at a grueling recovery period where I have to somehow maintain employment while being in terrible pain. And the surgery itself is terrifying, even though I want it so badly at the same time. I'm in so much debt from all the other medical expenses. I have no family (my family were abusive drug addicts I escaped from years ago). I'd rather be dead than disabled and homeless. 

I started getting worried when I started thinking seriously about how and what I'd do. Tomorrow I might get a final ruling on my insurance claim, and if it's a no, I think that might be it for me. And Wednesday I'm supposed to defend my PhD dissertation proposal, and some of the people on my committee told me straight up that they think I'm an idiot, so I know I'm going to get torn apart. Those things coming up just made me start thinking more seriously about killing myself. 

I have a counselor and a psychiatrist already, and when I saw my counselor on Friday, she was mean to me, and I just felt more hopeless. I think she was trying some techniques to try and push me into a breakthrough or something, but it was just really destructive. She called me ""Whiny and Mousey."" I'm actually *almost* a counselor myself, which is part of why some of this feels even more shameful. I would have been licensed in May, but I had to drop my final internship due to the worsening of my spine injury. I feel like I should be able to help myself more, but I can't. 

I just can't see any hope for my future. It all looks like pain and poverty from here. But I'm terrified of trying and failing. Members of my family tried and failed several times in my childhood, and it was ugly. I don't want to be that person. 

And I don't want to die here, in this state. I live in the desert, but I'm from California, and I'd want to die by the ocean. But I'd feel so bad like doing it in a hotel room and having some poor stranger find me. The fact that I'm still having logical thoughts like that I know makes it seem like maybe I'm not serious, and I don't want to be, but at the same time, I can't see any way out of this. 

Edit: My final appeal failed. Honestly not sure how I'm going to survive this week, that was my last hope. I'm doomed to a life of pain and neverending surgeries. I'd rather be dead. 

Update 2: Well I'm obviously still alive since I'm writing this. I did my dissertation proposal defense and I basically went crazy trying to fix everything they told me I was retarded about. I knocked it out of the park and had a lot of people in awe of my research and its implications. So that's good, but I still have the surgery authorization that failed and now I'm still facing the old shitty surgery that's going to ruin my life. As soon as I finished the defense I had a bunch of calls from surgeons and insurance companies and billing departments. It's like, I did something really incredible and I couldn't even enjoy it for one second. I can't catch a break. "

Me and your Lt. Governor /u/basedcake are incredibly grateful that you have given us a second term to lead the Southern State. We will do all we can to make our great state even better, more beautiful, more pristine than ever before. 

In the debate threads for the 4th State Elections I made several elections promises. These will not be forgotten. Me and my cabinet have worked hard to put together a policy plan for the 4th term in the Southern State. We will be drafting and pushing legislation to do the following:

##**Health Care**

We will be pushing legislation making vaccinations of children in elementary school mandatory. We will be building more clinics in rural areas to ensure all Southern citizens get equal access to health care. We will also be working with private ensurers to make health care cheaper, getting rid of monopolies which have the health care market in a stranglehold.

##**Energy**

We will work towards a cleaner future. As part of that, we will be pushing legislation giving tax cuts to businesses who choose to switch to cleaner energy sources. We will be investing in solar and nuclear energy, however, we will make sure no money is wasted, and that no renewable energy companies become dependant on the government. 

We hope to have 25% of all energy be clean by 2025

##**Education**

We will be pushing legislation establishing a University of the Southern State system. We will strive to lower interest rates on student loans and we will push for more internships and apprenticeships so that students can build skills for their future careers.

##**Economy &amp; Finance**

We will we pushing for a balanced budget. Following that push, our dear former State Treasurer /u/PepperoniJalapeno has drafted a budget for 2016 with a 7 billion dollar surplus. We will give tax credits to start-up businesses, to entice more Southern State citizens to start their own companies, and make it easier for those start-ups to compete.

We will be increasing taxes on those earning well beyond the living wage, specifically above $250,000. We will also push for a minimum wage of $8. No less, no more. 

##**Drugs &amp; Crime**

We will be pushing for rehabilitation of minor drug offenders who are dealing with addiction. We will be taxing and regulating marihuana, and make 18 years the minimum age of purchase. In line with that logic, we will be lowering the age of legal alcohol consumption to 18. Adults are adult enough to decide for themselves if they can drink or not.

##**Gun Control**

We will push for legislation making it harder for convicted felons to own a gun. We affirm the 2nd amendment, but we will be pushing for legislation instating universal background checks.

##**Conclusion**

We are going to push legislation as described above, and we hope to pass such legislation, working together with Southern assemblymembers from all political stripes. We can make the Southern State the best state in the Model USA, and I know we will. Let's keep the Southern State active as well, as it was the last term!

God bless all of you, and God bless the Southern State!"

I want to get a new PC around end of March, and at the moment I still do research about what fits me best. Since I have to move pretty often due to interns in the near future and me being on longer journeys here and there as well, I thought about getting a Gigabyte Brix Gaming PC. 


The question I have, is the following: Can it compete with [one of these builds](https://redd.it/4136su) while being around the same cost? Which specific PC of the series would you take? And which parts would you choose for it then? 

I'll be glad if somebody can help me out,

**Form:**

* Country of purchase: Canada

* Budget range: CAD $1000-$1500

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): portable gaming, mainly

* Screen size preference: 15.6"", but I can live with 17.3"" if there's no choice.

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows.

* Gaming requirements (list example games and desired fps/settings): Enough to run very heavily modded Minecraft at least 50-60 fps, LoL/DOTA/CSGO on high/maxed out, and Street Fighter V on high settings. Other than that, I have no desire of running any game on ultra, ever. I don't know if GTX 960m is enough, or if 970m is the only thing capable of hitting that benchmark. I'd prefer 960m for its vastly reduced price, but please let me know if you absolutely need to use the 970m to meet these benchmarks.

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): None, outside of *very* light AutoCAD usage.

* Portability requirements (constantly carried, frequently moved, mostly stationary, etc.): Very frequently moved, but will be plugged in while at 90% of those locations.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): Can't find a good Sager build under $1500 CAD, though it's my preferred brand, along with ASUS. I do not want to use XOticPC to order a laptop, given their horrendous reputation. Already looked at ASUS ROG G751JL and its other constituents, and I'm not impressed with how quickly its users are reporting its hard drive failing (under a year of usage, even with maintenance). I **absolutely** need a hardy, long-lived laptop to juggle between moving to different countries on internships and the like. Shelf life of 3 years and above with regular, diligent maintenance preferably.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Not too specific, would like good build quality though.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: High performance gets 1st priority, then long battery life as a distant second.

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality

**List any critical features:** 960m or 970m (budget is main limiter here), i7, no thermal throttling, good build quality (not flimsy), 500gb+ storage

**Which features would you pay a premium for?** (eg. high resolution screen, great keyboard/touchpad/audio, low noise/heat): great performance, long laptop life (not battery life, but its overall shelf life, if that makes sense), build quality."

So 


Funny story 


I'm in an LDR but not? Hope it's appropriate for this sub.
Apologies this is likely to be long.



Backstory: So just over 2 years ago I had gone through a break up of a 5.5 yr relationship and this friend let's call him Rin - was a huge help getting me through it and he ended up admitting he'd always had a thing for me which initiated some pretty satisfying sexting but nothing ever happened (at that point we were in the same city still) 
We both ended up with other people and for 2 years we pretty much didn't talk. I later found out that it was because of his ex let's call her Bee. 
Bee entered one of my friendship circles due to dating Rim and I later found out an offhand comment about my past association with Rim was a reason we didnt really speak as she'd lied about what I had said and called me disrespectful. 
He contacted me out of the blue end of last year asking me how I was and apologising profusely for 'being a dick' and explained how Bee had made him cut off almost all of his friends.
I knew they'd ended it but not how so when he asked I told him I was aware but not of the details. 
She told him she was leaving him at the airport as they waited to leave for a trip they'd been planning and getting  excited about for months. 



Boom headshot.



He still went but bought a ticket back within a few days. 



We proceed to flirt and sext again pretty much from day one. We talk every day. Still do. 



Must note here that a year ago I moved from the west to the east coast (Aus ~ 4ish hours flight 400ish return on sale) to take up a 2 year long internship crucial to my career. 



I visited home over Christmas and saw him a lot...2 years (sort of) of build up came to fruition in a pretty spectacular way multiple times. We spent a lot of time together. Now I've had some pretty shit luck with love lately and this guy is a breath of fresh air. Respectful, kind, ambitious,smart,funny,family orientated like myself and has somehow instilled some semblance of patience in my rather impatient ass. So pretty much everything I want in a guy...


I go back east - big sadface :(



Shortly after i got back he brings up ""us"" to see where we stand saying he doesnt want to hurt me or give me the wrong idea because he's processing Bee stuff getting her out his life and it's left him a bit emotionally numb therefore he doesn't want anything atm BUT he doesn't want to rule out the future re: us. He also told me how greatful he was I'd been there for him and that I'd been there when he really needed it.
We continue to talk every day and I had a weird situation where I was back west for 24 hours for a medical a
thing and he took the day off work to spend some time with me and we went for a long drive and a swim - no funny business this time - but it seemed like we were both nervous (well I was a little). Saying bye I felt like maybe he wanted to kiss me but held back? 
We're talking a little less (but still every day and mostly he initiates)  since I got back this time. I've felt frustrated  because I just  want to blurt out that I  think I'm falling for him and ask how he feels but I know he has said he is still thawing from Bee shit and emotions in general so I don't really wanna be like 'Heh please take an ice pick to the part of you that you've specifically said you're not ready to deal with yet.'
Truth be told I have a year and change left in the east and I am more than willing to search for jobs back west once I'm done with my internship and if he said let's try long distance for a year I wouldn't hesitate to say yes.
Rock and a hard place here I don't know what to do - I want to say something and ask if any feelings are reciprocated but that also runs the risk of damaging what we have *cries* and not knowing I feel like ima explode cos i dunno i really see us working. Also if I ask how do I even do that ...? 







Tl;Dr 
Had friend back home;Flirted 



Ended up with other people so didnt speak for like 2 years 


I moved east


He contacts me out the blue- we rekindle flirting


Visit for Christmas and we end up connecting and eventually sleep together


Go home, speak daily he says he's dealing with horrible ex and not ready for anything but won't rule out the future


Short visit home he takes day off to spend some time with me


I catch feels wanna tell him don't know if I should or how I would cos I would totally do LDR till I can move back west in a yearish"
470zkm,6,2016-02-22,I (23f) was promised a job....,dndlady,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/470zkm/i_23f_was_promised_a_job/,"Hi! 

I am in a pretty competitive college program. At the beginning of the year we were all matched up with mentors. People who have been in the business for a while and can offer some guidance. My mentor, Jackie (50f), has been great. We're really similar and get along really well. We've gone out for some drinks and talked about life. She was always super encouraging. 

For the program we have to complete an internship in order to graduate. I was telling Jackie that I didn't want to just apply for anything and there was actually a couple of jobs I was interested in but it would be cutting it close to the internship deadline.

She was very encouraging and actually kept asking me about why I hadn't applied for her internship yet. She then told me that she would be my backup so that I could apply for the jobs I wanted without worry of not having an internship. 

Now I went to interview for her internship and it went really well. There was only one other person interviewing. She told me my answers were perfect and I'd be a great fit. 

I recently got an email from her telling me I didn't get the internship and she gave me reasons as to why she offered it to the other candidate. 

I understand that I am not going to get every job I apply for nor am I entitled to it. But I am feeling really disappointed and embarrassed. I only applied for a couple of other jobs and I'm feeling like if my own mentor won't even hire me then I don't have a chance. 

My question is: what do I do now? She signed off her email with see you soon but I don't really know how to interact around her. Im feeling really stupid. 

Mini update: Jackie messaged me a few days ago and offered to take me and the other candidate on as interns. Not sure I want to accept, but just got turned down for another position. Feeling pretty down about the whole job hunt thing right now! 

TL;DR: My mentor offered me an internship and then turned around and gave it to someone else. I don't know how to interact with her anymore."
4710ku,2,2016-02-22,Very long vent on the joke that is my life.,nightjesus,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/4710ku/very_long_vent_on_the_joke_that_is_my_life/,"My life just tends to be an endless joke. Some of it is my fault, some of it is not. 

It's my fault that I went on a trip to America that I could not afford. I should not of taken out that bank loan. I should of canceled it when my step sister pulled out and I should not of invited and paid for the person who went with me. I also should of waited for the dollar to go up (I'm Australian, the AUD to USD is murder). I've become unemployed and I live in the highest unemployment rate city in the country. If I don't get a job I have to declare bankruptcy in June. I'm 21. I'm an impulsive little shit. And I should not of done that. And I do agree, I'm a fucking idiot. I just really, really wanted to go to America for my 21st. I had never left the country. 

I lived with my grandparents from the ages of 2 to 18. When I graduated high school I was forced to move on campus or be sent to my ice smoking mother in a different state. Regardless if I was accepted into uni. The catch? I had to pay for it, out right, with my own money (as most kids do, but I thought because of the circumstances, they would of paid for the first year at least since I had no choice.) They are wealthy people. I was 17 going on 18. The money I was saving at my job during my first summer out of high school, they convinced me I was saving for my trip to the US. It wasn't until I was accepted into my uni accommodation that they dropped the bombshell on me. I had to fork out $13k. They thought it was funny. Then they expected me to move home after my first year. As someone who suffers severe depression from just living under that roof, it was a no go. I was staying on campus for my sanity. (I kept telling them during high school that I thought I had depression, they just laughed in my face. Turns out, I was, severely, and I am now on medication for it still.)
 
Yes, they have bailed me out in the last year. They did. And they know I pay back as I always have. I'm just unemployed and not earning any money (every time I see them, the first question is 'when are you paying us back?' knowing fully well that I am unemployed with bills to pay.) I honestly have no money to even feed myself. Thankfully I get fed on campus during the week. On the weekend, my boyfriend feeds me. But my lovely grandmother told me today that if I don't get a job, and I do have to file for bankruptcy, tough luck. No money. No bail out. Can't afford anything? Get your boyfriend to pay for it, or his parents. Don't ask us for any money. We have it, but we just feel like teaching you a lesson. She then proceeded to tell me what happens after you file for bankruptcy. It's not good. And it would ruin my life.

I feel like they just want me to fail. They could easily help me. They just don't want to. The loan is minuscule for them as it's $5,800. If I was employed, I could pay it off easy and still be financially stable. No problem. I just can't seem to get a job. I have handed in close to 50 resume's in the last 2 months. Problem is? So are other university kids. Just when I think I have the job, some one with more experience comes along. I've worked in HR, I know how to resume. I don't know. I just can't seem to find a job. 

Due to the stuff that happened on my trip, my 8 month old, newly fixed iPhone 6 was stolen. They refused to help me. They even said 'It wasn't your fault...but we aren't helping you get a new one. Buy a cheap one from the supermarket'. Thankfully I have travel insurance but that has been a fucked up cycle that takes up to 14 working days to process any new information they need. Which they don't fucking tell you they need. They wait after the 10 working days, wait for you to ring them to see what is going on and then they go '...oh yeah we need this as well, send that to us and it will take another 14 working days...soz'. This has been going on for 2 fucking months. My phone was stolen the day before my 21st at Venice Beach by a homeless guy. Grandparents don't care. It is $500 to replace the phone. They just shrug at me and say 'When can we have the phone back?' 

The insurance should be approved in early March but jesus christ Allianz has the worst customer service ever. 

Then I also find out today there is a very real chance I may have Lupus which seems to be very hereditary in my fucked up family. My grandmother does have it, my mother was just diagnosed with it and I have been showing symptoms. Fucking jim dandy. I kinda wish my boyfriend would message me more asking if I was okay. I'm not. I'm not keeping it together. I guess league of legends is a little more important then his girlfriend having a breakdown. Don't get me wrong, I respect bro time. I just really need him. All I want is a message from him asking me if I'm okay. I don't think I'm going to get that. 

They told me all High School, 'go to uni'. Now that I'm here they tell me that uni is pointless. They praise my pot smoking, unemployed, dirty aunty to the sky and would drop anything for her. But I'm just the granddaughter that goes to uni and is poor. I think they have already written me off as a failure. I'm the only one in my whole family to go to uni. I have a stable relationship (although sometimes I wish he would maybe not play games and talk to me), I have great friends, internships with a great pay lined up later in the year (unfortunately too late for when I would have to file for bankruptcy. They start in July.) And to be honest by the end of Feb 2017, I won't have any debt due to my internships. It's just when I start them, it would be too late. 

I know I sound incredibly privileged, but I'm not. My grandparents are rich. I'm not. My mother is a drug addict. I haven't seen my biological father since I was 6. I have severe depression and anxiety and paranoia. My adopted uncle has Alcohol Fetus Syndrome, he sufferers from paranoia. When my grandma found out about mine, she made it all about him. My aunty has anxiety from all the weed she smokes (like she is a chronic weed smoker), they jump up and down when she needs something. Me? 'Oh well, go talk to a therapist. Sort it out yourself.'   

I don't know what I've done to them. All my life I just wanted them to be proud of me. I've done so much just to hear them say that they are proud. I just feel like because I'm horrible with finances, they have shoved me off and written me down as a lost cause. I was never taught how to money. I wanted help. They never gave it to me. I kept everything bottled up to the point that I was drowning in debt. 

Now I can't sleep at night because I'm stressed and scared. About my finances, phone and my possible lupus diagnoses which is going to cost me a lot if I have it. I feel so alone. 

TL;DR: Uni student cries about how hard her life is. Just needed to get it out. I'm going off to cry now. Bye. "

Wall of text ahead. TL;DR, was an emotional eater, went through emotionally trying times, learned to stop suppressing emotions with food, am finally coming out the otherwise healthier for the wear. Documentation at http://imgur.com/a/D1OJU *** 

Here are some side-by-sides to give you some context as you read. 

http://i.imgur.com/CIPlN6R.png and http://i.imgur.com/jrb1Fab.png 

**Background:** Without going into too many unnecessary details, I was brought up to be an emotional eater, it is what was modeled for me and in many cases what was told to me. Sad? Food will make you feel better. Happy? Celebrate with food! Bored? Let’s eat! When I was younger this was not the biggest deal as I was active enough to keep the weight off for the most part. I became heavy through high school after witnessing the death of someone very close to me, but shortly after starting college and a really nice job the weight came off. I was still probably an emotional eater but I was busy enough and happy enough that it wasn’t really an issue. 

**When Things Turned for the Worse:** When I was on my own and focused on my work and academic pursuits things were smooth sailing. The emotional eating hit and hit hard when stressors started to pile up. I got married and my wife really struggled with her emotional wellbeing to the point of needing acute care several times. During those times I had little support and few people to talk to so I turned to food and, to an extent, alcohol. Once everything we dealt with we decided to start our family and, in a rather ill-advised move, I decided to pursue doctoral level studies concurrently. This would have been stressful enough, however those stresses were multiplied as my wife suffered from terrible postpartum depression and, shortly after that was dealt with, our son was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The eating and alcohol use went into high gear. Once I felt like things were somewhat under control my father suffered a stroke, we welcomed a second child who screamed for the first six months of her life, my wife required even more acute care in the postpartum phase and beyond, my dissertation had to be restarted as someone published a very similar study just before my study was about to start, my father then died. All and all it was a shitty seven years and, as you will see in my complete progress album (http://imgur.com/a/D1OJU) the stress of the years took their toll due to my own inability to stop using food and alcohol to avoid my emotions. 

**When Things Changed:** At the end of all of that chaos my body was finally telling me it was time for a change. I had hit 257 lbs., developed GERD, and wound up in the ER for what I thought was a heart attack but what was really just really bad GERD symptoms. I could barely keep up with my kids, felt physically uncomfortable everywhere I went, and felt socially and emotionally uncomfortable as I became more and more aware of just how much weight I had put on. This was especially difficult when, in the course of grad school, I was assigned to a lab that studied weight and eating. All signs pointed for a need for a change. 

**What I did:** I kept it simple. Alcohol had to go first, and for the most part it did. I went from one to two glasses of wine nearly every night (which also meant snacking while drinking) to one to two a week and only when on dates with my wife. That alone helped me drop the first ten pounds in a flash. More importantly, it forced me to deal with my emotions rather than shutting them off with food and alcohol. The more I made myself sit with uncomfortable emotions the easier it got, the more I understood them, and the more likely I was to do something productive with those feelings rather than making the choice to use them as an excuse to shut myself down and self-destruct. I then focused on simply making healthier choices and avoiding snacking unless it was a very busy day where I knew I could not schedule my meals well. That helped me drop the next 15 pounds. I then plateaued and so I turned to MyFitnessPal to get more reliable data and, as it turns out, while the “healthier” choices I was making were certainly better than what I had been eating they did not qualify as healthy. As a scientist a value data in decision making, MFP gave me the data I needed. That, along with increased physical activity, has led to a consistent loss of at least two pounds per week for months now. 

**My Victories:** I realized a few weeks into my efforts that many of my major victories would coincide with each other and so saved them for one post rather than pestering people with multiple posts. So, the victories I have experienced in the last month include, but are not limited to, 

* **ONE-derland!** As of this morning I am 198 pounds, the first time I have been less than 200 pounds in a very long time. It feels great.

* **Half way there!** As of mid-January I hit my half-way point.  I started at 257 and wanted to get to 160. I am now 9 pounds beyond the half way point, having lost 58 pounds altogether. That means just 39 pounds to go and only three pounds until I transition from Obese to Overweight. 

* **People are noticing!** Over the past few weeks people I had not seen in a while started noticing my progress, then people who I see every day started saying things. My wife and I posted pictures of a weekend out and EVERYONE noticed. That also feels great. 

* **I am noticing!** I still hate the way my body looks, make no mistake about it. But it looks better and feels better and I notice it every day. I am not winded as much, I have more energy, I am shifting around in my seat less. What’s more, ANYTHING I pull out of the drawers or closet fits and, in some cases, feels loose. Close I have not been able to wear in years I can wear again, and I’ve even gone shopping and have purchased a few transition-weight items that make me feel more confident. 

**Why am I sharing:** I am sharing this because I could not have done it without this subreddit, the related subreddits, and the folks who encourage me on MFP. Because I still live in a family of emotional eaters and am somewhat socially isolated while I finish internship I have had little practical support, though everyone in my life certainly gives me positive feedback on the results they can see. Having all of my digital colleagues share their stories and tips for success has really helped give me in edge in this effort and so I consider this not only a personal victory, but another victory for everyone here and another piece of evidence for anyone struggling or just starting out that change can happen. I hope to report back come August when I should, in theory, hit my goal weight.

Thanks everyone, and keep up the good work! If anyone else has felt that emotional eating has been their downfall, especially if you are struggling right now, reach out to someone. Talk about it. If you have nobody PM me. Seriously, getting around emotional eating was the best thing that ever happened to me and you can do it too!"

4711nn,15,2016-02-22,Rejected job after job...what's a graduate got to do to stand out?,charlagold,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4711nn/rejected_job_after_jobwhats_a_graduate_got_to_do/,"I graduated university at the end of 2014, and although I knew it would be hard to get a job in my field (journalism/writing), I presumed that doing a number of internships would get my foot in the door. During uni, I did a 3 week internship to accompany studying. Since graduating, i've done 3 more internships. In total, it's been 6 months worth of internships that have all been unpaid. The last one I did was 3 months long full time, I was given the opportunity to publish my work, and on the side I have been doing some freelance writing for several websites, so I've got quite a strong portfolio at the moment. At the last internship I did, one of my 'mentors' offered her CV for me to use as a template, which was very valuable to me as she has the career I should like to pursue. I have also had people in my field who are employed to help me with my cover letter several times.
For some reason though, I'm just not standing out. Nearly every job I apply to I get ignored or rejected. In some cases, I have been invited the interview but not made it past the next stage. Usually they never give feedback, but on the odd occasion they'll say they gave the role to someone with more experience who were willing to take on a junior. I find this quite unfair that they are giving graduate roles to people who have like 5 years experience?! I've tried to let it not get me down, and have been applying to temp jobs as well, but those are proving to be a struggle too. I would totally understand if I was fresh out of uni with no experience whatsoever, but i'm starting to think that 6 months working for free was a waste of time, when at the time I thought 'Ok, I'm not getting paid, but it will be worth it in the end'.

I've been offered more unpaid internship opportunities, full time, that range from 1-3 months but I simply cannot afford it anymore. If it were for a shorter period, like 2 weeks or so I would definitely take that on, or perhaps if they were offering only one or two days a week. While I was interning before, I had to work at the weekends in order to support myself and had to move back home after University.
So I just want to pose the question, what do you think would make a candidate stand out when applying for a job? I know I'm not the only one facing this issue, there are so many other graduates out there facing the tough job market.

Thanks :)"

Since our interns don’t last more than month, they all either don’t get it or fail there exams several times, the other guy had a psychotic break, after falling asleep on a train and waking up thinking God was trying to kill him, Seriously that happened. I think I should go, but it would hurt this company to go, at the same time since we handle mostly Microsoft, I realized that I allowed myself to specialize and not also learn the different OS’s in-depth and other virtualization technologies, so I am concerned that I may not be an appealing prospect.

471j9n,40,2016-02-22,The Salt Marsh,marbleopia,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/471j9n/the_salt_marsh/,"The police are ruling it a suicide, but I don’t think it’s quite that simple. I was there, and I know what I saw.

This is hard to write, because it happened so recently, but I don’t really know who else I can tell this story too. It’s not that I don’t want people to think I’m crazy. I don’t want them to think that I’m lying, that I’m besmirching her memory or diminishing what she did. Small towns in New England are like small towns anywhere – people like to talk, and they’re quick to judge.

Especially in our group. In high school everyone talked about leaving when they graduated. Then we graduated, and a lot of us did leave. Throughout those four years a number of us started trickling back in, transferring schools to save money or be closer to home. There was no shame in it. At least, not to me. I was one of the ones that stayed at home after high school, commuting to the nearby branch of our state university of my parent’s house. Who was I to judge?

My best friend, on the other hand, was one of the most ambitious people I’ve ever met. I always envied her commitment to her own future. She knew exactly what she wanted and how to get it. She graduated from Fordham (not too-too far, but out of New England, and a different enough environment, being so close to the city and all) in five years with a major in organic chemistry and a minor in math. Yeah, this bitch was smart. 

The summer after we graduated she came home. I was really grateful. I went to visit her at school a bunch of times, but I’m one of those people who gets bogged down just by the daily grind. It took her five years to get two degrees, it took me six to finish with one. Illustration. Oh, gee.

Anyway, by the time she was came home my visits had fallen to about one or two a year. I had friends that I passed the time with at home, and a long term boyfriend to keep me company, but there’s no one like your best friend. I was really hoping she would be home for good, but of course she wasn’t. She got an internship down in Virginia. She was gone from November to April, and by the time she came back she was talking about med school. And not at any school nearby, no. She was talking about Washington, California, even England. She was going to cure cancer, but she wasn’t going to do it in our backyard.

Me and the boyfriend had broken up at this point. I was 23 now and was kind of accepting the fact that, while I might be content with staying home, Michelle was born to roam. One of my other friends, Annie, had filled Michelle’s role after my breakup. Michelle and I would always be friends, I knew, even if we weren’t physically close.

So you can imagine my surprise when Michelle announced she was applying to Brown and Yale. She was going to stay closer to home after all. I like to think that it had something to do with me, but it wasn’t. It was a guy, of course. A guy we had gone to high school with. He hadn’t really been in our circle, but everyone knew him and he was well liked. It wasn’t like there was a history of jilted or unrequited love between them that was playing out now, years later – there just was no history to begin with. Their circles never crossed until we were in our twenties. 

If I’m honest, it kind of pissed me off that she would stay home for a guy. She’d been through a couple of boyfriends in the past that couldn’t keep up with her, and she’d never let them hold her back. And God knows, me and her family weren’t enough to hold her back, either. She was dedicated to the point that it made her an asshole at times. Her school put a pretty steep financial burden on her family, but to her, that was beside the point. She didn’t care much that anyone missed her when she went away. It was kind of like she didn’t realize it was possible for people to depend on her for anything. Nothing emotional, anyway. In her mind there was no such thing as emotional dependence.

Michelle got accepted to Yale School of Medicine, but she never went. She got pregnant. You would think someone as smart and ambitious as her would be more careful about things like that, but if you want my honest opinion, I think she was cracking under pressure. She just didn’t want to admit it to anyone, not even herself. And the saddest thing is that we all loved her regardless of her accomplishments. She put all that pressure on herself. 

She and the boyfriend got engaged and found a place to rent from this elderly couple. It was a small house on their property, at the edge of a salt marsh. If you’re not familiar with a salt marsh, you can kind of picture a swamp, with the difference that a salt marsh floods and drains with the tide. They are truly beautiful, like wet, grassy beaches. They generally aren’t deep, but with some (and this is true of the one near Michelle’s new house) if you go too far out you can find yourself in the ocean.

Alright. I know I’m probably boring you, but I wanted you to know what kind of person Michelle was, the good and the bad, so you can understand how strange her behavior started to become. But from now on I’m just going to cut to the chase.

It wasn’t long after they moved into the little house. At first they loved it. The old couple in the main house were really nice, they were amiable but not nosy, etc. The view of the marsh and the ocean beyond were incredible. For the first time Michelle admitted to me that she could understand why someone wouldn’t want to leave. I knew she was talking about me, but you know. I didn’t want to be a dick. I was just glad she could finally be content here the way I was.

Then I started noticing the bags under her eyes. Her hair, which was curly before, was turning into a rat’s nest. She told me she was having trouble sleeping and she was too tired to shower and comb her hair. Like everyone else, I just attributed it to her being pregnant.

Then she had the baby. A little girl they named Gabrielle, Gabby for short. Obviously I’m not a mother myself, but I’m the oldest of four, so I tried to help out as much as I could. Any time I wasn’t working I would be at Michelle and Dan’s house. And if I wasn’t there, the old woman they were renting the house from would come by.

I felt like I was more her mom than Michelle was at times. I’d be watching TV or something, holding the baby, feeding her, burping her, while Michelle stood at the window, staring out at the marsh. And Dan worked a lot, so he wasn’t usually home. It was just me and the baby. I say that because there were times when I couldn’t really count Michelle as really being there, she was so spaced out.

She wasn’t always staring out the window. She slept a lot, too. She didn’t eat much and she lost a lot of weight. She pumped a lot of her breast milk because we couldn’t always count on her to be awake when Gabby needed to be fed. She got mastitis pretty bad at one point because she just wasn’t taking care of herself.

I was worried, and so was everyone else, but we figured she needed time. My mother had suffered with post-partum depression after the second two kids, so I had already seen it first hand and knew she would come out of it eventually. In the meantime we were there for her and the baby, we encouraged her to eat and sleep and bathe.

I was holding out hope until the morning I got the phone call. 

“Amber?” Michelle sounded frightened, and I pictured her hiding somewhere, clutching the baby, who I could hear crying in the background.

My heart started to race. I am a habitually late riser, and it was maybe 9AM when I got the call, but as soon as I heard that tone of fear in her voice I was wide awake, my mind racing. I was thinking that someone had broken in, or there had been an accident, or the baby was deathly ill and needed to be brought to the hospital.

I sat up in bed, ready to jump out and throw on some clothes.

“What’s wrong?”

“It’s – it’s Gabby.”

“Is she sick?”

“No, she just – she’s crying, but it’s not her crying. It’s not her voice.”

Huh. I was getting out of bed now, but I was moving more slowly. Michelle seemed confused and scared, she wasn’t explaining herself well, but by the time I hung up and was on my way I thought I understood what was going on. The baby was crying, but what Michelle heard wasn’t the sound of a baby crying. She heard a woman, sobbing in agony. A woman crying through her infant daughter’s mouth.

I admit, it gave me chills, the thought of it, but at this point I didn’t really know what to think. I was beginning to be scared, but I was scared for the baby, not Michelle.

I went right in when I got there, like I always do. I found Michelle standing in front of the window, holding Gabby, bouncing her. Gabby was asleep. Michelle turned when she heard me come in. Her face was pale and even from across the room I could see the sheen of sweat.

“Hey,” she said.

“Are you alright?”

She frowned. Then she nodded. I took the baby, who woke up and started crying again. Michelle shrank away from me, her face contorted, her mouth twisted in a horrible grimace.

“There it is again!” she screamed.

My mouth kind of dropped. All I heard was a baby crying, but she looked at me like I was holding an axe, not a baby. Like, yeah, hearing a baby cry is awful, but the way she described it on the phone – the heart wrenching gasps of a grown woman – I was not hearing any of that.

Immediately I thought I knew that Michelle had snapped. The baby was too much for her, the depression was worse than we thought. I needed to call Dan and her parents and tell them. She needed therapy, or medication, or something. Holding Gabby in one arm and taking my phone out of my pocket with the other, I went outside. I know it probably wasn’t the best idea, leaving Michelle alone in the house, but I could see how much she was bothered by Gabby crying and I just needed to get the baby somewhere Michelle couldn’t hear so I could calm her down.

First I called Dan and got his voicemail. I left a message – just real quick, “Hey, it’s Amber. It’s Michelle. She’s really not okay.” Then I called Michelle’s mother and quickly explained what had just happened. She was upset, but she didn’t have any idea what to do, and before she hung up she said she was going to call her husband and see what he thought was best. She sounded so sad when she said goodbye that I almost started crying.

After the two phone calls, I walked around outside with Gabby until she fell asleep, hiccoughing. We found ourselves at the edge of the backyard where thorny bushes separated the sturdy lawn from the shifting mud of the marsh. A heron balanced on one leg somewhere near the middle and gulls squawked overhead. The smell of salt stung the inside of my nose.

Then I felt tingles on the back of my neck. I turned around slowly, but I already knew what I would see. Michelle in the window, staring. But she wasn’t looking at us, she was looking at the marsh. I followed her gaze but all I saw were birds and the tall grass bending with the wind.

This is turning out to be way longer than I thought it would be. I have to stop for now but I’ll update as soon as I can. After this point, things didn’t just go downhill. They dropped off the edge of a cliff.

471krg,17,2016-02-22,Go to the Resume Workshop tonight if you're a Computer Science student,_J_,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/471krg/go_to_the_resume_workshop_tonight_if_youre_a/,"Hi /r/UMD,

It's that time of semester again when the CS Career Fair is coming up and students frantically get their resumes ready.

I am a UMD CS alum who is at the university this week to recruit for Microsoft. In the past two semesters that I've visited the university, I've looked through a lot of resumes and unfortunately a lot of students misrepresent themselves.

During the career fair, I always hear at least one student say ""I wish I went to the resume workshop"". So here's a reminder. Come to the resume workshop. Instead of the 30 seconds I normally get to read your resume and talk to you during the career fair, we get 5 minutes to talk about your experience and how to make your resume look impressive.

Plus, in 3 days when you give me your resume at the career fair, I can just take it and ask you any additional questions because you already had 5 minutes more than everyone else to talk to me!

**What**: CS Resume Workshop

**When**: 5pm to 7:30pm

**Where**: CSIC - Room 1115

*(Last time I was here, students requested that I post messages like this because they didn't know when Microsoft/other events were)*

EDIT: Pro Tip. Bring a few copies of your resume so the recruiters can write on them. It's a lot easier to remember their advice when you let them draw all over your resume :)

Pro Tip 2: Put your graduation month/year on your resume. Every recruiter needs it so they know whether you're looking for Full time or Internship

**tl;dr go to the resume workshop, seriously.**"

I have been applying for the extremely limited number of UX internships and graduate jobs in and around London, but sadly no avail! It seems recruiters and companies give me the ""You are a fantastic candidate for the role, but sadly they/we are looking for someone with 6-12months experience for the junior/graduate role.""


So where do you all suggest can a newbie like myself start learning skills that will assist me in learning more about UX? I've subscribed to a few podcasts, such as, UX Intern and UX-Radio. I have also just purchased Bill Buxton's sketching user experiences book.


Are there any reading materials, audiobooks, web courses and programs I should familiarize myself with e.g. Axure that will aid a newbie like myself?


Hopefully this post is not a complete mess but I really enjoyed the HCI module I completed and reading some UX job listings and books seems like it will be a great fit for myself. 

Even if you do not post thanks a lot for reading this. If you know of anything feel free to post I'm sure someone else in the future will stumble across this and it might help them too!  Thanks again. "
471x67,179,2016-02-22,My graduate advisor tried to have a sexual relationship with me. When I declined his several advances our working relationship was never the same. He then attempted to slander my character and ruin my professional career.,Secretsaheavyburden,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/471x67/my_graduate_advisor_tried_to_have_a_sexual/,"This is a throwaway account as this is very personal. I have a PhD in a science-related field, but obtaining that degree was not easy for several reasons. I worked under a male advisor for 8 years that was emotionally manipulative, deceitful, and extremely inappropriate with women. At the beginning of our working relationship he provided me with incredible career-accelerating opportunities that I took full advantage of. I worked so hard, learning everything I could. Along the way I became friends and colleagues with his friends and foreign colleagues. I even worked with them on several projects. Then I realized his motives. He tried on several occasions to have a more-than-working relationship with me. 

One of the most frightening instances of this was when he sent me to a foreign country for an internship to work with him and his colleagues. When I arrived at this foreign country late in the evening I was exhausted and delirious from the 9 hour flight. He was there at the airport to take me to my hotel. When I arrived at my hotel, it was the hotel he had been staying at. More specifically, the very room he had been staying in. There was no room for me like we'd agreed on. I didn't know what to do. He was my lifeline in a foreign country where I had no money, no working cell phone and did not know the language. I was terrified. The only thing I could do was insist he slept on the couch and I had to sleep in the bed he had clearly been sleeping in. I was extremely uncomfortable. 

On another occasion he was driving several of his colleagues around the local area, giving a tour of sorts. I was included. I didn't think it was much of an issue since there were so many other people. After everyone was dropped off I was left in the car. He took me to one last place. A scenic overlook with views of jagged, rocky cliffs and the crystal blue ocean. It was certainly beautiful but what happen next was not. Turned out it was a resort. He ordered drinks and got drunk. He couldn't drive me to my hotel (this time I actually had my own hotel room). So he got us a room at this resort. And despite being a well-known tenured professor he didn't have enough money for me to have my own room. So I insisted we have separate beds. I go to the room and it's a king bed. He said they were out of double beds. I tried to speak to the front desk but the language barrier was definitely an issue. He finally got us a room with separate beds, which was the only compromise I could come up with given the situation. 

Throughout that whole internship he would give me inappropriate neck/back massages while I was working in my office. He even picked up my hand in front of his colleagues at a restaurant and started massaging it. I pulled it away but they already saw. I was so embarrassed. 

When I came home from the internship, his persistence continued. He came up with work-related reasons to go out to dinner, for him to come over to my house, for me to go to his house. He walked me to my car. He insisted I work in his office with him. As I became more serious with my boyfriend (now husband) this behavior stopped. Then it began to change, slowly and subtly. He started to go out of his way to embarrass me in front of other students/colleagues, trying to make me look stupid if I didn't know the answer to something or if I asked a question. I hated asking him questions so I just stopped altogether. I dreaded going to meetings in his office. Every meeting he would yell at me for something or embarrass me in front of his other students. I was constantly in trouble for reasons that were never clear. It's like he would just invent reasons. It started to affect me in my other classes. I was afraid to speak out in class for fear he would knit pick everything I did. I made a mistake answering a question in class and he brought it up for 3 weeks. I finally told him to let it drop. This happened frequently. By this point our working relationship was crumbling to dust. 

Fast forward until just before graduation and his behavior becomes intolerable. He began to alienate me from my friends, and professors in my program. He and another professor he was friends with would clearly pick on me in class. It was a seminar class so it wasn't uncommon that several professors were present. They would give me the more complicated papers to read, interrupt my presentations, and ask me ridiculous question in front of the class. His resentment towards me intensified when he hired a pretty blonde girl in her early 20s that was in a business related major. She was showered with trips to France, conferences, and special attention. I knew what he was doing. He had a new victim and it disgusted me that he was going to try this with another girl. He would bring her to sit in the graduate seminar classes. Everyone knew what was going on and it was so awkward. I knew that's what they though of me too. I was numb by this point. He had a stronghold in my life and it showed. It was severely affecting me and it was perfect for his plan. He began to alienate me from the other professors using my behavior as example for his claims that I wasn't cutting it. In reality it was him. He was the reason. His twisted, manipulative behavior was the reason. I was a passion-filled, driven, intense person before I met him. Now my light was fading.

At the beginning of the summer right before my supposed graduation we had a meeting. He tells me ""I'm old"" (yeah sorry I'm not 22 anymore), ""I'm heading off the edge of a cliff"", he ""didn't want to be my advisor anymore"" and he would ""never write me another reference letter."" He also told me how several of the professors in the program weren't happy with me (I realize now this was part of his alienation technique). He said all these things with a twisted smirk on his face and I was disgusted. He was enjoying it. I am certain he waited to tell me these things right before I headed off to my internship over the summer. It came out of the blue.

I absolutely loved working at my internship. The people I worked with were amazing, professional and friendly. My advisor knew I enjoyed it and attempted to ruin my relationship with my internship advisor by telling him I wasn't doing well back at school and to keep an eye on me. He even visited my internship advisor (which normally doesn't happen) and said more untrue things about me. It was absolute garbage and I am so fortunate my internship advisor saw through it. But unfortunately my advisor didn't stop there. At the end of that summer I found out he told our program chair back at school that he didn't want to pay me because I was lazy. It's funny how he said this while I was in another state working 10 hr days running experiments at a national lab for my prestigious internship. 

That fall I ended up taking a huge pay cut to teach just so I could stay in the program since my fellowship ran out. At the beginning of that fall semester my advisor, the program chair and I  agreed I could graduate. While teaching 3 classes I wrote my dissertation. It was the hardest 6 months of my life having to teach, write, and deal with his behavior. I remember an email he sent me while I was teaching a class. He said I was ungrateful and I never thanked him for sending me on trips to foreign countries and conferences, and giving me amazing opportunities. It was ridiculous. I am a very grateful, blessed person. I've thanked him numerous times despite these were the situation in which he was inappropriate. He made it seem like I forever owed him. I was beholden to him.

Near the end of the fall semester, I had met all the graduation deadlines and my dissertation was almost completed. I had to fight him just to proof read my drafts. He would tell me he was too busy or he would half ass the edits or keep changing his mind. Delete this paragraph. Move this graph. Change that. But then he would change his mind and want it the way it was or some way that didn't make sense. He attempted to send me in circles. After my final draft he told me I could't graduate. I'm absolutely convinced he waited until I was done writing to tell me this. I told him that I was determined to graduate. I was so done with his behavior and I wanted out. I submitted my dissertation to my committee. I'm pretty certain that only 2/4 professors in my committee actually read it. I suspect my advisor and his friend (the one that picked on me in class) did not read it in as much depth as the other two member or even at all. Nevertheless I believe he manipulated my committee to agree that I needed to stick around another semester. And he was actually going to pay me for spring. He looked like a hero for paying me, but in reality he was only going to match the pittance I made teaching. Let's say it wasn't even enough to cover my rent. All of the other students in the program were making 2-3 times as much. That's when I made a very important decision: to go to the program chair. I realized he had the power to keep me from graduating and I had to do something about it. 

A few days before I went to the chair I went to a weekly meeting in my advisors office. He had a student in there deleting all of my advisors emails from his computer. He mentioned to the student ""delete everything up until 20XX."" It was the year I started working for him. Then he says, ""I don't want anyone to know my business."" He had found out that I was going to talk with the chair and he was covering his tracks. I was shocked, disgusted, horrified all at once. I told the chair everything. Everything I should have told her years ago. She asked me why I didn't come to her earlier. There were many reasons why. I thought it would be difficult to see him everyday in class, or in the hallway, or at journal club after coming forward. Most importantly I thought it would ruin my career. Although now I feel that either way it would have. If I had switched advisors earlier he still would have had the opportunity to slander my name and spread lies about my work ethic and character. That's who he is. He indeed spread deceitful things about me to cover his behavior. If he got to other people first then how could they believe my side of the story? He was a masterful manipulator. When I graduated I was the laughing stock of the department. He carefully crafted it to be that way and I had no power to change it. I feel like it was easier for people in the department to go along with his attack on my character than to address the real problem. Everyone in the department suspected he was inappropriate with young women and students but no one said anything until me. The chair had heard rumors but no one had actually come forward. I was close to filing a Title IX but at the time I wanted to start a new life. My husband got an incredible job and we were moving far away. I didn't want to drag my emotions through the mud anymore. 

My biggest mistake was choosing to ignore his inappropriate behavior, trying to deal with it and forget it happened for all those years. No good working relationship could have ever come out of my situation. But here I am now. A lot wiser but still struggling with this. I miss my friends and foreign colleagues tremendously. These were incredible people I knew and worked with for 8 years. I haven't heard a single word from any of them since I graduated. I feel like he got to them. Who knows what he said about me to them. I feel like deep down they won't believe him but then again I haven't heard from them. I don't know what to do. My field is so small and tight knit. I feel alienated from any career in the field that I love so much. I devoted so much of my life to this passion. I am so frustrated with men in power like him that can continue enjoying a lucrative career while getting away with acting so inappropriately. I struggle with contacting my former colleagues in hopes of a job opportunity. I miss working with data. I miss conferences, coding, and computers. I miss seeing spectra no one has ever seen before. I miss tackling some of the big open question in science. I miss working for a prestigious national lab. I miss operating million-dollar instruments. I can't let him take that away from me. I am a huge supporter of women in science, and I know many of you are too. Please know this kind of thing still occurs and it can be devastating if we let it. I graciously ask for constructive advice from this community. *Should I contact my former colleagues?* Finding work right now has been challenging and they may have opportunities for me. *If I should contact them, what should I say? How would I handle myself if I saw him again at say a conference? How do I overcome this while being gracious yet strong? How do I let my friends/colleagues know the truth?* I am prepared that they may never know what really happened. *So I guess my question becomes how can I reclaim my reputation as a smart, hard-working, dedicated, professional scientist?*

**TL;DR:** My graduate advisor tried to have a sexual relationship with me. I declined his advances, ignored them, and attempted to continue a working relationship. I put up with 8 years of manipulative, deceitful, inappropriate behavior. He tried to slander my character, and ruin my chances at a professional career, especially after I told the department chair and other officials what happened. Need advice (read last paragraph for more detail).

**Update:** I just want to sincerely thank everyone for their comments, advice and support. I read them all (tearfully) and just couldn't believe the amount of support I felt from complete strangers, both male and female. Both perspective were incredible to hear. I wish so much I would have posted earlier, perhaps when this was actually happening right before graduation. Let my mistakes be a lesson. I didn't know that I could talk with the universitie's ombusman, or that I could have gotten a lawyer involved (seems obvious but not at the time). I have to say that I was extremely lucky my chair was female. She listened to me and took swift action (removing him from my committee). She is the one that took my story all the way to the dean. NASA was amazing too. I happened to catch them doing interviews at my school concerning sexual harassment. I am the one who chose to end this and not pursue Title IX. You could say I was weary from my battle and ready to move on. But I am certainly not ready to give up. These comments have given me such a motivational boost. I have so many incredible accomplishments. Not many people have traveled the world for science. Have used one of the largest telescopes in the world. Have a paper in Nature. Have worked for a large space agency. I did that and I'm not letting it go to waste. I'm not sure if I can say goodbye to my field just yet. I'm going to bet on the fact that good character, a hard-working attitude, good colleagues, and a hopeful prayer can go a long way in getting me my dream job. I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do but I'm on the hunt now. I also have the courage to send a simple, friendly *how are you doing?* email to my former colleagues. Just know that all your comments made a difference in my life. Thank you."

Currently, I have a lot of pressure from my dad to pursue something in engineering as my sister had previously done a masters degree and told him that she wanted to study something else, putting his pockets under some serious stress. So he doesn't want me to go off into another field after he has sponsored me to do this. Also, I don't want to end up wasting his money in the long term.

I'm afraid that I'm quite complacent and now, after three years of engineering, can say that I've lost interest in it, then again, I haven't been exposed to it much more than my course and a short internship. I've applied for various graduate schemes and internships but so far, I've been rejected by all but one of them in a telecommunications company back in my home country (I'm studying in the U.K).

I have a few options:

-Continue my studies

-Find a job (not related to my course)

-Find a job (related to my course)

-Tell dad that I'd like a year off to find out what I'd like to do

Thing is, I also wouldn't have a plan for that year and I've been pondering this for weeks now, I really don't know what kind of job I'd like to do. Everything comes to me as an ""okay, yeah I'd give that a shot"", but really, there isn't one thing that I've thought of that I go, ""that's the one!""

I attended college for three years to get an associates degree in Computer Information Systems program, I graduated with honors. It was a jack-of-all trade's program having me touch on Programming with PHP/Html, Microsoft Server, Networking,  Linux, Computer Repair, and a couple other subjects.

I've had the worst time trying to locate a job in the area, having applied to multiple jobs, gone through a few interviews and being turned down for lack of experience. I've tried to get into an internship in IT to get some experience, but also recently got denied for the internship with a possibility of them looking into an Internship in April.

I have 0 motivation to continue on getting certifications or proceeding in the field because of the constant denying of possible jobs. I feel like the three years I spent in college was honestly a waste of time and amounts to nothing in the IT world.

Has anyone had problems getting into IT that I am having or lack of motivation in continuing IT because of it?"

4736vv,42,2016-02-22,The Co-Op experience that I won't be submitting in the survey at the end of the semester.,BiouxBioux,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4736vv/the_coop_experience_that_i_wont_be_submitting_in/,"For those of you who don't know, Co-Op is short for Cooperative Education and it offers college students, such as myself, working experience during school. As of now, instead of taking my fourth semester of college, I'm working as an electrical engineering intern at a certain company, which I'll leave nameless. I jumped at the opportunity as soon as I learned about it as a freshman- making money *and* not having going to class? That sounded magnificent to me, even if it would keep me in school for five years instead of four and a half. Halfway through my third semester, when the workload of the engineering curriculum finally got to me in the form of four days without sleep and hands too shaky to handle the soldering gun, I knew I had to get in on it.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, here I am, sitting at my own desk, typing on my own computer (which can’t play music, unfortunately), dressed for work and making $15 an hour in my little Quality Assurance office. It's not as glamorous as I expected, but it pays the bills and letting the stress from school fall off my shoulders feels deliriously amazing. I even have my own ID with my picture on it that lets me access my office and lab, which I think is pretty nifty. It’s a very protected and tight facility since we work on classified material, and I feel very professional and adult-like in my noisy office pumps and ironed pants. I never used to iron my pants- but I digress. The building I work in is *old*, with wide, long hallways that I consider creepy enough to be in a horror movie, which is why I’ll never stay late here again (I have, but that’s a story for another time), but it's the lab that I work in that has led me to post in the subreddit that I thought I'd only read from, never post in. 

&amp;nbsp;

Only a handful of people, including myself and my supervisor, have access to this chemistry lab. It has a total of three rooms, although it's basically an open floor plan since the doors are never closed. A better understanding of my current fear needs a better understanding of the setup of my lab, and sadly, as an engineering major with little to no talent for writing, this may be painful to some of you NoSleep regulars. 

&amp;nbsp;

Upon entering, there is a space- a sad excuse for an entranceway, bare aside from a cork bulletin board with flyers from the 80's still pinned into it advertising faculty picnics and outings. There are three doorways visible as soon as one enters: a door to the left, a doorway (no door) at the right, and a door directly ahead. To the right is where I spend most of my time, which is the x-ray and ionic cleansing room- we’ll call this my room. The x-ray I use is the second youngest thing occupying this lab, with me being the first. It uses the oldest Windows I have ever encountered in my life and runs as fast as anything its age should. Anyone who comes into my room while I’m working (which is forbidden, since I’m operating equipment that emits radiation) can see me at my post at the x-ray machine, and vice versa. From my little seat, the end of my room is visible where it meets the chemical storage room.

&amp;nbsp;

The door to the chemical storage room, which is always open despite the fact that no one ever uses it anymore, is directly ahead when you unlock the door and enter. It’s where most of the chemicals are stored in specific temperature environments and tested, along with blocks of solder and specially formulated alcohols that we use for our PWB’s. This room runs in parallel with my room, and they are connected by the doorway visible from my post. It seems to have had a door in it at one point in time because there are hinges on the doorframe, with paint chipping to reveal their age and rust underneath. I never enter this room; it’s always pitch-black, and the only thing visible within it is this old coat stand. I don’t need anything from in there, anyhow.

&amp;nbsp;

The door to the left, which is also perpetually open, leads into a room that, I’m assuming, is the oldest part of the chem lab. It has an old camera that is larger than me, a machine that simulates temperature scenarios for PWB’s, and a bunch of other old technology that I don’t use or have the intelligence to describe. Like a scene from a Wes Anderson film, the lab is vintage to the point of impropriety. The machines and equipment date back to the 1950's- I'm sure of this since I found love notes between two interns from 1957 flattened in the early pages of an old log book on the desk- and there are reference books on the desk shelves that are in dire need of replacing since their contents have long been disproved or updated by modern day science. I’ve even picked up some knickknacks from this desk while some guys worked on the x-ray machine for maintenance; I found some cool old red ink, a stamper, and some stirring rods that would shape clay nicely (I enjoy clay). However, the most important thing at the desk in this room is the computer, just as up-to-date as the one in my office, but even better- it has speakers! They’re old and clunky, but they work when I plug them into the audio jack, so no complaints here. You see, the thing I used to hate most about this job was how quiet and alone I always am. As the intern, I’m doing an important job- important in the sense that it has to be done, but it’s the job no one wants to do. I don’t get many visitors to the lab (I can’t unless they have x-ray protection), and after a week the silence and isolation began to stress me out. I had tried talking to myself, but that just felt worse. Finding these speakers was akin to discovering my Holy Grail.

&amp;nbsp;

I mentioned this before, but the security on this place is pretty tight. You can’t get in without getting your car checked, swiping your ID, entering a personal pin, and addressing the security guard at the entrances/exits of the building. No personal electronic gadgets are allowed either, and Internet access is limited, which is understandable, but for some reason they haven’t blocked reddit and YouTube- at least not fully. I need my daily dose of NoSleep (self-prescribed 4 hours a day at least) and music, so I’m grateful for these loopholes.

&amp;nbsp;

About two weeks ago, I sought to use IT’s negligence to my advantage. Since the chem room is across the hall from my room, I decided to try to play music from the desktop while I worked. I turned the speakers about three-quarters of the way up, as to not make it so obvious that I was abusing the workplace’s ‘no media streaming’ protocol, and put on a full concert of classical music. It didn’t reach me that well from my perch (I could barely hear the high pitch staccato accents) but it was better than the pure silence I was enduring before I got the idea. 

&amp;nbsp;

About a half an hour or so later, when I had finished with my tasks at the x-ray, I noticed that the music had stopped. I thought this strange since usually concert audio lasts more than an hour at least, so I went over to check on the video I had picked out, already disappointed. When I went to check, however, I noticed that the speakers were unplugged from the audio jack. Since I’m easily creeped out, I booked it and ran back to my office to think it over instead of standing there. There was no way they could have fallen out, that was for sure. No one had come in while I was working, either, and if someone *had* come in, I would’ve heard the door unlock and seen them from my chair. But no one had entered the lab that day aside from me, and that’s how it has always been for the past month I’ve worked here.

&amp;nbsp;

I can already imagine it now, some readers looking at my post and thinking, “Um… Okay? So?” since this isn’t really one of those thrilling, chilling stories that I read on here, but it’s just because I needed to set it up for you. I *need* you to imagine and understand my situation thoroughly before I continue.

&amp;nbsp;

The incident happened today. I had just been given enough x-ray work that I had to stay in the lab from 8am to 10:45 without a break, and just as I was signing my initials into the log book, I saw it. I saw it in the corner of my left eye, where the chem storage room meets my room- a flash of white, stark against the darkness where the light of my room is defeated by the shadow of the chem storage room. When I turned my head to look, it was gone; in its place, only the coat stand, dimly lit, staggering under the weight of blue, white, and gray lab coats. Lab coats! Laughing at myself, I almost let go of the fear that had instantly bloomed within my stomach. Almost.

&amp;nbsp;

The relief was short lived. As I turned to leave, a figure stood in the doorway of the chem lab, directly across from me, at least five feet away. It seemed like a person wearing a sheet, like those ghost costumes that kids used to wear for Halloween, except there were no eye or mouth holes. Whatever or whoever it was just stood there, lit by the light of the entranceway and my room. I’d seen The Conjuring laundry scene enough times to know that I should get away, *now*, but I couldn’t leave without passing in front of it or turning my back on it. With my heart beating in my chest, hard enough to allow me to hear it drumming, pumping in my ears, I asked it a question purely out of protocol.

&amp;nbsp;

“This is a radiation area. For your safety, I have to ask you to lea-“

&amp;nbsp;

Despite standing at a distance too far from the door, it slammed the door in my face. I just *knew* it was its doing even if it didn’t make any movement. Then I bolted. I was so panicked that at first I struggled to use the doorknob to let myself out but when I finally managed to turn the damn thing I burst through the door and sprinted to my office, dodging several other puzzled employees along the way. When I got back to my office, I realized I had worked up a sweat, but I felt cold. I was actually freezing, and my teeth were chattering so loudly that my supervisor asked if I was alright. I didn’t know what to say. I can’t tell her about what had happened; I can’t afford to lose this internship. I phoned my boyfriend for some comfort but it didn’t help at all. I’m praying that I don’t get any more work requests that require me to return to the lab today. I don’t know if I can take it. I guess I was never really alone after all."

Management is keen to start me learning Salesforce development, recommending I skill myself up for the Platform Developer I certification.


As a beginner who is just starting my career my concern is that I am limiting myself to one platform too early, and that skills that I learn working with Salesforce won't be applicable elsewhere, making it hard for me to find jobs in other fields such as Java or .NET development. I've read about COBOL developers and other similar cases where people are struggling now as the skills they learned weren't adaptable and I'm worried about falling into the same trap. 


Is this a valid concern? What could I do to mitigate the risks? Should I just avoid Salesforce in favour of more broad skills (eg Java) or is it a viable long-term career path?

I am in graduate school. I applied for a diversity internship program held county-wide. It is one of very, very few paid internship programs for people in my year. The application required extensive personal and research essays as well as professional recommendations. I probably spent about 10-12 hours total on the application. Before applying, however, I attended an information session to ask whether candidates of only certain races were supposed to apply (I am 100% Caucasian; my mother came from a European country, but I am still Caucasian by ethnicity) and was told the program was intended for diverse candidates of different backgrounds and not at all based on race. So, I applied.

I was selected for an interview. I was one of three white applicants selected for an interview (they sent out a list of interviewees and I knew many of them personally from school; maybe 30-40 others selected in total out of around 90-100 applicants). I was floored about the interview because this job is basically my dream internship. I then spent more time and effort preparing for the interview, going in on a weekend for an interview, getting my suit dry cleaned, etc. 

Finally, the interview. I was definitely nervous, I will say that. However, I usually interview well and am generally confident in interviews. The woman who greeted me (one of the two interviewers who would be interviewing me) introduced herself and was friendly. She brought me into the room to meet the second interviewer. The second interviewer, a man, shook my hand and introduced himself. The woman was probably of Asian decent and I believe the man was African American. 

Right from the introduction, the man would not make eye contact with me and seemed annoyed to meet me. I tried to think nothing of it, but starting off an interview on that note did, admittedly, put me on edge a bit. I will say I was more stiff than I would normally be in an interview, but I wasn't an absolute train wreck. From there, the woman began asking me some pretty standard interview questions. I answered them all, trying to make eye contact with both interviewers while answering. The woman was polite and nodded at things I said, etc. The man refused to make eye contact with me and stared into space most of the time. When asked about why I thought I was a good fit for the diversity program (this question was geared towards why I was a diverse person), and I explained my background and how that made me a diverse candidate. The man rolled his eyes and scoffed at me while I was explaining this. He still did not make eye contact. He did ask me a few questions towards the end-- more general interview questions but he never made eye contact with me while I was speaking and seemed very flippant with me throughout the interview. I walked out of the interview confused and feeling extremely uncomfortable with how it went.

We were told we would hear back in 5-7 days about who would be selected. After 24 hours, I received an email that I had been rejected. 

After speaking with others (friends, a couple trusted mentors, other classmates) it was pointed out that maybe I should say something to the school. The program told us in the information session that selection would not be based on race but based on a background/childhood that made you a ""diverse"" person. Had they told me that they did not want White applicants, then I would not have applied. I was also very straightforward in my personal statement, I explained how my childhood was certainly unique and how that made me a diverse applicant with a unique background. In the essay I even mentioned that I had never been discriminated against for my race, ethnicity, socio-economic background or sexual orientation but that what I had outlined in my statement was what made me unique. If my personal statement was enough to get me an interview, then why string me along and interview me like that when I wasn't a good fit in the first place, right?

So my question is this: should I say something about this to the school or to the program? I've read a lot of well thought out essays and articles on how reverse discrimination does not exist. I understand that and I do think there may be some truth to that. I also realize that the male interviewer could have been having a bad day. However, I spoke with another applicant who had the same interviewers and did not get the same reaction from the man that same morning in his interview. I guess my question is whether this is a real issue that I should be concerned about or whether I got what was coming by applying to a program labelled as a diversity program while being a white woman, even though the program urged me to apply because it was not looking exclusively for racially diverse applicants."

Currently, I'm 25, half-way thorough University in ""Business Technology Program."" We're considered a hybrid between business side and software sides of things, have experience on both ends of the spectrum, a jack of trades is what I refer to it as. 

Currently, I work as a intern business intelligence analyst at a big Public company. (8month intern)  I gather and utilize design, requirements, analysis, process improvement, scope management, and project coordination with stakeholders. I work cross-functionally with every department (engineers, I/T, supply chain, procurement, inventory managers, and project managers). I analyze vast amounts of data daily, prepare reports for senior level Execs, and spot anomalies in data. I took it upon myself to learn VBA and automate reporting (300 lines of code, felt very impressed), made queries in Access, Pivot Table for proof of concept and analysis, and minor SQL experience (company won't allow SQL server for me). I enjoy the project management side of things, managing teams, working cross-functionally, essentially being the ""glue"" between teams and achieving required objectives. I have experience in Java/SQL/ and Python (personal learning).

My question is:

1. Should I get a project management certification and work in the BA field? Work up to Senior BA --&gt; Project Manager?


2. Go into the I/T side of things, do more development and software testing, create applications to interface backend databases. (develop my Java/SQL/ and Python programming further?) 


3. Go towards a database position? move towards the DBA field?

I have such a strong passion for both project management, data analytics and I/T/programming and just confused where to specialize in. I don't want to move into another BA role, and my next intern role comes in September (4 months), really trying to figure out how to best move on from a business intelligence analyst is. I feel like at 25, i really need to figure out what direction of the Business technology world I want to go into. I feel like I should have accomplished a lot more. Probably putting stress on myself, but just looking for advice. "

474dno,2,2016-02-22,Some progess?,ghostblonde,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/474dno/some_progess/,"Double post, I know.

Anyway, I've said before how I work two jobs, seven days a week and go to school. It's total hell. 

A few months ago, I applied to dozens of places in attempts to replace my original crap job. Nothing. They either sent an e-mail rejecting me or never responded. I was devastated. But then a Work Study program at my college fell into my lap, just as I gave up hope. It was weird. It was definitely one of those ""meant to be"" type of things.

So being unsure if the department was going to keep renewing my contract, I kept my first job. It's at a well known pet store. It's really gotten worse over the past several months. But I've hung in there because NM would throw a self absorbed fit any time I brought up quitting that job. My plan was to save the majority of the money from the internship and look for something else in the mean time. But NM would still go on a tyraid, insisting I was going to make her pay for everything and how she would be in such a terriblllee position and oh my god, what about her!
Of course, said decision had nothing to do with her but N's just need to change that.
I also get refunds from the pell grant, so that would just add to it all.

Since NM kept pressuring me and since I thought I could still hang on until I knew for sure what was going to happen, I stayed with the two jobs.

Well, crap job has gotten so bad, no one new has bothered to stay and we've been the most understaffed we have been in recent years. the majority of the staff is planning on quitting as well. They also pay an insulting amount for the type of work it is. But it's mostly that management has totally turned their back on the rest of the staff and treat us as if we're not even human.
Before they'd joke around with us and it was a more relaxed environment. It's not the same place it was even six months ago. Not that it was a decent job to begin with but it was made bearable due to how even management got along with everyone.

the final straw was when I was describing a near dog fight to a supervisor and as I was still speaking, he turned around and walked away. It took everything to not radio someone to replace me and just walk out.

So I told NM the situation and she was seemingly understanding. Mostly because there's such a high rate for injury there that it's better for me to quit than her having to possibly pay to repair an injury. (I was injured when I first started working and going through workers comp was one of the worst experiences i've ever had.)

NF doesn't know yet because all he'd do is bitch and whine and accuse me of ""never doing anything."" That I'm lazy and terrible and I'm just sucking them dry. This is his usual spiel whenever I stop doing something. But he can walk out of his job and it's totally justified.

So my plan is to give them a letter of resignation next weekend when I go in. It's actually required. It's a joke, all of the staff mocks it.

I'm sort of scared because I still don't know if I'll be kept on at my college. I've never gotten anything but positive feedback and they keep giving me more and more freedom. I also recieved summer aid, which has never happened before. I've done the math in several ways and I should not have gotten it. Yes, I should ask but I still have two months left and i'm afraid it might be too early to discuss it. And I'm also afraid that they'll say no and I'll spend the last two months upset somehow.
But I'm going to look for other work anyway. For now, I'll just apply to places for the weekends and if i'm not kept on, I can just open up my schedule.

I'm aware I should just keep terrible crap job until I find a weekend replacement. It's the safer thing to do and the more adult choice. Here's the thing, I hate that job and it's stressing me out so much that I'll spot (the ladies will know what that means.) And it's only taking up time on the weekends to do school work and to sleep. 
One of it's only positive qualities is that it pays weekly. but the pay is generally so low and due to only working weekends, it's really not worth it. I do work holidays/school breaks and that does increase the paycheck for the one damn week. And I'm sick of working holidays. It's mostly because they either understaff or over staff. If they understaff, everyone is put through more stress and it's the end of the world. If we're over staffed, we get sent home early and what the hell was the point of even coming in? They also know how many dogs are going to be boarding week to week, which makes the horrible schedule even more confusing.
I get treated like crap at home and at one of my jobs. Though i'm getting paid to be treated so poorly, I'd rather just get abused at one place rather than two."

I was hoping to get input on a situation that's stressing me out (using a burner account since at least one coworker knows my main account.) I'm currently a dev at a small place (~20 employees.) I was an intern here during my last two years of school and got a full-time offer before graduation that I took, so I've been here a total of 3.5 years (2 intern + 1.5 full-time.) I'm in an area where there aren't many developer positions, which is part of the reason why I took this job. Recently I heard through the grapevine that the company has been struggling financially and that a larger company may be looking at acquiring us (and may be trimming fat.) Needless to say, I'm ready to hit the eject button.

In a few days I'll have my resume polished off and will soon thereafter start applying for other positions and contacting people I know at other companies. However, the fact that I have to do this behind my employer's back is stressing me out. In some ways, I secretly wish they'd just lay me off (even without severance) so I could have a month or two to focus on finding a good job. I regret taking this position, since I largely did it mostly out of comfort and laziness (not having to interview immediately after graduation.)

The thing that stresses me out most it that I'll likely be applying to lots of out of state jobs, which would mean 1-2 days away from the office for interviews. As I'm single (no kid-related excuses) and only take off longer chunks of time to visit family, I'm certain my employer will catch on after the third or fourth random Thursday I take off as vacation/personal-leave. It is kinda obvious in a smaller office like mine.

Are there any common strategies for someone in a situation like mine? Is lying about illness (e.g. I'm not feeling good and won't be coming in tomorrow) acceptable?

Thanks!"

I started drinking too much five years ago, and those consequences hit me three years ago, in what was to be my last semester of college. I just hit a wall. I had been doing fine -- decent GPA, a few internships, doing work at the school paper. I just couldn't muster the will to keep going anymore, and I wound up lying in bed and drinking for months instead of going to class for my last semester. I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, but instead of withdrawing, I kept going, thinking I could get my act together. I failed that semester. Went onto do an internship, and that went well until I got fired for absenteeism thanks again to alcoholism.

I am sober for 1.5 years now. I finished all my schoolwork, I have a job, I have a new apartment. I finally feel like I am close to back on track, but now I don't know what to do next. I've spent so much time falling behind and then catching up, I don't know what to do next.

My job is fine, but it is not in a field I am interested in, and there is no chance of promotion. I think the journalism lifestyle contributed to my mental health issues, so I don't know if I want to go back to that. Even if I did, I haven't had a journo job in three years.

I've been using C#, Angular and JavaScript. I mostly work with integration testing, but that role is changing to more development.

4750xn,1,2016-02-22,Advice for a masters' field after physics,Sir_Bocks,AskPhysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/4750xn/advice_for_a_masters_field_after_physics/,"Currently I'm in a very cool position with my scholarship where I have essentially full tuition covered for my last year of undergrad and two years of grad school. Right now, I've been pushing through the physics program pretty fast and academics has pretty much consumed my life at this point. With three more years of scholarship left (which rolls over to a graduate program), I have a lot of opportunities. I'm pretty set on getting a masters' degree, but I don't know what I want to do it in, or if I want to pursue grad school or a career in industry post-graduation. At this point, I have very limited scope of what jobs are out there, what I can get with a background in physics, what I want to do for a job, and by consequence, what degree/skills/experience I need to get there. I think I'd be happiest using up my scholarship, getting a well-paying job in industry, then using my spare time and money to pursue my other interests (e.g. music, athletics, literature) which I have had to put on hold nearly completely to pursue school full time. However, on the other hand I decided to pursue physics because I have had a long time passion for it, and naturally I want to learn more. I can tell that I won't learn all that I want to through my undergraduate program. That said, the thought of committing myself to a grad program for the next 5-6 is daunting, and I frown at the thought of having to continue to put off my other interests for that long and be 'tied down' by grad school. I really like physics and I think I would enjoy learning more, but I'm a little fed up with the pressure of school right now and the sacrifices I've had to make. The general consensus is that grad school becomes your life, and unless that's what I want to do with my life then I shouldn't do it. I know that right now I'm definitely not ready to make that decision, and that there's a lot more that I want to get out of life than just school. The best plan I have thought up for the future is to power through the rest of undergrad and a masters program, take a year off to travel and explore my other interests, then after having some real exposure and time for self reflection decide what I really want to pursue after that. I think a masters degree is a very valuable asset, and with that opportunity almost a given, I find it very hard to see a more advantageous use of my time. 

Coming to the end of my junior year at the end of this semester, I have been looking at summer internships to get experience and capitalize on my current background to make a decent amount of money. I honestly haven't looked around a whole lot, but I found positions at Intel and Raytheon, among others, that I'm going to apply for. My focus has shifted away from my studies and more towards my interests and extracurricular skills I want to develop in pursuit of my own interest and eventually a career. However, I'm running into friction. Long story short, I don't know what I want to do. I've been directing my research and honors projects in the direction of physics simulations, numerical methods, nonlinear dynamics, etc. I've found that I'm a little annoyed with traditional pen-and-paper problem solving - while a good tool, computers are far superior in their ability to solve problems faster and more generally. After revisiting programming and picking up Python during my math methods classes, I fell in love with Euler engines and solving differential equations numerically. Forget the complicated, tedious nuances of solving boundary conditions analytically, I can just model a differential equation on my computer, find a suitable numerical method, and within seconds have a solution to arbitrary accuracy. In short, I love the utility of computers, the satisfaction and power that comes with programming, and having a visual representation of the physical system I am working with. The option of making my side projects my main course of study thrills me, but I'm a little intimidated by mathematics and even more so by computer science. I don't know much about what these fields really teach you, or if they will pave the way to interesting jobs. The thought of being stuck in a lame IT job or becoming a programmer working on boring projects outside physics and mathematics problem solving is a huge turn-off for me pursuing this field. I have had a few people tell me that there is a great desire for people to do simulations and things in the physics world, and the professors I have worked with (who seem to have very limited programming skills) have been delighted with my work, although I know what I'm doing is very simple as far as real-life problems and programming go. I know that there are a lot better programmers than I, and my only upper hand is my background in physics relevant to these kind of problems. 

With all that in mind, I don't even know if that's what I truly want to pursue. Simulations and computational problems have been a focus of my extracurricular interests for the past year, but I don't know if that will change and if there's something else out there that is moreso what I want to do. I think that deep down I still love physics, and programming is simply a means to do that. When I talked to a senior about my interests, he suggested I look into applied math (my university does not offer an applied math masters, only mathematics, but I do not know what the flexibility of the program is) which was something I had not considered before. I am planning on taking some computational methods courses in the math department soon, but I never considered mathematics as a study to be very complementary to my physics interests. I'm not a big fan of mathematics and pure math because I am annoyed with the nuance of artificial problems. In other words, I want to work on tangible problems. 

Yet another field I have considered is nanoscience. At my university, the nanoscience program is a Professional Science Masters rather than the traditional masters program, which gives an introduction to nanoscience, flexibility to pursue a focused field and research, and builds professional skills (writing grants, professional practices, etc.). It's a one-year program which makes it even more attractive, but the biggest benefit of the program seems to be job-preparedness rather than a wealth of technical skills. Seeing as how I don't know what I want to do, the nanoscience program seems to be a moot point because I would have to arbitrarily choose an area of focus. I do have an interest in quantum computing, but I'm not sure if the nanoscience program would even get me in the door for that kind of stuff (seems more like postdoc-level work). 

On pursing a masters in physics, the general consensus is that there is little marginal gain to a masters in physics over a bachelors in physics; you simply gain more knowledge of physics but little other skills, as opposed to a full grad (masters and PhD) program. However, a physics masters would leave the door a lot more open if I decided to come back and pursue a PhD program.

To sum up, I am open to pursuing other fields for a masters degree, but I can't quite decide on one or another because I don't know what I want to do in the future. I also see a lot of value in diversifying my skills, and physics is a great foundation to jump off of. My recent interest has been in computational methods to solve physics problems, but I'm afraid that will lead me further away from the kinds of problems I enjoy solving right now. Registration for fall courses opens soon, which has been putting on the pressure to take relevant classes over the next year that will pertain to a masters program. I could use a lot of advice/background on pathways other physics majors have ventured on and what options are out there. I feel like I just don't have enough exposure to make an informed decision;"

I've never really had any romantic relationships as an adult due to me focusing on my career and research. My only girlfriend was for like 2 months in high school when I was 15 so I'm making a better effort nowadays to explore the dating world. I'm pretty busy with my research and most of my social network is essentially paired off at this point so it's getting harder and harder to meet single people in my small midwest college town even with using online dating sites such as okc and tinder. 

Anyways, I feel like such a creep about this but somehow there are a bunch of attractive undergrad interns (all girls, around 20-22yo) in my lab. My fellow grad student officemate (F27) supervises all of them so although they're in my lab and I am a ""superior"" by default, I technically don't interact with any of them in any supervising manner since they all work on the molecular projects and I only work on the computational projects.

Unlike some of the other interns, one of them (F21) purposely likes to eat lunch in my office and chats with me even when her supervisor isn't there. I'm on OKC and I've seen her profile pop up as a potential good match so I know she's single. I sense some flirtation from her whenever we talk but it could be just her personality or that she's suppressing it for professionality sake. If it was flirtation, would it be appropriate if I asked her out? 

She's also graduating in the spring so she may or may not stay in the lab after the summer if that matters at all.

Also, my officemate is super introverted and oblivious to anything regarding social interactions so I can't really get her advice on all this.

TLDR: An intern in my lab likes to hang around my office and seems very friendly if not flirtatious, am I a creep if I ask her out?

I have been offered a job at a London based startup. The startup is quite young - a few months old but the offer and job is very good. Job is related to software engineering/machine learning.

I'm currently working in the EU but am from Asia.

With limited research, I understand that a Tier 2 (General) visa is what we'd need to process.

A few questions I couldn't find the answers for:

 - Can we process this as a Tier 5 visa ? Start it as an internship and eventually convert to full employment. Haven't been able to completely understand if software engineers come under any of the Tier 5 categories.

 - Can a Tier 2 visa be sponsored by a company other than the employer ?
 - How much time does it take to process the Tier 2 sponsorship licence ? Are there some additional hurdles for a young startup ?

475si9,0,2016-02-23,[help] Dell SAN disk expansion,Skipperen,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/475si9/help_dell_san_disk_expansion/,"Hi!

We have a Dell PowerVault MD3260 SAN with some 90TB of bloody expensive NL-SAS drives and are in urgent need of expansion.  The disks recommended through the official channels are about twice as expansive as a model that has the same specs.  I'm thinking of taking a chance and buy a newer model from the same manufacturer - what's the risk here?

Thanks in advance

Details: we have two models drives in the SAN shelf already, both 3.5"" 4TB NL-SAS 7200RPM though Dell reseller channel.  First disks were Toshiba TOSHIBA  MG03SCA400, later
SEAGATE ST4000NM0023.  I've found what looks like a later Seagate model with the same specs: Seagate Constellation ES.3 ST4000NM0033 - Harddisk - 4 TB - intern - 3.5"" - SATA 6Gb/s - 7200 opm - buffer: 128 MB."
475t09,2,2016-02-23,My life is in shambles and I don't know where to turn anymore.,Nifty_Wiggles,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/475t09/my_life_is_in_shambles_and_i_dont_know_where_to/,"I just turned 30 two weeks ago, and I am a fucking mess.

I recently quit the only opportunity I'll ever have for a full time job related to my field available in my town, because I learned that 1) I was not gaining any kind of skills or experience that would be useful outside of that one organization, 2) my boss was impossible for me to work with and gave me very little guidance, and 3) I felt like I was bad at everything, and the pay was so bad that my finances were actually worse than they were when I was working retail.  I feel like a failure; the job should have been easy enough and I couldn't hack it for more than 4 months, yet one of our interns is working productively on a huge project, with major contacts and all sorts of cool shit, basically doing my job better than I could with no training, and she's 8 years younger. Everyone seems to be doing cool things, finding great jobs, etc., and I feel like I could too, if not for my crippling depression and lack of training with everything. People tell me I'm smart all the time, but I have literally no job experience outside of food and retail, my degree is in the arts (and it's unimpressive), and I both struggle with a bad memory and attention problems; I can't remember anything if it isn't either written down or I am physically walked through a process. I doubt myself and because I am scatterbrained and get flustered easily, I am not exactly managerial material, so pretty much any job I take I am doomed to stay on the bottom. I am currently working at the same place I have been at on and off since 2006, and while I feel safe there I also feel stagnant and defeated. I used to have two other jobs, but one fired me last year and the other won't take me back.

I am in the worst debt of my life and see no way out. I owe my parents over $8000, have $4000 in student loans, and have about $12000 combined in credit card debt (the $12000 has all been amassed since last June; I made $14,500 before taxes total). I made fucking terrible financial decisions in the past during a traumatic life event about 6 years back, and repeated my mistake last year after getting fired (though in my defense, a decent chunk of the debt was from using my credit card to pay the rent and utilities I could no longer afford). I am behind on literally all of my utility payments and debts. I have tried selling my artwork but while people have said good things about it, the style and subject matter are not exactly sellable.

I live with my boyfriend, and though we love each other we are also toxic to one another. He is also suffering; he hates his job and hates being stuck in our shitty town, and is stressed and exhausted most of the time. He takes his frustrations out on me a lot, and lacks the empathy required to support me emotionally; I find that our relationship is primarily me supporting him. I do almost all of the cooking, cleaning, yardwork, shopping, etc. I even drive most of the time when we go out. I am so, so exhausted and feel like my life lately has been completely dedicated to work, working at home, and keeping him as happy as possible. It's draining me completely, and while he shows his love and appreciation to me in ways, it's not what I need. We rarely have sex anymore (not my choice), and he refuses to discuss it with me. When we do, he's usually dismissive, condescending, or argumentative about it, and a couple of times he's threatened to leave when I've brought up the subject. I know I should break up with him, but I can't afford to lose him as a roommate, as I can't pay my rent as is, and I see him as my only way out of my town; he will move on to another job in a much bigger city within a year or two and has asked me to move with him when he does. I have never been in a healthy relationship, and most of my experiences have been terrible one night stands and unrequited love. My one previous boyfriend and I broke up 8 years ago, so there's also a part of me that feels like this is the best I can do for myself, otherwise it wouldn't have taken so long for me to be with someone else. The most terrible thing is that he has an interesting career that I enjoy living through vicariously, and doubt I would date anyone else as interesting. I hate myself for admitting that, because it's so stupid.

My entire life I have gone through 1-2 year cycles of finding friends and then losing them. I thought I had a really strong group of friends from college, but now they're busy all the time and while many of them still get together to hang out or make art or whatever, I'm almost never invited, and feel like an outcast. Even my best friend of 12 years has stopped inviting me to stuff; we've been performing music together regularly for 4 years but recently she did a couple shows with other people and never told me or invited me, and recently threw a party that I also did not get invited to (but for some reason tagged me in photos). I know part of it is because I've been dedicating so much time to my bf, and am too exhausted and depressed to go out and do stuff. It's a catch-22 where I want to see people and feel included, but when the time comes I'm too down to actually go do anything. I rarely have anyone reach out to me anymore, and I know it's my fault, but I wish I was important enough to somebody for them to at least say hi or something.

I've struggled with body issues for a long time; my first bf made me stop taking medication and I gained 40 pounds within a year; I now weigh 20 more on top of that. I did lose a lot a few years back, but gained almost all of it back this past winter; I had to put my dog down for mental issues around Christmastime (which I'm still not over) and no longer walk 4 miles a day as a result, plus baking and cooking are literally the only things I really enjoy doing anymore anyway, so I haven't been eating well and it shows. I hate the way I look; people tell me that I'm not fat all the time but none of them have ever dealt with weight issues. I have PCOS which adds another complication to losing weight. Hell, I'm in terrible health all around; my body is falling apart and I have no insurance to do anything about it. Even the subsidized health clinic that I go to is getting too expensive for me.

My family situation is tense. My parents are my landlords, so almost every time we talk they are asking about rent. My dad was a pastor and is super conservative, my parents are pretty religious. I'm an agnostic atheist and know it would devastate them if they knew the truth, so I'm constantly lying and hiding the truth from them. My dad thinks I'm a virgin despite living with my bf (we have separate bedrooms so it's plausible). Both are overwhelming and cloying to be around when ibhave problems, so I've been hiding my issues from them because I can't handle how suffocating they are. My oldest brother and I are practically estranged; we haven't spoken since I met my nephew two years ago. My other brother is great, but his wife is even more exhausting to be around than my parents, so I don't see him as much as I'd like. I wish I could open up to them, but they get super involved in a way that stressed me out more; I know it's because I've been hospitalized for attempted suicide a couple of times previously, and they're concerned, but they always go overboard and make me feel even more anxious and restless. They also would tell me to pray about it, which is fucking useless advice and makes me even more stressed and uncomfortable.

I've been suicidal on and off throughout most of my life, but right now I feel the lowest I ever have. I've been fantasizing about killing myself for the past month or more, but this past week has been especially bad, especially after my bf told me that living around my depression is toxic to his own psychological health and that he didn't expect me to be so constantly miserable. Tonight I couldn't stop thinking, and was desperately trying to stop crying, and needed an outlet, so here I am. Writing it all out has already made me feel a little better, so hopefully I can sleep. I feel so hopeless. I want to go to therapy so bad; I can't afford insurance, and there are no qualified therapists who will give me a price break or a sliding scale. I've called suicide hotlines before, but all they do is tell me to go to the hospital and I can't afford that. I'm so ashamed of the hole I've dug myself into, and just need to have an outlet to whine about it. I know I won't do it; I'm too scared of pain and couldn't subject my bf to finding my body, but I just have this unending pain that I can't deal with.

Tl;dr: My life is a constant spiral of personal failure and self hatred."

TLDR at the bottom


Hello, I am not very active on Reddit and have posted a few comments here on this sub. I like to read about these happy endings and thought I would have one too with my SO. As of this morning it looks like it might end between us soon and I am posting here mainly to let my heart out somewhere and maybe get some advice. First I would like to tell a bit about myself.

My name is Thomas. Currently 20 years old and am starting a new job next week as a software developer. I have been struggling with life ever since high school. I got picked on a lot because I was morbidly obese and it made me stand out a lot in this country. Got too scared to go outside and most of my childhood was spent locked in my room playing video games and getting fatter. 

When I entered college, at 16, to become a software developer I had a bad case of social anxciety and had tried to kill myself twice. Also have a self diagnosed case of depression. My first internship was at a startup. It was a lot of fun since I didn't get judged on my looks but rather the things I build. I knew I wanted to continue doing development. Until my next internship a year later. The startup got a big project and way too few people to work on it. I became one of the three developers to work on it. I was 17, didn't get paid and worked 80 hour weeks. Needless to say it was a very stressful time and I learned to say no.

During this stressful time I met my SO on a game I was addicted to. We kept talking and talking until there were no more hours left in the day. It was that much fun to hang out with Maria.

Maria was in a LDR relationship with a jerk. They had never met and het cheated on her 2 times. Maria was a good friend of mine at the time and I didn't want her to be sad so I tried to cheer her up and maybe help her fix her relationship. I knew he was bad for her but if being with him made her happy then I wanted to help my friend. 

He was rarely online anymore and Maria kept our conversations going. When he occasionally came online on very obscure times of the day they would discover that they didnt have anything to talk about so Maria would come back to me and we would talk about what happened.

In December 2014 she was fed up with his crap and we had become inseparable. I made clear that I didn't want to be in a relationship if she had a boyfriend so she broke up with him and to this day she thanks me for that.

Later that month it was the first time we actually talked. We always texted over skype and now I would finally hear her voice. Damn was it cute and the conversation was so much fun that we kept it going for 4 hours straight. Despite it being on New Years,I couldn't be bothered to light any fireworks (trust me that's a big deal here).

Skip forward to March 2015. I went to visit her for the first time. I had never traveled on my own let alone to another country. It was scary but I knew it would all be ok when I saw her. Once I arrived. Everything felt so natural. I met her parents and her dog. They are all fond of me and it makes me so happy. That night we were cuddling and finished The office. I wasn't paying much attention since I was distracted by the beautiful  girl in my arms. She smelled so sweet and I couldn't belief that ME out of all people. The nerdy software developer was who she wanted to be with.

I forgot to mention that I started losing weight for her since I met her. I'm down about half of my original weight. Went from 1.90cm 160 kilo to 80 kilo.

Second time I visited for nearly a month. We had some troubles with a physical relationship. We were both virgins and she was very closed off to me. We would talk about it but whenever I tried to engage she declined and I wouldn't continue. This happened to many times for me and since I am still depressed and felt awful about myself, I felt rejected. As if nobody would ever want me. I'm disgusting and didn't deserve love. That was only for normal, happy people. In the last week I emotionally manipulated her to have sex. She knew how I felt and we ended up doing it. I feel bad about this but she has ensured me time after time that it's okay since she wanted it too. Everything was okay when I left. Is what I thought.

My depression got worse since my weight loss didn't go so great anymore and some closer friends were starting parting ways with me. On occasions I questioned why Maria loved me and why she would continue which a loser like me. Her answer was usually ""I just want to be with you"". There were times I was a real jerk to her and everyone around me. This send me into a spiral of hating myself even more to the point where I was considering suicide.

She was here during Christmas. She met my family and I could not have been happier. When she was laying next to me I felt complete and all those fears magically dissappeared. I love her and knew I would give her a ring one day.

The physical relationship was still lacking. She didn't want to have sex with me. I love her and gave her more time but it did hurt since I kept feeling rejected. One night when we were openly talking about it she told me she didn't feel attracted to me. I had a panic attack. After working hard on my body and eating healthy, nobody would be attracted to me. She said that she didn't know if wether her saying that was actually true but since I kept pushing for an answer why we didn't have sex she felt that this might have been it.

The week before valentines I visited her again for a weekend before I moved out of my parents' house. An hour before arriving at her city I got a text saying ""If I'm acting weird ... distant to you. Please don't think of it as a big deal"". This was troubling me so after talking she told me she is feeling pressured for sex again. I told her that we didn't need to have sex to have a perfect weekend and that I want to have a lovey dovey romantic pre-valentine weekend. She said she felt okay after that. However, we did end up talking until early in the morning. I was already ready to go home and it looked like we would go on a break.

I love Maria and don't want it to end so that weekend we spend cuddling and we both felt great about our relationship. I went home and a few days later I moved out.

At the appartement I didn't have access to internet and it took about a week to get it all working. This means almost no contact with her. Occasionally I did put on cellular internet to talk with her very briefly. Yesterday I got an email from the post office that I would get the modem today so I could access internet. I was so happy that I could talk with Maria again! I immediately told her that we could do so and .... silence. She didn't reply for a few hours. I knew she was behind her computer so I asked her after some hours if she didn't want to do anything with me ... silence. Ok, well. I will talk with her tomorrow, she is busy now.

It drove me crazy that night and I couldn't sleep much. Why did she ignore me? The next day, today, I bluntly asked if she is ignoring me and a few hours later I got the dreaded reply.

**TLDR-ers here**

She told me she had discovered a lot about herself in the past week without me and she wanted to talk with her friends and parents about it first. She comfirmed that it is about us and that she will write the conclusion in our shared diary. I am also not allowed to contact her a few days. She needs time for herself. 

This post was to vent and tell my story to the world. Now, there is a lot more to it. But that would require more of your time to read and I don't like to keep you. Anyhow, i feel very torn up and conflicted. On top of moving to a different city and starting to work again. She will probably break up with me. Considering my mental state of depression and anxciety, I don't think I can handle this.

I am very thankful for anyone who has read this long vent about my life. Thank you so much and ... I love you"

47704l,24,2016-02-23,Starting to lose confidence in myself and I'm in the wrong industry.,Mango__Juice,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/47704l/starting_to_lose_confidence_in_myself_and_im_in/,"This might sound trivial and niave and young and everything else, but it's starting to get on top of me. Getting a job...

I'm a recent graduate (graduated in June '15) and I'm doing okay with freelance work. I've had to move back in with parents after University due to not being able to get a job straight away, that's okay I thought, it's not uncommon for people to go back home even if they can get a job.

But like I said, freelance is going only okay, due to car bills and the rest of it, I'm barely making anything I can actually save. Job hunting is going so so poorly. I live in Birmingham UK and I've gone to so many job interviews, but it seems that ""Junior Graphic Designer"" and ""Graduate Designer"" roles are a load of crap, companies want a Senior Designer but don't want to pay that much, which would be fine but then I don't have experience. They want people with1/2 years industry experience. 

I've gone on Internships, unpaid, and that really breaks the bank, I have to ask for money from my mother as Job Seekers won't fund me as I'm not actively looking for work when on an Internship. I feel like I am faced with 2 options, for the next couple of years bounce from job to job, bar work and anything I can get until I have enough money to move out and make a proper start at it (all the time still applying for design jobs) OR apply for jobs in London and Manchester and where else (as their are a shit ton of jobs in London advertised) but then just getting to interviews is a lot of money and I just can't afford to do that for long at all. 

Ultimately all this is making me feel that I'm just in the wrong industry, I'm not actually good at design, I graduated with a 2.1 but I'm not actually any good, I can't get a job in it. Feel like utter crap explaining to people that even though I'm on JSA I'm freelance and still working and doing things as well as a part time job. Working my ass off for little money, stuck at home (which isn't the best as I feel constantly judged by people and even my parents and I hate getting into conversations with older people for them to say how easy it was to get a job in their day, they could quit one job, walk down the street and get another a few hours later)

Any advice from more experienced designers? Is it always going to be this way? Is it a case of luck? Who you know? 

I'm due to start a job at the Safari Park soon and will try and ask about their promotion and marketing department and see if I can make contacts and know people and see if that can get me anywhere. Just so many rejection emails or no reply at all, starting to get me down. "

I currently have an offer from a fairly large and well-known tech company for 84k per year. I fully intend on accepting this job offer within the next couple of days, but that puts me in a tricky spot with my current co-op/internship. 

I was taken in by a startup in Boston as an intern because they liked my past experience and because I'm a senior. The expectation is that if I do well enough (which I expect to) that I'll get some sort of offer later down the line. However, I've only been there for about a week.

What's the standard here? Do I tell them that I have an offer, and tell them that it would help if they decided on hiring me or not fairly soon? Or do I just say nothing and wait for a possible offer in the next couple of months? I really, really enjoy the work at the startup, as well as the environment and people, and I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy it more than the larger company I have an offer for already. 

Is it realistic to accept the first offer, then wait a couple months, get the offer from the startup and then accept that, reneging the previous offer?

Probably not explaining this very well, but I would appreciate any and all help, as I'm really torn on what to do."

Basically, she's, more or less, having me place calls to local offices in hopes of recovering their attorney fees (i.e., collections). She mentioned teaching me and having me do intakes, but gave no indication just how soon that would happen.

I also received some mixed signals from her yesterday morning as to how long this unpaid ""internship"" may actually last. It could be 6 weeks, it could be 8, 10 or 12 weeks. It could be however long she deems appropriate. (The current full-time paralegal interned without pay for 3 months.) That's a bit longer than I wanted to go considering my unemployment is starting to wind down now and it won't be much longer until my benefits cease. I wish she had been looking for an unpaid intern a month or 2 ago, as it would've been better timing. I don't mind doing something like this, but not so close to my unemployment benefits expiring. I haven't told her I'm drawing unemployment and that it'll be ceasing relatively soon. I've contemplated doing the best job I could possibly do with collections and then broaching her about permanent employment at the end of March/beginning of April, but am concerned she may feel that's too soon for her liking and would want me to continue for another month or month and a half.

During our interview, she discussed needing help in the office and just didn't feel comfortable paying someone she wasn't really sure of which is why she initially decided to post a Craigslist ad for an unpaid ""internship"" rather than hiring someone out right and paying them from day one. After hearing her say that, I can't help but wonder if she's classifying me as an intern to avoid paying wages just to get the help she needs.

What's to say this attorney will use you until you refuse to go on without payment and then will move on to another unpaid intern?

I think I'm worth a worth a fair and legal wage. Aren't I?

And, as I suspected, she had a hard time soliciting responses for her unpaid ""internship"" ad and really didn't have anyone else to offer the opportunity to."

Option 1: I'd really really really like to get a Master in Engineering: Computer Science, which is one of the hardest degrees in Belgium. The catch right here is this master would take me 4 more years. So in the best case i'd be 27 when i graduate and i am ready to start working.

Option 2: the firm where im doing my internship asks if i'd want to stay and start working there. It's a great firm, pays very well, company car, fuel card, etc. This is of course only if the firms asks me to stay.

###South Africa Fair Education Act

The South African primary and secondary education system knows much dispararity between poor no-fee education and high fees, still on public schools.  
Only the poorest of the poor are eligible for a fee-exempt and they usually don't live nearby schools that demand high fees.

That will change through an ingenious new system.

* 1. Fees will be paid to the state, not the school.
  * 1.1 Fees will be drastically reduced and a limit of R4000 will be instated.
* 2. The state will determine fees based on the quality of the school.
  * 2.1 Higher functioning schools with (ABC) will receive more funding per learner.
      * 2.1.A More graduating learners.
      * 2.1.B More satisfied learners.
      * 2.1.C More satisfied parents
  *  2.2 Lower functioning schools with a lack of (ABC) will receive less funding if a lack of funding is determined to not be the reason for the lower functioning.
* 3. Taxes for the education department will be shown in the child support grants.
  * 3.1 Rich parents will receive less. They have to pay less in fees, after all.
  * 3.2 Poor parents will receive the same. They have to pay less in fees for sending their children to a better school.
* 4. The Department will create a $700 million program for educating more and better teachers. These teachers can only work in public schools, not private schools.
  * 4.1 Teachers receiving extra tuiton from the state can only work in public schools.
  * 4.2 Internships for all teachers will require a period in public schools even if they wish to work in private schools.
* 5. People who's family annual income is less than five times a school's fees will be able to exempt from fees if the school is within ten miles or if it is the closest school to where they live."

I switched into CS from EE my senior year (what) - which was Fall of 2014 - and I'm going to be graduating at the end of this semester.

So I'm applying for jobs now and I'd really appreciate if I could get an answer from you guys to this question I've got:

EE really wrecked my GPA. I just generally disliked it and it didn't play to my strengths. 

But CS is a whole other story - I really enjoy what I'm doing and I've been consistently getting &gt; 3.5 every semester since (which is 3 semesters). So I'd put my major GPA on my resume but there's a little problemo there: somehow some EE classes seeped in as electives (that's how I'm able to graduate in 5 years) so my major GPA is about a 3.3. So that's the backstory, here's the question: would it be weird if I had a 'GPA since CS major' and only that on my resume?


I explain my situation in my cover letter but there's no way I can guarantee that anyone's going to look at that, right? As a side concern, given my predicament, I only have one CS related internship experience listed on my resume. So I've really got to highlight that I've only been a CS major for 1.5 years (without completely relying on my cover letter) but I have no clue how. I'd love some input on that too if you guys have any ideas.


Thanks a lot guys"
479naq,2,2016-02-23,Deciding between Chillary and Trump. Leaning hard Trump; here's why:,NMF_,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/479naq/deciding_between_chillary_and_trump_leaning_hard/,"You want a president who has actually done something with their lives, who has actually achieved something. Let's look at the field:

Marco Rubio: Too young. Has only been in congress for a few years; doesn't even show up to vote; no professional or personal accomplishments to date; also, let's not forget on the precipice of personal bankruptcy (read up on this; it's very interesting) PASS

Ted Cruz: Religious nut case; only able to succeed in Texas due to religious beliefs and favoritism from a very narrow version of conservatism; universally unliked by virtually everyone inside and outside of his professional and social circle throughout his ENTIRE LIFE; PASS

Bernie Sanders: Talks a big game and seems very interested in reform however he has been in politics for OVER 30 YEARS and why haven't you accomplished any of these things?? Your ideas aren't revolutionary Bernie, where ya ass was at when they repealed Glass Stegall? Where ya ass was at when they passed the Patriot Act? Where ya ass was at when we invaded Iraq, WHERE WERE YOU?? PASS

Hillary ""Chillary"" Clinton: Listen, let's not roast Chillary too hard here. She basically had the absolutely worst thing in the world happen to her (had her husband who was the president publically bang a hot intern in the oval office, ON TAPE!). Most women would be utterly destroyed by that. What did she do? Won a senate rate, became secretary of state, ran a successful charity and probably made people's lives better. Is she ready to be commander and chief? Yes. But unfortunately, there is a better candidate:

TRUMP: Where to begin. 

Let's start at the beginning. Everyone likes to say, ""Oh Trump had a rich dad blah blah he had an unfair advantage"". Most of my friends with rich parents are complete shit heads and haven't done anything with any of their parents resources. Trump could have done the same thing, he could have just chilled and not used his father's money. What did Trump do instead? BUILT A BILLION DOLLAR EMPIRE OUT OF 1 MILLION DOLLARS. 

Trump has a FANTASTIC family. Once again, most rich people's kids are dicks and don't do anything with their lives. Eric and Ivanka have expanded the Trump brand and further engaged in profitable enterprises, all under the motivation and mentorship of their father! That speaks volumes on the character of an individual, not only did he do good for himself, but also did right through his children. Not many men can claim that. 

Trump many pop off here and there and say some wild shit. BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE HE IS HIGH ENERGY! I do the same thing from time to time. If you really look at his policies, he is very balanced, focusing on buttoning up areas where America has lost ""profitability"" and return this country to a successful self sustaining democracy and positive force for good in the world. 

I voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. I think he's done a good job. But I don't think we have ""won"" yet. As Trump himself said in his Barbara Walters interview, it takes a lot to not only be good, but to get over the finish line and win. And I believe Trump has what it takes to help this country get over the finish line and win.

I'm voting for Trump. I hope you do to. I hope you caucus tonight in Nevada, show up on super Tuesday and be ready for election day come November. PEACE!!"

I need work experience to get an internship, but I need an internship to get work experience.

My GPA isn't horrible; it's in the high-2's, but the problem is that with the school I go to, everyone is an ""intelligent, hard-working student"", so at any given Career fair on campus that I go to, with my cookie-cutter CS classes that I've taken, I don't really stand out from other students, even if I may stand out among CS students at another university, and on top of that they won't even talk to you if you're below a 3.0.

I'm not really sure where to go from here as far as getting an internship for this summer.  I've put out plenty of feelers, and I'm even talking to a company that is adamant about not giving internships, but wants me for a co-op next spring/summer, and so I'm still left out to dry in terms of what I'm going to do this summer.  I really don't want to make it another summer where I just wake up, go to the gym, and do chores around the house all day, I want real work experience in the field, and I don't want to wait until spring of my junior year to do it.

I've been told that Craig's list is an option, but most of that stuff is part-time jobs by small ventures that don't really have a need/desire to take on a summer intern.

However, I've found through my internships that it is terribly boring and feels unrewarding. I've always been interested in computer related skills and find programming quite fun (I've been learning C# with visual studio). 

Do any of these sound good? They're mostly the same.

47a5kn,1,2016-02-23,Some depression confessions,iB_Raii,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/47a5kn/some_depression_confessions/,"Hello reddit. Long time lurker with multiple accounts (create, post three or four things, delete, repeat), now going to try to use this as a medium through which to turn things around. But to do so, I need to get some things off my chest. 

For the last few years, I've dealt with depression. It started my junior year of high school and persisted to my freshman year of college. Had a few suicidal thoughts in those years, but they were few and very minor (thought about what would happen if I were to do it, and once contemplated putting my car into a ditch from a gravel road). Self-harmed slightly, in ways that people wouldn't suspect (people expect teenage boys to have bruised knuckles, so I could get away with punching doors/walls/etc without people wondering). But I would usually just shut down and not show any emotion. My friends called it ""iB Raii's mood.""

As college went on, I met some friends that helped me turn my life around. I was on anti-depressants going into college, but I met a guy who brought me into the gym and started helping me exercise. It noticeably turned my life around. Fitness became my life, and subsequently my major in college. I started running 5Ks and lifting, and noticed myself becoming happier, healthier, and more outgoing. I thought I had found my natural antidepressant, and that I was done with my meds for the rest of my life. I knew depression wasn't something you could ""beat,"" but I thought I found the thing that I could use to help me for the rest of my life. I went through my sophomore, junior, and senior years of college with little issue. I had my flare-ups, of course, but overall I did very well.

Most people know everything up to this point, so that's not what I want to get off my chest. It's everything that's happened post-graduation (ish) that I need to tell someone.

Shit started going downhill this past May. I was in a committed relationship for over a year with a girl. She was wonderful, we had talked about getting married, we were about to move in together, it was great. I'd never been so sure about something in my life. But within our relationship, I was a piece of shit. I was kind of selfish, and somewhat of a compulsive liar (let me clarify: it was never anything serious. I would tell her my phone died instead of just admitting that I forgot to text her back, things like that. Things not worth lying about). She caught me in one of these shitty lies, and we got in a fight about it. A few weeks pass, and ultimately I decided to break it off. I blamed it on her not willing to talk about some of the issues we were having, but it was ultimately me not knowing how to best make a relationship work. I didn't realize that relationships like this took work, and I decided to jump ship the second I felt like something was off. I could have saved it (in retrospect), but chose not to. That was part one.

At this same time, I had a required internship to culminate my degree (somewhat like a senior capstone project). It was working with children with mental and developmental disabilities. I'd worked with this population before, so I enjoyed working with the kids. However, I could not stand my supervisor or the owner. I was doing everything in my power to make ""attitude adjustments"" that they requested (even though I legitimately thought my attitude was fine; super open to criticism), and to progress the three different projects I was assigned to over the three months. During this time, coupled with my relationship issues, I developed severe anxiety. I would have panic attacks in the bathroom at my internship, and had to try to maintain myself during the six hours I spent in this place. Also contributing to my stress was the fact that this internship was unpaid, so I had to work two more jobs to pay my rent/bills/etc. So during this time, I was working approximately 70 hours a week, with only 45 of them being paid. The trigger point for me, however, was about halfway through this internship. I started driving to my internship, and I started getting dizzy. Didn't know where I was, and I would black out for 3-5 seconds at a time. I got about 15 miles down the road and realized I shouldn't be driving. I pulled off to a rest area and I burst into tears. Everything fell apart at that moment, I realized that everything I had in life was falling apart, and it was out of my control. 

It's been about 9 months since that moment, and not much has changed. I got back on my meds about a month ago, but some things about these past few months have scared me, and I don't think I can tell anybody this without them becoming incredibly worried.

The suicidal thoughts have become more prevalent lately. The past few months, as I've been driving to work, it's a conscious effort to not drift my car into oncoming traffic. ""At least then,"" I think to myself, ""it would look like an accident."" Shortly after that thought hits, though, I'm able to rationalize my way out of it. My desire to live outweighs the negative thoughts, but sometimes it's a battle. I've started having some other self-destructive thoughts lately as well, none of which I've acted on, but they still scare me. Obviously, antidepressants and alcohol don't mix, but I've thought about having a few drinks after work, just because. Or popping pain pills unnecessarily. Sometimes I skip dinner as ""punishment"" for.. something. Honestly not sure what. 

As of right now, I don't know where my life is going. I hate my job, but I have to work there to survive. I don't have a place to live come August. I want to go to grad school but year after year I keep getting delayed. My friend group that I've had for years is falling apart, as they all graduate and move on to other things. I really want to move to another state, start fresh, and try to forget these last 10 months. I can honestly say that this has been the worst time of my life.

I'm trying to take on this lifestyle of ""do what makes you happy, even if it goes against society's expectations."" It's made me want to start a Youtube channel for gaming, start a Soundcloud for my music, things like that. But with depression that saps the life out of you for every hour you're awake, it's hard to do those things.

In case anyone cares, I'm in a safe place with regards to all my self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Haven't acted on them, and have no plan to. Sometimes that voice just makes itself heard, and it scares me."

47aaa0,7,2016-02-23,Engineering Grad with a question for any NZ programmers/I.T. workers out there.,Answer_Me-This,newzealand,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/47aaa0/engineering_grad_with_a_question_for_any_nz/,"Hey folks, 

I’m a recent electrical engineering graduate but I specialised in programming. Some of what I studied was microcontrollers (C), networking (CCNA) and programming studies (.NET, C#, Java etc). The end result is that I feel like I can't call myself an electrical engineer but more like someone in I.T. with an engineering base. My problem is when applying to any graduate, intern or even work experience positions for programming, I’m up against grads with degrees in computer science, information tech or the like. So even though I earned high grades, I never get anywhere.  One concern I have is that I’ve no chance due to my degree being in engineering. Not I.T. or comp science.

So my question is; how did you all get your first jobs in the industry? I’d love to hear from those who weren’t able to land one of the graduate programs with the big boys in NZ (F&amp;P, Orion, Vodafone, Planit etc.).

Edit: Grammar."

I appreciate it. tl;dr below.


What follows is background information. **You can skip ahead to important build info below.**

As the title states, I am trying to piece together a budget entry gaming build for my girlfriend. I built my first PC last year (March 2016) and I am in love with [this thing](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/theflashking/saved/#view=tBLKHx). I was already transitioning into the PC gaming world from console, and building this machine has all but clinched that transition (Kingdom Hearts… *sigh*).

I am wanting to share gaming with my girlfriend who lives in a different city than I do, and thought I could use what I learned in building my pc to build her something to get her started. I really hope to get her hooked, but I have to get her going first. With that in mind, I set to building the following.


**Build info starts here**

**Here is what I have put together for her.**

Priorities (**in bold**) and things I have considered as well as have in mind:


 * **Budget**: I am building this myself, using money I earn from my internship. Though I’d love to splurge on her, I cannot afford that right now (collegeeeee). So this is a top priority. Trying to stay ~$500

 * **Functionality**: Budget in mind, I still need this to be a good experience for her. So I’m pushing that GPU as best I can. Pretty graphics and smooth playability with current games is a must. Do not want to turn her off to gaming because of a crappy experience caused by her pc. With that said, **I am concerned with bottlenecking the GPU with the CPU**. But that’s ok at first if it lets me get it off the ground at a much lower price.

 * GPU *: I want to get her the best manageable GPU I can. 

 * Scalability: I picked these parts with future upgrades in mind. If she really finds things she likes to play, I want to be able to flesh out the machine in the future. An i3 or i5 cpu maybe. A GTX 980 gpu. If I want to be able to get there in the most affordable way possible, I am insuring I have the proper socket mobo in place for those future Intel CPUs. In other words, this is why I am not using AMD.

 * Peripherals/Accessories: Since she's a total noob to gaming, I do not plan on going all out with a gaming mouse, killer headset, and mech keyboard (this one is actually a maybe. Having someone I love type on anything different almost feels like betrayal). I plan to fish around for a keyboard here, a mouse there, two monitors there. Just to get her by at first. Leaves great room for future presents/upgrades too! :D

* Case: Left it out on purpose, since that will largely depend on her preference (she likes all things ""cute"" &gt;.&gt; can't blame her) and my comments for functionality. Chances are we'd get something I'd have to paint for her to get the colors right.

I could really use tips on where to best get affordable parts. I am not above buying quality used products or finding functioning parts from other machines (except for the GPU). 

I have only built a computer once. I really enjoyed it. I have done and continuing doing more and more research so I can produce the best machine with the right reasons behind them. 

I am open to all tips. Thank you so much for reading again, and for your help!
tl;dr: Building a budget entry level gaming PC for my girlfriend prioritizing budget then functionality. Important bits in bold. Would appreciate reviews.

So I'll start with some backstory: 

I've smoked weed for a while. I've recently cut down a lot. I wasn't caught that much when I did, and it was maybe 2-4 times a week. My parents don't understand this. And they simply won't. I have stolen money from my parents for this (estimate of maybe 300$ total)

My dads family has a history of becoming deadbeats and shit like that. His brother died while tripping acid. My dad thinks I'm the most disrespectful child he's ever met. My dad is a hard worker. He went to college and struggled. 

My parents ask me to get a B+ average, and I consistently get A's and B's in school. I have never had a job. I play 2 sports, field and football. I have a 4.175 GPA and I am going to become something related to computer science. I'm very good at programming, as I have made a full database using NodeJS and MongoDB. I can get into the colleges near me, as long as I get good SAT scores. My classes next year are going to finish up my required credit, and they'll finish a math class an English class and public speaking for college. I have ADHD, and I take medication for it. I am lazy. Positive reinforcement has worked before for me. I got 99th percentile in math on the PSATs, 88th in English, 97th overall. I'm a very confident person, if this matters. I can get an internship in a computer job without going to college. This can be done via my computer programming class. 

Cool now that that is out of the way, I'll get to the story. 

My parents found a stash of weed and alcohol I had. My mom asked if I stole her alcohol before, and I said no even though I had. That was in the bag along with $5, the weed, a makeshift smoking device, and a lighter. They're mad, because they thought I quit. 

They are going to cut off my phone if I don't get a job in 2 weeks and study for the SATs 1 hour a week. This isn't the real issue. I could go without a phone, and I could realistically tell them to fuck off and do whatever I want. 

I have offered a compromise: I'll take a drug test monthly and I'm not forced to give up field for a job. 

I think they're overreacting, and they're not doing themselves any favors. They speak very condescending of my ideas about college (I.e. That I'm pretty much fully qualified to get in if I do good on the SATs). My dad says I should rely on his experiences, because he got out of the middle of bumfuck nowhere. 

They think I have no chance in college or life, because I don't know how to work. They want me to go, however. They have said repeatedly they don't want me going to a college because it's a party school. It's my 2nd choice. 

This whole situation has physically angered me because of how they handled it. I could have punched holes in the wall, but I didn't. I was pissed they were confronting me. 

So Reddit, what should I do. I need life advice here please help me. 

Ask for any clarifications, even the colleges. I don't really care. "

I decided to share my personal story that may be of some inspiration to anyone who is struggling in the industry.

I always loved art in high school and also had an interest in computers, so I decided to major in Computer Graphics Technology in college. I had a passion for film at the time, but figured this would be a better career choice. In college, I got hooked to the ""life"" and partied a lot, skipped a lot of class, and didn't take it very seriously. I worked as a telemarketer the entire time I was in school and got really good at sales. I was told I was going to be finished with school, and it seemed like a barely made it my senior year. My grades weren't that great and I didn't even have a a real portfolio.

My sister who is 4 years older than me, lived in another state and offered me to come live with her and my brother in law, so I could get on my feet and get my act together basically. I saw it as a way out of the place I was in since there was no job opportunities at all. I decided to drop everything and move 900 miles away after college. I got a letter in the mail a few weeks after I was there saying I never graduated and I was missing 1 class and my gpa was too low as well. So now I'm 40k in debt with no degree or even a passion for design at all. I started selling cars and doing sales. I faked to everyone that I was a design graduate and was looking for a job. I hadn't even opened photoshop in a couple years. 

Eventually I decided to grow up and try to fix the mess that I had made. I got back into online classes through the school I went to and finished my degree in a couple years. My brother in law got me a job at the local news station as a Production Assistant pushing cameras around during the news. The pay was terrible, but it got me in the door to see some of the design production and also a good resume name. I did this for a couple years.

I really wanted to get back into design, but I had no experience really, and my work was terrible. My brother in law had moved onto a marketing agency doing video, and had me come in for an unpaid intern kind of a thing a few times a week for a few weeks. I made a logo for them and the people there had basically told me to go back to school and do something else, that design wasn't for me, and were really mean about it. I sat in my car when they told me that and decided to stick with it and not listen to them. I didn't work this hard to finish out my degree to quit. I'm not a quitter. I was doing little things at the station, but they were really bad and people would look at it and I could tell they knew it wasn't good. My sisters friend had a paid internship opportunity open up for a graphic design intern at a private corporation in the city. I ended up getting the job, working 25-30 hours a week there, along with my job at the news station. I was really bad and did a ton of terrible work, but I showed work ethic and I was eager to learn and catch up on everything I had let go by me since college. The other designers there helped me and helped me grow. I wanted to keep learning and any chance I had to do tutorials or read blogs I would. They eventually hired me full time and I just kept getting better, learning to use the wacom tablet, and keeping a good attitude. 

My position was eventually terminated after being there for 2 years and I was left to find a design job on my own. I at least had a portfolio now and could show what I knew how to do. I had learned so much. I ended up turning down a few interviews because the pay was nowhere near what I was making and I was getting low balled hard. I was out of work and on unemployment for about 5 months. I had posted my resume on craigslist and a lady from a Marketing Agency emailed me, liked my work, and asked me to come in for an interview.

I ended up getting a 90 day trial with them match the pay from my previous job. In that time I had branded a company, learned wordpress, made brand guideline books, and a ton of other stuff. I stayed hungry, kept learning, and really wanted the full time position. I could see myself getting better and better and people complimenting my work. I ended up getting the full time job and now I have been there for 8 months and killing it.


DO NOT QUIT. Design is very very hard. This business is really hard. Anyone on here will tell you that. You need very think skin to survive in this industry, and it's rough seeing people with super phenominal work that you wish you could do, but your not them, your you, and you will eventually find the right style that fits you. It doesn't happen overnight. It has taken me 3-4 years playing catch up to get where I'am. I went from people telling me to stop designing, to being the lead designer at a marketing agency in a prestigious area. 

You need to fully engulf yourself in design. Listen to podcasts, study whats hot on behance, read design blogs and books. Always keep up on it and researching. You will go through a million bad designs until you make a good one, but each one of those made you better and you learn from it. 

Don't give up. You chase a dream and then you stop, I guess you'll never know.."

I recently started working in a new city, haven't rent a new apartment but was planning to move when I get a job and after 3 days I already feel like this might not be my place. I'm now hesitating on moving and I'm wondering how long I should wait to see if things picks up or not and quit. I never had that ""doubting"" feeling before.

The company is also giving me 3 months of probation, should I decide then?"
47asms,23,2016-02-23,Update on asking for some advice from fellow pharmacists/other employees/pharmacy owners,OOTPDA,TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/47asms/update_on_asking_for_some_advice_from_fellow/,"Hey there! I apologise for my [previous long post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/44ec2u/would_love_some_advice_from_fellow/) and the [slightly shorter one before that](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/3zm0uy/starting_to_love_pharmacy_again_been_a_rough_year/) about my job/employer woes. I can't promise that this one will be much better, I do apologise.

It seems **it's alllll gonna be okay** after all! See, following all of your help, telling me to tell the real Slim Shady to please sit down and that I wasn't going to take his job, I called him. 

The interaction went something like this:

Slim: ""OOTPDA! Why haven't you gotten back to me?""

Me: ""Slim, how are you? I've been busy.""

Slim: ""Me too, I have all of these plans for when you come. We're gonna need you doing clinical interventions in the Webster room"" (which, if you recall, churns out ~1000 dose administration aids a week. And all pharmacy interventions which are documented are paid in Australia- so naturally, while this isn't mandatory, pharmacies like to get paid for their work.) ""And there'll be more hours for you and-""

Me; ""I'm going to stop you right there. I won't be accepting your offer.""

Slim: ""Oh.""

Me: ""And it's because I don't appreciate you going behind me back and talking to my employer on my behalf, without my knowledge or permission. You could have gotten me fired.""

Slim: ""Oh that wasn't me, that was my business partner, he makes the decisions, I told you."" 

Me: ""Whatever your business partner does, you do. It's your choice to let him make decisions.""

Slim: ""Well, I'm heart broken. I thought you were going to work for us. You're like my daughter."" (Gag)

Me: ""I would have worked for you from the beginning, and I would have been a very loyal employee. But you chose to offer me full time in October and then change your mind, and it mucked me around. And the way you've handled everything since is unprofessional. I'm not comfortable working with you.""

Slim: ""Where are you going to go? I really need you."" (Mouth-vom)

Me: ""I have some offers."" (Read: one offer of full time and some other 1-2 days per week offers.) ""If you need someone, perhaps [former fellow intern] will take you up on your offer, I know you offered her the job too.""

Slim: ""I offered her ANOTHER job, I need 2 people. And she isn't as good as you are, I only offered it to her cos I felt sorry for her and [Insert about 10 minutes of him rambling and receiving nothing but stony silence from me]."" Turns out 2 of his pharmacists have left since I last saw them.... Wonder why. And if he's saying those things to me about my fellow intern/friend, what does he say about me?

Me: ""Ok, well I'm sure I'll talk to you soon.""

Slim: ""You can come back any time."" (BACK? I was never there)

Me: ""I'll keep that in mind, take care."" Que him calling me back straight away to ask me to work the next Saturday. I told him I was busy.

So, I had successfully burned that poor excuse for a bridge. 

And then I started to get nervous that the full-time offer an hour away would fall through. I went to every pharmacy in my town and within an hour radius to apply for work. I received offers of 1-2 days per week from a few places and thought I'd at last get enough to scrape by (not what I'd imagine when I went to uni, but I digress). I worked a Sunday shift in a busy shopping mall pharmacy, with a view to work every Saturday in the future, which was fun.

Then, the day before I was to drive that hour to see the pharmacy that I was offered full-time in, **my old boss from my intern job asked me to come and see him**. He offered me a minimum of 31 hours a week! (Plus additional hours during busy weeks and when other pharmacists were away) They've restructured their business model and have decided to add 2 more pharmacists to make it work and I was one of them!
Naturally, I grabbed it with both hands, and told him I'd go and see the other place the next day and talk to them. 

That night, the other place called me and told me that they've given the job to someone else and not to come the next day. Dick move, keeping me on a hook for a few weeks after all but formally offering me the job (at the interview, they said I was well ahead of the others and they look forward to working with me).
I would have been stressed, but that offer from my old place came just in time. 

**I have now signed a contract with the old place** and I aim to see if one of the other places in town will be happy to have me working one day a week (that I'm not at my full-time job) to supplement my income a bit because I'm saving for a house, which my new-old bosses are happy with.

Sorry about the novel (again). But I wanted to update, mostly to thank you all for your support and advice. 

Thank you all for keeping me sane through this fantastic flurry of flying fudgewittery.

 

**Edit/another update (Idk, some people seemed interested):** Slim called me today! The convo went:

Slim: How are you? I miss you, I'm calling to see how you are. (Yeah sure....)

Me: I'm doing great, thanks. You?

Slim: I'm good thanks. Tired but good.

Me (out loud, but not really though): Yeah, screwing people around will really do that to you.

(out loud, really though): Oh that's no good.

Slim: So where are you working atm? ([AND THE CAGE COMES DOWN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz68Z5kjE3o). Start from 0:30 for the reference- Slim's the mother.)

Me: Still at [place he tried to get me fired from].

Slim: How long will you be there for? Have you found somewhere else? (THE GATE LOCKS, SLIM IS HONING IN ON TARGET)

Me: I'll be here a while, and I've found somewhere else. (MISSILE DIVERTED)

Slim: Where?

Me: Oh somewhere else. (Nice try, silly)

Slim: Oh. Well, I just wanted to call and see how you are because I miss you and you're like a daughter to me (hurl)

Me: Ohk well thanks for calling.

Slim: No worries, talk to you soon.

Me: K, bye."

47awgt,0,2016-02-23,Graduate or Intern?,Revhak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/47awgt/graduate_or_intern/,"I'm a transfer student at a top 20-30 CS program and due to me being a transfer I have not had much time to intern. Previously I've had experience at a small startup and I currently work as a network engineer. I applied a lot around September and have had interviews at 2/4 of the Big4, however they did not lead to offers. (The good news is that I went from knowing nothing about the interview process to going through most of cracking the coding interview). Anyways, my graduation date is (potentially) coming up and with only waiting for one company to respond to me (went through the on-site), I'm questioning whether or not I should just graduate (obviously I will notify the waiting party) and move on to full time asap. Any comments/questions appreciated, thanks."
47b2gg,2,2016-02-24,I (23F) essentially agreed to take a year off post-undergrad to be my family's (56M/56F/78M/82F/14F) caretaker. It's been 5 months and I am growing weary and resentful. Can I back out?,familycaretaker,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/47b2gg/i_23f_essentially_agreed_to_take_a_year_off/,"I am from an Asian American family. My parents immigrated to the US before I was born. I grew up in the US with my family, which consists of: Mom [56F], Dad [56M], Grandfather [78M], Grandmother [82F], Sister [14F].


**Background**


My father is a lawyer and my mother is a professor. I am fortunate to have grown up in an upper middle class family. My parents paid full tuition for me to attend college. They supported me financially throughout college as well, even though I always worked or had internships and was making money of my own. I have always appreciated this immensely.


Because of my upbringing, my family very much has the mentality that the income we make individually is our whole family's income. To give an example of my what I mean: I once had to take my grandfather to a doctor's appointment, and we had to pay $500 dollars out of pocket. I simply paid the money out of my own bank account. My father or mother would transfer the money back into my account at some point later, or maybe never, but money has never been an *issue* in my family, so nobody ever counts how much we owe each other. 


Culturally, I grew up very Asian. I have a sense of duty to my family, as well as my extended family, to be there for them and help out whenever I can, just as they have done in raising me. 


**Problem**


During my time at college, my grandparents' health deteriorated. My parents became very busy with work. My sister became very involved in activities (but cannot drive herself anywhere). Senior year, my parents asked me if I would consider taking a year off post-grad to help care for the family. I was hesitant, but agreed. I take full responsibility of this.


It has been five months and I am becoming incredibly weary and resentful. I am essentially a domestic slave. I take care of my dying grandparents all day, take them to appointments, drive my sister around to any and every extracurricular activity, make her school lunch, clean the house. I do a lot of chores, including dinner prep, laundry, general cleaning. My sister has absolutely no chores (which is not how I was raised at all, but since I am doing so much of the work my mother did raising me, she has never asked my sister to help). I'm taking out the trash, picking up my parents dry cleaning. Whenever any work is being done around the house, I have to be home to pay the plumber, or the electrician, or the movers. 


Moving back home, what I expected was to help my parents take care of my sick grandparents while they were at work and too busy to provide for them. But it has become much more than that. 


And, to top it off, I don't have any of my own money. To be clear, I have had a part time job during the school year and a full time job over the summer every year since I turned 18. I have probably racked up tens of thousands of dollars of my own income. But because of the way I was raised, none of that money really felt like *mine.* Since my parents were so generous with their money to me when they raised me, I have been generous with mine, since really, it was *our money*. Over the course of the last five months, all my money has been depleted, and my bank account is pretty much empty. But again, since it is *our money*, my parents put me on an allowance, just so I have money for errands and a semblance of a personal life. 


My parents have never been so stress-free and happy since I move back. They often joke about how I should just stick around forever. 


But I'm miserable. And I've agreed to be miserable for seven more months.  My friends graduated, got jobs, are living their independent lives. I am stuck in my childhood home, taking care of my family, and I feel like I am regressing. I want to move out and get a job, but I committed to helping them. It would be different if I had any money saved up and could just move out, but it's like all the income I earned since I was 18 was for nothing. 


I don't know what to do. How can I bring this up? How do I get out of this situation when I have no funds to call my own? I desperately want to move out but I feel like I am trapped. I owe my parents so much for raising me, but I cannot take this much longer. 
   
**tl;dr**: My parents asked me to be the family caretaker post college graduation. All I do now is take care of my sick grandparents, my sister, and run errands. It is taking a toll on my mental health. I feel like I  only exist to be a maid. "

47bj0w,2,2016-02-24,Just diagnosed. What steps should I take?,BoredomReddit,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/47bj0w/just_diagnosed_what_steps_should_i_take/,"Sorry for wall of text, I have problems ):

Hi everyone, I am a 19 year old college sophomore and recently got diagnosed with anxiety. I've had extreme symptoms since I was a child but never had the opportunity to access mental health services until college because of my family's irrational beliefs. I also suspect I have ADHD and I am trying to get help for that as well. My university was able to diagnose me with anxiety but once I brought up a suspicion of ADHD the process to get diagnosed turned 100x harder - but that's another story. 

I want to understand my anxiety a bit better and searching online basically gives me generic answers and my counselor doesn't know much about my cases.

Ever since I was young, I wake up feeling anxious and nauseous if I have big plans or events and end up puking mucus and stomach acid. If I can hold it in it usually comes out from a short gag reflex when brushing my teeth. I get the exact same feeling sometimes during the day, especially in highly stressful situations. Does anybody else have this symptom? And what can I do to address it?

Another thing I have is that I have no problem meeting new people one to one or even conversation, however whenever I'm in a group setting I get more anxious. And presenting to a group of people is damn nearly impossible. If I do give presentations then I require tons of hand movements, pacing, and lots of stuttering.  If it's a professional presentation then I'll get an anxiety attack which is what happened at my first presentation for my business class last week. I felt asphyxiated and had to stop the presentation asking if I could talk to my instructor after class. I then took heavy breaths to calm myself down and asked if I could try again. I started off really strong but then I had a bunch of intrusive thoughts like am I stuttering too much, am I talking too fast, or moving my hands too much (by the way is a heavy part of your grade since it's a class on professionalism and ethics) which led to me not being able to focus because I also was physically trying not to do those things and lead to getting an anxiety attack. I could describe. Is there a specific type of anxiety that describes me based on this?

I also talk very fast when I want to convey an idea, especially when I'm passionate about it. Except when I'm anxious or lacking in confidence I'm extremely soft spoken and people complain they can't hear me all the time. I also afraid whatever I say will be judged heavily since I was bullied as kid all the time and was told my ideas/thoughs were stupid. I generally don't care what passerby strangers think but I care what my classmates think and I can never ask questions or answer the professors without extreme anxiety. Actually I have a huge fear of sounding stupid and people talking behind my back because I didn't understand a concept. Especially when it's already so hard for me to concentrate on many things.

My GPA is basically shit and I'm failing exams left and right. I'm doing okay on my homework if I have enough time and I got extended test time for my exams, but it's still hard for me to study and focus that I'm actually wasting time trying to read and do exercises when I can't even retain the information from distraction. I am constantly worried about not finding that one good internship that'll help you get a job because of my poor gpa and I'm also afraid I won't even find a job out of college. This is my biggest daily anxiety at school since my GPA looms over me the whole semester and everything I do in school will affect it. It bothers me endlessly. Most importantly is if I can pass my classes and graduate on time while my peers laugh and secretly make fun of me. I should mention I'm at and business school and word can get around about different students, I don't want to have and bad professional image especially if some of these kids will be my bosses. 

Also, I get racing thoughts not only during the day but in my sleep. If I have an exam the next day I'm dreaming about taking the exam and failing it and I'm in cold sweats feeling like I need to puke.

Can someone with similar experiences or expertise please help me with what I should do with my life based on this information? I live in the US and I feel like mental health care is really hard to access, it takes forever to get an appointment that fits my schedule, the cost is high and some places don't take insurance, and some doctors are outright not helpful at all!

Thank you very much!

47bp69,1,2016-02-24,Wrestling with whether to take an offer,Savage57,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/47bp69/wrestling_with_whether_to_take_an_offer/,"I need advice.

A bit of background about me: I earned a chemical engineering degree several years ago and went to work in a design firm in Arizona. The notion was that I'd work for a few years and then get a job in the Pacific Northwest, where I've always wanted to live. A few years pass and my office is going through major layoffs due to work shortages. I've been looking for jobs in the Northwest for a while and am beginning to understand that with my skills, the only places I can reliably hope to find work is in the southeast and Texas, and I'm not interested in either of these options. My only aim was to get back to the northwest, and I didn't enjoy my work enough to compromise on that goal.

So I go back to school for computer science. I get an internship in software testing and it's looking good. then I get the motherload: an internship with a big company in Oregon. And it's amazing. I'm doing some engineering, but I'm writing code too and I'm networking well and I'm very hopeful that I'm finally going to make it.

I have recently received an offer from them, but here's the kicker: it's neither in Oregon, nor is it in software. I'd be working in chemical engineering in Phoenix, which I'm less than enthusiastic about. I am worried that the offer is hard and fast and haven't asked if relocation to Oregon is even a possibility,  and now that I'm coming up on the expiration of the offer I'm afraid to ask. Above all I'm concerned that I'll be laid off again and that I'll never be able to get a job in software engineering, which is what I'm more interested in these days. However, while I have had some promising developments in my job search, nothing substantial has materialized. I don't know if it's a good idea to accept this offer as a safety, knowing that if I can't transfer back to Oregon or into a software position I won't be looking to put down roots here. It's a good company with a good culture, but all I want is to be back in the Pacific Northwest, more than anything. 

Do you have any advice on what I should do?

edit: it bears mentioning that I really don't want to burn this bridge if I don't have to. This company is really exceptional to work for and they do hire software people, so if working for them in that capacity in the future is a possibility I'd jump to take it."

&gt;SCF: That's great but you're still a kid, You teach well enough, and its only for a bit. Would it be okay if I had her drop by the shop on the weekends?

&gt;Me: I suppose if she really wants to, and you'd owe me a huge favour.

&gt;Me: Most problems you face are just puzzles. Rather expensive puzzles, but puzzles nonetheless. I have a customer coming fairly soon, so if you're interested in learning more about software, now would be the time to learn.

&gt;UNI: Sure! What's the issue?

&gt;Me: Claims to have a virus on a Mac.

&gt;UNI: Isn't that impossible?

&gt;Me: Not in theory, no - at least as far as I'm aware. But it's quite hard to pull off properly. I wouldn't know for sure as I don't work on OSX.

&gt;UNI: So why would you take the job?

&gt;Me: He installed Win7 on his Macbook.

&gt;UNI: ...

&gt;UNI: ...

&gt;UNI: Doesn't that defeat the point?

&gt;Me: Yep!

&gt;UNI: So why...

&gt;Me: Gaze not into the abyss. A lot of the time you'll not want to know why your clients have issues, just that they have them and you want to know how to solve them.

%TIMESKIP%

&gt;IntrepidCustomer: Hey /u/_politech! How's it going!

&gt;Me: Well enough, I have an intern for a few days, so things could be a lot worse.

&gt;*UNI waves* What's the issue?

&gt;IC: Well, my Macbook has a virus, I think. Can you handle that?

&gt;UNI: Well, I'll have to take a look at it first, but almost definitely.

&gt;Me: We'll handle it. Anything else you need?

&gt;IC: Well, my son's gaming desktop is acting weird too... could one of you look at that? 

&gt;Me: Sure. Bring it in tomorrow. 

&gt;IC: Thank you!

*IC leaves*

&gt;UNI: Well what about payment?

&gt;Me: He's a regular. He knows my scale. 

&gt;UNI: R...regular?

&gt;Me: Not the best with computers.

&gt;UNI: I...see.

*hands UNI the ""Mac""*

&gt;Me: So. Take a look and see if you can find a the major issues.

&gt;UNI: Do you already know?

&gt;Me: I have a theory.

*UNI takes the laptop and does some troubleshooting as I watch an episode of Hetalia*

&gt;UNI: Well, you have good taste in anime, at least. Mouse drivers aren't installed, occasional hangs that probably aren't hardware related, and I don't think it's stable. 

*laptop BSODS*

&gt;Me: Fantastic timing. Do you know how to fix those issues?

&gt;UNI: Yep! Well, except for the crash. Do we solve that?

&gt;Me: Unless we can recreate it, no. 

&gt;UNI: But...

&gt;Me: We can't waste time on a one off error. If he comes back and the error repeats, we can look into it. As for current solutions, mark it out on the list of problems.

&gt;UNI: Okay. So otherwise, what can we do?

&gt;Me: Fix the issues we know of, and if we find anything off that could be causing the BSOD issue, try to fix. It's a Macbook, so your choice on digging around on the hardware side of things.

&gt;UNI: I'd.... rather not. 

&gt;Me: Right. Well, I'm going to do some business calls, so I'll be outside. Good luck!

&gt;UNI: You're just going to let me be in the shop with all your gear...?

&gt;Me: Yep! Don't misuse it.

%TIMESKIP%

*UNI frantically waves to get my attention and motions for me to come in*

&gt;Me: What's so important that you had to do a wind sock impression to get my attention?

&gt;UNI: I found the issue.

&gt;Me: Oh?

&gt;UNI: Yeah. Like half of the computer is infected in some way. Including his AV.

&gt;Me: I've seen [worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/45itp8/it_broke_again_or_a_tale_of_chrome_and_viagra/), I suppose. 

&gt;UNI: H..how..?

&gt;Me: Gaze not into the Abyss.

&gt;UNI: So if I get rid of the viruses, will it fix the BSOD?

&gt;Me: Dammed if I know. Give it a shot.

&gt;UNI: But how?

&gt;Me: Ever boot from USB?

&gt;UNI: No?

*hands UNI an AV flash drive* 

&gt;Me: Set it to boot from this.

&gt;UNI: I don't know how.

&gt;Me: But do you know how to learn?

&gt;UNI: I guess...

&gt;Me: That's the most useful skill you'll learn. Try StackExchange or Google it. Your choice.

&gt;UNI: Can't I just fix the desktop?

&gt;Me: We both know it's probably just porn, and this is much more interesting and also more important. 

&gt;Me: But yeah, you can work on the gaming desktop when it comes in.

&gt;UNI: Hey, am I getting paid?

&gt;Me: If you solve the issue, sure.

%TIMESKIP%

&gt;UNI: I SOLVED IT!

&gt;Me: Yay! What was the issue!

&gt;UNI: He had a batch file in his startup that was causing a lot of issues.

&gt;UNI: Well, that, and one other thing...

&gt;Me: What thing?

&gt;UNI: He had no web browser.

&gt;UNI: He was trying to do his banking via Windows Explorer, I guess.

&gt;Me: I... **what**?

&gt;UNI: Yeah.

&gt;Me: Viruses gone too?

&gt;UNI: Yep! Learned how to boot from USB as well. But that's not the weird part. Nearly all the other issues were caused by that batch file.

&gt;Me: Any idea why?

&gt;UNI: Gaze not into the Abyss.

&gt;Me: THAT'S MY LINE

&gt;UNI: Actually, I think he thought it would let him bypass his work firewall.

&gt;Me: Really? What was it called, FirewallKey.bat?

&gt;UNI: Yep.

&gt;Me: Well, hush my mouth I guess.

&gt;Me: Still, one of these days you should see what one of my clients does to everything he touches. 

&gt;UNI: Should I?

&gt;UNI: Actually yeah I should.



~fin

Intrepid reader, this is a cautionary tale. Don't judge people based on their age, as they can surprise you. Also, apparently getting past the work firewall is totally the way to solve all your problems, and you should all definitely 100% totally do that and recommend that to all your friends (/s)

Once I'm confident I can go back to writing regularly and I'm confident that my depression isn't worsening, it'll be back to your regularly scheduled AL programming - unless you want more intern stories. 

TL;DR: Intern learns quick; Firewalls are bad, you can totally get away with no web browser, and Windows belongs on a Mac.

I am an intern at a small film production and part of that work is every once in a while to copy the mail adresses of all the people that ordered dvds into mac in a subcategory. 
Example: 
1. In Outlook we get a mail when someone buys a dvd in a folder, lets call it sales. 

2. I check if that adress is already in our contacts in the contacts app

3. If not I add the Name and Mail and Country into the Form and then put that adress into a subcategory for the year the ordered in.

4. We use those mails to send a newsletter to all those adresses in the respective countries. 

Is it possible to code a bot to check if the mail adress is in the Contact App, if yes, dont do anything, if no, add to contacts with all the above mentioned information. And would it be difficult to code?

I would just like to know if it is worth the effort.

Deck built on [NetrunnerDB](http://netrunnerdb.com).

I have been loving Vikram, and I decided to run it over Ichi for a few main reasons: it has great staying power in the mid- to late-game, works as a great tax on D4v1d counters, is more relevant against runners who don't use full rigs, and combos well with Turing for an early/mid-game scoring server (they can get in without programs but only if they take 2 brain damage traces and click through Turing).

Some atypical cards I've included that I haven't seen as much in other Foodcoats deck include Successful Demonstration and Heimdall 1.0 (I think more people are running 2.0?). I like it for extra burst economy in the early game, and it can still be relevant with Caprice later in the game. My favorite is those turns when you can play both back to back -- really accelerates credits early on if they facecheck Heimdall, Bastion, or another ETR ice and don't have a way to break.

Here are some specific questions:

1) Should I cut Successful Demonstration and just focus more on asset economy? I could go -2 SD, +1 Breaker Bay Grid, +1 Biotic Labor and have a stronger late game. I just have been hesitant to do this because I am worried there will be a lot of Whizzard, and I think Anarch will be unprepared to consistently break some of my higher-strength ice.

2) Should I include 1-2 more Will-o'-the-Wisp? I think this card combos great with BBG and will be effective against a wide range of Runners to open up scoring windows. Not sure what to cut for them, unless I go the very non-traditional route and cut 1-2 more Ash. Same thing with CVS. I cut it because I haven't been finding myself loving it when I drew it, but maybe that was just bad timing.

3) Should I cut Caprice and make room for Eli and...something else for 1-2 influence? Crisium Grid? I am less sure that this would be a smart move in my current list, as I use Caprice for better shots at scoring windows and Successful Demonstration. I also like having Bastion as it's fairly taxing but has a hard ETR.

4) In related to #3, is there a better ice suite you would recommend, especially for barriers? I like Heimdall 1.0 because I can go install HQ, credit, credit, and then go install ice R&amp;D, credit, Successful Demonstration on turn 2.

Any other general suggestions or feedback on the deck itself? Thanks!"
47ce0m,1,2016-02-24,I feel like a complete and utter wreck.,AliasAlphan,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/47ce0m/i_feel_like_a_complete_and_utter_wreck/,"This one's a really long post, just want to detail and let out everything about myself. For reference, I'm currently a junior in high school. 

I wasn't always lonely. During my middle school and freshman years, I was actually pretty popular. I went to a really small school that had maybe 150 people from 9th through 12th grade, and everyone loved me. I really don't know why, though. Maybe it was because I was funny sometimes. Maybe it was because there were only 40 people in my grade and no one wouldn't wanted to make enemies. Maybe I was just stupid and no one had the heart to let me know. But I was popular. People liked and respected me. I even dated a couple people my freshman year, being 6', barely 100 lbs (started the year at 89, finished at 104 after a gym membership) and having no hygiene or fashion sense. Jeans and a black jacket/random shirt for dayz, I guess. I knew everyone in my school, and everyone knew me. Life was great.

Towards the middle of that year, I was given the option to transfer to a nearby public school. I took it in a heartbeat. Who wouldn't want to go over and be the most popular or well known person in a public high school? That would be the complete dream. I took it, and immediately went over.

When I transferred, I really didn't know anyone. Random familiar faces from me having gone to a nearby elementary school in 6th grade were there, but I really didn't know anyone. My class schedule put me with mostly freshman to finish up course requirements, and I really didn't connect with anyone there. I had a single class with people in my grade, and didn't talk to basically anyone there. I think the only class I was any bit social in was in my AP Chemistry class, and I'm pretty sure that was out of pity. Even today, I don't really know or talk to anyone I was in class with my sophomore year. I tried to talk to people, but I was a complete wreck. I guess I just can't talk to people without being a complete clusterfuck. Even though this school was only 10 minutes away from my old charter I went to, no one there really talked to me, or wanted to hang out. And that's my fault. I trashed the school, saying that it wasn't developing the skills people needed to be successful post-graduation, and probably insulted a lot of people doing it. A girl I was dating towards the end of the year, with whom I made a promise to stay together, broke up with me a month into the summer, because I was being hilariously clingy despite us only texting each other for that whole month. I still cringe every time I think about it. This was a long time ago, but it still kind of reminds me of how stupid I can be.

Back to sophomore year, my grades tanked. I didn't talk to anyone from my old school or my new one for a very long time, and honestly only had friends in college. If they saw me more than once every two weeks, I'm sure they wouldn't have liked me, either. If I couldn't even keep my friends from my last school, or make ones at my new school, I doubt I could've stayed friends with them for that long if they'd seen me more often.

That year, I barely showered. I basically wore the same hoodie every single day, because it hid how disgusting I was. I didn't even try and ask anyone out, because I knew that I would've been rejected and laughed at more than I could've handled. I was a complete failure in every sense of the word. My grades tanked, and I barely got a 3.0 that year. I even failed my AP Calc BC exam with a 1, which was completely pathetic. If I had done anything else that year other than browse reddit in the back of the class, maybe I could've done better. Even better was that the BC class I was in had only two people in it. How stupid do you have to be to fuck around that much when you're literally the only person in a class? We had no teacher, so I guess I did what I wanted. But it's pathetic nonetheless.

My Spanish teacher, who taught Freshman Spanish, told my counselor at the end of the year that I shouldn't go into an honors course for Spanish the following year, because of how abysmal I was in her class. B first semester, and a C the second. In a class where the average was probably an A because of how easy it was. Absolutely pathetic in every sense of the word. My sophomore year was more than a slump. It was like a complete nosedive into an abyss with no end.

And for some reason, that whole year, I still didn't stop working out. Even when my lifts made no progress over the whole school year, I was still going, sometimes with the only person I still talked to from my previous school, but many times I'd go alone.

The second semester of that year, I took a full time job at a resort working with kids. I started out well, but towards the end of my employment I could tell that I was just some idiot that they didn't have the heart to fire. I probably couldn't have even gotten the that job if it wasn't for another friend of mine from my last school, who basically handed me an interview with his boss after having the job for a week. I did well until our original boss left and my friend quit, at which point I stopped caring about my job like I was somehow above it. That whole job was unbelievably easy, and I still couldn't do it right. I was pathetic.

Around this time, me and this friend of mine got back into a card game we played as kids. I wasn't embarrassed enough to not go to tournaments for it, but he clearly was, since these tournaments were filled with the exact type of people you'd expect to be playing children's card games at 30. I stopped after a couple months, but my before investing about $1000 into fucking cards. I managed to later sell them all and turn a profit once I quit, but that was still a very low point in my life, where I was shelling out cash for slips of cardboard.

Around the start of that semester, I also got into very shady business. Friends of friends heard that I could synthesize a very particular drug that I won't name online, and hired me to do that with a couple people who graduated from a nearby college. I worked with them and sold it across my school and schools nearby, and turned a huge amount of profit. Most of that would be squandered on card games, gas, my personal college fund, and League of Legends. 

That summer, while keeping these two jobs, I got an internship from my Mock Trial coach for doing well in competition. I didn't do anything that entire internship, straight-up didn't show up to my internship some days, and essentially wasted a whole summer driving down to my lawyer's office without doing anything productive, wasting her time. I also began volunteering at my local hospital to help out, and... Actually I'll be honest, I did that job pretty well. I'm going to skip over that.

This whole summer, I was also smoking a stupid amount of weed with my college friends, who had come back for the summer. I wasted so much time that summer that could've been spent doing literally anything else, but I squandered it.

Come the start of junior year, I quit my job on very bad terms after being told how bad I was at my job (I knew. I just didn't have it in me to care.). My class schedule somehow ended up with essentially all AP classes, even though I was a complete wreck the previous year. I moved from synthesis to essentially becoming a major dealer at another nearby public school. This year, for no good reason, I signed up for 5 extracurriculars, while still keeping my volunteer job at the hospital. This year, I don't know what happened, but I pulled up. I worked out harder than ever before. I took it upon myself to fix my personal appearance. I started to care about my hygiene and personal well being. I maintained work in all those clubs, held leadership positions, kept and did well in honors societies and groups, and got a 3.33 UW for my first semester. Not good at all, and not what I should've gotten had I tried my best, but I was still pretty happy. I made some friends, and made a ton of friends in senior classes. But nevertheless, I made basically no friends in my own grade. In fact, honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if people in my grade just straight up thought I was special needs or something. 

So why am I bringing all this up, and why is it getting posted to this sub? 

Because today could've been the worst day for me in a very long time. Bear in mind, this whole day is the first day back from my school after my grandfather's funeral, so I guess it might be embellished. Anyways, back to what I was typing before.

My third period teacher paired me up with another person who was absent the day before like I was, and this person just straight up thinks I'm a loser. Honestly, even without him really knowing me, he's right. If he's heard anything from anyone who's known me for a long time, then he'd know how pathetic I am. I tried inviting him to a college party sometime first semester, and he basically laughed and said he had work, which was obviously an excuse. Oh well. 

Almost no one I know has the same lunch period I do, so my lunches are with some guy who I currently work with (I got a part-time job about a month ago, but had sat with him the entire year) and a person from my AP Chemistry class last year. That's it. I move from time to time to talk to other groups of people I know, but that's basically it. 

My fifth period today was some classroom discussion. Some girl I know, who I have no interest in, moved her seat to go sit on the opposite end of the room after I grabbed a seat next to her. I don't know if I'm repulsive or something, but that ruined me. I don't have any intention of asking her out, I mean, I'm dating someone right now, but the fact that she moved not long after I grabbed a seat next to her is just completely pathetic on my part. I guess its goes to show how pathetic I am.

After school, I rode the bus home alone, because I usually stay after for clubs but none were going on that day. Once I got back, I started doing homework, and afterwards I went to go pick up my dog from a family friend's house after not seeing her for four days; we dropped her off for the funeral, and I went to go pick her up afterwards. She didn't even bother to acknowledge me. Which figures.


I mean, with how busy I am with schoolwork, I never get to spend time with her. There are other people in my house, I mean, my sister and parents play with her. I just don't have the time. And I guess it shows since she clearly didn't recognize me.

Should mention right now since I can't edit it into the main post, I quit all my dealing and operations around December, and made it out with a pretty hefty sum of cash. Most of it I've spent on weed and alcohol, but a good chunk of it has gone towards my personal college fund.

To top it all off, my PSAT scores will probably qualify me as a semifinalist, and then as a finalist for NMS. Being a NMS finalist gives me a full ride to my state school, which means that I can't go out of state. Which is fine, I mean, my GPA probably wouldn't let me go anywhere meaningful, anyway. But my girlfriend, who lives across the country, had plans with me to go to an OOS school together, which can't really happen now that a full ride to my state school is very much possible. This means that there's basically no chance of us ever seeing each other again.

After coming back from the gym with friends, I realized that after this year, all my senior friends will have graduated. And I'll be all alone, just like my sophomore year. Just that thought alone makes me want to kill myself. To top it off, I have 6 APs, an internship, volunteering, positions, and work going on and I don't know if I can handle all of that at once, especially if I'm all alone doing it all.

And even after all I've grown and changed from my freshman to my junior year, I still feel as alone and useless as ever. I can barely sleep. I never have time to relax anymore. I'm a complete wreck to everyone in my grade and my old school. Until very recently, every time I had the chance, I'd just get completely stoned or trip out on LSD (Which, somehow, I've never had a bad trip on) and just escape. I have so many problems that I've brought upon myself that I can't ever see myself being a good enough person to be a real partner to someone, let alone a father in 10 or 20 years.

After this year, I'll be alone. Irreversibly, undeniably, completely alone. All my friends will be out in college, and I'll have a year to reflect on how miserable and pathetic I've been these last four years. At least I can do it alone.

Even though I'm in the top 8% of my class, and have done so much as a person, the top 10 students in my grade think I'm borde Maybe I am. Even though I'm not unattractive, 6'2"", 145 and very built/muscular, I'm still a compete piece of shit, and I don't have anything but my personality and own self to blame. Maybe I'm just conceited for thinking that people care about how I look, especially when I'm such a complete loser on the inside, where it counts. 

I don't know if I'm ready to take on the rest of high school, let alone the rest of my life.

If anyone reading this has any questions, I'll be happy to answer them. Thanks to whoever took the time to read though this."

Yet he didn't look a day over fifty, all the vibrance and youth of anyone else in the company as he slid two silver pistols into holsters under his armpits.

""Alright, gentlemen, listen up!"" He called out. Everyone was already silent, waiting for what he was about to say. ""We're ready to close the deal on this buyout. But if you think for a second that OmniCorp won't try and fight tooth and nail for every last share, well you clearly haven't been paying attention."" Arthype moved around the room, placing a hand on one man's shoulder, checking another man's clip, locking eyes with each individual, ending with me at the far side of the room. He grinned and squeezed my shoulder. ""We've been fighting for those military contracts for too long, boys. Today, we're cutting out the competition.""

---

I watched as Arthype's car wound its way through the streets to the OmniCorp building, an imposing high-rise several blocks away. Our men were stationed along the side of the rooftop of the VeloCorp building facing the OmniCorp tower. As we waited for Arthype's signal, four men came forward and pointed four, swivel-mounted harpoon guns at the tower. They fired four, thick metal wires at the Omni Tower, winding back the winch on the harpoon guns to pull the wires taut. I was pulling on my coat over my collared shirt and kevlar when I heard a distant *pop.* All of our attention snapped to the OmniCorp tower in time to see several flashes and one window burst open in an explosion of glass as gunfire broke out at the opposite tower. ""This isn't right, Arthype was supposed to send us a signal. Alright, go! Go! Go!"" I shouted. All of the employees crowded the ziplines and began to fly across the distance between the two towers on motorized zipline trolleys. I checked to make sure mine was secure and clicked the forward switch, immediately zooming across the wide chasm, the sounds of horns and car engines below a faint hum, as the city opened up wide beneath me. Before I knew it, the OmniCorp building was below my feet. I disconnected from the zipline and pulled my assault rifle up from the strap around my chest.

The men were already clearing the building, gunning down any OmniCorp thug who tried to stand in their way, all of them searching for Thomas J. Arthype. I didn't have time to stumble down stairwells, tromping over OmniCorp employees. Instead, I planted a anchor into the roof of the building, pulled some slack from the attached rope and began rappelling down the building to the open window. I descended one floor, my men chewing through the target with ease and determination. I pushed off the building again and slid down another floor, the OmniCorp underlings either dead or subdued. As I descended one more floor, the window cracked as a spray of bullets scattered across the glass-front. Upon impact with the window, I easily smashed through, firing several rounds into the backs of the enemy workers, dropping them like flies. ""Keep moving, men! Thomas is only a few floors lower!"" I yelled. With that, I leapt out of the window, letting out a little slack on the rope in order to swing down to the floor Arthype had been on.

Absolute chaos was breaking out as I let go of the rope and rolled into the building, landing with a *thud* against a suit-wearing corpse beneath a blood-stained conference table. I regained my bearings, checking the body for Thomas's face but instead seeing the lifeless, gray eyes of Meredith, Arthype's secretary. I eyed the room beyond, where gunfire was being exchanged from seemingly every direction. Standing, I rushed to the cover of the doorframe, trying to peek around the corner. Instead, bullets peppered the wall right next to my head and I ducked back into cover. I stuck a finger into my earpiece, shouting, ""I found Arthype! I'm getting hammered in here, I need reinforcements!"" The sound of the wall exploding around me caught my attention. A huge hole suddenly appeared several feet away, followed by another a little closer, then another and another. I dove past the open doorway as several more holes burst through the wall where I'd been standing, following my path across the room. The table basically exploded into splinters as some extreme ordinance reduced it to kindling, craters opening in the carpet as the gunman closed in on my location. I sprinted to the window, diving out and for a few crazy moments, it was as if I was suspended in air, no connection to the earth or the building behind me. Then everything snapped back to reality as my fist closed around the rope and I twisted and writhed in the air, swinging around to another window.

I connected with the side of the building again, peering in through the glass to see some huge, bipod; a massive, two-legged robot with menacing gatling guns on either side of its main body. Not that I was surprised. Where VeloCorp had been making advancements in cybernetics, OmniCorp had been tiring away on the robotics front. With that, I sent a signal out through the rest of my forces, to activate Act 2 of this buyout. I could see faint circuit lines in my field of vision, closing on on the huge robot and circling it. The bot froze, mid-step, one foot hovering in the air, gatling guns steaming. I smirked and began a gradual ascent to the floor above, where my men were quickly moving through. I watched one of my subordinates toss an OmniCorp worker against the glass front of the building, fissures in the glass webbing out as he impacted on the window. Another man's eyes were glowing as some other OmniCorp intern or temp started screaming, blood dripping from his ears and eyes as a soundless pulse issued from his attacker's implants, slowly cooking the victim's insides like a microwave. I could tell my initial hack of the OmniCorp robot was finished when the glass of the window below me exploded into powder, misting away into the air. I slid down and the rope and snapped my fingers, the robot taking its cue and trotting over to the window and over the edge, plummeting the street below. I smiled when I heard it meet the ground in a thunderous explosion followed by the cheer of several car alarms below. This takeover was going just swimmingly. Now I just needed to find my boss...

47cqjg,6,2016-02-24,Internships?,helluhconfused,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/47cqjg/internships/,"So I've been on the prowl for some internship opportunities, and have started applying, but I'm worried that as a sophomore computer engineer who hasn't taken any relevant programming or actual computer engineering related courses yet, my choices will be severely limited. Since I can't be hired for a software position or anything technical that is actually relevant to my major, I thought it might be useful to get different positions that are at least at engineering firms/somewhat related to STEM. One thing I recently landed for this summer was an opportunity to teach minority girls in STEM/aid in the program's overall execution, but I'm wondering if it's a waste of time if I don't end up doing anything really technical. Another option is looking into doing scientific research, since I'm considering entering the biomed/chemical industry after graduation. Ideally I'd end up doing both this summer, but if I only manage the STEM organization thing, should I even bother or just keep looking?"

I appreciate it. I made a similar post in r/PCMasterRacebuilds Trying to get as many opinions as possible. **tl;dr below**.


What follows is background information. **You can skip ahead to important build info below.**

As the title states, I am trying to piece together a budget entry gaming build for my girlfriend. I built my first PC last year (March 2016) and I am in love with [this thing](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/theflashking/saved/#view=tBLKHx). I was already transitioning into the PC gaming world from console, and building this machine has all but clinched that transition (Kingdom Hearts… *sigh*).

I am wanting to share gaming with my girlfriend who lives in a different city than I do, and thought I could use what I learned in building my pc to build her something to get her started. I really hope to get her hooked, but I have to get her going first. With that in mind, I set to building the following.


**Build info starts here**

**Here is what I have put together for her.**

Priorities (**in bold**) and things I have considered as well as have in mind:


 * **Budget**: I am building this myself, using money I earn from my internship. Though I’d love to splurge on her, I cannot afford that right now (collegeeeee). So this is a top priority. Trying to stay max ~$500. Less would be better.

 * **Functionality**: Budget in mind, I still need this to be a good experience for her. So I’m pushing that GPU as best I can. Pretty graphics and smooth playability with current games is a must. Do not want to turn her off to gaming because of a crappy experience caused by her pc. With that said, **I am concerned with bottlenecking the GPU with the CPU**. But that’s ok at first if it lets me get it off the ground at a much lower price.

 * GPU: I want to get her the best manageable GPU I can. 

 * Scalability: I picked these parts with future upgrades in mind. If she really finds things she likes to play, I want to be able to flesh out the machine in the future. An i3 or i5 cpu maybe. A GTX 980 gpu. If I want to be able to get there in the most affordable way possible, I am insuring I have the proper socket mobo in place for those future Intel CPUs. In other words, this is why I am not using AMD.

 * Peripherals/Accessories: Since she's a total noob to gaming, I do not plan on going all out with a gaming mouse, killer headset, and mech keyboard (this one is actually a maybe. Having someone I love type on anything different almost feels like betrayal). I plan to fish around for a keyboard here, a mouse there, two monitors there. Just to get her by at first. Leaves great room for future presents/upgrades too! :D

 * Case: Left it out on purpose, since that will largely depend on her preference (she likes all things ""cute"" &gt;.&gt; can't blame her) and my comments for functionality. Chances are we'd get something I'd have to paint for her to get the colors right.

I could really use tips on where to best get affordable parts. I am not above buying quality used products or finding functioning parts from other machines (except for the GPU). 

I have only built a computer once. I really enjoyed it. I have done and continuing doing more and more research so I can produce the best machine with the right reasons behind them. 

I am open to all tips. Thank you so much for reading again, and for your help!
tl;dr: Building a budget entry level gaming PC for my girlfriend prioritizing budget then functionality. Important bits in bold. Would appreciate reviews.

* *Edits:* Reasons for leaving out case; Edited parts list. I really want to get that i5 in there but the money, it hurtss.... &gt;.&lt;.

* *Edits 2/24/16 1:22 PM:* put in the i5 &gt;.&gt;

47cuzh,13,2016-02-24,Irritated with season 5 so far. What kept you guys watching?,bryceandspam,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/47cuzh/irritated_with_season_5_so_far_what_kept_you_guys/,"So far behind, I know. I started watching on Netflix late last year. I just finished episode 9 of season 5 and there's a couple things that are really irritating me. 

&amp;nbsp;

1) They really downplay the new interns. Yeah, Meredith and the gang are now residents, but it seems that they have stayed at the same level in maturity and medical knowledge while the writers made the new interns complete idiots compared to Mer &amp; Co. Why?    
At the end of episode 9 where Lexi (so cute) and the new interns screw up an appendectomy on a fellow intern, the residents proceed to lecture the interns and put them on probation -- as if it wasn't their refusal to teach that led the interns to operate on themselves in the first place. Did this story arc frustrate anyone else? I hate seeing the original gang still acting like idiots but paling in comparison to the unrealistic idiocy of their new interns. Feels like cheap writing and it's making me dislike the characters.

&amp;nbsp;

2) What the hell is going on with Izzy? She was with George, then she wasn't, then she was with Karev, and now she's still with Karev but mind-fucking Denny on the side (she's like, actually insane). And I don't remember her and George even breaking up officially.    
It's ridiculous to see that George left Callie for Izzy, tried and failed at a sex life, and just gave up like that. Meanwhile Izzy gets back with Karev almost instantaneously and George apparently has no problem with it. What the hell? Like I said, stuff like this is making the show hard to watch because I'm disliking all the characters I fell in love with.

&amp;nbsp;

I actually feel better typing all of this out, so I think I just needed to vent. And I know this must be such a blast from the past for most of you like, ""Season 5? What the hell that was almost ten years ago!"" but maybe there are some of you who are new like me or rewatching the series and can remember this season. Either way, any thoughts?

47czmz,1,2016-02-24,Credit Card Debt Settlement Ideas,ThrowawayDebtSettled,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/47czmz/credit_card_debt_settlement_ideas/,"Hello-	I’ve read a lot on here, a lot about SOE of debt and trying to get a paid-in-full or pay for delete, and a lot of other things, and I’ve still got questions. I wrote out a whole long thing, but I decided I gave you all way to much backstory that you all probably don’t want to read, so I deleted it and decided to give the TLDR 


* 	+  My girlfriend had a lot of debts she hadn’t made payments on since July of last year she wanted to take care of because she had some money come in about a month ago
	+ All of these debts, a month ago, were still with the original creditors and not sold to debt collectors. The debts are all legitimately hers.
	+ We called the largest debt, a synchrony credit card- 2400, to see if they’d be willing to do some sort of payment plan (she makes very little money) to prevent the debt from being sold to collections
	+ they said they were happy to take a payment, but the debt was already in process of being sold to a collections, and unless we could Pay In Full (we couldn’t) it would still be sold
	+ We paid off all the other debts in full, nobody we worked with was willing to do a pay for delete, but we will attempt to write goodwill letters to get rid of some of the late derogatory marks.
	+ A collections agency called today, Synchrony has sold the debt to them
	+ It is well within the SOE (went delinquent a year ago), my girlfriend won’t let me pay it in full since it’s her debt from before us and I have my own issues and it’s not my responsibility
	+ She makes intern level money and works in education and is very poor (under 1k a month, US) this won’t be changing for quite awhile
	+ They offered us a settlement of 1400, and when I said I couldn’t afford it they said they could go to 975. I still said I couldn’t afford it.

	From what I can tell, given her financial situation and the fact she is unlikely to be able to pay this in full and that it’s already in collections, I think her best bet is to settle, correct? If she did a payment plan, it could be years before we pay it in full. Do you think I could get a better deal than 975? It seems like a generous and good offer, but I’m surprised at how quickly it was offered to me and I was wondering if we could push for more. If I wanted to go about negotiating a better offer, what’s the best way for me to do so? What should I offer them?

47d3zj,2,2016-02-24,"How is it like being an intern, and how should you put interns to better use? From an intern's perspective",anton164,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/47d3zj/how_is_it_like_being_an_intern_and_how_should_you/,"Having joined a start-up as an intern just after the company’s inception in May 2013, I can soon boast about completing my third year as an intern, the bottom of the office food chain, and I'm loving it.

I was hired coming straight out of high-school with very limited coding experience. You might be wondering what value a fresh high school graduate could bring to a startup, and frankly so did I. 

Thanks to my founders' well-guided approach to interns, I have been able to succeed with a variety of tasks at the company. That's a win-win, I've learned a lot from them and hopefully I've also contributed to their growth.

If you’re a student, or currently unemployed, hopefully, I can pass on some motivation. Pursuing an internship at a startup has its challenges, but if you’re motivated and passionate about what you do, or rather, what you would like to be doing, there are tons of opportunities in line.

If you’re someone higher up the food chain, you will hopefully gain some insight into the bottom-up perspective and how you can put interns to better use.

Check out the full article on our blog, https://ardoq.com/being-an-intern-at-a-software-startup/, as I've used images and already formatted it nicely. The bottom line is, HIRE INTERNS and do it well."
47d5dw,2,2016-02-24,I [24/F] with my sister [27/F] think my mom [55/F] needs help but don't know what to do,passiveagressivemom,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/47d5dw/i_24f_with_my_sister_27f_think_my_mom_55f_needs/,"I think this is going to be long. To give you some background, my parents are separated and we are originally from middle east and moved to the US 6 years ago to live close to my dad. Things have been great, we love the country and are grateful to be here however it seems like my mom is struggling. 

My mom has always been an introvert like me. I was so introverted and shy that I couldn't even order my own coffee and always hid behind my older sister. As time went by, I found friends at the university, completed a couple of internships and still am an introvert but socially comfortable and love going out with friends etc. 

This didn't happen to my mom. She doesn't have any friends. She has people at work that she talks to but no going out after work or during the weekends. I'd go as far to say that she has a special snow flake syndrome for thinking being an introvert makes one superior to others. I used to have this mentality before going to university but I grew out of it. I know you can't improve with having that mentality. 

Since she doesn't have any friends, her only social outlets are me and my sister (we all live together - cultural norm). I don't mind talking to my mom but I can't be available all the time and I want her to have her own friends. My sister and I are probably going to move away for jobs and studies soon. 

She also has other problems like she never apologizes for anything. My dad says she has too much pride to apologize. This causes so many problems because she gets super passive aggressive constantly about any discomfort. For example, she's not talking to me because I didn't set up her fitbit. I sent instructions in simple steps three times over text but she still wanted me to set it up. To her, fixing computers and setting up new technologies is my job because I'm finishing my computer engineering degree. and I don't mind fixing people's problems but sometimes things are simple enough to do it yourself with a little bit help from google. 

I hate passive aggressive-ness. I hate lack of communication. If she's upset about something, she never says anything. Just the silent treatment for as long as she can go and then starts talking again whenever she feels like it. And she can get upset at literally anything. We're constantly walking on eggshells around her. 

She used to get upset about me and my sister going out for a coffee run or me going out with my friends. I think she just wants us to be around so she knows we're safe. it used to be that she wanted constant updates ... so if I went to a restaurant and then to a park, both my parents wanted me to inform them but they grow out of it (cause I stopped doing it lol)

my mom has a lot of communication problems but I think the main issue is lack of friends and hobbies. It could also be depression? She just comes home from work, eats and watches tv. 

It's so sad because back in our country, she used to be my hero. She started from zero when my dad left, never asked help from no one. Sent us to best schools to get the best education and was always hard working and respected and had friends. The transition from cultures hasn't been easy for her. She used to have a highly respected job, now she recently got a desk job so I'm sure it hasn't been easy. Used to have friends but doesn't have any anymore. and cultural differences too ... in our culture it's good to be reserved but US culture praises openness and extroverts. Obviously my sister and I had our own struggles to fit in with culture, get along with my dad and everything but we were younger. Much easier to adjust to new culture when you're young. 

I think my mom would benefit from someone to talk to. Like a therapist. But I don't know how to bring it up. She gets offended at everything and currently is on silent treatment because I didn't set up her fitbit. 


   
**tl;dr**: My mom doesn't have friends and overall has plenty of communication issues and might benefit from a therapist.  I don't know how to seek help for her. "

Don't know what to think about it.",thebargainartist,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/47dn71/had_my_first_real_second_interview_yesterday_dont/,"Backstory: Originally applied to an internship with Beauty Procurement for a major grocery retailer that I've worked for for 8 years. Interview went well, but the director wanted me to apply for a full time salary position as an assistant to a buyer. Had phone interview and was selected for a second in-person interview.

I guess I'm just asking other people with experience in a second interview if my experience is normal and/or positive. Basically, I've met all of the people who work in this department before and am fairly familiar with the work they do there since I've worked in an area that requires their support on a lot of things. My second interview was with my would be boss if I get hired for this position. I went into her office and sat down and she said she would be going over the specifics of the position and would ask me some questions. She also had my resume in front of her. The whole interview was an hour long but she didn't really ask me any questions about my skills. She asked me a few from my resume about my degree, some job related systems that I knew, and how comfortable I was with Microsoft office and Excel which I said ""very"". The only thing I feel weird about was when she asked me how I use Excel now...which I don't and said I haven't used it since college (I graduated in August 2014) which kind of concerns me because this area of the company basically lives in Excel. 

All in all, I don't know how to feel about it because I did prepare for the standard behavioral and skill questions, but she and I just talked about the business and things related to the position. I think we left on a positive note because we were talking about our personal lives for a little bit, but I don't know. She said she is still doing interviews and if selected, I'll have at least one other interview with the director (who asked me to apply) and another member of the team. I feel like if she asked me the standard interview questions and I answered them how I had prepared, I would have a better idea of how I stand. So I guess can anyone tell me what they think or what their experience were in the second interview process?"

I know the school requires student get at least one internship before graduation, so I am wondering if letting the school know somehow would increase my chances? Has anyone every done / heard of anyone doing this before?"

However, I am about to earn my BS degree pretty soon and I haven't done any internship I applied at few places but i didn't get excepted to them and just time went by after that.. I was wondering if this would make me hard to get a job and is there any idea what i should do to cover that no internship experience?? I feel like I was wasting my time focusing on my Stupid GPA and not focusing more on trying to work(intern) some place by researching."

I just found out I'm not getting the dream internship.,ojeele,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/47e7wa/feeling_crushed_i_just_found_out_im_not_getting/,"I found out about a position that was everything I wanted in an internship more than a year ago and I kept it on my radar ever since. This was the year where I finally had the qualifications and confidence to get to the interview stage. I was one of the few, if not the only, candidate that they invited for an in person interview. After driving a couple hours to the company's headquarters and interviewing well, I felt as if I had the job in the bag. 

Today I found out that a colleague of mine was offered the job instead. He's much more qualified and charismatic than I am so I don't fault the company for choosing him. I'm happy for him, really, but I can't help but feel really down about not getting the job. I know this massive sense of disappointment is my fault for being so sure of myself so soon after the interview, but I feel absolutely crushed right now.  

I'll bounce back and use this experience as motivation to improve myself. But for now, I just need to vent a little bit. 

Thanks for reading."

----------------------------------------------------------------
ACT ONE

The episode opens with the MizTV and Miz is covered in rotisserie chicken pieces.

**Miz**

I hope you enjoyed my one-man chicken pieces fight, kids! Now it's time for another fanschmabulous episode of... Monday Night Raw!

The episode is titled ""Are you watching Cole?"" Kevin Owens makes Michael Cole bungee jump into a volcano using his intestine. Cole dangles just above the lava, and Owens pours gasoline into him until Cole goes up in flames. The Simpsons TV is turned on, displaying this episode, but with no one watching. Marge walks through the living room and notices.

**MARGE**

Kids? Kids? (She finds her children eating stacker2 and Popeyes in the kitchen.) You're missing the Kevin Owens Show. Don't you like it anymore?

**LISA**

(reading the back of a Popeyes box) Sure, we love it. But how can we watch WWE when it's so beautiful out? (pointing out the El Rey network and Lucha Underground)

**BART**

Well, yeah, Mom. I mean, we love NJPW and PWG too, but God knows we don't need to see it every day.

**MARGE**

An occasional indie match is all I ask. (stiffly hugs him, Bart No Sells)

**BART**

Mom! You can hug me when TNA's on.

**MARGE**

I do!

**BART**

Ahhh!

At ""MustseeTV"" studios, Vince McMahon Jr. comes to Miz's lockerroom, which is a closet.

**VINCE**

Hey, Miz, you look great. You get your teeth bleached and recently replaced because of that rookie redneck, AJ Styles?

**Miz**

Yeah, it's a new kind of polymer treatment... Hey, shut up! You're here 'cause your ""Land of the Giants"" storylines are stinking up the Raw ratings. Look at this breakdown of last Monday's show. (He shows Vince the ratings graph, with a huge dip in) Eh, eh, eh, Big Show vs Braun Strowman, KABOOM!

**VINCE**

What happened here? Lightning hit the transmitter? Football game on? Grammys on?

**Miz**

See, that's what I thought at first, but then... Hey, shut up! That crater is where you lousy main event landed. It's ratings poison.

**Vince**

But Big Show and Strowman are critically acclaimed!

**Miz**

Acclaimed!? (spits) I oughta replace it right now with that Japanese Match where that guy wrestles .......an inflatable doll! (sits down in his chair) But I'm Miz, and I'm awesome. So I'll give you one more chance. Get out! Don't come back 'til you fixed ""Monday Night Raw""!

Vince walks out, slamming Miz's closet door so hard that it comes of the hinges and falls to the floor. Alex Riley can be seen outside.

**SECRETARY**

(off screen) Okay Alex, you can go in now.

Alex Riley enters, holding a tin can of Rage.

**Alex Riley**

Miz, I've come to solicit TV time for the WWE Hall of Fame and... (Miz stares at him) Uh... I'll come back later.

At Springfield Mall, Marge is shopping with the kids.

**MARGE**

I need to purchase a brassiere and a Naomi Ponytail hat. You kids wait over here in the WWE Shop 90% off section.

**BART**

Oh, can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?

**MARGE**

Mmm...okay, just be careful.

Bart and Lisa run off. They run into a creepy-looking guy. It's old-school NXT wrestler, Johnny Curtis.

**Johnny Curtis**

Would you kids like to come with me?

**BART**

(simultaneously with Lisa) Sounds good to me! Let's go!

**LISA**

(simultaneously with Bart) Okay! Guess so.

Bart &amp; Lisa participate in a WWE universe focus group, along with several other kids including Rich Brennan, Ryback and Bo Dallas.

**Johnny Curtis**

Alright, thanks for participating in our focus group, kids. Today, we're going to show you some Monday Night Raw.

The kids cheer in delight.

**Ryback**

Ryback Rules! Feed me More!

**Curtis**

We want you to tell us what you think. And, be honest, because no one from the WWE is here spying on you. (chuckles)

A sneezing sound comes from a large mirror on the wall. That man is instantly fired.

**LISA**

Why is that mirror sneezing?

**Curtis**

Ah, look, it's just an old, creaky mirror, y'know, sometimes it sounds a little like it's sneezing, or eating a buritto, or being out of touch.

**LISA**

Hmm...

Curtis gives a thumbs-up to the mirror.

**Curtis**

Now, you each have a phone with a WWE app installed in front of you. When you like what you see, join the conversation with # WWEFOCUSGROUP. When you don't like what you see, shut up and complain online.

**Bo** 

(with phone in mouth) My phone tastes funny.

**Curtis**

Please refrain from tasting the phone.

First up, Owens and Cole play pool. Owens knocks out Cole's eyeballs with a cue ball and Cole replaces them with two pool balls. The kids laugh and vote on WWE.com. The next segment is set on an island. While The Total Divas sunbathe, a muscle-bound man in bikini trunks flexes in front of the camera. Ryback tweets  ""# This is Awesome"" on Rich's phone repeatedly to the twitterverse.

**RICH**

Hey, quit it!

From behind the mirror, Vince and two other people watch on a monitor. Vince loves this second segment.

**Vince**

They like Owens, they like the Divas, one awesome kid seems to love the Speedo man, as he should,... what more do they want DAMNIT?

Back with the focus group.

**Curtis**

Okay, how many of you kids would like RAW to deal with real-life problems, like the ones you face every day? (the kids all cheer and agree) And who would like to see them do just the opposite - getting into far-out situations incest angles, midgets and poopjokes? (more cheering) So, you want a realistic, down-to-earth show... that's completely off-the-wall and swarming with incest angles? (The kids agree)

**Ryback**

Yeah, MORE.

**Rich**

And also, you should win things by watching and following the conversation on WWE.com and twitter!

Curtis sighs. The light is turned on in the observation booth, and Vince appears at the mirror.

**Vince**

You millenials don't know what you want! That's why you're still smarks: 'cause you're stupid! Just tell me what's wrong with the freakin' show!

He turns the lights out. BO starts crying and calls his Be-A-Star representative.

**Bo**

Mommy!

**LISA**

(talking to the mirror) Um, excuse me sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with Raw, it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the wrestlers just can't have the same impact they once had.

Vince turns the light back on.
**
Vince**

That's it. That's it, little girl! You've saved Raw!

David Otunga enters the room, holding papers.

**Otunga**

Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save Raw.

At WWE HQ, Vince has called a meeting of the writers (who look strikingly similar to the real WWE writers) along with Miz and Chief Brand Officer, Stephanie McMahon.

**Vince**

I have figured out how to rejuvenate Raw. It's so simple, you egghead writers would've never thought of it! What we need is... a new sports entertainer! One that today's kids can relate to!

The writers look at each other, uncertain.

**Dewey Foley**

Are you absolutely sure that's wise, sir? I mean, I don't want to sound pretentious here, but Monday Night Raw comprise a dramaturgical balance of characters.

**Miz**

Hey, this ain't wrestling, it's sports entertainment! (to Vince) Whaddya got in mind? Gay Hairstylist Chihuahua? White Gangster Rapper Octopus? Redneck Pitbull from the South?

**Vince**

No, no. The Megastar hierarchy goes technical shooter, Rebel Badass, Samoan. (to the writers) S-A-M-O-A-N.

**David Kapoor**

Uh, a Samoan? Isn't that a tad predictable?

**Stephanie McMahon**

In your dreams. We're talking the original Samoan from hell.

**David Kapoor**

You mean Haku?

**Stephanie McMahon**

(pause) We at the WWE network want a Samoan with attitude. He's edgy, he's ""a silent badass"" and also ""talkative jokester"" You've heard the expression ""underdog""? Well, this is a dog who ""overcomes the odds"" Consistently and thoroughly.

**Miz**

So he's proactive, huh?

**Stephanie McMahon**

Oh, God, yes. We're talking about a totally outrageous paradigm. Borderline ridiculous and unrealistic.

**Dewey Foley**

Excuse me, but ""proactive"" and ""paradigm""? Aren't these just brandings that dumb people use to sound important? Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that. I'm fired, aren't I?
**
Vince**

Oh, yes. You're FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRED.

**Vince**

The rest of you writers start thinking up a name for this Samoan; I dunno, something along the line of say... Roman, only more proactive.

**Miz**

Yeah!

Miz, Vince and Stephanie leave.

**David Kapoor**

So, Roman okay with everybody?

**WRITERS**

Yeah...

An animator, who looks like Kevin Dunn, draws a sketch of a Samoan

Vince

No, no, no! He was supposed to have attitude.

**Dunn**

Um... wh-what do you mean, exactly?

**Vince**

Oh, you know, attitude, attitude! Uh... pretty contacts!

**Stephanie McMahon**

Can we put him in more of a ""Riot Officer"" context?

**Miz**

Forget context, he's gotta be an ex-football player. Give me a nice shmear of ex-football player.

**Stephanie McMahon**

I feel we should dude/bro him by ... ten percent or so.

Dunn redraws Roman. They're still not totally satisfied.

**Vince**

Hmm... I think he needs a little more attitude.

Dunn shakes the paper up and down and adds a bigger chest protector.

**Stephanie McMahon**

Oh yeah, bingo. There it is, right there!

**Miz**

Yeah, that's it!

**Vince**

I love it!

The next morning, The Simpsons eat breakfast. Bart notices the headline on the dirtsheets Homer is reading: ""BREAKING: NEW SUPERSTAR TO DEBUT, CLICK HERE"".

**BART**

Hey, Lis, look! They're adding a new wrestler to RAW! Roman Reigns!?

**LISA**

Adding a new wrestler is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.

Jon Stewart enters the kitchen.

**Stewart**

Yo, yo! How's it hangin' everybody?

**MARGE**

Morning, Jon!

**HOMER**

Yeah, hi, Jon. Hey, there having open casting for the booking agent of Roman.

**LISA**

You should try out, Dad. You have a funny way to get guys over.

**HOMER**

I do not!

**BART**

Haven't rewatched the booking of Cena in 2005-2012?

**HOMER**

I prefer to watch NXT.

**BART**

(holding up a tablet with the WWE network playing Summerslam 2010 Team WWE vs Nexus) Well, here. Book this ending.

**HOMER**

Well, obviously. Cena shoud take a DDT on the exposed concrete and kill the momentum of all the new young wrestlers. (Bart quickly shows the fates of all the Nexus wrestlers after the angle)

**HOMER**

Ah! I don't book that poorly like that, do I? Oh... I don't like having such a hilarious booking mind.

**BART**

That hilarious booking mind could be your ticket to stardom.

At the auditions. First up is Vince Russo.

**Russo**

(reading script) Whoa! A badass Samoan! What were you guys smokin' when you came up with that bro?

**Ryan Ward**

We were eating rotisserie chicken. Can you just book his debut, please?

**Russo**

Alright bro. So Roman Reigns is being buried in the desert, I sweah to gawd, and then he starts superman punching all the cactuses, but then hes such a badass that he refuses to follow the script and beats everyone up with a pole.

**Vince**

You're perfect! In fact, you're better than perfect! Next to you, perfection is crap!

Jim Cornette is up next.

**Cornette**

So, Roman starts punching out all the gays and the republicans, and then, back in 80s everyone thought wrestling was real so people he almost gets stabbed by dumb motherfuckers, so my preception of how things work today is completely flawed.  I'm Jim Cornette. You may remember me from such promotions as ""Smokey Mountain Wrestling"" and ""Ring of Honor"".

**Vince**

You're even better than this guy! (to Russo) Take a hike, you bum.

Russo moans and walks off. Next it's Homer.

**HOMER**

(clears throat) So Roman debuts as part of a badass stable, and doesn't talk much and just kicks ass....

**Vince**

Now, that's just bad. You've got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. Next!

**HOMER**

(angrily) Oh, no attitude, eh? Not in your face, huh? Well, you think you have grapefruits but all you got is pair of grapes!

**Vince**

That's it! That's the Roman Reigns attitude, do that again!

**HOMER**

(sheepishly) Huh? I can't, I don't remember what I did.

**Vince**

Then you don't get the job. Next!

**HOMER**

(sarcastically) Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well boo-hoo! I don't get to book an unbeatable underdog with zero stakes and fan connection!

**Vince**

That's it, you've got the job!

**HOMER**

Oh, now I've got the job, huh? (realizing) Oh, thank you.

**ACT TWO**

Homer attends the booker's meeting at WWE HQ

**Intern**

Okay, Homer. Let's get a level check on your booking.

**HOMER**

After the Shield breaks up, Roman should keep his attire, the badass entrance, the music, and should instantly be in the mainevent!

**HEYMAN**

Relax Homer, you'll do fine. My Name is Paul Heyman. I am the advocate for the BEAST, BROCK. LESNAR. I have successfully booked in ECW, on Smackdown, and the WWE's bastardization of ECW, WWECW.

**HOMER**

You? But you're a manager! Or a commentator!

**HEYMAN**

Accentuate the positives, and hide the negatives. Find out what your wrestlers are good at, and show only that. Everyone has value. Don't lie to your audience, they'll know.


**HOMER**

(laughing) Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?

**Heyman**

Oh, just experience I suppose. I started out majorly booking in ECW. ""THIS IS E-C-W""

**HOMER**

You mean EASTERN CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING?

**HEYMAN**

No, EXTREME CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING. I didn't have the most technical guys, but they excelled at extreme violence. Then the WWE stole my concept and talent and barely compesated me. Cheap Bastards.

**Vince**

(handing them scripts) You folks ready to begin?

**HOMER**

Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on be rewritten live?

**Heyman**

Yes, Homer. Very few wrestliing shows are rewritten live, it's a terrible strain on the wrestler's performance and character direction.

Roman Reigns hype grips Springfield. Homer and Heyman do an AMA on r/Squared Circle, which is full of smarks.

**SmarkySmarkster**

Hi. Question for Mr. Heyman. In episode U.C.ME, Cena clearly tells his opponent he is going to clothesline him, yet the opponent is unable to avoid it. Are we expected to believe that this is all a work and that the wrestlers aren't really fighting? LOL Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.

**Heyman**

Uh, well, uh...

**HOMER**

I'll field that one. Let me ask you a question. Why would a man whose shirt says ""Save the Indies"" spend all of his time watching and complaining about the biggest non-indy company on the planet?

**SmarkySmarkster**

(embarrassed) I withdraw my question. (eats a super old WWF Machoman Icecream bar his mother has stored in the basement freezer)

**MARK4MOJORAWLEY**

Ah, excuse me Mr. Simpson. In WWE 16' is there a way to get out of the NXT without fighting Tyler Breeze 1204 times, putting 5 Star matches each time, but creative having nothing for you?

**HOMER**

What the hell are you talking about?

**Heyman**

You're a lifesaver, Homer, I can't deal with these hardcore fans!

**Squared Circle MOD**

Your attention, please.

**SHITPOSTER**

Uh, in episode...

**SQUARED CIRCLE MOD**

Your attention, please! Mr. Simpson will now be troll linking eight-by-ten glossies of HAITCHFACE, ONE per wredditor. Please form a comment line. There will be downvoting!. I'm talking to you, Mr. guys who think the vote buttons are disagree buttons!

A few minutes later, Squared Circle Mod cuts through the crowd.

**SQUARED CIRCLE MOD**

Pardon me, look out, pardon me, excuse me, hot soup... Hi. (puts down HAITCHFACES) Kindly make one out to me, and three out to my fellow mods of the same name.

The first episode with Roman Reigns is about to air. The Simpsons' friends and family gather in their living room.

**MARGE**

I'm so glad you could join us for Homer's big premiere.

**The Rock**

(in the background) You know, Roman is based on me...

**JERRY LAWLER**

(sitting down) Is this seat taken, little girl?

**BART**

I'm not a girl! Are you blind?

**JERRY LAWLER**

No. Just wishful thinking.

**Jon Stewart**

I am stoked, Mr. S.

**MARGE**

Shh! Everybody it's coming on!

Miz appears on-screen in the ring, lit by a dim spotlight. Slides appear on the Titantron.

**Miz**

Once in a great while, we are privileged to experience a MUST-SEE television event so AWESOME, it becomes part of our shared heritage.  Hogan slams Andre. 1987 (slide of Hogan Slamming Andre)- Shockmaster Debuts(Slide of The Shockmaster crashing through the Wall) 1993 - Christian Debuts. 1998 (slide of Long-haired, big glasses Christian on screen) - CM Punk becomes a whiney crybaby 2011 (video of Punk's ass, zoomed in and rotated) Then, for a long time, nothing happened. Until tonight. Behold the future of Sports Entertainment: Roman Reigns!

The WWE universe cheers and Raw started, with Roman's Theme tacked on at the end. Roman's voice:

**THEME**

Tonight is the night, Bright lights, hype crowd, Yeah, Roman came to throw down, Belee DAT!

The episode is titled ""Roman Has Landed."" Ambrose and Brock are driving together. They pass signs reading ""Street Fight at Wrestlemania 5 weeks away"". They then spot Roman Reigns at the side of the road.

**Ambrose**

Look, Brock, it's our new friend, Roman.

**Brock**

What's that name again? I forgot.

**Roman**

(rapping) The name's Roman Reigns, And I rock the Tators, I'm half Rocky Mavia, And a third John Cena. I'm the Samoan badass, From Florida city, I'm a rappin Riot Officer, You the fool I pity. Blee Dat!

**Brock**

Ooh, Roman is one outrageous Samoan.

**Ambrose**

He's totally in my face.

**Roman**

(playing guitar) Sufferin Soccatash, Blee Dat, I can I will, I am a Royal RUMBLE!

**Rich Brennan**

When are they going to get to Wrestlemania? (crying)

**Jericho**

Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on? Midge, help me out here.

**HOMER**

Quiet! You're missing the jokes!

Roman is getting praise from anyone the fans remotely like, grabs the fans hope for a favorite to mainevent WM, slam dunks it and lands in Brock's and Ambrose car.

**Roman**

Catch you on the flip side, jobbers. (holds out hand for a fistbump, Ambrose extends his arm and Roman withdraws his) Not!! (In normal Joe Anoa'i voice) Hey kids, always recycle storylines... (as Roman) to the extreme!! Blee it!

Roman drives off in Ambrose and Brock's car. An awkward silence follows in The Simpsons' living room.

**Ryback**

Ah, STUPID! (smacks side of head)

**HOMER**

So, what did everybody think?

Nobody answers and they start leaving.

**Jeremy Piven**

Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of Wrestlefest I've ever seen!

**R-Truth**

Yeah, you should be very proud, Homer, you, uh... got a beautiful home here.

Ryback drops Bart on his shoulder on his way out.

**HOMER**

So, it was pretty okay, huh?

**BART**

Mom, can we go to bed without dinner?

**MARGE**

Yes we can. (They rush upstairs)

**HOMER**

Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I? (pan up to brain)

**BRAIN**

Oh, you don't want to know what I really think. Now look sad and say ""D'oh"".

**HOMER**

D'oh...

 
**ACT THREE**

The next morning at breakfast.

**HOMER**

Roman is the worst sports entertainer ever.

**LISA**

Ah, it's not your fault, dad. You did fine. It's just that Roman was a soulless by-product of awful booking. You can't be cool just by spouting off a bunch of worn-out catchphrases, and being proclaimed an underdog despite winning all the time.

**BART**

Don't have a cow, Lis.

**MARGE**

Bart's right. Let's none of us have a cow. All that matters is that the WWE Universe liked it.

**On r/Squared Circle.....**

**Squared Circle MOD**

Last night's Raw was, without a doubt, the worst episode ever! Rest assured that I was on the Internet within minutes, deleting shitposts, registering my disgust throughout the world.

**BART**

Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?

**Squared Circle Mod**

As a loyal Mod, I feel they owe me. I shouldn't have to clean up the hundreds of ""Roman is a fuccboi"" posts everyday.

**BART**

What? They're giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, If anything, you owe them.

**Squared Circle Mod**

(pause) Worst booking ever.

Dave Meltzer delivers the news.

**Dave Meltzer**

It looks like, uhhh, the end of the Monday Night Raw program. For years, wrestling journalists, such as yours truly, Dave Meltzer, have waited impatiently for cracks to, you know, appear in the show's hilarious facade. Yesterday, our prays were finally answered when Roman Reigns made his smirking, 1 star debut. Far be it from me to gloat at another's downfall, because thats bad for businss, COUGH, but I have a feeling that no smarks are gonna be crying when this push is put to sleep. It is what it is

Miz and the writers are watching the report.

**Miz**

What the hell happened?!

**Stephanie McMahon**

Well, I'd attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in the way brands are going to win, coupled with the overall crumminess of Roman, unlike my husband, HHH.

**Miz**

(crying hysterically) You've got to stop this thing. Please, when my hand goes up, the push goes STOP. Do something! Do something!!

Homer enters.

**HOMER**

Uh, hi, Mr. Vince. I've been doing some thinking, and I've got some ideas to improve the show. I got it right here. (pulls out a piece of paper) One, Roman needs to be louder, angrier, and have more access to nursery rhymes. Two, whenever Roman's not onscreen, all the other wrestlers and commentators should be asking ""Where's Roman""? ""What's Roman Reigns up to today"" Three--

**Vince**

Great, great. Just leave them right there on the floor, next to the ""Zack Ryder Push ideas"" and ""Storylines that are good but I didn't think of, so we can't use them"" on your way out.

Homer does so, but realizes something's wrong. He eavesdrops on the meeting from a closet next door.

**Vince**

Listen guys, we've got to do something about Roman. He's clearly very strong, very good, better than everyone else, but the audience is out of touch.

**Miz**

There's only one thing we can do.

Homer hears something and is shocked. At dinner, Homer tells his family what he heard.

**HOMER**

Then they said they were going to Roman look Strong!

**BART**

(joyful) Really?! (realizing how this is gonna backfire) Oh, how awesome.

**LISA**

(trance-like) Yes. Awesome.

**MARGE**

It's not your fault, Homer. It's those other lousy bookers. They make me madder than a... um... Scott Stiener in WCW!

**HOMER**

You're right Marge. it's not my fault. I won't let them treat Roman like dirt anymore just because he's the new guy.

**Jon Stewart**

Right on, Mr. S!

**HOMER**

Put a sock in it, Jon.

At WWE HQ.

**Vince**

Okay. So here is where Ambrose lunges at Roman with a rusty fork. Cue sound effects. (Sound guy makes cheering sound) LOUDER! (rustier Hairdryer sounds)

**Heyman**

(booking for Ambrose) Are you prepared to die, Roman?

**HOMER**

No, I am not.

**Vince**

Oh, cut, cut, cut, cut! You'll stick to the script as its written, Homer. You're supposed to say ""Please, wacky Clothesline me in face. I don't deserve to live.""

**HOMER**

Never! (He tears he script in half,the writers gasp) You can't just job out a classic TV character. Roman could be bigger than steak wraps. But first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm going to read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands.

**Vince**

Forget it Homer. We can do this show without you, if we have to.

**Heyman**

But not without me! If I go, Brock and most of the good booking ideas go.

**Vince**

Oh, jeez!

**Heyman**

Let him try the new lines.

**Vince**

Alright. Alright. We'll try them. Action.

**Heyman**

(as Ambrose) Hi, Roman. You look like you've got something to say. Do you?

**HOMER**

(as Roman) Yes, Blee dat! (normal Joe Anoa'i voice.) Hello there, Dean. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away. But I can't. I am stuck in this no-win siutation where if I tell the WWE that this isn't working, they'll find someone else to replace me, because they'll see it as a weakness. They won't turn me heel for the same reasons they don't turn Cena heel, because they care more about business than telling a good story. I just go out and do my best with what I given. It's been terrible and counter-productive for the most part, but at least I can put on good matches when given the chance. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little Samoan that nobody wanted, I know we can win you over given enough time and work.

**Vince**

(impressed) ...and cut!

Steph claps. Then slowly everyone else begins to clap. A ""This is Awesome chant"" breaks out in the room.

Back at home, the new episode is about to air.

**HOMER**

Now kids, I know you loved the old Roman, but the new one is going to be better than ten Wrestlemanias! I don't want to oversell it like Ziggler, judge for yourself.

At an ice sculpture contest, Brock begins cutting into Ambrose with a chainsaw. Suddenly, Roman wanders by.

**Brock**

Hey, looks who's here.

**Ambrose**

Hi, Roman. You look like you've got something to say. Do you?

**Roman**

Yes, I certainly do! (Roman's mouth stops moving and Vince' voice is heard) I have to go now, HHH is the best at wrestling.


The rest of the segment is replaced with heavy cuts of HHH's return from injury, and all the times he got cheered. A poor photoshop of Roman's head on Rock's body getting pedigreed by HHH is shown.
A picture of Roman making a strange face is shown being buried in dirt.

A screen shows some handwritten text: ""Note: Roman died on the way to fight HHH at Wrestlemania"".

**BART**

Wow, Roman was supposed to fight HHH at WM?

**LISA**

Uh, I guess...

**HOMER**

Hey that wasn't supposed to happen. Roman was supposed to be the hero and HHH was suppose to lose at WM! Those finks double-crossed me.

**Miz**

Roman's dead! (laughs) (kids in audience cheer) Well kids, we all know that sometimes when wrestlers are buried, they're back again the very next week, but sometimes, they are never heard from again. That's why I'm presenting this sworn affidavit that Roman Reigns will never, ever, ever return!

**Otunga**

This WWE.com article conforms to all applicable laws and statutes. Sips coffee.

**BART &amp; LISA**

Yeah! ...oh.

**BART**

Tough break, Dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Roman. Maybe in a few years.

**Stewart**

Good news, everybody. I'm moving into directing films and getting involved in wrestling angle where it makes no sense.

**MARGE**

Oh, then I guess this is goodbye, Jon. Maybe we'll see you in a few years. (she kisses him, and he leaves)

**HOMER**

Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live learn.

Later, Bart &amp; Lisa watch a Raw episode, back in its original form. Raw are doing a John Cena match. John Cena is fighting a brutal match with Sami Zayn. John Cena goes for a AA and is countered into a Helluva Kick, then an Blue Thunder Driver and pinned! Cena kicks out at 2, gets up like nothing. AA's Zayn and pins him clean in the middle, sending him back to NXT. Bart &amp; Lisa laugh.

**BART**

It's back to the basics, classic ""Raw""

**LISA**

We should thank our lucky stars that they're still putting on a program of this caliber after so many years.

They both stare blankly for a few seconds.

**BART**

What else is on?

Lisa changes the channel, screen goes to static and the credits roll.

47eqal,5,2016-02-24,Advice for CS major,Zml173,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/47eqal/advice_for_cs_major/,"Hey guys, 

So I'm a CS major (sophomore) and I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I don't enjoy CS (gasp). I'm not like the other kids here who all seem so enthusiastic about it and create these insane side projects, win hackathons, etc. I'm in 3410 now and doing ok (still early in the semester). I've taken 1110 (B), 2110 (A-), 2800 (B), and 4320 (B-). My overall GPA is a 3.5.

I don't want to change my major, because it's a hassle, it's too late, and I'd like to have a technical degree. I basically just do the coursework, and not much else during the day. I tried joining clubs, but none accepted me. 

As for career interests, I'm more interested in the product management/business development side of things. I received an internship offer a few days ago from a Fortune 500, however, it's in a smaller city not known for technology or really anything (unlike SF, NY, Seattle). The company's HQ is in this city. It's a software internship, and they really didn't give me any details on it. However, I'm concerned I will be unable to contribute because I really don't feel like I can program (and moreover I find it extremely boring). As an aside, they're paying me $900/week, how does that compare considering it's a very low cost of living area?

I just feel lost. Any thoughts or suggestions? Anything at all would help me at this point. Thank you."

These individual workbooks then output to a summary page the sum of the orders for each company in a table. This table is a column of company names then a column of the total sales for that period.

Is there a way that I can create a Master workbook that adds all this data together to give a value for the sales made to each company in all the periods combined?

47ezoc,1,2016-02-24,Applying for jobs and coding tests,kaitisyoung,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/47ezoc/applying_for_jobs_and_coding_tests/,"I have a question about applying for jobs that ask questions about coding. 

So I've been pretty lucky to have interned for the company that eventually hired me while I was still in college. The interviews and questions for my internship weren't very extensive so I never had a tough entry-level interview because I had already proved myself as an employee when I was applying for a Software Engineer position.  I never applied for any other jobs but I'm currently fishing around.

 I found a dream job, and I know it's a longshot, but I've already heard back and they are putting me through the screening process. The first step is a coding test. I've researched and found that it is probably 20-30 MCQ and 2 coding application problems. I've been out of school for awhile now and I'm not that quick to remember specific details about CS stuff without taking a while to think about it or googling it. I'm just not in ""exam mode"" anymore.

If I don't pass the coding test, can I keep re-applying to the company until I do better? Or will they not look at my application anymore if I fail the first time through?"
47ffuf,2,2016-02-24,Possible C#/ASP.NET internship; some questions,see_flat,csharp,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/47ffuf/possible_caspnet_internship_some_questions/,"I'm a n00b whose minimal web-dev experience is with high-level/dynamic languages like Python and frameworks like Django.  As a CS student, I've been hoping to snag an internship using something like Django/Rails/Express or React/Angular as soon as possible, hopefully by the summer.

However, I may have an opportunity to work with C#/ASP.NET with a university.  Now, I've heard great things about C# and the Microsoft ecosystem.  My first question here is, will I get pigeonholed if I do that kind of work (a la getting pigeonholed as a Wordpress developer or as a QA engineer)?  Do you think smaller/startup companies see that as a red flag (as an example, I've heard that there are companies that don't look favorably upon enterprisey Java experience; for whatever reason I feel like bias towards C#/.NET would be even worse).

My next question is, are the skills/tooling absolutely transferable to working with equivalent technologies (ie, Windows stuff vs Linux stuff, like developing on Windows, working with MSSQL, etc.).  I'm worried about investing double the effort to keep up with different ecosystems.

Another issue -- *I don't have a Windows computer* lol.  I have a Chromebook that runs Ubuntu, and I don't think it'd be very manageable running a Windows VM on it.  Will that be a problem?   Are there ""cloud"" tools I can use?

My last question is, do you recommend a resource that can run me through developing a simple app with C#/ASP.NET/MSSQL?  Something that can give me a quick feel after 2-3 days of work.  I already have some Java experience via school and don't need extreme hand-holding with basic programming/web-dev concepts.   I'm open to recommendations; I have a Pluralsight account if that helps.

Thanks!"
47fgg2,12,2016-02-24,GPA cutoffs,csgpacry,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/47fgg2/gpa_cutoffs/,"Let me start off by giving a bit of background: I go to a top University for CS, and while I have a firm grasp on data structures and Algorithms, my university has some notoriously difficult 300/400 level classes that have killed my GPA. It is now at a 2.64.

I have several projects, have done an internship at a pretty well reputed company. They do not ask for GPA until the on site interview. Lets say Company A is my dream company. 

I applied for a position at Company A in December 2015, and I was contacted by a recruiter to set up a phone interview in early January. I excelled at the phone interview- it was basic algorithms and data structures. Then, I was put on the ""fast track"" - according to my recruiter, and invited for an on site. He made me fill out a second application, this time with a full copy of my transcript. 

I am flown to the company's headquarters in late January, and they have 4 interviews. All of them go well. One of the interviewers even remarks that even she ""wouldn't have thought of such an optimal solution"". 

I email personal thank you notes to all the interviewers and the recruiter.

I fly back, and was told to expect an answer in within 2 weeks. The two weeks pass- no response. So I email the recruiter, politely asking for an update. Until a week ago, I didn't get a response. The recruiter calls me and tells me that ""We unfortunately have decided to pursue other candidates at this time"". I ask him why, and he says that "" we require that students maintain at least a 3.3 gpa for this position. You excelled at the interviews and seem very qualified, but this is our company policy"".  

I'm slightly shocked and surprised. I know some finance companies have GPA cutoffs but why do tech companies? I thoroughly read through the position requirements on the company site, and a GPA requirement is not publicly listed."

The one who never touched alcohol before I was supposed to. The one didn't have sex until I was legal. The one who weighed the consequences of all actions before acting. It wasn't all bad. I'm about to graduate soon, I have a regular job, and I'm doing internships to boost my resume.

I've watched you throw caution to wind simply because you didn't give a fuck. I've watched you quit several jobs because you hated your managers. I've been there afterwards when you needed money for your bills. Whenever you needed money I was there...even when you would come back to me and say that you squandered it on takeout food. I've been there when your SO wasn't doing too well and needed money. I was there when i persuaded family members to take you in. And I've been there waiting on you to return the favor. 

I don't want my money back, I told you I don't loan friends money, whatever I can give, I give...Loans make everything awkward and complicated. Especially since I know you probably wont have the means to pay me back. I just would like you to think about me once in a while. Send me a card for Christmas or for my birthday sometime, they aren't that expensive. Call just because I'm your friend and you want to check up on me, not always because something serous just went down, or because you need someone to rant to, or because you need favor. 

I know life has been more than hard for you these last few years. Your mom died, you ended a long-term relationship, and you had a daughter. Knowing that, I always feel bad about complaining about my life to you, and I never tell you how I'm feeling. You've probably felt worse than I ever have. And I always think ""What the fuck am I depressed about?!""

 But it doesn't change the fact that I am, and have been for a long time. I hate the fact that when you say you're depressed, no one can question why. Anyone who reads this will not doubt the valid reasons why you're depressed, and I don't either. But when I say I'm depressed, people and you, will ask the same ""What the fuck are you depressed for?!"" ""Get your shit together!"" Okay maybe I added that last one, but it is something I should do. 

My life has been stable, I know where my next meal is coming from. I'm in college, and I always keep enough money on me to support myself, my mother if she needs it, and you. Again the responsible one.

I wish that when I talk to you about personal things, I wish you'd listen. Just listen. Not laughing with you new BF in the background, not on some type of social media and interrupting me to tell me what some troll said in response to your comment, and not having a ready made explanation for what i'm feeling, or explaining to me what might be happening like I'm five. I haven't experienced as much life as you have, but that doesn't make me an idiot when it comes to people. Just listen.

 That's what I do you for you. We've had hours long conversations with me saying nothing but a few sentences, and you unloading on me. I'm glad I can do that for you. It would be nice if you could do the same. Whenever I try to talk to you on the phone, and I get into talking, and I hear the line get silent, I always have to ask ""Hello, Hello are you still there?"" Then you say ""Oh I'm sorry *blank* caught my attention or ""Yooo have you seen..."" or ""Shit! *blank* just happened."" And then you began your story in between mine. By the time we get back to mine, I've lost my motivation to tell my story because chances are I will get interrupted again. I've tried telling you about it, you know I have. And you know you've done it and you continue to do it. Now its easier to just not talk to you about the things that are really getting to me in life. It's easier to talk about the superficial things. 

Sometimes I wish didn't give a fuck like you do. I wish i could just quit my job, and not think about how I'm gonna make it. I wish I could have sex without the fear of pregnancy or stds. I admire how free you are with sex. I wish I could have semi-anonymous sex like you did. Wish I had the sex appeal and confidence, maybe even arrogance you have. i wish i did't care so much about other people feelings. Feelings not thoughts or opinions, you know I've never been a people pleaser, but i will spare feelings.  I always listen because I know what it feels like to be ignored...I don't want to do that to people. That's probably why I'm going into counseling among other things.  But you just don't give a fuck. I want some of that. 

I don't want to turn my back on you. I know you've dealt with that a lot. I can't, I'm your oldest, closest friend. And I don't want to, even though I know these feelings are not healthy. I want you to be my friend again. Not someone who's been through such terrible tragedies and has been enlightened and speaks as such when she's actually listening. I want to you to listen to me, and make me feel like i have your undivided attention. The attention I've given to you. 

Despite everything you're a good person and I know you try the best you know how. If you weren't we wouldn't have been friends for this long. I just wish I didn't have these feelings. They've been here for a long time. "

so a little background about me: I'm 17, turning 18 in july and a senior in high school. I first started pmo when I was 13 and was addicted up until the second half of my junior year (probably 3 years of pmo). 
It got to the point where I'd come home everyday and do it just out of habit and a method of relieving stress. Somewhere around March of last year, I discovered this forum and out of curiosity I tried to stop pmo. After a few tries, I eventually built up a streak of 80 days. Then summer came, and so did finals week. I eventually gave in and relapsed somewhere around June. Like everyone, I immediately felt an immense amount of guilt and throughout summer, I kept relapsing. 

Then the first day of school.. I told myself that I'd quit forever. With school ending at 2:04 and then football practice right after until ~5:30, I was physically drained everyday. This helped a lot since I was too tired. (The trick is to always occupy yourself and get to the point where you're tired by the end of the day). 

At around day 20 - I was on fire with energy and the amount of attention I was getting. Some of you doubt the benefits of nofap but it's okay, there's no scientific study to back up what i'm saying, unless you try it for yourself. 

And so today - I am 172 days free of pmo. 

Some benefits: eye contact is nice, my posture has improved, i've gained a lot of strength (and energy).. bench pr: 185, squat: 255, a lot of attention with girls (haven't done much with this attention, however, mostly have been using the increased energy to get work done (i'm taking 4 ap classes this year). 

I haven't really incorporated mediation into my everyday routine yet, but cold showers have been going strong. The thing about nofap is that only a small part of the journey towards getting your life back is quitting pmo, the hardest part is what you're going to do with the increased confidence and drive. What i've done is kept straight A's so far this semester, got accepted to a prestigious college (most likely going into stem), and kept up with the gym and eating right. I've set clear goals such as waking up at 5am every morning and going to bed earlier, and I'm also looking to intern this summer. I know I'm a teenager and supposedly it's harder to resist urges at this age, but after around 2 months, it gets easier. Occasionally I will get urges, but not urges to fap - usually urges to bang a girl in one of my classes. 

A lot of friends and peers joke around about porn.. but porn is nothing to joke about. But you can't blame them - they don't know any better. A thing i've noticed is that once you start changing yourself for the better, they'll always try to drag you down to the previous you. ""why do you care so much about your self image?"", they'll say. But keep doing you - people will always be jealous with your success.

And that's all - I'm sure I missed a lot of things and may have said too much. Thanks for reading, nofap.

While I was not the brightest in my classes, I would say I was a struggling average student.

* I have 1 REU where I did ecology fieldwork for a summer and was able to present my findings, although very basic, at an ASLO conference. 

* It is important to note that I did not go to college with plans to become a doctor, lawyer, nor geologist as I was the first from my family to go to college to begin with. My plan in high school was just to get into a college and graduate. Being that I was at a liberal college, I took different kinds of classes but stuck with sciences, enough to also get a minor in psychology. I never really excelled at anything, to the standards of my college, but hey I managed to graduate so I must have been decent. *(as you can guess, I am not a very confident person)*

* I was also very shy within my geos department so I do kick myself for not networking more, but what's done is done. 

After I graduated I didn't really have a plan and got my first ""official"" job outside of college jobs, at a dealership and learned the basic clerical duties, accounts payable/recievable, scheduling, and customer service. And learned how to deal with HR, managers, coworkers, etc. 

It took me a little over a year to learn as much as I could from that job. I worked with every department from sales to finance to parts to helping the warranty administrator. It was painfully obvious that I wanted to learn as much as I could and do more than what my job title described. So after a year and a half, I put in my notice and my manager and basically everyone I worked with agreed that it was time for me to pursue something more than working at that dealership. 

So now, I have been at a law firm (corporate/IP Lit), well more like a contracted company who provides workers for this law firm, for 1 year and I have learned as much as I can. I started out slow like my first job, learning about reception and administration, scheduling meetings, caterering for events, etc., but now everyone who I work with knows that I have reached that limit where I am bored and want to learn more than what I can. The firm administrators have been giving me more and more responsibilities, like dealing with Certificates of Insurance and processing invoices, but I want to do more than just sit at the front desk and look pretty. The problem is that I don't know what I want to do. 

I took the ASBOG FG in the Fall with the hopes that if I pass I can apply to environmental consulting firms but I didn't pass. Most of the reason why I didn't pass was because I didn't feel motivated to study. I bought the regreview guide and for the first month of studying I felt like I was in college again, I remembered topics and was interested in geology again. But towards the last 2 months of studying I lost that motivation, I didn't feel like I was good enough to be Geologist and when I was trying to study harder topics and dense materials, I lost that motivation to keep studying. 

Sidenote: I did apply to one environmental consulting firm that combined my interest in the sciences with my reception/clerical work experience, but they didn't hire me because I did not have enough accounting experience. 

So now that I am looking for a new job, I don't really know where to look because I still don't know what I want to do. I know that I want to work in a company or industry that has substance - meaning that it is making a positive impact in the world (like if I were to work at a dealership again, I would want to work for Tesla or if I was at a law firm that focuses on energy or the environment). And I even started looking into working for water resource departments but most opportunities that I want to take are for internships that require you to be a student.

The thought of gradschool is not even a solution because I wouldn't know what field to go into. 

**So the advice part:** what are careers that can combine my work experience in administration with my interests in geology? Should I take the ASBOG again? What are my options?

47gmg9,15,2016-02-24,Have my specific rotations just sucked or is medicine just not what I hoped it would be... [Long Rant],def_1,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/47gmg9/have_my_specific_rotations_just_sucked_or_is/,"I have just finished 4 rotations in my 3rd year, Peds, OB, Psych, and IM and aside from 2 weeks of Peds wards, I did not enjoy any of them. I am reaching a point where I am concerned if I entered the wrong profession or if I just romanticized what a doctor is way too much in my head. However, I also think there is a big possibility my rotations just sucked and that medicine would actually be fulfilling, but I don't know how to decipher which is true.

I came into medical school because I thought being a doctor would be fun, exciting, and I would be able to use my brain to solve complex things. I actually really enjoyed the first 2 years of medical school. We did not have to attend lectures so I just studied FA and pathoma and did anki cards, so the first 2 years almost felt like a vacation because I was always home and in charge of my schedule. I was very excited about starting 3rd year, I was tired of just reading and could not wait to get on the floors and actually put it into use.

I didn't know what 3rd year would be like but I definitely did not think it would be like this. There is zero responsibility as a 3rd year student at my school. The work and hours are not hard but it is really boring being somewhere with very little to do. I started with Peds which was mostly clinics and basically followed the residents around while they did the H&amp;P. I don't even think I got a chance to present until I did Peds wards. I had fun on Peds wards because it was the first time I came up with my own A/P on a real patient. That was the last time I enjoyed a rotation.

OB/Gyn was similar to Peds, a lot of clinic with lots of shadowing, 2 wks L&amp;D which I did enjoy cuz I scrubbed in on every C-section but that was the highlight of my rotation. By the way, in case you think I am shy or not a self-starter, I asked to see patients on my own every rotation but was not allowed. 

IM was like the straw that broke the camels back for me. Inpatient wards on IM was horrible. There was so much doing nothing that I everyday I came home just dreading going back in the next day. At least on the other rotations we saw multiple patients at a time. On IM it was preround, round, write my notes, then watch the interns and residents write their notes and orders and just sit around waiting for a consult, and OMG if it was not a call day, then i would just sit there almost bored to tears waiting to be sent home.

I don't know if being on IM just burned me out but it made me do a complete 180 on what I thought I would end up doing. I came into 3rd year thinking I would do Plastics because I really love reconstructive cases. But I still have PTSD just thinking about sitting on the floors for 12 hours on IM bored out of my mind and I am terrified that thats how I will feel on wards during a surgical residency.

So now I feel so conflicted. I still want to do plastics very bad but I really do have nightmares about being on the wards now. I am not scared of hard work. I worked 12 hours on the Peds floors too but we took call everyday so I got to see new cases everyday and always had something to do and I enjoyed that. 

So now I just feel lost. I don't have a passion for anything anymore. I feel like IM stole my hopes at going into surgery just because it made me despise being in the hospital so much.

TLDR: I was bored on all my rotations. IM was the worst and made me despise the hospital so now even my hope for doing surgery is tarnished. Now I don't know what to do with my life."

47gv5r,226,2016-02-24,50 Ways to Make Extra Money,melissamonte,beermoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/47gv5r/50_ways_to_make_extra_money/,"This is a long one but I think it's a great resource I wanted to share. I realize it's slightly different from the posts on this thread as all of those seem to focus on one specifically per post. But there's just a wealth of info here. I didn't take the time to add all the links from the original post but you can find the [Original post with links here](https://getlenny.com/50-ways-to-make-money-for-less-than-500/)

1. Sell Custom Goods on Etsy

Nowadays, you can sell just about anything on Etsy, a website designed to allow creators and designers to share their artwork with the world. If you have a talent, it can probably be showcased here. One great example involves etching , but you can also sell woodwork, clothing, graphics, books, and games.

What materials you’ll need: 

Anything that can help you create your masterpiece. If you etch, you should find an affordable Cricut, as well as Glass Etching Adhesive. If you design clothing, you’ll need to look for fabric and sewing materials. When in doubt, you can usually find everything you need at Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores or Michaels Craft Stores.

 

2. Create Custom Book Bags

Let’s zero-in on a specific creation, for just a moment. You’re in college, right? You need to make money, but you don’t know where to start. Why not utilize the people around you? Designing custom book bags is a fantastic (and cheap) way to earn cash. All you need is a creative eye, and enough time to bring your ideas to life.

What materials you’ll need:

If you want to make quality book bags, you’ll need a sewing machine (which can be found on Amazon in the Arts, Crafts &amp; Sewing section), as well as some canvas fabric and thread. Again, you’ll find many of your necessities at local craft stores.

3. Fix Broken Phones

You know how heartbreaking a broken phone can be. Why not get into the business of fixing them yourself? You’ll be hailed as a hero on campus, and you’ll make plenty of extra cash from the ongoing stream of business.

What materials you’ll need: 

First of all, you’ll need to read this article about fixing iPhones. There’s more than enough information there to get you started. Secondly, you’ll need to buy a Pro Tech Toolkit, a 54 Bit Driver Kit, and a Magnifier Table Lamp. And, finally, you’ll want to invest some time into learning the craft by practicing with friends and family.

4. Design T-Shirts

This idea involves entrepreneurial talent and a decent level of design skill. You can help promote causes, design t-shirts for local bands and student groups, and showcase your favorite memes. College students are always looking for ways to express themselves. Why not help them along?

What materials you’ll need: 

Obviously, you won’t be able to make these t-shirts in your dorm room. You’ll need to outsource that work to another company, like Teespring or Zazzle. It’s up to you to design the shirt, place the order, and make the delivery. You can also develop stickers for student groups by utilizing Sticker Mule. Market yourself with business cards from websites like Vistaprint.

5. Become a Content Writer

Hundreds of websites need content for their pages, and you can be the one to supply it. With a little bit of research and a working computer, you can write thousands of words a week and get paid handsomely for it (depending on your client).

What materials you’ll need:

To get started, you’ll need an account on a freelance website like Upwork. Then, you should take a Udemy course on generating website content, just to get familiar with the tone and quality that’s going to be expected of you. Other than that, starting a career in professional writing is fairly inexpensive and material-free.

6. Refurbish Furniture

Have you ever seen an old piece of furniture that you thought you could improve? With a little bit of elbow grease, you can turn someone else’s trash into your treasure. And you don’t necessarily need to dig through garage sales to find a subject. Using websites like Craigslist, you can easily locate unused items and refurbish them. It’s almost like flipping a house.

What materials you’ll need: 

It’s impossible to tell exactly what you’ll need, since there are so many different styles of furniture, and even more ways in which they can be altered. But it’s a pretty safe bet that you’ll need basic tools (a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, etc.), paint or varnish, and an electric sander. You can find most of these things at The Home Depot or Lowe’s. You’ll also need a large workspace, such as a garage or a backyard.

7. Walk Dogs

You probably thought about walking dogs as a teenager but, now, you have the ability to take it to the next level. Pet owners are far more likely to trust their dogs with an adult than a preteen, and that gives you an edge. If you market yourself correctly, you can turn dog walking into a full-time, under-the-table job.

What materials you’ll need: 

Marketing is the most important part of this equation. You’ll need a website, which you can create through WordPress or Weebly. You’ll also need business cards and flyers (again, Vistaprint is a great resource), as well as a travel water dish and a few toys.

8. Start a Babysitting Service

Again, parents are far more likely to trust their children with an adult. Not only 

that, but an adult with a certification in CPR. You can start a babysitting service for next to nothing and, if you enjoy spending time with kids, you won’t be anywhere near as miserable as you would be working in an office. Also, tax-free work. Can we even argue with that?

What materials you’ll need: 

Start out by making a profile on popular babysitting websites, such as Care or Sitter City. You’ll also want to create a professional website, business cards, and flyers. Finally, you can choose to bring toys or entertainment supplies for the kids, but many parents supply those for you.

9. Become an Airbnb Host

Did you know that you can rent out your home, or a portion of your home, through Airbnb? That’s right – you can make money on empty space alone. You don’t even need an entire house or a room to rent. Believe it or not, there are plenty of couchsurfers that take advantage of Airbnb on a regular basis.

What materials you’ll need:

First, you need to make a profile. Take tasteful pictures of the space you’re going to offer and come up with a colorful description. The area should be well-decorated and cleared of any personal items. When the guest arrives, you’ll need to provide basic amenities (toilet paper, towels, blankets, lighting, etc.) and enough food for breakfast.

10. Review and Test Games

It might sound too good to be true – but you can actually get paid to test video games. Check out an awesome tutorial here for more information. You should keep in mind that this method of making money will feel more like an official job, with a regular paycheck coming from a specific company. You can find positions on websites like Indeed, and there’s a ton of information online. Time has a useful article on the subject, as does Business Insider and Game Testers.

What materials you’ll need:

Becoming a game tester and reviewer doesn’t involve a lot of monetary investment. But you’ll need a decent resume, a list of experience, and a website (if you really want to make an impression).

11. Tutor Students

If there’s a subject that you know quite well, but notice other students struggle with, consider becoming a tutor. You can do this at the college level, as well as the high school and grade school levels. If you plan on becoming an educator, this is an especially rewarding experience.

What materials you’ll need: 

Other than the usual marketing tools (resume, flyers, business cards, etc.), you’ll need to take advantage of flashcard applications such as Quizlet. You’ll also need basic school supplies, such as a calculator, a notebook, pencils, graphing paper, and a computer.

12. Manage Social Media Accounts

Far too many businesses want a strong social media presence, but don’t have the knowledge or the drive to make it happen. In order to satisfy their needs, many companies turn to college students to handle their social media accounts. Don’t believe us? It’s actually more common than you think.

What materials you’ll need: 

Statistics are the name of the game, in this business. You’ll need an account on Buffer to help analyze the amount of traffic your social media pages receive. You should also invest your time in an Upwork account, as many businesses hire through that platform. Other monetary investments could include business cards and a professional website.

13. Make and Sell Custom Jewelry

If you’ve got a knack for creating your own jewelry, turn it into something more than a hobby. College students love unique, thoughtful pieces that aren’t generic or common. Take advantage of the environment surrounding you. Or, you could sell your work at flea markets and local events.

What materials you’ll need: 

Other than renting out space for a booth at festivals or events, you’ll need to invest in basic materials. You can use a range of different items to make jewelry, so it all depends on your preferences. As we said earlier, Michaels and JoAnn Fabrics are fantastic for affordable, in-style craft supplies. If you plan on shipping your work to customers, you’ll also need boxes and labels for shipping purposes.

14. Clean Houses

Another one of those preteen 

jobs, turned professional. Make flyers and offer to clean houses for a fair price. The bigger the house, the more you make. You can also offer to clean dorm rooms for your friends and classmates. Imagine what college students would pay to have someone else take care of their dishes or dirty laundry!

What materials you’ll need:

You’ll need cleaning supplies, such as all-purpose cleaner, window cleaner, dish soap, rags, wood cleaner, and air fresheners. You don’t necessarily need to bring your own vacuum, mop, or broom. Most households will provide those things for you. You might also find that making an account on Angie’s List is a useful way to generate clients.

15. Become an Uber or Lyft Driver

If you feel comfortable driving strangers in your car, this might be a viable option for you. Not only do you get to meet interesting people, but you get to make money in the process. Both Uber and Lyft pay their part-time drivers up to $35/hour, and you don’t have to worry about awkwardly asking for tips.

What materials you’ll need:

First of all, you’ll need to be twenty-one. That’s the biggest requirement. After that, you’ll need to obtain a four-door car with at least five seatbelts 

that’s less than twelve-years-old. You can check out more information on that here. When it comes to upfront costs, you’ll need pack plenty of water bottles for your guests. You’ll also need a decent navigation application (we highly recommend Waze, which is free). Want to learn more? Uber has an awesome and complete guide here.

16. Knit or Crochet Beanies and Hats

College students love homemade clothing. You can develop a total monopoly in this niche by knitting or crocheting stylish beanies and hats. And, when you’re starting out, you can even have your friends wear your creations as free marketing sources.

What materials you’ll need:

Luckily, knitting and crocheting doesn’t involve expensive sewing machines and equipment. You’ll need a set of patterns, a box of yarn, a basic set of supplies, and a decent needle set. After that, your business should fund itself. As usual, we recommend Michael’s and JoAnn Fabrics for your crafting needs. But you can probably find a few local shops, as well.

18. Sell Custom Cutting Boards

If you’ve ever been interested in woodwork, this might be the perfect job for you. Cutting boards are unique and fun to make, and college students never think to buy them until they see them. They’re also fairly affordable to build, in comparison to other wood-related crafts. You’ll need your own space for this job, though, so this particular moneymaker might be best for a commuter student. A dorm room just isn’t going to cut it.

What materials you’ll need: 

Aside from a workshop area, you’ll need an electric sander, stencils, and a wood burning tool. Michaels has a fair inventory when it comes to woodwork, but you’ll also want to check out The Home Depot and Lowe’s for heavier equipment.

Cutting boards aren’t your thing? Sell coasters to the sororities. I heard house moms hate water stains…

18. Make Leather Cuffs

Leather cuffs offer a unique style that only college students seem to understand. If you love crafting but also live on-campus, this low-stress method of earning some extra cash could work for you. Rather than making a series of jewelry options, you’ll be able to focus on one, specific item. If you’re not sure where to start, you can check out an interesting tutorial video here.

What materials you’ll need:

You’ll need, of course, leather. You’ll also need a leather burning tool, adhesive snaps, and a leather cutter. If you need start-up materials, Artbeads is an online platform that has an entire section set aside just for leather jewelry supplies.

If cuffs are too big for you, trendy wrap bracelets never go out of style.

19. Create Surprise Balls

If you’ve never heard of surprise balls before, you’re probably going to fall in love with this money making venture. Made of brightly colored paper, surprise balls are full of streamers and prizes such as puzzles, rings, jokes, whistles, and stickers. These unique gifts are perfect for birthday parties and large events. If you have the right connections, this fun business can take off pretty quickly.

What materials you’ll need:

First, you’ll need to read a few tutorials on how to make surprise balls. We’ve found that Not Martha and Honestly WTF are quality resources. Most websites agree that you’ll need multiple colors of fine crepe paper, confetti, ribbon, glitter, glue, and an assortment of candy or toys. If you’re located near a party store, this is going to become your hotspot for supplies.

20. Develop a Digital eCourse

Far more complicated than crafting surprise balls, making a digital eCourse involves patience, dedication, recording, scriptwriting, and research. While you don’t necessarily need to purchase supplies right away, you might spend two or three months crafting a quality product. If you’re not sure how to get started, Teach Good Stuff, Freelance to Freedom, and Problogger offer instructions on eCourse creation.

What materials you’ll need: 

Once you’ve written and established what you want to teach in your eCourse, you’re going to need to record your content. That’s going to involve a high-quality webcam (we suggest Logitech) and a microphone (we suggest the Snowball). Once you’ve finished, you’ll need to publish your work. Learning Revolution has some great information about that portion of production.

21. Work for Fancy Hands

Fancy Hands provides US-based assistants for the self-employed, large company executives, and other business owners who need help managing their time and responsibilities efficiently. If you work well with organization, phone calls, appointment-setting, and other secretarial duties, this is a straightforward telecommunication position that can work for you. You can find more information here.

What materials you’ll need: 

The materials you’ll need will depend entirely on the client you’re working with. You’ll need a smartphone, for sure, to help with prompt communication (we suggest an iPhone, but you can also use an Android). You’ll also need a laptop or desktop computer that can easily connect to a WiFi hotspot. Employers may have you download different applications or purchase additional materials, depending on the work they have you doing.

22. Use TaskRabbit

Do you enjoy running errands? TaskRabbit will connect you to households in your local area that need assistance with grocery shopping, medication pickup, cooking, cleaning, and more. The only downside? TaskRabbit is currently available in nineteen cities, including New York, Portland, London, LA, Houston, and Phoenix. If you aren’t located in any of these cities or suburbs, you’ll be limited to virtual tasks (which are typically very similar to Fancy Hands jobs).

What materials you’ll need:

You won’t need much to get started with TaskRabbit, other than a full tank of gas and a professional outfit. Any costs you incur for shopping will be reimbursed by the household, and you’ll be paid an hourly wage that you set when you create a profile. Check out more here.

23. Help Other People Move

If you have a large car or a truck, this is an easy way to make money. You can also offer labor, rather than transportation, if you don’t own a moving-friendly vehicle. Moving companies are, generally speaking, overpriced. If a household can hire an outside company or individual to help them move without paying an arm and a leg, they will. You can be that person.

What materials you’ll need: 

Obviously, you’ll need to market yourself with business cards, flyers, and a website. You’ll also need heavy-duty gloves and moving blankets (if you own the vehicle being used). You should also plan on using a fair amount of gas between trips.

24. Try Fiverr Jobs

Similar to Upwork (which we introduced earlier), Fiverr connects freelancers in various categories (such as Graphics &amp; Design, Digital Marketing, Writing &amp; Translation, Video &amp; Animation, and Music &amp; Audio) to employers who need work completed. If you’re successful in any of these niches, you should consider making an account and getting started immediately.

What materials you’ll need:

Fortunately, you won’t need anything but a service to offer and an idea. Fiverr has no basis of commitment, no memberships, and no hidden fees. You’re able to keep 80% of each transaction you complete. However, you should keep in mind that Fiverr sets base fees for their workers. For example, if you market yourself in the Writing &amp; Translation niche, you won’t be able to charge more than $5 per job, unless you add extra services for the client to purchase (which can add up to $25 per job).

25. Sell Used Items Online

This can go above and beyond selling old items that once belonged to you. You can also collect items from your friends and family members, recycling centers, or classmates who might consider trashing them instead of reselling them. Read a great success story here.

What materials you’ll need: 

Other than shipping supplies, you’ll need a first “wave” of items to sell. From there, you can grow your collection through marketing and communication. Amazon and eBay are both online platforms specifically utilized for the sale of new or used items. It would be in your best interest to sell through one of them, since they’re both wildly popular with consumers.

26. Become a Personal Shopper

If you love to shop, this job is perfect for you. Despite the stereotypical personal shopper positions, you won’t necessarily be shopping for the clothes of rich, old ladies. Personal shopping has really taken a turn in the past decade. Read more about it here and here. 

Entrepreneur also has a wonderful article about starting a personal shopping business.

What materials you’ll need:

Other than a full tank of gas and a measuring tape, you won’t really incur any costs when you start this business. You may choose to spend money on a professional website, business cards, or flyers. But you can also place an advertisement on Craigslist for free. Since personal shoppers can only handle a limited number of clients, it won’t take long for you to get comfortable in your work.

27. Be a YouTube Video Blogger

If you have something to say the world, start saying it. Because, eventually, you can be handsomely paid for it. While you won’t start out making money, you’ll be able to reap the benefits of advertising once your channel reaches a certain number of subscribers. Google will directly pay you a portion of their income from ads placed on your videos. How do you think YouTube stars survive without day jobs?

What materials you’ll need: 

Like eCourse production, you’ll need a webcam (again, we suggest Logitech) and a microphone (another quality option is the Yeti). The rest of your starting materials depend on what you want to do in your videos, and how you want to market yourself. This is a far less professional platform than, say, Facebook. The most important thing is that your video is interesting and creative, not expensive.

28. Try Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is a performance-based form of marketing, in which a business will reward you for each visitor or customer brought to their website because of your personal marketing efforts. For example, YouTube stars that receive money from advertisements placed on their videos are actually taking part in an affiliate marketing program.

What materials you’ll need: 

Once employed by a business, you can start marketing to your followers through a social media scheduler and advertisements. You should be smart and creative about your efforts, because affiliate marketing is hard work. While there aren’t any upfront costs to get started, you’ll need to spend quite a bit of time pushing the product before you see any payoff.

29. Blog!

In the same way that you can get paid for advertisements on YouTube, you can get paid for placing advertisements on your personal blog (assuming your traffic statistics meet Google requirements). This isn’t going to happen overnight, so you’ll need to spend several months (or even years) building your brand, story, and website. The more you post, the faster your blog will grow in followers.

What materials you’ll need: 

First of all, you’ll need a website. This can be created through WordPress or Weebly (which we discussed earlier), or you can utilize Squarespace. The most important part of the process will be purchasing your own URL, which is vital to making a quality blog or website. The more popular your blog, the more return you’ll get for your investment.

30. Create a Niche Marketing Website

So, how do you make money from a website without waiting months or years for your traffic to be high enough? You create a niche marketing website. This is basically a website that utilizes SEO keywords to place your link at the top of the Google search page. Even though your website won’t actually offer or sell any products, it’ll be visited so often that Google will pay you hundreds of dollars each month to place advertisements on your page.

What materials you’ll need: 

Other than starting your website, which can be done through a horde of different resources, you’ll need to spend hours each week creating useful content for your page. Choose a smart and thoughtful set of keywords that have proven popular through Google and incorporate them six or seven times in each article you produce. Within five or six months, your website will earn you a decent amount of traffic and income.

31. Flip Websites

Before we talk about flipping websites, you need to check out Flippa, the most popular place on the internet for doing so. You’ll learn quite a bit just by checking out their page. Flipping websites 

involves buying and selling domains for a profit. Basically, your job is to purchase the website of a company that wasn’t so great to begin with. Start an AdWords or AdSense campaign, upping the value of the site, and then sell it for far more than you bought it.

What materials you’ll need: 

First, we suggest reading this tutorial on how to flip websites. Then, you’ll need to pool together enough money to make your initial purchases. Similar to flipping houses, you need to be smart about your decisions. Some websites are beyond help. Others have potential. It’s up to you to pinpoint the difference between the two.

32. Become a Window Cleaner

If you like cleaning, but aren’t prepared to take on an entire house, consider cleaning windows. Most homeowners hate cleaning windows because it involves going outside and thoroughly washing each pane. On homes with many different windows, this can be a challenge. You can really make a market for yourself in this business, with recurring customers and references.

What materials you’ll need: 

According to Great Day Improvements, the best window cleaning solution involves a spray bottle filled with fifty-percent distilled vinegar (white) and fifty-percent tap water. In addition to your spray, you’ll need a backpack, a ladder, a series of rags or squeegees, and other necessary cleaning supplies. To market yourself, make flyers and business cards to pass out throughout your neighborhood.

33. Be an Independent Make-Up Artist

Have you been doing your own make-up since you were thirteen? Do your friends struggle to get the same professional results? Do you know the best products to purchase for a reasonable price? This is probably the job for you. You can make money by doing make-up for classmates, friends, and family. References come quickly when you do a quality job, and you’ll make a name for yourself right away.

What materials you’ll need: 

This is going to be a bit more expensive to start up than several of the other business ideas presented in this article. Why? Because quality make-up isn’t cheap. For many individuals, that’s why hiring an independent make-up artist for special occasions is more affordable than purchasing their own supplies. And, for independent make-up artists, that’s why it makes sense to purchase supplies for many different individuals. Read a great article about how to get started here.

34. Style Hair

Do you have a knack for hair styling? Trusting someone else with their hair, especially for special occasions, is a hard thing for most people to do. You’ll need to be patient, understanding, and smart about how you decide to work. You also need to be willing to work with the design ideas that your clients have. If you can manage all of that, this is a great start-up business that could, potentially, pay the bills.

What materials you’ll need: 

Hair styling is, typically, a very expensive business to start. You’ll need a set of curling irons, flat irons, styling products (hairspray, conditioner, shampoo, etc.), scissors, and an area where you can work. The amount of money you need to invest depends entirely upon where you want to style hair (at the homes of your clients or in your own space) and whether you want to offer haircuts or simply styles for special occasions. Read more here and here.

35. Write YouTube Product Reviews

Yes, you can get paid to write YouTube product reviews. But, how? First, you need to make a Fiverr account and offer reviews for $5 each. Then, you’ll create a video of your honest review and post it to your channel. The more of a following you create, the more businesses will pay for your reviews.

What materials you’ll need: 

You’ll need a webcam and microphone (we’ve already suggested Logitech and the Snowball), and a place to record. A huge bonus of this job? Free products. However, you need to make sure that businesses are aware of your intention to create an honest review. Your channel won’t be credible if you only offer positive reviews.

36. Start Your Own Delivery Service

Have you ever wondered why fast food chains don’t offer delivery for their products? Most people assume that, since orders are so cheap, it wouldn’t be worthwhile. But, imagine making an independent service that delivers any fast food orders (Wendy’s, Arby’s, McDonalds, Taco Bell, etc.) for $5 each. Customers will reimburse you for their food, plus $5 for your time and gas. In fact, here’s the story of a millionaire CEO who did this same this in college.

What materials you’ll need: 

You’ll need a car and a full tank of gas. You’ll also need Venmo, so you can accept payment from your customers. We also suggest a website, business cards, and flyers.

37. Create a Bootcamp at a Nearby Park

If you love to run, jump, climb, and jog, you can actually make money by forming an outdoor bootcamp in a local park. By running your own workouts, you can help adults and teenagers get in shape. You’ll also feel better about yourself, in the process!

What materials you’ll need: 

You’ll need basic workout equipment, such as cones, weights, tires, jump ropes, hula-hoops, or anything else you might use to create an obstacle course. Read more information on how to get started here.

38. Design Graphics

Bloggers love graphics, but they hate creating them. Therefore, they sometimes turn to an outside party to design something for them. If you enjoy working with graphics and have a creative eye for marketing, this is the job for you.

What materials you’ll need: 

In order to make quality graphics, you’ll need to download Adobe Illustrator. This is usually fairly expensive, but the student edition is just $19.99 a month and includes a handful of other applications. You can also use a sketch application on a Mac computer, which is cheaper and usually has the same effect. We also suggest Graphic River credits, which will save time with pre-made vector graphs.

39. Start a Party Supply Delivery Service

Students haven’t created this service yet, and we’re really not sure why. Imagine being at a party. You run out of chips. The last thing you want to do is run to the store for chips, so you call a party supply delivery service and pay them a small fee to bring the chips for you. Yes, you can actually make this service available on your campus by marketing yourself, filling up your gas tank, and running around town.

What materials you’ll need:

You’ll need gas, which we mentioned above. You’ll also need to create a Venmo account, where you can professionally accept payment for the service you’ve provided. Keep in mind, you’ll need to make sure that you aren’t delivering anything that has an age limit (for legal reasons). Unfortunately, this means you can’t purchase beer or cigarettes.

40. Paint Menu Boards

Menu boards are what customers see when they first walk into a business. The point of a menu board is to draw passerby into the store or restaurant by making a good first impression. Fortunately, this works quite well when the board is thoughtfully and tastefully designed. Unfortunately, this works quite poorly when the menu board isn’t professional in presentation. You can design these boards for local businesses, and offer your painting services as an incentive to bring in customers.

What materials you’ll need: 

First of all, you’ll need to market yourself online. You’ll need to get in touch with local businesses and reach a fair wage for your work. You’ll also need a slew of paints, chalk colors, stencils, and other design aids to help you get the job done. Check out some great ideas here. You can also view the work of local San Diego artist Art by Autumn for inspiration.

 

41. Be a Secret Shopper

Also known as “mystery shoppers”, secret shoppers are hired by outside companies to determine how good (or poor) the service is in specific restaurants, grocery stores, and retail stores. Not only will you get to visit new places, but you’ll get to report your findings and get paid for it. Be wary, however. Many “outside companies” are scams. You need to make sure you’re working through a reputable service. Read more here.

What materials you’ll need: 

Secret shoppers don’t need much money to get started. You’ll need a full tank of gas, a notebook, and a pen to keep track of your reports. That’s about it.

42. Sew Dorm Décor

College dorm rooms have a tendency to look boring, undecorated, and unloved. You can change that by designing quality dorm décor that helps students feel at home on campus. Start by creating designs for your own dorm. Then, as your visitors see what you’ve done, ask them to refer you to their friends and classmates.

What materials you’ll need: 

You’ll need a set of trendy fabric (check out some awesome samples here), a quality sewing machine, and some amazing design ideas.

43. Sell Class Notes

There are many things that aren’t “okay” in college. Writing other students’ papers, doing homework for your friends, cheating on tests, and copying answers are all “wrong” acts. However, there’s nothing inherently wrong with sharing class notes. Everyone misses class sometimes. It helps them to know what’s going on while they’re gone. So, why not sell your class notes for a reasonable price?

What materials you’ll need: 

You’ll need to store your notes on a computer, making them easier to read. You’ll also need to create online flashcards (again, Quizlet is great for this) for your customers to use. Once someone “buys” your notes, give them access to a locked Google Document and send them the URL to the Quizlet page.

44. Buy Storage Units

Have you ever seen Storage Wars? In the popular television show, bidders try to purchase abandoned storage units. Then, they attempt to flip the contents for cash. Most of the time, bidders were successful in earning their money back and maintaining some kind of profit. If you have the time and energy, this start-up business is fun, interesting, and has the potential for huge payoffs.

What materials you’ll need: 

You’ll need a full tank of gas to attend auctions. You’ll also need start-up money with which to bid. Other than that, you may need to rent a trailer to move the contents of a unit to another location. And, of course, you’ll need a location to store or sell your findings.

45. Become a Campus Brand Ambassador

Brands are constantly looking for ways to break into the millennial market. If you have great communication skills and a large social circle, this could be right up your alley. Many of these positions are performance based, offering commission and bonuses. With a little willingness to talk to strangers and a charming smile, you could be making friends and money at the same time. Check for listings on popular intern sites such as InternMatch, Internships.com and InternQueen.

What materials you’ll need: 

Not much is needed to be a brand ambassador, and if there is, usually the company will supply these to you. A clean shirt is recommended and see if the company can provide some swag to make your job easier.

46. Start Landscaping and Lawn Mowing

On hot summer days, homeowners don’t want to go outside and mow their own lawn. They would much rather pay a teenage boy twenty dollars to do it for them. But you aren’t a teenage boy. You’re old enough to make sure the work is done correctly, and that gives you an edge. You can also do extensive landscaping – something that teenagers rarely offer.

What materials you’ll need: 

As always, you’ll need to market yourself with a website, business cards, and flyers. You’ll also need gardening supplies (Lowe’s is a fantastic resource for this equipment), shears, and (potentially) a lawn mower. Many homes, though, will provide a mower for you.

47. Shovel Snow

Even more than they don’t want to venture into the heat, homeowners don’t want to venture into the cold. And, while long grass doesn’t stop cars from going down the driveway, snowstorms do. This means that, in the winter, you can make plenty of money by shoveling snow for your neighbors, friends, and family. Since the season is long and weather is unpredictable, some months will be heavy and other months will be light.

What materials you’ll need: 

All you need to make a quality snow-shoveling business are a few decent shovels, a handful of business cards, and a single-page website explaining what you offer.

48. Wash Cars

Some car washes aren’t as quality as car-owners would hope. There’s nothing like washing a car by hand, but that isn’t really offered anymore. Or, is it? By starting your own car washing business, you offer a service that most people can use. Without having to leave their home, car owners can have a clean car that hasn’t been unnecessarily damaged. You can also offer interior cleaning, for an extra cost.

What materials you’ll need: 

Just as you’ll need when you clean homes, washing cars will require basic cleaning supplies (soap, sponges, buckets, etc.). You’ll also need an interior vacuum, towels, access to a hose, and weather that doesn’t get in the way of your job.

49. Review Applications and Resumes

You live on a college campus. The students around you are desperately filling out applications and creating resumes. Whether or not these applications and resumes paint the best picture of the individual, however, is a different story. If you’re interested in PR, or you just enjoy helping other people with their resumes, this could be a great position for you. And you can make a ton of money from the right clients. People are willing to pay if it means they’ll get hired.

What materials you’ll need:

Writing and editing jobs really don’t cost much in the way of start-up fees. However, you will need profiles on websites such as Fiverr and Upwork, and you’ll need to keep those profiles as up-to-date as possible. We suggest making several resume examples, and writing a few blog posts or articles about what companies are looking for in a potential employee.

50. Offer Editing Services

Again, you can access the world of writing and translation through Upwork or Fiverr, both of which will allow you to offer editing services for a set price. On Upwork, you apply for jobs that are specifically posted. On Fiverr, clients will contact you based on your promotional post. Be specific; what do you enjoy editing? What experience do you have?

What materials you’ll need: 

Once again, writing itself doesn’t cost additional start-up money. You just need a computer, a WiFi connection, and a stable place to work. We also suggest a printer and a red pen for serious editing jobs, such as college essays or novels.

47gx4t,14,2016-02-24,Am I the only person who feels like its impossible to collect enough precious metals &amp; XMR/BTC before the inevitable happens?,floam412,Monero,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/47gx4t/am_i_the_only_person_who_feels_like_its/,"Look, I don't know if it's just me or not, but I'm trying to protect myself from the collapse of the USD and the rest of the fiat system as we know it.  It's something we have inherited generation to generation; a game of perpetuating debt that enslaves 99.9% of the human population to be wage slaves.

Many have argued that no one can trust crypto currencies, because it is something they simply can not understand and the average joe won't be able to understand the distribution system through mining. When in all reality, does anyone have any real true understanding of how the few people who control the monetary supply of fiat in their country at any given time?

I feel like most people in this sub have somewhat of a good understanding of what it means to ""hedge your bets"". I personally believe that *when* the fiat system collapses, there will need to be a way to go back to the gold standard to keep everything level and not continue inflating a currency. I believe I need to accumulate all the crypto/precious metals I can, because while I believe that in the future there will be the use of cryptos for everyday transactions (hopefully it will be able to handle the load of transactions), I believe we will have to eventually go back to the ""gold standard"" and have everything priced in precious metals and/or btc.

So that's why I never get concerned what the USD value of a crypto is... I worry about how much purchasing power it gives me (i.e. How much gold do I get with it?)

But here's the thing.. I'm still working to get out of college to get a job. I'm essentially struggling to pay for a meal out with my SO, let alone trying to buy crypto currencies and gold.

So I wanted to make sure I'm not the only one feeling this way. That I want ""make it in time"" in terms of purchasing a lot of XMR, btc, gold, silver, real estate, etc. before the who system goes caput.  I just don't want to miss the boat before the ship takes off.. And it's hard while working a part time job and going through an internship.

Any words of encouragement for me?"

I've been tasked with designing a new course for students nearing the tail end of my college's (2-year) CS and CIS/IT curriculum. The goal is to incorporate skills/experience that are otherwise lacking in a vanilla CS and IT curriculum, and which would be useful for students who are aiming for employment or internship very shortly. We already have all the standard courses in basic programming and algorithms, data structures, pre-architecture, discrete math, networking, Unix-y scripting, some security topics, etc.

Off the top of my head, I'm envisioning something like a ""DevOps"" course, maybe with topics in:

* SCM (version control, release engineering)
* Key-value stores, caching
* Cloud services (computation, content delivery)
* Preparing for interview questions

In your experience, what are some topics that are lacking in new grads, and which are feasible to incorporate into a small (maybe 2 or 3-unit) course? Keep in mind this would go into a course curriculum, so any specific names of software/vendors are generally a bad idea.

If you have any advice, I'd be glad to hear it."

47hsyt,0,2016-02-25,TRIP #100 (02.25.16),backwoodfinesse,LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/47hsyt/trip_100_022516/,"Before I begin, I'd like to set the tone for this oration by telling you how my day went. I received in the mail this morning the results of my IQ Examination, which my friend who interns at Langone HCOP provided me with. I have scored an IQ of 137. I did not plan ahead for this day before today that I'd be tripping, but I have this propensity to gravitate towards my favorite kind of trip, which is one I spontaneously initiate, and to mark this ceremonious day, I've ingested 700 mics, and though I have never precedented the full severity of this dosage, I feel that I am now more prepared for it than I am ever before. I spent most of today at the Museum of Natural History. By now I've developed such intensely beautiful cognition and splendid, childlike-wonder for the entire **universe** that I decided I'd like to share this moment with everyone. I'm about 12 hours into my trip now, give or take, and at this point in time, I'm in the final increments of it, away from the visual/auditory hallucinations (yes, this portion is undoubtedly, absolutely wonderful, but aside from this eye-candy and music-tasting and pleasantly harrowing, simulated schizophrenia, I strongly believe it is significantly imperative to understand that this is the superficial part of the trip, and now that I am towards the extraordinary, unfamiliarly familiar set of epiphanies that spontaneously explode from deep within my mind, I am now experiencing the ""comedown"", in the state-of-mind that I genuinely bask in as the part of the trip where I really explore myself in a manner only explainable to those who have experienced tripping, or even better, to those who are currently tripping. Simply put, I am self-conscious neurology; *I* am the fluctuating synapses that fire throughout the grey matter and neural tunnels of my brain, an ultimate self-aware being at my deepest core with no ego or personality. I am the sentient, **superhuman** embodiment of myself. In this mind-state, I find there to be only one instinct that I inherit from myself, and that is to **learn** anything and everything, as I will use the finessed power of my mind to uniformly categorize all knowledge I ever accumulate into the archives of my conscious and subconscious brain. I have, in a sense, put on my **thinking cap**. 
  While I was peaking today, I had an utterly terrifying realization. I have been eternally dead before being born. I think people would argue that death is not something to be afraid of, as I've ""once experienced the oblivion where it'd be like to not exist from all the way since the Big Bang (Which is not fictitious; it is 100% the truth. Research the theoretical suppositions of Dr. Stephen Hawking. Be enlightened. Be blown away.) until the serendipity in the space-time continuum at which I was born. But what really got to me was that this interpretation does not comfort me whatsoever. I still firmly believe that death is incredibly unfamiliar; I cannot envision what it would be like to be *dead*. I cannot picture the abyss, the unseen void, the unforgiving infinity of the **other side**. I can understand one of the elementary psychologies behind why individuals practice religion, as it provides them with a sense of comfort with the concept of an ""afterlife"", but it is impossible for me to ever *imagine* what it would be like to be dead, as it is with anyone else (who is alive, for that matter). But right now, right now I really really really enjoy being **ALIVE**. Right now **I** am the incredibly complex combination of carbon atoms that is me, floating along on this blue and green marble in the Milky Way, one of truly countless 
galaxies, in this paradigm and dimension of reality of the perceived universe. 

This trip was a fucking blast. I feel that I've done a terrible job sharing this experience with everyone, not because of anyone's incapability to understand what I've said, but because of my own incapability to selflessly **share**. Now I'm going to enjoy myself a nice warm bowl of cereal and prepare for my personal finale. Thank you everyone for being here with me. I love you all. **You** especially. "
47i4os,2,2016-02-25,The lies I've been telling for years caught up with me tonight,-Defy-,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/47i4os/the_lies_ive_been_telling_for_years_caught_up/,"Well, I guess the gist of it is that for the last 3-4 years I have been lying to pretty much everyone I know (but mostly the people I live with: SO, parents, younger brother, Aunt) about how I've spent the last half decade. They were all under the impression that I had spent that time taking 3-4 classes a semester at two different local community colleges. I got my GED at 17 at the end of my junior year of high school, after fucking around and nearly being declared truant starting in 8th grade. I figured I'd have a leg up on everyone else in my grade because while they were having a normal high school experience, with a senior year, graduation ceremony, etc. I'd be already done with half of my general education requirements to transfer to a 4-year university. But the fucking around didn't stop. That first semester I took 4 classes at a community college less than a mile from my residence, and I completed two of them, both of them with A's. Then next semester I didn't complete a single course. Withdrew all of them on the last day to get a ""W"" in the course as opposed to an F, and wallowed in my own misery for the last weeks of the semester. I lied about it all. That summer my parents actually thought to actually make me show them the transcripts, and needless to say I was caught, and they were furious, they didn't understand and I was scared shitless. I straightened up for a semester (with a lighter, part-time classload) and was told I had to look for a job, paid or not, to fill the rest of my time. After a semester spent hosting at a local breakfast/lunch restaurant, I was let go for calling in too much and then eventually completely no-showing a shift after having spent the whole night playing video games. Spring semester, now my 4th semester at a community college, I switched to a different but still local CC about 20 miles away, though I had also gotten an internship at my mothers place of work, which was only a few miles from the school. I figured if I could get my classes to mesh well with my work schedule in some way it would be better than going to school somewhere closer to where I lived. It actually worked for a single semester, too. I was making 300-400 every two weeks for about 20 hours of work a week, still managing to attend all my classes and finally pass both of those classes, both with A's. Then came summer break and the work started to amp up and I decided not to take summer school. I realize only now as I type this what a stupid decision that was, because come Fall semester I had a taste of what real money can get you if you have a real job, and the idea of going back to school almost repulsed me. I wanted to quit school completely and work full-time, but the job wasn't at all a full-time gig, and so I went back to the old go to school for 6 weeks and then get scared of failure and drop the course. That went on for 6 fucking semesters. 3 years now. I'm about to turn 22, I'm not currently enrolled in any courses for Spring 2016 semester, and tonight, my lies finally catch up to me. Both my parents think I have class Wednesday nights from 6-8:50, but my dad knocks on my door at 6:15 and I'm home. I panic as he hands me something he was just going to leave on my desk and give a shitty excuse. He leaves, comes back thirty seconds later, clarifies the excuse, comes back a minute later, says he wants to see the email that got sent saying class was cancelled. Fuck. That doesn't sound like something he'd say, though, so I walk out of my room to see my mom is home and that's when I really panic. Once she gets on the subject of wanting to see proof, she doesn't let that thought get away from her. I try to diffuse the situation and learn that she had a really rough day at work and tell her I'll forward her the email. I walk into my room and really go into full panic mode. I try to play it cool and hope that she just forgets because of how upset at her staff she is and she won't bring it up again. But 15 minutes later, she brings it up, and I start to realize just how truly boned I am. The rest is history now, I suppose. After a few hours of continuing the cat and mouse of game of hoping she'll forget, coming up with an excuse as to why it didn't forward 5 different times, I finally just let it out. But for some reason, I still decided to lie about the current semester and other small details. I realize pretty instantly how dumb that is to do, but I didn't even immediately correct myself, I let that come out an hour later. My dad is not one for crying, but tonight I saw him cry harder over this than when his own dad died. That was eye-opening, to say the least. My mom asked me ""Do you even have a conscience?"" and she didn't mean it in a dark joking way, she actually needed to know. It's going to be a long, uphill battle from here, but I think this might be the wake up call I needed. Getting threatened with being kicked out of the house definitely kicked me in the ass. I immediately put in an application for a summer job opportunity that is very close to a sure-thing that a.) looks incredible on a resume and b.) could make me enough money to find my own apartment with my SO and a friend at the end of summer, and then start working full-time and living the life I want to live, school-free, for now. If anybody has any questions about the situation or something that wasn't clear feel free to ask. I mostly just wanted to get this off my chest and into words in a way that I wouldn't feel persecuted by the people responding. Thanks to anyone who actually read the whole thing and leaves either their advice or even their take on the situation, but I'm also not expecting much from this post. Thanks again r/offmychest, writing this actually felt pretty good."

The main issue I am facing is I haven't worked in a big corporate firm or a job with a big title and dedicated roles .  

As a personal hobby and enthusiast I used to review a lot of high end portable consumer audio gear or in short  niche audiophile equipment  while pursuing my Diploma in Electronics 6 years back .  After finishing my course I ended up working as an intern for a small startup which was into imports and distribution of  similar audio equipment.

Over the next 4-5 years , being one of the core members of the startup and since the owner / investor was staying in a different country I was the main person handling the business overall and with my limited knowledge I helped the company expand its business by doing the following and learning each day - 


**Retail-**

Handling all online sales accounts like eBay , Amazon etc. 

Being the key person co-coordinating with local vendors , incorporating new local brands and deciding on the pricing , doing the organic marketing / handling social media accounts .

**Country wide exclusive distribution/ imports of brands -**

&gt;Researching on new brands for the market and deciding which ones to get to the country , handling the price negotiations , imports documentation etc 

&gt;Running sales promotions ,media promotions etc.

&gt;Finally working towards the promotion of new brands by conducting reviews , ads etc 


    While doing all of the above to ensure highest level of customer service satisfaction , I handled some of the important pre-sales (high value customers) or post sales customer issues which my team couldn't handle .  This could be advising a confused customer in making the right purchase decision or technical advise and in case of post sales- helping an angry customer resolve their issue or ensuring they become repeat customers instead of disappointed ones shaming the brand or company online or on forums .

  Over a period of time I realized I was good at my job and liked it cause I loved delighting a customer by helping with the right decision, resolving any issue and trying to keep them happy while trying to get new brands and add more products to our catalog . 

   In the last one year I was also part of a team which developed their own product and brand and got decent success and great reviews from the first product's sales testing .

While working ,  I also finished my 3 years of bachelors in Business Management (Marketing) and wish to pursue a masters course in the near future after I gain some more experience.

Now due to a fall out with the owner of the company i worked for due to difference in vision and expansion, I have quit the job and been looking for something new and challenging in any creative field or marketing / business development related.

The company I worked for was a pretty small one which started with just 2-3 employees and has about 10-12 now in last 6 years . From 50-100 orders a month to about 2000+ orders  today and 400% increase in sales. The way of doing things was also unlike most corporate companies since there was less stress of reports or lot of paper work and more on getting things done while keeping the overheads as low as possible . So I seem to be lacking when it comes to corporate way of doing things and the tools they use for sales analysis etc but I believe shouldn't take much time to learn and pick up. As for job titles and roles as you can see from above - being a startup there was no fixed role and the namesake title also kept changing from sales executive to business development and eventually a Product Manager handling the complete line up.

All these big terms I see for most job positions and their requirements do not make a lot of sense to me and confuse me a lot when it comes to making a CV/ Resume of my own and applying for suitable jobs. 
I really have no clue how to put the above experience in a systematic manner on a resume with the right keywords  and what kind of new job to look for.

Any pointers would be helpful :). Extremely sorry and apologetic  for the long post but this is the shortest I could cut it down to and still feel there is so much missing .

Tomorrow I have a phone interview with a person from Merrill Lynch for a summer internship position with one of their financial advisors.  I'm at a decent school majoring in economics.  This is the first interview I will have done for a ""real"" job, let alone one in wealth/investment management.  Does anybody have any insights as to what a ""typical"" interview for this kind of thing might involve?  The interview is supposed to last 45 minutes, and I want to be prepared for the questions they're likely to throw my way.  I know some computer programming (not sure if this job involves any of that), have experience from other jobs with customer service, and I have a strong-ish work ethic (worked 65 hours/week last summer).  I plan on highlighting these qualities, but if there's anything I'm missing I would greatly appreciate your advice.  Thanks!"

This is my first time posting here, so feel free to direct me to the appropriate section if I'm in the wrong place.

My ultimate goal is to work in primary care medicine. I am currently waiting on interview results and hope to start Med School in September. 

In the meantime I am a current dietetics student and I applied to dietetic internship programs as a back-up plan, in case I am not immediately accepted into med. I was recently accepted into a great internship, slated to begin this summer and I have accepted the position. 

Should I gain acceptance to med in september I am considering requesting permission to complete my internship during medical school (i.e. during breaks)-- allowing me to obtain an RD license in addition to the MD. 

I am wondering if any of you current MDs hold licenses in other allied fields (RD, PT, OT, etc) and whether or not this additional license has been useful in your practice? I am particularly interested in dietary interventions and research in obesity/diabetes management so suspect the RD would help, but if the extra work will provide no patient or career benefits I would gladly free up my summers.

Thanks!

I don't particularly like talking about how I feel so even this post is hard for me.

I'm basically doing this because I don't know what else to do. I don't want to kill myself, but I can't get rid of the overwhelming feeling that I don't want to live anymore. 

Things don't make me happy the way they should, and I can tell by observing what makes others happy. I don't want to do anything except for sleep, but when I sleep all day I feel lazy and disgusting. 
I go to school full time, work two part-time jobs, and have an internship working with individuals with developmental disabilities. 

Everything seems great to someone on the outside looking in. I have maintained straight A's for the past two years of my college career and have also excelled in jobs, activities, etc. I have friends and people generally like me, although most times I have a hard time convincing myself to go spend time with other people. 

I'm very busy, and generally Monday-Friday I am at work or in class from 8am-10pm at night. I work on the weekends occasionally as well, however I haven't been lately as much as I used to. 

Either way, I wake up in the morning and cry. I don't want to do it. It doesn't make me happy. School stresses me out constantly and if I receive anything less than a A I have an emotional breakdown.
 
I don't know if I'm depressed because I'm too busy, but it just seems like nothing is ever good enough. I need to work to pay for school, and then I need to go to class, and do internships in order to graduate, and participate in all these other activities/requirements for my major and it just seems like nothing is ever good enough.

I don't know what to do with myself. Everything makes me angry or stressed. I used to be known as the person who you would never see angry, but suddenly I can't find my shoe and I want to put my head through the wall. I know that misplacing a shoe isn't a big deal and that it will show up and I can recognize all these things when I'm having an emotional breakdown, but I just can't stop all the thoughts running through my head and how I'm such a fucking failure. 

But I know that my life is not terrible. I can recognize this. So why can't I get over it?  "

My boyfriend and I are both in college and we've been dating for 2 and a half years now. This summer is internship summer for both of us. Near the beginning of our relationship, he did tell me that he wanted to be an investment banker after he graduates -- he's in it for the money because he does love to buy nice things and travel. He's currently looking for investment banking internships this summer. I'm trying to be fully supportive but his friend (let's call him K), who had an ibanking internship last summer, told me the hours were brutal but he did make a lot in those 4 months. K said that he basically worked 12 hours a day from 9am-9pm, and was on call on the weekends (had to stay within a certain mile radius from the office!) and on holidays... and this is what associate ibankers' hours are too. 

We are in a serious relationship and hope to move in together after we graduate and find jobs. I'm really trying to be supportive of his aspirations and wants and I've expressed my concerns with him (i.e. not being able to see him that often because of his hours), but I know that this is what he wants and he's very insistent on it. I'm so proud of all his hard work; I love him and I know he loves me... but I don't know if I want to be an ibanker girlfriend.

and current state I am in. I don't have any other safe place to explain
myself and am sorry for sounding like a whiny bitch.

In school, I was healthy, smart guy but sucked socially and as a result,
failed with girls. My father was not divorced but was largely absent from
my childhood. I was raised by my grandfather and the mother who are also
not very social, did not have successful careers and are, unfortunately, lazy.

In school, I did fine despite wasting my life away playing video games, and never thought 
of what I want to be. But after exams, I went into depressed state because I did not know wtf
to do. I did very well in exams and without any direction got into med school. I decided to
quit and go on a gap year because I was completely unsure about this career path and I knew
that I will fail miserably if I go in depressed. Over this gap year I found programming, applied
for great UK unis and now study in Scotland in 3rd year.

Over time here, my health declined, I have digestive disorder that doctors are trying to find that
cause me brain fog, depression and lack of nutrition despite eating enough. I feel that my mental
abilities have declined through university due to those problems. But I am trying to address that
and sort it.

The biggest issue for me is the choice I made for career. I came into university excited about
programming. Over time, I had no luck in finding internships and that made me realize that I am
not hot shot in this field, i.e. do not have passion for it. I can do programming but it is not easy.
This year, I will have 10 exams to pass at uni and I am currently doing uni work, internship applications, non-stop. Another stressor for me is that my parents are poor and cannot afford to support me for long to finish my degree. This is the reason I am looking for internship for summer but money worries make it so much harder to not hear back or be rejected.

But in the end, I have a dilemma whether I made a huge mistake of pursuing something that I am not talented in. I have thoughts that I could have studied medicine back home(for free btw...) and stay in more affordable place. I am tempted to explore this option again but I am 1 year from graduating in Computer Science(assuming I can find job to pay for remaining year, I would run out of my saved money in November) and quitting would most likely be stupid.

I am pretty sure that I am depressed for multiple reasons: studying subject I am not passionate about, healthy issues, money problems and lack of social skills that make me unattractive to girls and feel isolated.

I am already 23 years old virgin and having such doubts puts me to constant anxiety state. Quitting CS degree and trying med school again would put me to graduate from it when I am 30-32 but at the same time, I am sure that being in such wreck state clouds my judgement.

Finally, to not sound like a total bitch, I am trying to do those things(not only whine):

* Lift 6 times a week(gives me a pump but does not budge through my depression).
* Changing diet (to see if I feel better).
* I will try to attend meetups in my field, i.e. tech ones to network and just talk to people.
* I also want a girl(s) in my life but I don't see how I can attract ANYONE in my mental state.

I am most worried about health, money, career because I do not feel complete without achieving those.

I appreciate any advice, including calling me a whiny bitch but please suggest what I can include in my life to change my situation.

47jsks,272,2016-02-25,I [24F] have been cheated on by all three of my previous boyfriends. I'm nervous about getting back into the dating scene.,probablyathrowaway_1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/47jsks/i_24f_have_been_cheated_on_by_all_three_of_my/,"I'm going to try and make this as short as possible.

I've had three significant relationships since I was 16 years old.

My first boyfriend, let's call him Mark, (17 at the time, 19 when we broke up) and I were together for two years; we broke up shortly before my 18th birthday. He was my high school sweetheart. I found out he had slept with two other girls while vacationing with his guy friends (from one of his guy friends who tipped me off, incidentally). I was heartbroken and, while I initially thought of taking him back, knew I wouldn't be able to trust him again. He was apologetic and seemed remorseful, but as naive as I was at 17, I knew sleeping with two girls wasn't just a temporary lapse in judgement; it was deliberate.

I was single for about 8 months until I met Derek while I was away for college (I was 18, he was 21). He went to the same school, we shared similar interests but I was hesitant on pursuing anything because of what Mark did to me. I was honest with Derek about it, and he agreed that we should take things slow. He was courteous and respectful. One night, he asked if I was ready to be exclusive, to which I agreed to. We were together for about three months. He went back to his hometown the weekend of his birthday, and said he would be back in his apartment around 6:00PM on Sunday. I decided to surprise him and come over with his favourite cake while wearing some lingerie under a trench coat. This was around 5:30PM (I had keys to his apartment). I noticed his car was in the driveway, and I thought it was strange that he was home and didn't let me know, but reassured myself that he was probably just taking a nap since he had to drive for 3 hours. Opened the door and I heard soft music playing from his bedroom, and laughter. A girl's giggle. My stomach dropped. I debated on leaving right away, but I needed to know what was going on. I opened his bedroom door to see him in between a girl's legs, giving her oral. He saw me, gave me a deer in headlights look and I immediately dropped his keys on the floor and left. 

I received a series of text messages from him, apologizing, begging for me to hear his explanation, saying it ""wasn't what it looked like."" I was disgusted and felt completely blindsided. Here was a guy who allowed me to let my guard down, only for him to do the exact same thing.

I struggled with what Derek did to me for a long time. I was 19 when we broke up, and decided to stay single for the rest of college. I met guys, had FWB relationships, but never committed to anything substantial because of my fear of being let down.

Fast forward a year and a half, the summer after my junior year in college. I was an intern at an organization that shared a high rise with about 10 other businesses. One morning, I was at the Starbucks in the lobby, where I met Chris. He was 23 (two years older than I) and worked at another organization in the building. I found him attractive and figured we could maybe be friends.

He became one of my closet confidants. We spent quite a bit of time together over the next few months, and I truly was developing feelings for him. I initially tried to suppress my feelings for Chris, but I kept getting the nagging sense that he was different than the other guys. And he was. 

We dated for the next two years. We vacationed together, met each others families and even talked about moving in together (more on that later). I am currently getting my Masters in another city, and he was looking for job opportunities there. Again, maybe I was naive at 23, but I truly thought that I had met my match. 

Towards the last three months of our relationship, I noticed him to be a little bit distant. I brought it up in a casual way at first, asking if something was bothering him at work, etc. He quickly brushed me off. Over time, it progressively got worse. He would rarely text me back, made excuses not to see me, and generally seemed to be stressed and easily irritated. I sat him down a few times and asked him to open up to me. I needed to know if there was something I was doing that was bothering him, or if there were other circumstances in his life. He said he was just feeling overworked, assured me that it wasn't anything I was doing, and asked if we could stop talking about it. I felt very uneasy, and knew in my heart that something was very off. I could see that we were growing apart; I was excited to go to grad school in a different city, he was more stable in his career. We talked about maintaining a LDR (I would be moving about two hours away). I made sure to let him know that I wanted him to do what he felt was best, and would never ask for him to make a big career move if he was happy where he was. 

I don't know what happened. One day, while he was still at work, I went to his apartment to get dinner started. I opened up his laptop to login to Facebook, and noticed that he left Chrome open. I went to go close the tab when I noticed what he searched: ""How to keep an affair going."" 

My heart dropped. I froze. I didn't know what to do. I sat for about two minutes, contemplating on whether or not to look into his history (something the two of us have never done). Over the last 2 months, he searched what the best ways to cheat would be, prices for a Vegas weekend, how to quickly get rid of hickeys (I never gave him any hickeys), nearby STD clinics. 

I felt sick. He came home about an hour later, where I simply just turned the laptop towards him. His face went white. All he said was that it wasn't my fault, he never contracted anything, it was just one woman, and I deserved better. He claimed he was going to tell me, but I had heard enough.

I packed my bags while he sat watching me, silently crying. 

Needless to say, that relationship jaded me. I have been creating pros and cons lists about myself, trying to figure out if there was something wrong with me, or if I just had really shitty judgment. My friends and family have been so supportive, and without them, I would still be wallowing in self pity.

It's been exactly a year. I'm in a new city, getting my Masters and living with my best friend. I've had a great year of new experiences, strengthening friendships and focusing on school. I feel a lot more confident in myself. I've been working out, taking new classes, meeting new friends, exploring this new (much larger) city. 

I haven't slept with anyone since I've broken up with Chris. I have had guys try and pursue me, but I think my last three relationships have left me to be quite cynical. My friends are dating, putting themselves out there (one just recently got engaged) and I can't bring myself to do that yet. I am happy being alone, but I am also terrified of getting back into the dating scene.

Redditors who have been cheated on: how do you cope? What advice can you give? I've been thinking of seeking therapy, but I've been having doubts. 

Thank you in advance. I really do appreciate this.

TL;DR: I've been cheated on by all three of my previous boyfriends. I've been single for a year and I'm scared to put myself out there again. What advice can you give?

EDIT: Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for your advice. I really was not expecting to receive such positive comments and PM's. I'm taking the next couple of days to go through everything and think about what I would like to do (and looking into some therapists). To those who have been cheated on: I'm sorry you have had to go through that, but know you are not alone. Your comments provided me with comfort and inspiration, and for that,  I am grateful :)"
47kdju,5,2016-02-25,Dilemma with GPA on resume after transferring colleges.,avocadomouse,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/47kdju/dilemma_with_gpa_on_resume_after_transferring/,"I spent 5 semesters at one school where I had a 3.5 GPA and then transferred to a different school that was a bit more rigorous and highly ranked, earning a 3.25 my first semester there. Unfortunately I had a very rough second semester at this school where I got around a 2.35. Averaging the 2 semesters I've spent at my new school comes out to a dismal 2.8. I wouldn't say it was the increased rigor that was solely responsible for my bad semester, but mainly due to some really stupid decisions I made involving procrastination and laziness (putting off projects until the day before the deadline, not studying for tests, etc).

I'm worried that despite my otherwise good track record, the single bad semester is going to sabotage my chances of getting an internship this summer. It looks especially bad considering it was so recent which means downward trend instead of upward. 

How do I put together my resume given this situation? I would hate to not be able to put my GPA for my original school and have my 2.8 being the only thing they see (or having no GPA and have them assume the worst). Can I put both GPA's?

The only other thing I have going for me is that I have had a prior internship the summer before. In a worst case scenario I may be able to go back there but the commute is horrendous and the pay isn't a huge amount. 

I am a computer science major by the way. 

Thanks in advance for any help. "
47kk0s,5,2016-02-25,[NP] Brazilian going to spend a year in Pune needing help with some questions,hatebacon,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47kk0s/np_brazilian_going_to_spend_a_year_in_pune/,"Hello. I am going to spend a year in Pune working to a big company there and I would love if someone could help me with some questions because I am very excited and terrified about this opportunitie at the same time . First of all, I am doing this as a way to get out of my confort zone, meet new people with different ways of seeing life, experience a cultural shock, get professional experience to improve my resume and so on.

1. My first question is about how influenced is the city by western culture. I am a little familiar with some tradicional aspects of Índia and my understanding of it is very superficial so a lot of what I can ask may sound superficial like: how easy is to find toilet paper there? Or restaurants with cutlery? Or western movie teaters and stores? I know I may look close minded asking these but I wanna be aware of how much of a cultural shock I will need to be prepared for.

2. How tolerant are people to white male foreigners? Can I be expect prejudice for being Christian? I heard foreigners in general are very well treated there and other interns didn't complain about their social experience.

3. How is the social life there in Pune? What do young people (less than 25) do for fun? Are there public events where you can meet people? Are man and women judged by being friends and walking together alone? And that leaves me to my final question...

4. How about the dating life in Pune? In my self aware very close minded notion of indian culture I see dating and pre marital sex as a impossibility in India due to very stricted religions and other aspects of the culture. I am not going there to party and be crazy, but it would be cool to know if there is a possibility of not going throught a dry spell for a year.

Sorry if I ofended anyone with my ignorance wich is just what I hope to be loosing by going there. I Hope someone can be helpful and I expect to have a good experience"

47llro,0,2016-02-25,Internship pay negotiation?,tczaro,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/47llro/internship_pay_negotiation/,"Hi all, I'm a sophomore in computer engineering, and have been working at an internship since last spring. Over time I have realized that I'm not really learning anything from this internship, as I am mostly just creating basic/intermediate programs in VBA. I have applied to a couple other internships, and have gone through an interview with a few of them, and am now just waiting to hear back. I am wondering if I should expect to receive a higher hourly wage (I'm making $18 an hour now), or if most internships expect you to take whatever they offer?

Also as an aside, if you weren't super tight on cash, would you take an lower paying internship that gave better experience over a higher paying one?"

[What is your favorite Ice Cube movie? Friday, Barbershop, Boys N Da Hood, or Ride Along?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dsb1l?context=5)|Friday without a doubt. -YR ""Whatchu tryin to build a clubhouse?""
[Give me the gun Trey.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dsb1l?context=5)|Wow. You win for best question of the day. This is also such a tough question. On one hand you have to say ""Boyz n the Hood"" because  that movie was so powerful and amazing. On the other hand you have to say ""Friday"" because the one liners in that movie are just amazing. On the third hand, who wouldn't want to listen to Cedric The Entertainer's amazing stories all day long while cutting people's hair in Barbershop. We're gonna go with Boyz N Da Hood, but we're also gonna say you should have included Three Kings, because that is an underestimated movie. ""But it takes respect to get respect. Understand?"" - TR.
[How come you guys never apologized for the sound issues at last years event? I thought this was a big issue that should have been professionally addressed, but it never was. What gives?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dpc4l?context=5)|We've recieved a few emails about sound issues last year, and we replied to all of them and apologized. We apologize to you too and really to everyone. The sound bleed during Lana was one on hand somewhat unavoidable given her show and size of the conflicting black keys show. On the other hand we could have had more speakers/audio there, and that's something we've changed for 2016 to try and help. Deadmau5 issue had to do with his brand new production and it not being able to be tested enough in advance. Regardless of whose fault it is/was, we apologize and it won't happen again. 
[I got a 3-day pass because the lineup seemed to good to pass up. This will also be my first music festival. Do you have any tips for a first time festival goer to get the most out of the Gov Ball?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dn9om?context=5)|Well, make sure you are well hydrated each day and drink tons of water. It can get hot out there and very tiring. Additionally make sure you plan how you are getting to and leaving the festival each day (which really depends where you are coming from and wanting to go to at the end of the night). Also make sure you look at our Info section for what to bring and what not to bring, and make sure you come with your cell phone fully charged and maybe even a battery case if your phone goes through all its juice. Other than that, just come with a great attitude and your best looking shades and you'll be good. :)
[Hey gov ball! I have two questions actually. First, when do you think information will be released about volunteering? Second, what advice do you have for people looking to get into music festivals career wise? Thanks so much and I'm excited for my fourth gov ball!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dpea9?context=5)|Hey! 1) Pretty soon actually.  Keep an eye out for sure.  2) Advice - get an internship with some companies you really admire, work really hard, be curious, be super likeable - best of luck!  -YR.
 |On Monday, Vol info will be sent to folks who have Vol'd before. Advice for folks interested in getting into music: find a company who does something you like and/or are interested in, and do whatever you can to get an internship there. Once you get in there, bust your butt so you prove your value as much as possible so they can't imagine life without you. 
[A\) Will there be more bathrooms this year? This lines were so long that it discouraged me from buying drinks! B\) Will momofuku be coming back as a vendor? I need some more of that crack pie.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0drdoi?context=5)|A) There will be the same amount of bathrooms this year. However, what we will be doing is messaging and educating folks on where bathrooms are, so people all don't flock to one area of bathrooms. Certain areas are so overused because of their placement, and others, which aren't that far away at all, are under used. We are so limited by space onsite that we can't add any more, but we think if we educate folks on where they can go, they can make a better informed decision and not wait in lines.
 |B) Working on it...
[Wouldn't it have benefited them to pick a weekend further away from you anway? They haven't announced yet either so I can't imagine this was part of their plan. Stereogum claims their date was for booking congruences with their other festivals (Firefly, etc\) are you saying this isn't true? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dnzpu?context=5)|We think it would have benefitted them to pick a weekend further away, yes.  However, they picked a weekend two weeks after us at a site they did not yet have the permit for, so once they officially got denied the permit, they had to scramble to move those acts to a different weekend, and therefore didn't have all the options in the world.  There's plenty of reasons that go into picking a date, and I'm sure routing artists was a major one, but also pretty sure being competitive specifically to us was another reason.
[Is there still an ongoing battle with AEG regarding their Randall's Island fest? I heard that it is still going to be taking place this year, but will you still be fighting to prevent it from continuing in the future? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dntgs?context=5)|NYC is a big city with room for multiple festivals. We are supportive of other events, but we want to create a scenario and environment where everyone can be successful. We were opposing the AEG event because they were trying to go two weeks after us with the same exact type of lineup and that would have resulted in both events losing. Since they are doing their event later in the summer, we are not fighting to prevent it. 
[1.\) Why bring back the Strokes? They were awesome in 2014, yeah, but to bring them back so soon is questionable. I'm going all three days, for sure, but I am curious. 2.\) Is there one act you definitely regret not booking? Undercard or headliner, doesn't matter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dn9gh?context=5)|Hey! Not sure if you've been following reports or news about The Strokes, but they may or may not have some new music in the works for 2016. This would be their first batch of new tunes in, well, just about a half decade. Kind of a big deal. Also, they've played a total of 8 shows in North America in the last decade, so I'd say it's a pretty big deal any time they hit the stage. Regarding question #2 - I regret not booking Rod Stewart. Would have been great. 
[ time festival attendee here! What should I expect? Any tips on how to get a really good view of the artists?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dofwk?context=5)|Here's what you should expect: a ton of really happy, upbeat, good looking people. a ton of amazingly talented musicians. a ton of really unique and weird art. a ton of really delectable food stuff. a ton of activities to take part in when not dancing your ass off. and maybe a dance off or two in the middle of the festival grounds. 
[All big festivals in Europe have T-barriers or other sorts of fenced off pits in front of the stage to prevent overcrowding or people being crushed.  Will this be implemented at GovBall this year? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dpv45?context=5)|Hi there. We would love to have T-barrier set ups but our main stage field isn't that wide (it's very linear). We want to make sure folks can get where they want to go easily, especially if there is god forbid an emergency evacuation. We will huddle up and re-look at this however because maybe there's a way to make this work and accomplish everyone's goals. Thanks for this!
[Last year, when waiting in line for the bathroom and the mariachi band came out of the toilet, I met a girl named Julie. She was really hot. After I came out of the portos I waited for her to come out of one for ever. Do you guys know her? Help a bro out?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dov4g?context=5)|Wow. This is a Missed Connection if we've ever heard one. We know a lot of Julies but we have no idea if any of them are the one you are seeking. Email us at info@govball.com with a full description of your story, your love, where you would take her and what you would do on your first date, and we will distribute to the masses. We got you Muzical. We got you.
[How open are you, if at all, to switching locations so that you can offer camping?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dp39l?context=5)|Not open at all, honestly.  We're a city-based music festival that offers the convenience of sleeping in a comfortable place, and other amenities based around convenience that cities have to offer.  Camping festivals are great, and there's plenty of them to choose from, but that's not us. -YR.
[I thought the x-word puzzle was a great idea, but it seemed like clues were a little too infrequent and some of the suggested acts didn't show up on the final billing - would you do the same sort of teaser again, and anything you would change?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dp5ur?context=5)|We love teasers and anything that is fun for our fans to take part in. We would do it again for sure, and we will try and make clues more frequent. Also, between you and everyone here, a couple of the bands on the puzzle actually dropped out and had to be replaced, so there's that (happens sometimes due to band conflicts, touring schedule changes, etc.)
[That Daft Punk clue, was it a legit clue? Or was it a way of teasing us?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dreje?context=5)|We actually put that ""easter egg"" link on our website because the video it linked to was so hilarious. The fact that DP was playing in the background wasn't meant to tease or allude to anything. But in hindsight, we should have seen that coming, so we apologize!
[What are you doing this year to prevent soundbleed between the main stage and the Honda Stage?  Nobody could fully experience poor Lana last year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dnocg?context=5)|To fix the potential of soundbleed on the Honda Field, we are adding more speakers to the Honda stage and position the speakers in ways that can help direct the sound better. We have had numerous phone calls and meetings about this very issue so we are hopeful that this problem will be fixed for 2016!
[I find that every year I go to Gov Ball, the cell phone connection is pretty bad. A mild inconvenience for a festival as awesome as Gov Ball, but it makes it difficult for groups to separate/reconvene for overlapping acts. Any suggestions on how to textually communicate with people once on Randall's Island? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0doicp?context=5)|We have verizon, at&amp;t, and t-mobile bring in cows (cell on wheels) to make the service better each year.  Unfortunately, there's only so much you can do when you have tens of thousands of people in a small space that usually doesn't hold that many people.  Recommend charging your phone to max, and picking pre-designated meeting spots just in case.

47lqsx,1,2016-02-25,Looking for [North Side] Summer Housing from ~May 23-August 31,autobiography,chicagohousing,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagohousing/comments/47lqsx/looking_for_north_side_summer_housing_from_may/,"Hi! I'll be in the city for an internship this summer and am thus looking for a sublease.  

I'm a 24-year-old guy, finishing my Masters downstate (will be taking a couple courses as well over the summer), love getting out to explore and be active in my down time, and am very sociable/outgoing.  I'll be working out by O'Hare but would prefer to live somewhere near friends, so something in Lakeview/Uptown would be preferable.  High preference for something near the lake and/or with a balcony (rooftop would be even more ideal!).


**Requirements:**


Parking - street is fine, free is better

Private Room - kind of a given, but you never know

Washer/Dryer on-site - ain't nobody got time for lugging dirty clothes 3 blocks

Decent-sized kitchen - I like to cook, and I'm not awful at it either

Close to grocery, gym, restaurants/bars - eating, drinking, and exercise are important


**Preferences:**


W/D in-unit

Close to the lake

Balcony/rooftop area

Parking = nearby

I'd also like to meet you [all] - as I'm sure you would I - and see the place before anyone commits to anything (non-negotiable).  I'm currently down in Champaign, so not too far, and make it up to the city quite frequently, so if you'd like to set something up let me know.  Looking forward to hearing from you!

47lrw2,2,2016-02-25,How do I advance from a general IT job?,likeafoxx,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/47lrw2/how_do_i_advance_from_a_general_it_job/,"First, my current situation isn't but so bad. My boss treats me well and stands up for me even to the president/owner. We have ~90 employees (40 non-contract/deploy) and a good chunk of the employees are easy to get along with, which always helps. I make a bit over $45k/yr which feels low, but maybe it fits the position.  I have asked for raises and got one last year but it was less than 5%.

So the job is that I'm *the* IT guy for three locations, two in state and one in Florida (can't wait for an issue that requires me to go there). As plenty of you know that comes with the perk of getting to do a lot of different tasks which is a blessing and a curse. My daily work consists of standard hardware/software related tasks, network admin, Office365 admin (all parts), VoIP service admin, employee hire/term IT tasks, and recently I got an intern that I train (yay minion!). Basically anything IT, nothing special.

edit: Except for the software listed below everything is SaaS.

The problem is that there's not any growth available. The budget is pretty tight (another part of my job this year has been to design the budget with my boss) and most of the laptops are over 2.5 years old (only about 20 are business grade and have Windows Pro). The plan is to replace the laptops over three years because of budget requirements and so that it lines up with how we are planning our life cycle replacement plan. The only ""server"" that we have is a small windows box that I have apache running on serving our opensource helpdesk, asset management software, and MySQL. If possible, my boss and I want to get a Dell server with 2012 R2 on it and that would give me something to train on and learn more, though it doesn't fit in the current budget. As for the networking equipment it's a Cyberoam firewall, CheckPoint firewall, unmanaged Cisco switch, and a UniFi switch + 3 WAPs.

When looking at job postings it seems to be helpdesk, full sys admin, or specialized. When I look at my current skill set it seems as if a ""jr sys admin"" job or something would be what I'm fit for but I can't seem to find positions like that. So with all that info known, how would you suggest I progress?

Also, apologies for what's probably a poorly written/formatted post."
47lthi,1,2016-02-25,Is a poor undergrad GPA (well below 3.0) a death sentence in the world of finance?,incompetentacademic2,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/47lthi/is_a_poor_undergrad_gpa_well_below_30_a_death/,"I have been doing some research on this matter because I graduated college with a 2.5 GPA as a chemistry major. A lot of it has to do with me not taking school seriously and honestly, just messing around in those years as opposed to pushing myself. Lots of C's in science classes, a couple of D's, and some A's and B's.

After being out of college for a few years and working in sales, I have grown a love for the world of finance. Reading the sub though, it seems like I keep hearing mixed things about poor undergrad GPAs. 

On one hand users say that you cannot really come back from a poor undergrad GPA due to competition being so rough in finance, with so many Ivy League grads with A averages and respectable internships being your competition.

On the other hand I hear users say that with some years of re-invention after college, you could get a masters, ace it, and re-invent yourself in the eyes of a lot of the firms.

I want to know if at this point, a career in finance would just be something that doesn't pan out for someone like me due to mistakes I made when I was in the 18-21 age range.

What has been your experience with this?"
47m0dz,148,2016-02-25,You're not supposed to do that!,Bakkster,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/47m0dz/youre_not_supposed_to_do_that/,"Back in high school, I interned in tech support for the school district. Generally a nice gig, didn't have far to go, and lots of experience in tech. Sometimes, though, the processes could be baffling.

First week on the job, I learned to discharge a CRT to make it safe. Get it on the bench, plug it in to ground it, power switch off, use a grounded tool to pop off the plug with your right hand, keep your left hand behind your back (so any shock wouldn't travel through your heart, of course). Easy peasy. It was also a pretty common occurrence since the district was almost entirely Apple all-in-wonder computers, from the 5000-class gray boxes to the brand-new white eMacs (but that's a story for another time).

Anyways, a relatively common and simple task that I'd sometimes do a dozen times a week. Pop the case off a 5000-class, unscrew the shielded enclosure, discharge the CRT so I could work on the machine. I felt I got pretty good at it after a few months.

About two months before graduation (and thus, no longer working), the district $BigBoss was walking through to see how we were doing.

&gt; $BigBoss: How's it going?

&gt; $Me: Pretty well.

&gt; $BigBoss: What are you working on?

&gt; $Me: Oh, this machine needs a new video driver, I'm just about to discharge the CRT so I can work on it safely.

&gt; $BigBoss: Wait a minute, you're an intern. You're not allowed to do that, it's unsafe!

So, for the next two months I got to dig around for one of the full-time techs any time I had a CRT that needed to be discharged (and there were a lot of them) and wait for them to be available to do it before I could do my job. I doubt they liked doing it any more than I liked not being able to do it, being that it was apparently dangerous and the most grunt work of grunt work tasks.

tl;dr: CRTs are easy, until they're 'dangerous', then they're just annoying."

I'll be interviewing for two positions so I do have a few questions, what are the chances that I'll be interviewing for both positions back to back (considering the time estimated for the interview is 1.5  hours). I'm wondering what I should do in preparation for this interview, this is my first technical interview (assuming that what an onsite typically consists of). She provided with the list of people who will be interviewing me so I will be doing diligent research but other than that, what else should I be doing? Like I said first technical interview, and the positions are Internal Auditor and Database Architecture and Development (both are summer internships). So I'd say the chances of me encountering programming questions could be slim? They're aware that I'm a sophomore and haven't taken the typical junior level / 300 level courses. So I shouldn't expect questions beyond data structures and general sql right?

I know people who have created amazing 3D games with a group of friends, and I have no personal projects. They have internships, I have none.

And whenever I say this, people tell me to just go create a useful app or program. I looked into trying to write just a simple Java game, and I feel like there's no way I could do it without just copying someone else's and tweaking it here and there, which I obviously don't want to do. Besides, something so simple would just be embarrassing. I can write the simple Java programs required for my courses with relative ease, but the idea of just starting something like that from scratch seems so far beyond me right now. I wouldn't know where to begin.
 
The worst part is that, with how much I have going on this semester, I don't have enough time for a worthwhile side project. I get stressed out just thinking about how I'm going to finish my school projects, the idea of piling side stuff on top of that makes me stress out even more.

I'm just kind of freaking out at this point. I lose sleep every night. I can't bear the thought of living with my parents for years because I couldn't find any work after school. Sometimes it nearly brings me to tears. It took me so much work just to get to this point (I had social anxiety as a teenager, and put off school and living on my own because of it), and now I'm feeling like it was all for nothing. I have a little over two months until the end of my college career, and I'll be applying to jobs with no experience and no projects to my name. Is there any chance I can find a programming job and make decent living in my situation? Or am I just totally screwed?"

Also worked as student manager at my universities student run tech support.

There are a couple of problems I'm looking for opinions on:
I can't quit my job because I can't afford to lose my health insurance or stop paying debts. So I'd be looking at about a 2 hour commute each way. Would it be possible to absorb lectures or listen to relevant podcasts or anything like that while driving (half driving half public transit)?

Internships. It seems like this is an important aspect to my burgeoning career. Obviously there are probably a lot more internship opportunities in Seattle as opposed to anywhere else in WA state. But aren't others in this program in less tech heavy areas? Are there internship opportunities that exist online? 

Mostly I'm looking forward to school and meeting my classmates! By the way, is anyone else in Seattle? Maybe if I had some classmate buddies I'd be even more inclined to stay. "

47n7b3,2,2016-02-25,Join the Navy or take the chance and finish college?,ndd11,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/47n7b3/join_the_navy_or_take_the_chance_and_finish/,"Really long story. All my life, I wanted to be an engineer, but I had a really hard time with math. I could do it if really motivated, but I have always had motivation issues and so sometimes would do really well and other times, really poorly. So when I’m a senior in high school, I’m trying to choose a major. I talked to my parents about it and two things made me decide not to pursue engineering. A. my mom teaches at a university, so I get free tuition there. But they don’t have engineering, so if I wanted free college, I couldn’t do engineering. B. My dad really made me self-conscious about my math skills. Unfortunately, he always struggled with math too. He tried to become a full-fledged engineer, but couldn’t do the math, so went to engineering technology. So I think he sees me as similar to him and warned me against engineering siting that I’d most likely not be able to do the math.
Bearing these two criteria in mind, I continue my search. I like science, I like the outdoors and I like money. So I settled for geology. It was interesting enough, had cool applications and I could make money in an oil company or something and I could do it for free at my mom’s university. My first red flag comes up before I even officially graduate from high school. I went on a mission trip to El Salvador (already having settled on geology) and I and a small group of amazingly good friends (seriously, I’m still friends with these people 4 years later) and we build a house for a poor family. I just remember how amazing it felt to change someone’s life positively and I wanted to chase that feeling. I remember waking up one morning in El Salvador and saying out loud “why am I not becoming an engineer so I can help people?” I knew it was what I should be doing. But when I got back to the U.S. and “reality” set back in, I decided I should just do the safe thing and major in geology. 
 So I start college and do much to everyone’s surprise, really well. My sister even mentioned to me once that my dad didn’t think I’d make it through the first semester. I’m doing really well in all my classes and I enjoy the people and trips and stuff. But after a while, I start to notice that every few weeks, I have this panic where I feel like I settled for geology and should have tried engineering. I know I enjoy geology, but when I think about how I could be helping people with my life, I just feel like engineering is the answer. But I always calm myself down and again, come back to reality and say geology is good enough. 
Then, the situation gets worse. About two years in to the major (still doing really well) I start working at a factory that designs/builds motors and I also start taking calculus one. So at the factory, I’m officially an intern (my godfather knew I liked technical things and offered me a position as basically his engineering departments bitch, where I do any job no one else wants to do) and I start getting really cool projects where I’m doing easy, but interesting design work for fixturing and things of that nature. I’m great at it and I love it. Simultaneously, I start Calc. one. And you know what, I do amazing in it. I get great grades in it, my professor says I’m good at it, and I seriously can’t wait to do my homework all the time.
I see this as a sign of sorts. Not from God or anything, just an indication that maybe between my love for my job, may apparent aptitude for calculus and the fact that geology is giving me panic attacks every couple weeks, maybe I should look at engineering again.
So I look into it and speak with a professor at the school I would have to transfer to (old university didn’t have engineering) and him and I and a lot of other people think it would be good for me to do. So I make the jump. I transfer schools and begin engineering. But then I get to calculus 2 and I have no idea what is going on. It’s just one of my four classes and they all need attention and because calc was giving me the most trouble, I avoided doing homework and stuff and ended up failing it. Then, I take it again in the summer. Also a mistake. It was a 15 week class crammed into 8 and it was insane. It was four nights a week and 2.5 hour classes. Also, I had to pay for this class out of pocket because loans FASFA loans don’t cover summer courses. So that meant I had to work to actually pay for the class. So I work all day and then go to class for 2.5 hours a night for 8 weeks and ended up getting a D…and my university requires a C- to move on to Calc. 3. 
So by now, I’m revaluating me decision. I feel like I’m spinning my tires and wasting time and money. I know I like engineering and don’t want to go back to geology, but I literally can’t keep taking Calc. 2. So I switch to engineering technology for a semester and quickly decide I hate it more than anything. So I know I need to make some choices. 
Then a bad situation goes to worse. Because I failed calculus 2, my loan allowance went down. And because I made so much money for the year (albeit in order to pay for my classes), my loan goes down even more. So I have to pay about half of my tuition out of pocket and my rent. I decide that paying for classes that I hate isn’t worth it.
So what to do when you can’t do what you want to do which is engineering and helping people? I thought and thought and then I saw an ad for the navy. I was on their website on a particularly stressful dark day and decided to request information. A day or two later, I get a call from a recruiter who asks if I want to come in and talk to him.
Now I had looked at the navy before, but never seriously. My dad was enlisted in the navy and so had a bunch of other family members. But I was always operation under the whole go to college first thing. So I wasn’t going in to sign up or anything, but really just hear about what they have to say. So I walk in and the guy immediately has me take the practice ASVAB. I score a 93 percentile and he immediately says I’d be a great nuke. So he explains that they’re the guys who operate the reactors on submarines and aircraft carriers. I think it’s cool, but still, I’m not that serious about it. He says to think about it and then give him a call. So I research and talk to a select few people and decide it’s actually really cool and pretty elite and everything. You’re in the navy for six years and two of them are training for the rigorous program. So I think long and hard (for like 3 months) and because school isn’t getting better and neither is my mood, I join. I swore in and everything and am told I ship out August 9, 2016. 
So the semester finishes up. I yet again, good grades, but hate engineering technology. So I think, well, I want to finish college after the navy and I think I want to do engineering, so I might as well try Calc. 2 again. So I started the class in January and you know what? I’m doing pretty well. I’m enjoying it, I like my professor, and I even like doing my homework again. And I’m signed up for Calculus 3 this summer. And now, I’m second guessing my decision to join the navy. 
Now just because you swear in doesn’t mean you have to go. You have until your ship date to pull out. The program still sound really cool to me, but 6 years is a long time to give up your freedom. I think I’d do really well in the navy, but I also now again think I could be a great engineer in a few more years. Also, I still don’t have money to pay for more than a couple classes each semester and rent. I could borrow from my grandparents, but if I start failing classes again, I’m not wasting their money. Some days, I operate like I’m for sure going to the navy and its fine. Other days, I operate like I’m staying in college and I just seem like I’m in a better mood. Know what I mean? 
And it also bears in my mind about not finishing college. Most of my friend are finishing their degrees right now. My brother is starting his PhD, my sister is chugging through college well and my other brother finished his degree last May. So I will be the only one in my family without a degree and who dropped out and joined the navy, seemingly wasting four years of college and getting nothing for it. And it still weighs on my mind my dad not believing that I’d survive my first semester. Obviously, I survived my first semester, but his guess is sorta latently becoming true...and I feel terribly about that.

So advice?
P.S. Told you it was a long story.

* AK tells the Keating5-Wes/Laurel, Bonnie and Frank that they are not going to do anything. AK is calling the bluff that Philip sent.
* They are counting down the deadline.
* Nothing happened when the deadline passed. Breathes and tears are held.
* Asher is celebrating but then Philip sends a video of AK with Nate.
* Laurel enters saying that she doesn't care for what is happening but does want to speak with AK.
* Laurel found dirt that the primary suspect for Rose's death was Wes. She didn't show this information to Wes and hid it.
* Laurel asks if AK knew about this. No response was given.
* The show ends with a clip of Wes' standing over his mother's dead body with a knife in his hands.

47nf8c,3,2016-02-25,"Please, Stop Wasting My Time",spareohs,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/47nf8c/please_stop_wasting_my_time/,"In October I left my job due to a hostile work environment. More than a year of complaining to HR about my bullying supervisor got her a promotion...and me? A demotion. It was a massive slap in the face as HR delivered the news. The same HR person I was working with to build a case against my boss. It would be a $15,000 pay cut starting retroactively and I was ""lucky"" they kept me full time. It was hard to swallow and also to leave. In particular walking away from mentoring a few interns, bright young students who often came to me for advice, and as a result they busted their asses on all of their projects. They made each day better, even tolerable, so before I left, and rather quickly at that, I made sure they had job security. They cried when I told them I was leaving. Why now? Why so sudden? I decided to spare them the details, and so I told them I thought it was time for me to move on. But the anger boiling inside of me right now makes me feel like I really haven't.

It's been a few months since I walked away. Now in my mid-30s, I question every day if I did the right thing. My therapist has assured me I did. Each week she commends me on my bravery, my unwavering positivity despite working in such a terrible environment for more than three years. She's heard about my ex-boss, how I was never given clear direction, how I could never please her. How, despite my going to HR, things only changed temporarily. I spoke up and I got punished. Every day I think about what I'll say if I run into her. But that's another post entirely filled with expletives. From the day I went to HR, my boss carefully manipulated me and crafted her own narrative to protect herself. She spent more than a year slowly taking me down notch by notch. Her level of narcissism and craziness goes unrivaled. I wasn't worried about burning bridges because I was never able to burn one in the first place. And yet, I feel like she got the best of me. I let her. For more than three years. Now I feel like I don't have a good reference, and her constantly not allowing me to do my job aka shitting on my work, has limited my portfolio. Like I said, I let her get the best of me.

I know inside I did the right thing, walking away that is. I feel it in my gut. But still, I can't help but feel like a loser. Here I am without a job. Getting rejected left and right. Several companies have interviewed me. I have spent hours interviewing. Sometimes up to five interviews to hear ""you're amazing but you're not what we're looking for"" weeks later. To hear this so many times, all for jobs that would be a dream to have, has really taken it's toll. 

I'm at my wits end. My dog, who's also my best friend is sick. I spend my days comforting him while feeling as though the universe does nothing but shit on me. 

The past two years, despite my crappy job, have also taken their toll. I was violently assaulted in my neighborhood. I went through a terrible break up after an almost 10-year relationship. I got pregnant and due to medical reasons had to have an abortion. These are the big things. The things that keep me up at night. And I really just needed someone to listen.

47nzvn,3,2016-02-26,How do I get my application noticed by a smallish company 5 minutes from my house?,landolakes_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/47nzvn/how_do_i_get_my_application_noticed_by_a_smallish/,"There's a small but kind of well known company with headquarters near my house. I can run there and be there in 20 minutes. I really want to intern there because not only could I live at home, but it's also in the type of CS work I want to do and it uses Java, which is by far my most comfortable language. 

I submitted an application a week ago, and wrote a good cover letter, but their application did not have a section for cover letter so I could not submit it. I was wondering what else I could do to get my application noticed. Is there any kind of followup email I could send within a week or two, maybe so that they notice my application? I remember doing that for my retail job last summer and it really worked. I really feel like I would be perfect for this internship, and if they saw my resume, they would at least interview me. I have a 3.9 GPA, I'm a sophomore which is what they're looking for, and I have done several side projects and some relevant CS work. Any tips? Is slight persistence the key here? They're small and don't relocate so I feel that someone close to their HQ like me would be what they're looking for.

47o1db,6,2016-02-26,Who had a sibling relationship like Ford and Stanley?,enzio901,gravityfalls,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/47o1db/who_had_a_sibling_relationship_like_ford_and/,"I have seen this family dynamic in only few stories.  There are two brothers. One brother has interests like science, history literature. They like to read a lot. They usually have strong ambitions that usually need higher education. From childhood this brother is a little bit shy. Others may call him a dork. He is usually introverted. The other brother is out going and extroverted. He is the life of the party. He has many friends. Girls love him. He has little interest for academic learning. He is kind of a rebel. But the brothers care for each other. Sometimes the dorky brother get's harnessed or bullied by stronger kids. In times like this the other brother would come to his rescue. Would beat up the bullies.

i also found this  in spy/war novel The Afghan by Frederick Forsyth [spoiler]...................... One brother is tough and strong. He later on makes a career in the SAS. The other becomes a professor on culture and religion.

Seen it in real life in my family as well. My father in his childhood would stay in his room for days and read books. His brother was extroverted and went out with friends and girls a lot. In my father's youth was mostly spend reading books in his room. Later on he went to university, fell in love with my mother, married her ,became a Medical Radiation Technologists and lived a stable life. His brother on the other hand joined the Navy initially against the wishes of the family. He excelled there and was selected for a elite training program. But his career didn't last. He was killed unarmed in an incident where the bus he was travelling was stopped and all the passengers brutally murdered. I haven't really seen him because he died before I was born. My grandma later said that my father didn't have many friends ( or cooler friends maybe) during school days. But his brother introduced him to all the other popular guys and girls in town. Later after his death to deal with the grief my father hanged out with them a lot and it forged many friendships that would last a life time. And also pulled by dad from a shell that confined him to his books.

I am an only child so I don't really have a say in this. But I have seen a similar thing between by cousin (my father's sister's son) and me. Since neither of us had any brothers (he had two sisters), we pretty much considered ourselves brothers. In my early childhood I was interested in science, science fiction history etc and I was not very social. I would go to my room when visitors came to my house. My cousin on the other hand didn't show much interest in academic learning, He was extroverted, He had a large group of friends, He went out with many girls and got involved in many fights. Now I am 21 and starting university thinking of majoring in Software Eng. I am starting to get more involved in society and becoming more social. My cousin who is now 25 didn't pursue higher education after his Advanced Levels. (year 12) He did a string of jobs mainly in sales. Recently he got selected as a officer at the railway department. As I have seen so far he is working very diligently. I don't know if he had cooled down his whole crazy phase though. Because even now I am a dork at heart. :)

Inthe other hand the relationship between Dipper and Marbel is quite different from Ford and Stanley. In most brother sister relationships where the brother is older or similar age, the brother feels more responsible for the sister and acts like he is a protector of her. This is kinda evident in Gravity Falls as well. Dipper sacrifices more for Marbel than the other way around. He sacrifices the chance to stop Wendy going out with Robbie, sacrifices his job at the pool, sacrifices smart Waddles and decides not to take Ford's internship. The only sacrifice Marbel makes (that I can remember of) is ruining her sock opera. She easily gets mad when Dipper does something that would make him happy in contrary to her plans. Like attending Wendy's party instead of trick of treating or going to Ford's internship. What I meant to say is that it is hinted that in this brother sister relationship Marbel slightly looks up to Dipper to take care/ look after her. And lastly the dating advice that would be given by a sister to a brother is different from advice given from a cooler brother to a dorky brother. Brother to brother advice would sound more like what Stanley gave Dipper. (the whole confidence and being funny thing) While a sister (like Marbel) would tell to treat girls nice and polite, hygienic and romantic.

Well, this is my interpretation. What do you guys think? "

47o7ro,1,2016-02-26,Applying for *the* job I have been waiting for ever since interning there two years ago...I am too eager!,taniapdx,CoverLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverLetters/comments/47o7ro/applying_for_the_job_i_have_been_waiting_for_ever/,"I have two complications...I completed a rather long (and I believe very successful) internship with the environmental team at *a local council office* and now the job I have wanted ever since (of the person who trained me) has come up and I am afraid that if I dive right in to writing my cover letter it will end up looking like OMG GIVE IT ME! 

The second issue is that I actually applied for another position in the environmental team earlier this week, before this one posted. I would be happy to take that position were it offered, but of course, it is now a *distant* second to this one.

So I am trying to balance a few issues. Obviously, I will have to completely rewrite my cover letter, since the same person will be doing the screening. I always do a major overhaul for cover letters, but this time I feel like I have to find a way to make it completely fresh *and* make it clear that this is the job I have been waiting for (and training for, working on qualifications, etc.)

I am reluctant to outright withdraw my first application, but I am wondering if I should acknowledge it, not in the cover letter, but in the email when I send it. Will it ruin my chances for either/both if I rank my interest?

I think I will paste my original cover letter here and if there are suggestions on how to rework it, I would be most grateful!

***

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the role of Recycling and Reuse Officer (XXXXXX). I am very passionate about serving in the public sector and having previously worked with the XXXXXX Climate Change Alliance I have continued to closely follow the workings of the Council and Environmental Services Team. I have a deep understanding of the Borough of XXXXXX’s mission, community, and ambitious culture of change. I am especially motivated by the commitment to sustainability, partnership, and outreach embedded into all of the Council’s dealings and see this role as the embodiment of that work within the community. I am a confident recycler in my own home, training my neighbours and co-workers, and in my last role was known (I believe affectionately) as the “green girl” whom staff came to for advice on recycling and sustainability practices.

I have recently completed post-graduate studies in the Sustainable Cities program at XXXXXX, focusing on the effects of binding carbon emission reduction goals on local boroughs and corporate engagement programs, such as XXXXXX and XXXXXX’s Climate Change initiatives. I am eager to translate my academic experience into finding practical solutions to emission reduction and energy usage issues, which by necessity include waste management and recycling. I am especially interested in community outreach programs, having previously worked with an organisation specializing in weatherisation, water conservation, and lead poisoning prevention workshops, where I was trained in community leadership and mission planning. I am also familiar with program reporting requirements and have a strong analytical background, experience with Excel, SPSS, and other statistical software, as well as graduate-level environmental economics and public budgeting, all of which will help with the documentation side of this role.

In addition to my research at XXXXXX’s, I hold a Master of Public Administration (Magna Cum Laude) from XXXXXX University in Natural Resource Policy &amp; Administration, centred on energy policy, mission planning, Smart Grid technology, environmental economics, conflict resolution, negotiation, and public budgeting. I believe these skills, coupled with my more recent focus on sustainable cities and ecosystem management make me an ideal fit for the RARO position, as I have a broad understanding of change making strategies, mission competencies, and policy frameworks. I also hold a BSc (Summa Cum Laude) with an environmental science, philosophy, and history focus, as well as a resource economics minor from XXXXXX University. 

My most recent professional experience was an internship with the XXXXXX Climate Change Alliance, assisting businesses in calculating carbon footprints, developing sustainability plans, and working both independently and as part of a team to analyse data and report the Alliance’s benchmark progress back to XXXXXX Council. Additionally, I assisted in writing member case studies, monitoring achievements, and creating awards and recognition profiles for Alliance members. In this role, I was also introduced to the Environmental Services team and worked among them for several months. 

My academic background in leadership and public administration, coupled with my many years of community outreach and social engagement have well prepared me for this public facing role. I am self-motivated, organised, discreet, and diligent in my duties, with a keen eye for detail. I am experienced in dealing with stakeholders from all levels of government, management, and the community and have a confident rapport with people from all walks of life and socio-economic backgrounds. I have served on numerous diversity and engagement task forces, as well as working with non-profit and policy advocacy groups which involved daily interactions with senior officials, policy makers, and stakeholders. 

I believe I will be a valuable addition to the Recycling and Reuse team, bringing practical experience as well as a deep understanding of city governance and resource management to the role. I am available immediately and look forward to discussing this exciting opportunity with you.


***
Notes: I hate that ""green girl"" line and have removed it from other applications. I actually do use the word keen...a lot, and in the UK a lot of person specs ask you to include the results of your degrees (ie grades), so while it makes me feel like a twat including the fact that I graduated with honours, it seems to be a normal things to do here."

So beginning a few days ago, all our networked printers started acting strange. At first, they would complete a print job, and then also print out a few strings of random characters along with a GET request string. The print jobs weren't affected so most people in the office just ignored it and didn't report it. Then one morning we come in and find out that each the big xerox copiers printed out thousands of configuration pages. This is a massive waste of resources and administration is furious. The weird thing is that the ""printed on"" date is different for each copier. Best I can figure is that's the day each one was installed. The print server's spooler had thousands of junk jobs clogging it up, and it took several resets to clean it all up. After that day, the network printers would print out the GET request after completing any job, including just making a copy, a network print job, a fax, whatever. It's largely stopped, except for the printers occasionally losing connectivity and needing to be reset.

What's happening here? My best guess is we got port scanned and somebody found a vulnerability in the print server."

I've been a long time lurker here and this site has been amazing for information gathering. I've been on estridol and Spiro now for a few months it'll be 6 months on April 26th.

I was a solid built guy before I started, 315 which with diet alone cut 40 lbs, about three months before I began HRT I joined an intense sports performance program through a hospital in Richmond Virginia because my goal is bottom half surgery, supposed to be 210 before that.

I've noticed mostly that I've been loosing grip strength, I used to crush the captain's of crush 2 with little work, now I barely move the ones, so yay!

My concern is I'm still big linebacker type, and haven't lost much weight. I teeter totrer in the mid 290s. I have a lot of work left to do. I'm trying for 150 to 160 which will take time I know.

I work out three times a week forty minutes weight training 20 minutes interval cardio. My problem really started this week where I workout and I'm just not recovering and its impacting my potential workout.

I know about the loss of endurance the muscle loss, I'm looking for ways to help with recovery. If I'm going to lose muscle that's fine but I don't want to go to each workout half dead and injure myself and really mess myself up.

Any thoughts, suggestions or ideas are welcome. My personal trainer has interns learning the system and ate the big trainers so how can I help them help me lose weight healthfully and not tear stuff in the process yet still be ready for my every other workout routine?"

You appear to be energetic and charismatic.  You appear to be just the man we are looking for.   We have an open position and think you are the man for the job.    It will involve lots of cold sales calls.  The pay is bad, you will be working in a closet (no lighting), and the hours are intense.  But I think there is good potential for you here.

(Posted a Sticker of a cup of coffee eating a Muffin)

Me:  Sir,  It is truly an honor to receive such an offer.  I am excited!  I am equipped for cold calling!  Bad Base pay is okay as long as I can earn commission!  The closet is totally fine as long as there is a computer screen and chances to leave the closet!   Let me know how I can move forward in the hiring process!

Recruiter:   Mr RoboBiscuit,  It is great to hear back from you so soon!  Well the good news for you is that you will earn excellent commission!  The other upside is that there is no base pay (upside for me).  As for the closet situation, well I'll leave that open for negotiation.  I'm glad to hear that you want to move forward in the hiring process.  For the first step we are going to need to receive your resume and a 20"" head shot.   After reviewing these pieces we will meet with you at a gentleman's club where you will pay for a night that we will all remember.   Depending on the success of that night we will determine what the outcome going forward will be.    I look forward to hearing back from you.       Sincerely,   DefinitelyARealCorp Corp.

Does DARC Corp have any good looking female sales representatives?  Are there opportunities for advancement within the organization?     Thanks for your consideration on this matter.  -DJ ROBO BISCUIT

Recruiter:  Mr RoboBiscuit,   I am glad to hear that you are interested in this opportunity.  You bring up some good points.  DARC Corp holds the belief that benefits are very important.  So we provide all of our employees with the biggest benefit of all: Employment.  As for other sorts of benefits, we believe that we should let you help yourself.  You will feel so much more accomplished in life as you provide entirely for your retirement plan and healthcare.        As for the good looking female sales representatives question.   Well that is a question we can't really answer online.   But we can promise you a Kate Upton poster for your closet.        One benefit I forgot to mention is our great hand-me-down system.  We have subscriptions to all of the best dirty magazines and share these with our employees.  Depending on your position in the company you may gain access to these magazines starting at 3 months delayed up to only two weeks delayed as you raise higher in the company.   Believe me, there is a big difference between the magazine after two weeks and the three month marker.  Believe me ...       Opportunities for advancement are unlimited.  You have the ability at any time to refer and hire employees to work under you and you will gain a percentage of each of their revenue.  Additionally if they refer further employees you will get percentages of that as well.  You could start as a nobody and in six months have a team of hundreds working beneath you!    At a certain point we may even upgrade you from a closet to a cubicle!  Imagine having light!       Sincerely, DefinitelyARealCorp Corp.

Me:  Wow!   This sounds like an unbelievable opportunity!  With the employees working under me ... ... Do I have to pay them?  Or perhaps they could be unpaid interns ... ...     I am beginning to feel super high motivation, the thought of having the opportunity to be working in a cubicle with LIGHT is possibly a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

I've been offered a paid internship in the city that'll last for two months starting this summer, at August probably. I'm coming from abroad, but I've already been to the city so I am kind of familiar with the different areas, but have no idea when it comes to rent prices.

Assuming I'm planning to spend about $2500 per month (including rent, utilities, food; everything basically), how easy is it going to be for me to find a nice place around Chelsea for a reasonable budget? I don't mind (and actually prefer) living with 1-2 roommates.

Also, assuming contracts here are signed for 1 year, how should I try to get a place for 2 months only? Is subletting my best option?

When and how should I start looking for an apartment, and how easy will it be for me do find one assuming I won't be in the city while looking for it? Should I just assume it's going to be impossible finding one from abroad and spend my first week walking around and finding a place?

In october, I had an interview with Microsoft for a summer internship. However, my recruiter quit his job and the applications were lost. None of us got an answer back (we all had the same recruiter) whether it's a yes or no. My question is: is it crucial to get an internship in the first year of your degree? I understand it's important to acquire experience, but will it affect my career if I don't have an internship this year?

47pm0u,1,2016-02-26,I gave a weird interview where the managers weren't sure if I was the right person for the internship. Did I totally screw up?,throwawayc0l,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/47pm0u/i_gave_a_weird_interview_where_the_managers/,"I am not sure what to make of my interview today but I will briefly summarize: 

1. Managers called me 7 minutes late. It was decided earlier that it would be a web conference interview. They actually called me and requested that it would be a phone interview. I was OK with it. 

2. Within the 15 minute mark, as I was going over my technical background, one of the managers explained me about the position in this form of tone, *""I just wanted to let you know that this is what you're getting yourself involved and this is what the job is about...""* I was stunned by this and started losing hope but I was confident throughout the interview. 

3. There was one question I asked if they hired people for internship if they are out of their degree background. Not sure if this was the best question but one of them chuckled. But my other questions were good, as they said it themselves. 

I went over my experience with the tools they were requiring for the position but one of them was rather rusty. I think the communication was not the best at that part because lack of preparation due to school projects clashing and lack of sleep.

This was in web support (Access and SharePoint, maybe some SQL). I have knowledge for these things but I did my best to convey that I can do the job. I am a computer engineering student so I am confident in my abilities. But I am not sure if they understand or if they were convinced with me. 

**I am not sure what to make of this, did I totally screw up or is there hope for this position?** 

I'll keep applying more as a backup but its getting very hard to get internships for summer. "

I'm technically a junior by credits, but am just starting into upper divisions.

 I really want to become a developer. A little while ago I moved from a crappy retail job to the university IT help desk. I've been working there for about 6 months and looking for developer internships with no luck. I've been offered a tech support internship, but I'm worried that this will get me stuck in IT.

I graduate in May with a BS in Computer Science. My GPA is pretty good, but I don't have any experience making personal projects or in internships, and I spend so much time on course work alone, I can't see how I would ever have the time to just build something of note in my free time. Even if I had the time, I don't feel like I have the same passion for programming that other people in my position do, especially from what I read on r/cscareerquestions.

For the last two years I've been working a student job in a helpdesk-type position for my school. I don't do anything overly complicated, but I would say overall I enjoy the job. I'm thinking of pursuing IT instead of programming when I graduate, because it just seems more in line with my skill set (ability to learn new tech, troubleshooting) than being a developer would be.

To be clear, I wouldn't mind a job where my programming skills come in handy and I do some coding, not at all. I can find coding enjoyable. I just don't know if I have the passion and creative drive to be a full time software engineer. And with my lack of projects and internships, I don't like my chances of getting a job. Everything I read says you at least need to have one or the other - a portfolio of projects or real experience.

But can you do entry level IT with a CS degree and this limited job experience I have? Do employers looking for IT people even want CS degrees? 

I'm just sort of at a crossroads and feeling a little bit like a man without a country. Any advice or insight is appreciated."

I'm a third year chemical engineering student in the UK and I have a bit of a dilemma. I really want an summer internship however I've had no luck so far (about 8 applications), and many internships here are only for penultimate year student. I applied for an summer exchange to China for 4 weeks through the university and got accepted, I have to decide if I'm going in a weeks time.

I want to do something productive this summer as last year I just worked in retail. Preferably I would get some engineering experience, however I would have to turn down the exchange and keep looking for internships, and then I may not get one.

I would like your help in making a decision. I want make it based mostly on increasing my employability, and also considering life experiences (I don't get to travel much). The exchange does really interest me, however with the oil markets going down recently, I'm worried about my job prospects after uni and want to do whatever I can to increase this.

It might also be relevant that I have very good grades and some may say this removes the cause for worry about employment, however I'm unsure. Also I'm doing a 5 year degree, so this is the second last summer I have before finishing.

Any help is appreciated :)"
47q9ws,3,2016-02-26,Question regarding emailing companies from Career Expos.,caseylul,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/47q9ws/question_regarding_emailing_companies_from_career/,"Hi /r/engineeringstudents

I could use some advice about emailing this company I am trying to intern with. So it was last friday I was at a career expo talking to this company that I applied for a while back and the whole interaction went great. The HR representative was there and I spoke to her for a while about my past internship experiences and my recent studies. She seemed very interested in me and spoke about having an interview and a tour of the facility. Then she wrote her company email on a flyer they had and told me to email her to discuss the internship. Later that day I sent her and email saying I was very interested in interning with them and I attached another copy of resume. The email was great it seemed very professional but she still hasn't replied to me one week later.

My question is should I send her another email? Another option is to message her on Linkedin because we are ""connected"" on there. 

I want this internship really bad and I was so happy because she acted like it was already mine at the career expo.

What do I do?

Thanks"

[DAW (and preferably sample libraries\) of choice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|1 - I'm a Cubase user, converted from Logic a few years ago, and I even used to use DP way back in the day!  As for libraries and synths, I like to use a wide variety - Cinesamples, Heavyocity, 8Dio, and Spitfire are all great, and synths like Omnisphere, Zebra, and Signal are all in my template as well!
[How common is it for professional composers to use Vienna Ensemble Pro? Can I get away with composing on just one machine?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|2 - I find it to be extremely common - almost all professional composers use VEP.  You can potentially get away with using one machine, but spreading the workload among multiple computers is definitely more efficient.
[Any tips on making my template as efficient as possible?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|3 - For me, I think it's important to have things organized so they are ready and easy to find.  That's part of why I like Cubase - I can really break things down into folders that allow me to get right to the sounds I want or need as fast as possible, and keep unused sounds and tracks off the screen to minimize clutter.
[Do you prepare the printed score as well or do you have someone who does that for you (including proofreading and orchestration\)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|4 - I have my team of trusted orchestrators and copyists that usually help me out with scores and notation, but I am always very involved.  I always proofread myself and have a lot of dialogue so that the score ends up being exactly what is necessary to bring the music to life!
[The most important advice you'd give to a youngster willing to get into composing for media in general?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|5 - No matter what, you have to do the work.
[. Also obligatory 6. Do you agree Austin Wintory's soundtrack for Journey kicks ass?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|6 - Absolutely!  Austin's stuff is fantastic!

I auditioned for ME and won. For Black Ops II, the audio director and I had worked on a kids game 10 years before and he really liked the ME games and asked me to audition for him. I won that audition and jumped up and down at LEAST 50 times. :)
 |My favorite location for VGL was the Kennedy Center! Great orchestra and 2 sold out shows. Amazing place. But we did a lot of cool things in a lot of great places. See ya Larry! 
 |I studied conducting with a guy who was a protege of the great Leonard Bernstein, Brad Keimach. It seems t hat want you visualize doing something, you manifest it. I started conducting my own scores about 2 years later starting with Myst III.  Jimmy is great and we are now talking about doing another big project together. We'll see, stay tuned!
[1\)  what is/was your musical background prior to getting into creating soundtracks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erry0?context=5)|My degree is in civil engineering. So yeah, that's odd right? But I've always loved music so I got bored and got involved in learning to become a recording engineer. I did that for about 8 years and got pretty good at producing music. Then someone came to me with an opportunity to actually write a full score to a game. I jumped in and did it and fell in love. That was in 1996. Been writing ever since. 
[2\) how did you get into the business/decide that is what you wanted to do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erry0?context=5)|After doing my first score for a company called ""Postlinear Entertainment"" which did a lot of games you never heard of, all of the people there went off and did bigger things. Dan Irish did Myst (which I scored the 3rd and 4th renditions of), Gareth Davis who was my producer became an exec at Facebook and Pixar. etc. etc. 
[3\)who are your favorite composers/musical inspirations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erry0?context=5)|John Williams, Hans Zimmer, James Newton Howard, Thomas Newman, many others. 
[As a person who makes music for a living, what music do you listen to when you're not working? what's your favorite genre?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erokq?context=5)|Looks like I missed this one! sorry...
[Ps. music in the ME series and Jade Empire was killer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erokq?context=5)|First off, thank you! I like to listen to silence when I'm not working. :) But seriously really like Adele, The Shins, Foo Fighters, Fleetwood Mac, Duke Ellington, other soundtracks, Beck is one of my favorites - just everything he does. Not a huge listener of classical which is rare for an orchestral composer. I do studies of it for work but not for pleasure in general. I also love the work of Cindy Shapiro. www.cindyshapiro.net. Check her out. (full disclaimer: She's my wife but what a creative voice!)
[What do you think of the soundtrack of Mass Effect 3? How did it feel to listen to a Mass Effect soundtrack you didn't work on?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0et3t5?context=5)|Honestly I thought all of the music was great and very well produced. However, as a gamer, I was very disappointed with how poorly the music was implemented into the game. It had a very unfinished quality to it. Sound design was missing and the wrong mood of music would come in at the wrong time. The biggest moment had arrived - the Reaper invasion - and it was just so poorly executed in the sound department. It was a bummer. I don't even think I finished the game. But honestly the music itself was really good!
[Hi Jack, you are one of my favourite contemporary composers. My question would be, What were your influences and/or inspirations when you composed Jade Empire OST?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0eqlr5?context=5)|Thank you! Well I did a LOT of research about Asian music - specifically Chinese music. Most of what I heard was a bit strident for a video game context, so I went with an ""East meets West"" approach. I hired a chinese music consultant who would bring in super authentic chinese musicians - many of whom did not speak English. My big influence reference for the game's score was ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Which sort of gave me permission to use percussion as a solo instrument. Loved doing that!
[Hello Jack! Thanks for doing this AMA. I have loved your work in the Mass Effect series and even had the opportunity to go see Video Games Live once, which was spectacular.  What are some of your favorite soundtracks to games/movies? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erjz6?context=5)|I just answered some about games. So I'll hit the movies here. Besides the best movie scores of all time belonging to Star Wars (seriously John Williams is our living, breathing Mozart or better!), I love James Horner's Braveheart, Hans Zimmer's Gladiator, actually I'm a big Zimmer fan though I don't write like him at all and don't want to. But even check out the score to The Holiday. A romcom that is a fantastic set of music and themes. who knew? Lol Anything by James Newton Howard and Tom Newman.
[Unfortunately I haven't played the games you've written for, but I've just looked up some of the works you've talked about in the comments and I love it! How did you managed to get into the business of scoring music for games in the first place? I'm an avid composer at the moment as part of my music degree and I have a big interest in game/film/tv soundtrack writing, but I haven't got the foggiest idea as to how to find a way into the industry, so to speak! Would you have any advice for this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0etfm1?context=5)|When you are done school try to contact composers you admire and see if you can gain an internship with them. Many internships turned to paid gigs within a short period of time, and then opportunities to write additional music. From there, you can begin your own writing career. Plus you'll have the added bonus of working under someone who is very experienced. that knowledge will be key to your own eventual success. My assistant started that way and now he is doing some writing for me. This seems to be the most viable pathway to a rewarding composing career if you're interested in that. 
[Suicide Mission from Mass Effect 2 is one of my favorite pieces of all time. Do you get to view the gameplay beforehand or are you just given a general theme to compose along?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0etlj6?context=5)|Thanks!  It varies from project to project, and even sometimes within the same project!  I like to try and get gameplay footage to write to as much as possible, but some times I will write themes or pieces without it - like Suicide Mission, actually.  Originally I was just asked to write a big, epic cue for the end of the game, then once that portion of the game was actually finished, I went back and tailored it more to the final product.
[Hey jack! Do you have any advice for young people looking to make it in the music biz? Any dos and donts? Thanks in advance. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0esph6?context=5)|Don't do it if you're not passionate about it. Do it if you are. And if you are, do it with everything you've got. Be a problem solver, not a problem creator. In the end, we all solve the problem of ""Hey, I need great music to tell my story, can you help me?"". If the answer is yes, you are on your way. BTW - always say yes and figure it out later. That's were the passion really pays off!
[Hi Jack! I am wondering what you like to do to get inspired for new work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0eqvxb?context=5)|I normally will take a shower. :D.
 |Seriously, I don't know why but a shower always gives me ideas. That and the several week process of digging into the story and just kind of going about my business, things start to percolate. Then it's just the business of sitting down and writing. No matter what, you have to do the work. 90% perspiration, 10% inspiration kind of thing...
[I absolutely love the games you had done the music for. It really is a very key component that keeps us latched on to every moment and most people just don't notice that it has that effect. Anyway, not related to my question, just wanted to say thanks.  What games in 2016/17 will you be doing the music for?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0eryct?context=5)|Well ""Into the Stars"" comes out next Friday! It's a small indy game with a big heart. Really enjoyed working on it. The team at Fugitive are great. The creative director and others came from the Lost Planet 3 team and other big companies with passion wanting to make a great game. I think they've achieved that. I'm also excited that iam8bit is doing a vinyl release of the soundtrack. Beyond that I am contractually not at liberty to discuss other projects at this time.

47qves,9,2016-02-26,A Semi-Brief Analysis of the SGA Debate,Organite,UniversityOfHouston,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfHouston/comments/47qves/a_semibrief_analysis_of_the_sga_debate/,"**Forward**

I’ve come to like politics. That doesn’t mean much unless you know that I grew up hating government and being somewhat anarchist. But like most fringe “fight the man” skater kids in high school, I grew up and began to see politics for what it is: Theatre. So I’ve become interested in politics not because of the technical implications of electing someone to office but because of the political process. We can debate for days about what the SGA at UH is actually good for, what power they have, or lack thereof, but you cannot deny that even the SGA is not immune to the political melodrama we have come to expect from more potent political sources a la the Republican Primary race. In fact, I would argue that the effect of and proximity to us gives SGA politics an edge that perhaps we don’t always feel for higher political powers. As a senior who has been at UH for 3+ years now, I regret only having recently taken an interest in our school’s politics if not for the sole reason that it can be downright entertaining. That being said, this SGA election has already had a few interesting tidbits and plenty of them came to light during the SGA debate on Wednesday. I’m writing this today to offer my thoughts about the debate, the candidates, what I thought was funny, and where I felt they fell short. This is not meant to be a super serious analysis to swing a vote one way or another. This is merely a letter from someone who is a fan of the art of politicking and debate. 
I’ll cover each candidate in their speaking order:


**John Fields**

John is a tough candidate to pin down. He called out his opponents for not having a clear plan while failing to outline one of his own. He called out his opponents for having unrealistic ideas while having a few of his own. Basically, John is a classic politician, and a pretty good one at that. John is a charismatic Bauer dude with a professional demeanor and the proclaimed relationships necessary to be successful in the SGA president position. He held the Speaker position before, and quit to do an internship, which his opponents were quick to attack him on, and he was able to deflect with political suave. Then, when he saw the opportunity to jab at his opponents, he seized it. On the notion of unrealistic ideas, the top line of John’s party flyer read “Keep UT out of Houston”, which Shane Smith pointed out was unrealistic for the SGA to accomplish. John was able to rebuttal that claim that as the voice of 40000+ students, the SGA president’s stance does matter. This gave John a pretty nice leg up, especially when Edwin Mascorro agreed with him on that matter.  However, even if the SGA somehow keeping UT out of Houston is an excusable idea to you, there are plenty of other things John hopes to do that lack a clear plan or even evidence that the SGA can do anything about: Reduce tuition. How? Better parking. How? Improve advising. How?  Better food… well he did elaborate on this one: more food trucks, price matching the overpriced groceries on campus, diversifying food options, etc. I guess at the end of the day, John never had any goals that satisfied me. John talks a good talk and has good ideas, but seems to lack effective means of getting things done. He talked about how he had the relationships in SGA and around campus already, and I would only hope that as the president he would know how to utilize those relationships to gain any ground on what he hopes to accomplish.


**Shane Smith**

Shane comes across as what I would call “the simple man’s candidate”. He didn’t speak like a politician, he didn’t answer questions like a politician, and he didn’t pretend to know things like a politician. He was not afraid to admit when he did not know the details of a subject of discussion, and I often found him answering questions very simply. Yet, in spite of the simplicity of his responses he often went over his talking time because he was wont to choose his words carefully and was careful to lay out his plans and ideas in simple terms. Simplicity seems to be the underlying theme of Shane’s campaign, and he’s doing a good job of emphasizing that. But Shane is becoming a victim of his own strategy which makes him seem tremendously shortsighted especially when compared to his opponents. When questioned about how shallow his platform was he detailed that better parking gets kids to class, better food keeps kids on campus happy, and better wifi allows kids to do their work. All valid responses, but it left me (and I’m sure others) wanting more. His shortsightedness became even more evident when asked about campus carry: he only cared about residencies (He’s an RA). And again when asked what his administration has accomplished in SGA: Printers in the UC. All the printers. Shane also scored massively negative points when he conceded that UT’s expansion into Houston was not something the SGA should worry about. Whether that is effectively true or not, it resonated very poorly with the audience and you could feel it. Now, do I believe that Shane Smith is as shortsighted as he seems to be? No. I think that he as a student of UH has had classic student of UH problems and has priorities that he wants addressed. A good hook for any student is going to be better stuff, better tangible stuff. Something his opponents seem to lack.


**Edwin Mascorro**

If John knew the political game, and Shane knew how to play the simple game, then Edwin is a master of the speaking game. Edwin Mascorro has the makings of a great public speaker. He adjusted his tone to fit the subject, he used cadence to evoke emotion, and he seems like an overall likeable guy. Here’s where I may lose some of you because I’m going to say what every conservative ever said about Bill Clinton: “I may not like his political views, but I’d love to have a beer with this guy.” Edwin is exactly that guy for me. Anyone who has ever read anything I have posted anywhere probably knows I am not a fan of campus carry, and as some of you may or may not know Edwin recently came under scrutiny for something he said during UH’s Campus Carry Open Forum back in November about gun free zones being targets. I hesitate to quote him there, because as someone who watched the open forum and then watched the attack ad against Edwin for what he said there I can tell you that he was taken severely out of context. Were those choice words to use to describe your view on campus carry? No, and he admit to that. Did he rescind on what he said? No, and he proceeded to press his view on campus carry even further. Even on the opposite side of that ideal, I respect that Edwin didn’t back down on what has become a very touchy subject for students at UH. Edwin made further use of his speaking aptitude when talking about seeing students who had to pray in the library basement because they had nowhere else to do it. I wasn’t particularly touched by it, but the way he said it was powerful and emotional and probably got the reaction he sought from it. However, amidst all of the emotional rhetoric Edwin was able to command, he falls short on actual ideas. To compare, in the face of Shane Smith’s shortsighted platform, Edwin’s platform seems almost blind. His “Hype Party” has the one seeming goal of increasing student engagement. The Hype Party is built on the idea that a lot of the student body isn’t getting the full college experience at UH, and they’re not wrong about that. UH is still largely a commuter school where for a lot of the students, school is just a daytime gig. I understand that as a member of Greek Life at UH, Edwin has probably has a bit more of a taste of the great parts of being a student on campus. I can never relate to that because I never dabbled in joining a fraternity. I digress. Edwin seeks to increase student involvement for traditional and nontraditional students alike except he doesn’t seem to have a plan to go about that aside from “plugging students in” to campus organizations. He even admit to not really having a plan, justifying it under the guise of going to the SGA senate as president and asking them what they want to do. As bipartisan as that sounds, people don’t want to hear that. It sounds weak and underprepared coming from an otherwise strong sounding candidate. All things told though, I do believe that Edwin “won” this debate. With his ability to address a controversial issue about him head on, seeming sympathy towards religious groups, and what I believe to be genuine motivation and love for UH I think most will be able to look past whatever he lacked and wherever he slipped up on.


**Epilogue**

A common denominator between all of the candidates was a clear lack of plan. John has plenty of ideas but no effective means of arriving there, Shane has a few ideas but several of them are already in the works, and Edwin has one overarching idea with an unsatisfactory means of getting there. I want to believe it was because of the timed debate format that the candidates weren’t able to fully flesh out their ideas, and the quality of the questions fielded to them didn’t help clear up anything. Alas, only so much can be accomplished in a two hour debate with three people on the stage. As a voter, I still feel like I don’t know enough about these candidates and how they propose to accomplish what they propose to accomplish. I only found out who was running last week, and I’m supposed to vote for one of these guys on Tuesday, and in that time all the information I have about the candidates is from a few Daily Cougar articles and one debate. So I don’t exactly blame them (yet) for not having a clear plan because I don’t even know if they’ve had the time to take a breath and think about those things. If there’s one thing I know for certain that the SGA *can* do, it’s increase the campaigning time for these guys.

We learned what programming is. 

1 We design
2 We realise (code/programming)
3 We implement
4 We maintain

I am following this course 1,5 year already at an community college. And i have in mind to continue 4 more years on a undergraduate bachelor in Informatics with the specialisation software engineering.

So i learned in 1,5 years what programming is. How to design, code.

But now i feel i am stuck.., it may also have to do something with my internship that i have at the moment.

I had to do an internship while i didn't have experience with frameworks, mvc and oop.

The internship is nearly done anyways. 1-2 months to go, as a junior webdeveloper.

But i feel stuck. 

I study appdevelopment at school, full time. 

But how should i learn programming/webdevelopment?

I learned how to design first. Then i learned the basic syntaxes of languages hmtl/css/js/php/sql.

I also learned what classes are, what objects are, what methods are etc. 

I writed some basic websites. Like 5-7 of them. As a beginner, they really are not that complex if i look back at it. But afcourse i am proud of it since it took some time to learn the syntax and scope of it.

But now i need to learn mvc/oop and handle frameworks. But because i am in an internship i really have little to no time since they expect me to already know the basics.. But i am still learning the basics of mvc/oops and framework syntax and logics..

So now i have a hard time, also because of shortage of time, to progress in programming..

I struggle learning oop.., mvc.. and applying those skills in frameworks...

How did you handle this step? Could you give me any advice? I really want to become a better programmer. I am just programming for 1,5 year, but i feel like i am learning slow :(."

I interned at this place for a couple days a week in July and August to get my placement hours that I needed to graduate. After my internship I was asked to stay on and was hired to work one day a week. I worked Fridays at this place (plus I had another job) until I was offered a full time job in my field in December. Obviously I took it.

Fast forward to May of 2015. I received a phone call from the place I interned/briefly worked at. Their main girl was leaving and they were wondering if I was potentially interested in the job. I hadn't even thought of leaving my current job but it was pretty good timing. I had just told my boss that I was overwhelmed. He needed to hire someone else to help out. He didn't see the issue and didn't take my concerns seriously. So I went for the interview. I was offered the job, extra vacation and for more money. I took it. It started in July. 

Everyone was heartbroken. All of my coworkers were so sad. They wanted my boss to make me a counter offer, but he didn't. So I left. I was full of anxiety and regret for the next two months. I missed my coworkers, I missed the flow, the fast pace. My new job was fine. My boss was wonderful. But it was so slow. It was hard to stay busy. The days dragged on.

Now today, in February. I've been here for 8 months. I like it just fine. I'm settled in but am often bored. Often searching for things to do. 

I went to a funeral today for an old coworker and of course all my old coworkers were there. It was like I never left. It was really great to be around everyone again. I had missed them all so much. I was begged to come back. I was told to make them an offer. They were serious. I wouldn't be as overloaded as I was before. They missed me. They regretted ever letting me go. They were completely serious about it.

So now my mind is racing and I guess it's time to make a pros &amp; cons list and see what my future holds. I've never been good at making decisions. I've never liked letting people down. (I mean who does really...) but I guess it's inevitable either way. "

I am graduating (computer science) in a few months and my start date is middle of August. The company offered me a $100,000 starting, with a yearly bonus between 15% and 23% depending on performance (the 15 is considered ""meeting expectations""). They also have a somewhat decent 401k (low by industry average) and 3 weeks PTO.  There are other small benefits as well.

This was all offered at the beginning, and after I took a few days I accepted it without asking for more, because I honestly didn't expect such a good offer in the first place (I was expecting around $85k) and the company seems a great fit for me.  I'm curious what this sub would say about that.  Do you think I should have still asked for more? Or was I right to accept without being greedy?

So this question might be very premature but I thought I might as well ask. I'm a new grad, and I've accepted a pretty good job offer with a well known mid-size company in SF. The base pay seems decent and I think I am able to negotiate the team I want to join.

The thing is, there were other places I wanted to join that I was still in the middle of interviews with. The reason I would prefer those places were mostly to do with the kind of work and industry I want to enter...I want to eventually be doing machine learning / deep learning and have spent some internships doing computer vision etc. I had managed to get interviews with some companies that work in these core areas, but unfortunately due to my visa status, I can't keep interviewing for long and have to accept a job.

As of such, although this is a premature thought, I'm thinking somewhere down the road I might want to change companies and get into the field I want. So this is two questions really...

1. The company I joined are great, and I'm probably going to be building some of the systems that work with their ML models anyway, so no loss of love there. However, in my head getting into the field you want to pursue as soon as possible seems a good idea, but thoughts on this are welcome.

2. I know people recommend jumping ship 3-5 years in, but have people done this after a year and seen progress?

&amp;nbsp;

I am writing this post because I am really scared and don't know what to do about my future.

&amp;nbsp;

**If you don't care about my story please read the tldr;**

&amp;nbsp;

My story:-
Ever since I was four years old (1996) I was fascinated with computers. I remember my dad buying me my first computer when I was nine years old (2001) which was an IBM computer which had a Pentium 1 chip that ran at 133MHz and could be overclocked to 200MHz by changing a jumper on the motherboard. The system had 32Mb of ram and 4GB hard drive with an on-board graphics card and of course Windows 95. I remember the first thing I did when I got it, was open the case up and looked what's inside it.

&amp;nbsp;

I tough myself how to code BASIC and spent most of my time playing Warcraft 1 and Doom. Since then I knew I want to make games. A few years after that my family had some financial issues and from the age of 12 until 17 I had no computer or an internet connection. On my 17th birthday (2009) my dad bought me a laptop to help me in college since I was going to study computer science.

&amp;nbsp;

The college I signed up in was not that great and the students were not motivated to learn or care about computers. Never the less I was very excited and determined to learn programming and game development. My professor gave us the ""intro to programming in C++"" book and he had an entire semester to teach us the course. I read the book from cover to cover in a week. 

&amp;nbsp;

Oops.

&amp;nbsp;

After I was done with the book I went into game development on my own since now I finally had an internet connection. I learned Allegro, SDL and SFML and made few small ""games"".

&amp;nbsp;

In 2012 I had a choice to either keep going and take my bachelor's or stop my education and only get a diploma in computer science. I decided to stop and only get my diploma since everything the college was teaching me I already knew and I felt like it was a huge wast of time and money.

&amp;nbsp;

After I graduated in 2012 with a diploma in computer science I decided to keep learning game development and try to start a small indie gamedev company with my friend. My dad was going to support me as long as I needed. In 2012 I moved from C++ and SFML to C# and XNA 4.0 based on my friend advice. In (2013) my friend gave up on making games and left. However I kept learning and improving my code. When XNA died I moved to MonoGame and I built my first 2D engine in MonoGame. 

&amp;nbsp;

My 2D engine has the following systems:-
&amp;nbsp;

* 2D tile map rendering.
* Basic point and spot lights using HLSL 4.0.
* Multi-threaded clearance based A* pathfinding algorithm using binary tree for sorting the nodes.
* Enemy AI with line of sight.
* Particle system.
* Basic 2D physics engine and collision detection.
* Basic bitmap text rendering. (I don't like MonoGame content pipeline so I made my own). 
* A GUI system that includes buttons, text boxes, windows, check boxes, radio boxes, menus, scroll bars etc...
* 2D sprite based animation system.
* A Server/Client based networking system that utilize both UDP and TCP connections with encrypted packets.
* A login system with SQL database.
* A simple bug reporting system like ""BugSplat"".
* A map editor that exports a custom XML based map to my engine.

&amp;nbsp;

All of these systems are written from the ground up without using any libraries whatsoever, with the exception of MonoGame and C#. I can tell you that I understand every line of code in there.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally that I have my engine ready I planned to start making a 2D procedurally generate dungeon game. Half way through the project my dad told me that he can no longer support me and I had to get a job.

&amp;nbsp;

After few months I got a job in a small company working as web developer. I have been working there for four months and I hate every bit of it. I can't stand web development especially in php.

&amp;nbsp;

So after discovering that the thing I loved the most in game development was the rendering. I decided to learn computer graphics and try apply for an internship or for an entry job level at any of the major game development companies. So in December 2015 decided to move to the big boys club and I started learning OpenGL 4.5.

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to write my own math library and not use something like GLM since I want to learn everything about matrices and vectors and what the hell is a perspective and orthographic projection and how do they work in a matrix.

&amp;nbsp;

So far I know everything about matrix math (I love matrices now). I wrote all my projection, translation, scaling and rotation matrices. I know how to pass them to the vertex shader. I know how the OpenGL pipeline works, I know how to load obj files into my engine. Right now I have a rotating wireframe monkey head in my engine exported from Blender. And now I am studying lighting and how they work in the fragment shader.

&amp;nbsp;

This is all well and good and I am planning on knowing everything there is to know about the basics of computer graphics by the end of this year and then start applying at any major game company.

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr;**
&amp;nbsp;

Here is the problem. I am scared of racism and discrimination in either the US or Europe. I am scared because I am a Syrian national. I was born in Saudi Arabia in 1992 and moved to Oman when I was five. I lived my entire life in Oman. I moved to the United Arab Emirates for college in 2009 and I have been living here ever since. I have never been to Syria in my entire life. To me Syria is only a country that I am associated with because of my passport.

&amp;nbsp;

I am scared of discrimination if I move to the US or Europe. I'm scared I will be walking to my apartment and get shot because of my nationality or and religion. I am scared shitless. 

&amp;nbsp;

If I had the option to join a game development company in UAE or anywhere in the middle east I would. I really would. But the only company in here is Ubisoft and they have no entry level jobs at all. I sent my CV anyways. My only real shot in making games and having a career in game development is to move to somewhere in the US, Europe or Japan.

&amp;nbsp;

And the whole ISIS/war and immigration crisis is not making this any easier for me. I feel like I'm being held back because of my passport and religion. I don't care about religion issues. I don't care about politics. I don't care about the top 10 freaking celebrities.

&amp;nbsp;

I just want to make cool shit. I just want to build games and get paid for it. I don't want any special treatment either. I just want be treated like any normal dude.

&amp;nbsp;

So I don't know where to go from here.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sorry for the long post."
47seet,1,2016-02-26,"[Canada, Ontario] Fear my employer may not pay me for my work",LAThrowaway891,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/47seet/canada_ontario_fear_my_employer_may_not_pay_me/,"So I am currently working on ""contract"" (a term which I am using loosely right now) with my former full-time employer.  I worked full-time for this guy for two years (marketing agency) before I decided to get away and go back to school.  He offered me part-time ""contract work"" while I was in school so he could still get some money out of me.

These contracts are e-mail agreements where I ""commit"" to fulfilling certain ""accountabilities"" until they are ""approved completion"". I get 50% up front, and 50% when things are finished.  Since September, I have delivered on two jobs and gotten paid for both of them.

The reason why I think this one is different is because we are both aware that I will be off doing an internship by the time this job is finished, and there will be no opportunity to do another job later.  So this would be our last interaction.

A little bit of background on this guy; he runs a very small (&lt;5 people, including himself) agency where he works staff into the ground and has not paid various ex-staff members, suppliers, and other ""contractors"" for the work they have done because they haven't met his expectations.  The caveat is that his expectations constantly change.  This man changes his mind, changes it back, forgets his commitments, and refuses to hold himself accountable for anything.  For example, if he makes decision A, changes his mind to decision B, has all of his staff implement decision B, and then realizes that decision A was the right answer...it is everyone's fault and not his because they didn't get it to him in time to review....or something like that.  If you push back or stand up to him even a little bit, his vindictive side comes out and he will go look for ways to add to your plates without solicitation, to make you fail. Then he will tell all about how you are sabotaging his company.  Every day. He deal creeps very easily, lies, and all in all it's a very harrowing experience. Turnover rate is 98%.

Anyways, the job that I have been given is difficult to achieve to true 100% completion because of the nature of its expectations.  To be vague about it, I need to interview over 200 unique people and measure their answers (I've dumbed it down for anonymity, it's very complex). We aren't 100% positive what the true scope size is of the place where these people do business in the first place (ex: could be less than 200. So me not hitting 200 = me not ""fulfilling my accountability""). I am worried I will not get paid because he knows I'm not coming back and won't feel obligated to have to pay me, and because my other boss who got me my rate approved for this job (approx $4K) is quitting and he didn't want to pay me that much because ""My output is not worth that much"" (despite me spending an incredibly significant work effort and time put into this to get as big as a sample as possible).  So if he is controlling my last paycheque and not my other boss, I don't think I'll actually get paid..

Also he is constantly changing and adding to the scope.  When I send him an email saying this will push back the delivery date he ignores it, and then talks to me in person so there's no paper trail.  If I summarize what we agree to verbally in an email and send it, it gets ignored as well.

Moreso, I am worried that we are not actually bound by a ""contract"" (e-mail agreement only, not even from him, from the other boss) and that he will find ways to manufacture through e-mail a story that makes it look like I didn't do what I was supposed to.

So, any advice for me? I think that if I just dropped everything and stopped working for him he could pursue me for breaching our e-mail agreement.  He has sued people for less. He tried to get us to sign an agreement saying he could sue us in the future if we leaked details about another project and cost him money, whether he had any evidence or not...

I am already kicking myself for working with him after I officially quit but hey, here I am.

I am beginning small in my scripts, testing how well it works along the way, but I find I have to go back constantly and add features, which begins turning the script into an unreadable, unholy mess. No one else sees them but me, but they are still embarrassing

So, I'm sure this is a learning hump, but I'm finding my time is spent fixing bugs and cleaning the script more than being productive and that is getting very frustrating. I've done dozens of little script tutorials and exercises, but none really seem to address writing scripts at the scale I'm reaching, and the best way to organize a script and prepare a script for unforseen changes. Is there any good resources on structure in programming, or is this just going to be a situation where I am just going to have to find my own way.

47ssmu,7,2016-02-26,Why are some web development salaries so much lower than other software engineering disciplines?,katzey,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/47ssmu/why_are_some_web_development_salaries_so_much/,"hello everybody :o) 

I am a junior level CS major whose beginning to look at internships, and potentially, a place to begin my career at. I really like web development. I've been developing a project with some pals of mine, utilizing the MEAN stack. this, by far, has been the most challenging task I've ever undertook during my undergraduate career. I fell in love with how challenging it is to utilise a framework stack. I find this so much more difficult than just writing something in C++ or whatever, which is great because I thoroughly enjoy challenging academic tasks.

unfortunately, web development salaries seem like a mess. I see MEAN stack starting level positions making like, $5-10 less money per hour than their OOP/traditional software development counterparts. 

why is this? why does something, which has a much higher barrier of knowledge requirement (to note, a skill set which is not taught in traditional undergrad CS curriculum), pay so much less? 

to add to the mess, an established full stack web developer around here seems to make well over six figures, meanwhile a junior/internship level full stack developer makes SIGNIFICANTLY less. again, this sort of discrepancy isn't as prevalent in traditional software development roles. 

I have a sneaking suspicion a lot of these low ""web developer"" salaries are really just like squarespace/CMS positions where you don't really do much actual programming, but I'm not quite sure.

I just have a lot of conigitive dissonance towards what I want to do in my career vs what I should do in my career. I want to do web development, but I feel like I should pursue other roles because they'll probably be a fraction of the effort for significantly more money. I just don't really get it, and I'm hoping someone can shed some light on this conundrum."

Its not supposed to be fun.  You can even argue that it sucks most of the times.

It didn't take long when I started to study accounting to learn about the long hours.  Ahh those nice 85 hour busy work weeks.

Studying accounting definitely has it perks.  Do well in school, do at least one or two internships and you're sitting pretty for a full time offer.

But.

You're a staff I making around $50k in the northeast.  Working those 85 hour busy weeks.  Hey, at least you got that job right out of graduation right? 

Until you realize that that there are many other jobs paying comparable wages at almost certainly less hours.

Off the top of my head, the average salary for an ""executive team leader"" at Target is $58k.

Of course accounting opens up all kinds of doors.  Doors that lead to becoming partner, or a CFO of a Fortune 500 company.  But the odds aren'r exactly great.  So, my question to you r/accounting, is, are we suckers for the relatively moderate compensation we receive for the long hours we inevitably work compared to other professions?"

It was a very compassionate relationship until the school year started. Something over the summer had changed.


Starting in November of 2014 her best friend confronted her and said that she acts like a child and that's why people leave her (a group of friends had decided to stop hanging out with her a few years before). Then she left  her boyfriend who had basically played on her insecurities to make her feel like he was all she had. When we started dating. I knew that it would be awhile before she was able to be her old self ( I had known her for about 6 months before all of this). We hung every day for about 6 months and then our college courses started back up and we saw less of each other.


I am naturally a very social and active person while she is naturally introverted and likes hanging out with a few people at a time. Eventually she started to be very upset that we never hung out for hours on end like we used to over the summer. I explained we are naturally very busy people and were both about to graduate and were trying to be as successful as possible (I was working 2 jobs and an internship and she was basically working full time at her firm).


Eventually It started to feel like I was holding her up emotionally. Without my presences and distraction she started to feel like her friends were leaving her and that she didn't have anyone, when she would refuse to ask people to hang out because she felt like she was being to needy and pushing them away. She started to cry more about little things ( I didn't want to cuddle while I was sleeping, like when I sleep I don't subconsciously cuddle and she cried about it  asserting that maybe it was a subconscious sign about my true feelings for her)



This slowly dissolved all while I was dealing with a lot of stress. I was taking about a full time load of work while also taking a full class load of difficult senior year classes. It started to feel like my problems weren't being noticed. Eventually our sex life closed off and I was too tired and I believe I started to be emotionally un-attracted to her. I started to go to the bar more after work and have a few with my one remaining constant friend ( hanging out with her for so long I had slowly moved out of the loop of my other friends and they also started to become busy enough that we couldn't hang out with our weird schedules). I gained weight and she started to get upset that I never asked her to come out to the bar and drink.


This last Christmas she went home to visit her family in a different state and I thought this break might be good for us. Instead i got more stressed as she became depressed at home since neither her friends, nor I was there. Eventually I told her that we need to have a talk about our relationship. I told her that she had no self confidence anymore and that she was putting all of her insecurities on to me and I couldn't handle both of our problems. I knew that I was secure in myself but it constantly felt like I needed/she needed me to reaffirm her and what she was doing. I told her that she was no longer the girl I had started a relationship with and I think she needed someone else to talk to besides me.


 She agreed and started seeing a therapist. She also started to stop trying to show affection at every moment of every minute (holding hands at literally every moment, I quite literally cannot stress that enough. Kissing all the time in public and in front of friends when she knew I was uncomfortable with PDA. When she was drunk at the bar she would try to grab my butt or grind into me to the point other people started to feel uncomfortable, myself included). 


After this talk things were good for awhile and our sex life improved and I started to think it would work. Then, our next semester started up. It started with us both finalizing our plans for after college. She accepted a full time position at her firm in town and I had decided that I needed to leave the college town we were in and move to a bigger city where I had applied to several grad schools and had a better chance at a meaningful career. 

With that in mind we both started to finish our final semester. She has gone to only 1 session of therapy ( snow day for one session and forgot about the other) she seems to not push so much problems on to me or me emotionally distraught all the time but we have started to argue more as I have started to be a little more concerned with myself and not as much her as I used to. 


I think i am at the point were I no longer want to be in a relationship with her. I do love her very much but I think we have both moved to different points and there is not much chance for us to stay together forever. I have no plans to come back to live in our college town ever again and I don't think she really wants to leave there to move to where I want to live unless it just to still be with me. I think she might realize we are at this point as well but is in denial about it. I don't really want to break up with her right now because I don't know if she can handle it.

 I know that it is not 100% my problem if she is able to handle it or not but i don't want to ruin her life or anything (maybe fail a class and not graduate? I don't think that would actually happen but none the less I don't need that on my conscience). I honestly do have some good times with her and we can talk and still have good moments over all but I think long term we are different people now and When I move we would just be waiting until we drift apart enough to break it off. We're planning a trip for spring break and I'm honestly excited about it. I think that we need to have a talk about where we are but I don't want to mess up her or my semester. 


Should I wait until we graduate to break up or is this something were I wait until maybe we are both at the point where we realize this is done?  Is there something I can do to maybe save this relationship or is this enough evidence to bring about that we might not work anymore?


TL;DR
My girlfriend was devastated by the fact that 2 people that she cared about left her and she eventually made me into her source of emotionally security. I couldn't handle that, we talked and nothing has changed. Should I just break it off now or should I wait till we graduate so it doesn't mess us up/maybe it gets better? Anything to try to make this relationship work?

47t4mf,2,2016-02-26,Resubmitting an updated resume,floridianreader,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/47t4mf/resubmitting_an_updated_resume/,"This may be a complicated issue; I apologize and will try to keep it simple.

2 years ago I was fresh out of grad school (Social work) with an MSW and only internship experience.  I submitted my less than stellar resume and a cover letter to nearly every agency in a 75 mile radius from my home in city A.  Eventually my husband and I agreed to move out of the area and we moved 100 miles north, to a city I'll just call city B.  I used my same resume and cover letter (amended slightly with new addresses and such) and was almost immediately hired by a home health company.  

I (mostly) loved my home health company which is part of a national chain but there were some local politics going on which I did not like.  Several other social workers quit, causing more work to be shifted onto myself and my dwindling number of colleagues.  My husband had also taken a new job but he did not like it and so we made the joint decision to move back to City A.  Husband got a job immediately.   I am still looking.

While finishing out my 2 weeks' notice at home health company (in city B), I noticed on the company website that they were hiring a social worker with my exact job description back in city A.  I immediately applied, sent a cover letter explaining that I already worked for the company and knew all the ins and outs and proprietary software and such and felt I was a shoo-in .  I did try to call HR in City A and no one returned my call.  I got zero response by email, other than the formulaic ""thanks for applying, we'll contact you if we think you're qualified, etc.""

In a moment of desperation, I asked my supervisor to call the company in city A to speak to someone in HR.  My boss thankfully put the call on speaker so I could listen in.  The HR person there said that they had my resume, but that it showed that I had just graduated school and I had no real experience and I wasn't really a good candidate.  Boss said that wasn't possible, because I had been working for the company, had evals and such.  HR person then said something snippy to the effect of ""let me look again"" and then pulled up something on her computer and said ""well we have a resume from summer 2014 [when I had freshly graduated] and then a resume from fall 2015 [the one I had most recently sent them].""  Boss told her to take a look at the resume from 2015 (duh) and she did, and lo and behold, she said, oh, yeah, it looks like she'd be a good candidate. let me get someone from social work dept to talk to her.""  Etc.   End of that part of the story: there was a job opening that I could have if I wanted (without even an interview), but it was at the farthest most point from my home so I decided to wait and see if another job opened up closer.  

Ok.   So we are living back in City A. I am unemployed now, have been since December.  I found another job opening at a different company doing the same exact thing as at my previous job.  I sent them my resume and such.  Minimum 12 months' experience: I have 15 months of paid experience.  When I logged in, it said that I had applied before and displayed my old resume (the one with the no real experience).  The website asked if I wanted to update my stuff, which of course I did.  I got the perfunctory email from the auto-responder thing.  

I haven't heard anything since.  I know that I'm the perfect candidate (aside from being unemployed).  I suspect the same problem that I had with my previous employer may be at play: where the HR person is seeing my old resume and not really looking for the new resume.  But I don't know.  

How do I get around this problem? I suspect this is probably going to be an issue for just about every agency in this area because I already applied at all of them a year or two ago when I had no paid experience, but now I have experience.  

Of course I also attached a cover letter outlining my experience and why I'm a good fit, but it's just hanging around in cyberspace being ignored.  

Help?!
Thanks

Anyone from the tech industry in Netherlands here? Anyone know of a better resource for speaking with people currently in the tech industry in Netherlands? 

I am active on Stack Overflow Careers (that hasn't seemed to have caught on in Holland, yet), and more active on LinkedIn. 

I have a 4 year university degree in Computer Science, over a year experience in internship and my current position (am not planning on moving for at least another year or two).

I am adaptable, a fast learner, critical thinker and love everything about the software development life cycle...

47tcl6,6,2016-02-26,WWYD: 1st time negotiating salary...,FiveDelta,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/47tcl6/wwyd_1st_time_negotiating_salary/,"Hey /R/Sales, hoping to get any thoughts/ feedback/ advice on this dilemma...What would you do if you were negotiating a salary under these circumstances?

Quick hits:

- 23 years old. Still doing undergrad but work F/T

- Inside Sales role (but truly an SDR -- I book appointments) 

- 1.5 years at current company

- 2.5 years in the industry/ space

- Working in Boston. Tech Co selling clinical trial SaaS

- 45K Base. $100 per meeting booked. 005% of closed deals

- Made 57K last year. About 9K for meetings and 3K for closed

The story:
So I've been working full-time for about 3 years, finishing up my undergraduate degree part-time. I go to a state school so it is dirt cheap, and I believe the work experience is better for me because I won't have access to awesome university alums or resources...anyways I get lucky. Really lucky. I get an internship at a startup company in life science software as an inside sales rep. It turns into an F/T. I learn the space, and about a year later I get poached by Company A, which is in a specific life science software space. 

This last year I worked at Company A with a team of 4 sale reps selling very high-value SaaS. They felt like they needed an inside sales person to help build out the pipeline, so they hired me at 45K base, with $100 per meeting and half a percent of any new orders. With no list/ clean CRM/ structure, I was able to book 92 meetings and have 2 deals closed for a total of ~800K. My boss at Company A loves the work I do, and we talk at the end of the year about a raise. Ask for 65K (don't face palm yet-- I have reasons!) 1% off orders, and a $100 per meeting. He verbally says, to my surprise, that he should be able to make that work. I am happy to hear this, as year one comes to a close.

During last year, Company B comes into play by purchasing Company A and so all the business units are going through reorganizations. We merge sales teams between Company A &amp; B at the beginning o this year... We also hire a new Director of Sales and a Director of Sale Operations.  We now have one Director of Sales overseeing 8 outside sales reps (one of which is my old boss/ Head of Sales at Company A) and the Director of Sales Operations is overseeing me and is building out the inside sales team (with another new hire) and we are expecting 2 sales engineers shortly).

I ask my old boss to communicate with the Director of Sales Operations about my compensation, and I learn it is no longer up to him because of the reorg...I and met with a new plan entirely. They offer 3% base pay, no amount for meetings booked, but 1% on orders...I can't sign the updated comp plan, I ask for a weekend to mule it over. This is the weekend.

Now I imagine some of you  folks are asking ""Why the high raise?"" and here are the reasons I was able to muster up:

-Year 2 inside sales reps in Boston average a 50/50 split for an OTE of 90-120K. Good tech talent around these parts is valued.

- The cost of living in Boston is higher, around 20-30% from my research.

- The company is doing very well, surpassing goals and we even started to pay each outside rep 125K, with OTE for 300K on average, at the beginning of this year when we merged.

- Not only am I supporting (3) more products, but one of my reps is solely focused on a specific market, therefore the messaging is very different.

- I processed mapped out so much of my work, email &amp; call templates, help to market with list building, etc...hell my new boss is using a lot of my stuff, and I don't think I am getting the credit. But the point has I put the work to go above and beyond in. And you bet your Glengarry Glen Ross poster that I do most of this misc.  stuff after hours by staying late.

- I'm also helping to get the new inside sales guy up to speed, and as he and my boss work in the Philadelphia office, it is not that easy. I was there this week and I was frightened to see how lazy/ laid back she seemed at times. 2 months on the job and not 1 list given to inside sales to call yet. Alas, now I ramble.

/r/Sales -- please help me! What do I do? What would you do?   I'm motivated to earn as much as I can for my elderly parents, so this is a really big deal for me at this point in my life. I'm buckling down, staying in this weekend to research as much as possible...Any questions? Want more context? Just ask! I am an open book for the next 48 hours. "

47ties,4,2016-02-27,Exactly 3 months and 1 day since the breakup. And I’m feeling pretty darn good.,mutedgalaxies,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/47ties/exactly_3_months_and_1_day_since_the_breakup_and/,"It’s been a while since I’ve last posted, but I thought I’d update everyone about what’s happened recently, and hopefully my story inspires someone.

Long story short, it’s been 3 months since our initial break up; longer than the amount of time we were even together. I got attached too soon to a guy who just wasn’t emotionally ready to be in another relationship. The 3 months since the break up was muddled with limited contact, hints of reconciliation, “breaking up” a second time, and overall anxiety. I was a mess.

Three weeks ago, I had to see my ex for a work-related event. I wrote about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/44ozl2/saw_him_today_for_the_first_time_in_over_a_month/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link). Up until that event, I was just a complete mess but in the end, nothing happened and it pretty much sealed the deal that we weren’t getting back together. It got rid of that final bit of hope for reconciliation that I was lingering onto, but it also caused a whole new wave of feelings and having to accept what had happened.

Then a week later, I had a bit of a scare. I thought I saw my ex on campus, and assuming it was him, I saw him visibly avoid me as we walked towards each other. This caused a whole slew of anger and confusion: I thought to myself, just one week ago, we were able to talk casually as friends, and here he is avoiding me! Fueled by this anger, I finally gained the courage to unfollow him on social media. I was tired of having to go out of my way to avoid seeing his posts and tired of cheating NC by peeking on his page. After talking about it with a friend, she suggested that it might not have even been my ex; with him being on my mind so often, it was entirely possible that I saw someone very similar and in my haste, I just assumed it was him. Regardless of whether it was him or not, I’m glad it happened this way, because I was finally letting myself move on.

Here’s the good news: In the last couple of weeks, I’ve been seeing a counselor on campus to talk about my relationship-induced anxiety. I’ve only been to a few sessions so far, but just having a fresh set of ears to hear my story helped a lot. Plus, having to retell what your ex did to you is a great reminder of all the shitty things he’s done and why you shouldn’t want to take him back. My counselor gave me a lot of insight on why I was struggling to move on and cleared up a lot of the things I was having trouble understanding about our relationship.

In between sessions, I’ve been focusing more on school. It’s internship season, and I’ve been frantically applying to as many summer internships as I can and gathering pieces for my portfolio. It’s stressful and I feel like I’m going insane, but hey: school-related anxiety is better than relationship-anxiety, in my opinion. And my hard work has been paying off! Today, I managed to snag an interview with my dream internship company. It was a preliminary interview; more like a portfolio review to give you some feedback before you officially apply, than a real interview. I came out of it feeling kind of neutral, but just the fact that I managed to get one and got myself in the running gave me a good high!

In other recent happenings, I managed to get myself a date for Monday! It was out of nowhere, but he was one of my classmates from 3 years ago. We haven’t talked since that class, but he reached out and asked to catch up over lunch. I don’t know if anything will come out of this date; I’d like to take things slow, but regardless, I’m really excited! Also nervous, because I don’t have a lot of dating experience, but excited!

As an ending note: I can’t say that I’m 100% over my ex. I don’t think that’s even possible for me; I just have a lot of feelings and all I hope for is everyone’s happiness, no matter how much they have wronged me. But I know I’m so so close. Since unfollowing him, I have not cheated my NC by checking his social media. The thought of my ex doesn’t dominate my entire day anymore. Any time I get a blip of sadness, they usually pass over within hours or sometimes even minutes.

A few days ago, I actually did run into my ex on campus. And this time, it really was him. We made eye contact, smiled, waved to each other, and walked off in our separate directions. I was with a friend at the time and I had no interest in stopping to say hello. Aside from the slight heart attack I had when realizing, “oh shit, it really IS him,” I recovered fairly quickly. So I know that’s a good sign.

Anyway, so sorry for the huge essay. I tend to let myself go when talking about feelings. But for anyone who has decided to stick around to read the whole thing, and to anyone who has given me advice the last couple of months, thank you so so much. I am so grateful for this sub, and I’m so glad I found this community when I was going though rough times."
47toni,151,2016-02-27,I Didn't Ask You to Talk to me,PennyoftheNerds,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/47toni/i_didnt_ask_you_to_talk_to_me/,"Hi everyone. I'm back to tell you more stories, as promised. Just to recap, I own a small business, wherein I have my own booth at events and sell my items retail that way. My business is pet related, and I carry a mix of resell items and items that I hand make myself. With years of brick and mortar retail experience under my belt, I've learned that events tend to bring in a different kind of crazy than regular retail stores. It's also helpful to know that I am a female in my thirties, but look much younger, which doesn't help when the crazy starts.

I already posted tonight, but this is a short story I remembered while posting the last one. To quickly explain something, I have some medical issues and can't work a normal job, so my doctors let me have this business, because it allows me to take breaks and lay down when I need to. If I can't make a show, my business partner goes for me. If I can't handle a show myself, she goes with me. She's not technically my business partner - just someone nice enough to fill in for me when I'm physically unable to do something - but I feel mean saying, ""This is my unpaid intern."" Yes, folks, she does it from the bottom of her heart to help me out. I buy her lunch and give her free stuff, but I still don't feel like that counts. She refuses money when I try to pay her, though. 

I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to ask someone to leave my booth. I can tolerate a lot, but there's two things I won't tolerate - theft and someone being rude to my business partner or anyone else who is helping me. If you're rude to me, I can handle it. If you're rude to someone else, I'm happy to show you the door.

Last fall, my business partner and I were at a multi-day community event. It was raining on and off, it was cold, we were outside, barely anyone was there, and no one was making money. Even though we had a tent, the dampness was palpable. If it were up to me, we would have packed up the tent, tables and items and went home, but our car was clear on the other side of the park and we weren't allowed to bring it over to pack up. We couldn't close early, because the event was still open and people will sometimes try to go inside of your tent after you leave, even though you closed it up. We were stuck and miserable, but everyone was super polite. 

Then these two older ladies came along. Because of the weather, I was hurting something awful, so my business partner let me stay seated and got up to deal with them. She walks up to greet them and begins to tell the women about our bandanas going over the collar, our ties having interfacing in them and our bows being hand sewn and machine washable - things that are important to know if you're buying from us. The whole spiel takes ten seconds. The one woman turns and looks at her as if my business partner is a peasant and she is Queen of the festival, and says the following: 

&gt; ""Just shut up. I didn't ask you to talk to me. It's not like I would buy any of this stuff anyway. A friend of mine bought something like this at another festival. I was just checking to see if yours was as nice as theirs, and it just started raining again and we don't want to stand in the rain. I don't need you flapping your mouth at me while I'm trying to look around. It's annoying. Just leave me alone.""

And then the two women giggled. THEY GIGGLED! They were easily in their 70's - old enough to know better. I like sassy old ladies, but I do not tolerate rude, no matter how old you are. 

I have never, ever seen my business partner cry. This woman is like rock. She usually has a sassy comeback and shakes it off. This time, she was so exhausted and cold that it got to to her. She turns around, looks at me with tears in her eyes and says:

&gt; ""Oh my gosh, what did I do?"" 

I took a minute and took a deep breathe, trying to figure out how to handle this without causing a scene. Another set of customers had entered the tent - a young couple. They were oohing and aahing over everything and trying to look around, but the women had parked themselves in the middle of the tent and were bad mouthing my business partner and how rude she was to have tried to talk to them. Apparently greeting someone and telling them about the product you think they came in to look at is rude. Once I composed myself, I approached them. 

&gt; ""Hi ladies. I'm sorry, but we aren't a free shelter from the rain. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Customers are trying to look and you're standing in their way."" 

&gt; Rude Lady: ""It's raining out there. I'm not going out in that. I don't have an umbrella."" 

&gt; Me: ""I guess you should have thought of that before you decided to disrespect my business partner by telling her to shut up, and then continuing to berate her. Out you go."" 

And then I walked toward them and literally shooed them out by waving my arms toward them and walking forward. Was I a little bit rude? Yes, I was and I will admit it. I was trying my hardest not say anything to them, but when they decided to park themselves in the middle of the tent, block other customers from being able to freely look, and continue to talk about my business partner, I was done putting up with it. They made it clear they weren't a customer and weren't ever going to be, and I wasn't about to allow them to make a wonderful person feel like crap just because they felt as if they were better than us. Did they have more money than us? They probably did. Does that give them the right to talk to my partner like that? Absolutely not. 

Luckily the other customers had heard them bad mouthing someone back and forth, as they made no attempt to hide it. When I spoke up to remove them and they realized it was my business partner the ladies were bad mouthing, the couple was very understanding and wasn't offended, nor did they think I was a rude business owner for asking them to leave. And they actually wanted to hear what my business partner had to say about my items, and then they bought something. For every bad customer, there are five good ones. "

The only problem I still have in my daily life is my brain damage.

The brain damage broke some features that a normal person should have, I used to have language difficulties (Sometimes I still have speech difficulties, but most of it is worked on and I'm actually good at learning languages). I still have bad motor skills (I have the handwriting of a four year old, but I can type and spell good), I still have some social-emotional problems (I might get sad or depressed often and I don't undertake things because I think it would fail nonetheless), I forget things, I don't think as quickly as a normal person would (I'm a good learner if given the time though) and difficulty planning and organizing.

My school life are a lot of close shaves indeed. I got kicked out of my first Elementary and High school (Dutch school system, we don't really have something what you would call middle school (We call high school middle school)) due to difficulties of my brain damage (And teachers labelling me as autistic). Now in college, I have to study for my degree in computer science and I'm doing my best, I say it's going well, but there's an inevitability that I would forget something that would cost me in the long run.

Apart from school, life is going 50/50. I do have a mother who loves me and fights for me (Although I think she can get angry easily) and I have a loving girlfriend (She knows about the brain damage and accepts it). On the other side, I have no steady income (Probably won't have until I get my degree.) and I have problems maintaining friends.

The steady income thing, I don't really know how to live with it. I can't get a job cause I'm not good with my hands due to overmobility in my joints (I have worked in a supermarket in the summer of 2014 though, I loved that job, it gave me a sense of accomplishment). I will have bills to pay, my internship didn't draw a dime and some day I will have to stop relying on my parents for money. Comparing this to my girlfriend and I get pretty jealous of her. (She has an paid internship) This brings me to tears (Already tearing up a little as I speak) and if I want to afford nice things, I'd either have to find very hard for a job and/or study further for years (Costing money in the long run). This is rather frustrating as I already have low motivation to begin with. Sometimes summarizing my frustration as ""I'd rather wrestle!"" (I'm a big pro wrestling fan since I was 11)

I'm an undergraduate student currently studying Cognitive Science w/ a specialization in Human Computer Interaction.

Is there any advice any of you who are working in the industry could give me about landing my first web development internship. What kinds of things are your companies looking for in potential interns etc.

The only problem I still have in my daily life is my brain damage.

The brain damage broke some features that a normal person should have, I used to have language difficulties (Sometimes I still have speech difficulties, but most of it is worked on and I'm actually good at learning languages). I still have bad motor skills (I have the handwriting of a four year old, but I can type and spell good), I still have some social-emotional problems (I might get sad or depressed often and I don't undertake things because I think it would fail nonetheless), I forget things, I don't think as quickly as a normal person would (I'm a good learner if given the time though) and difficulty planning and organizing.

My school life are a lot of close shaves indeed. I got kicked out of my first Elementary and High school (Dutch school system, we don't really have something what you would call middle school (We call high school middle school)) due to difficulties of my brain damage (And teachers labelling me as autistic). Now in college, I have to study for my degree in computer science and I'm doing my best, I say it's going well, but there's an inevitability that I would forget something that would cost me in the long run.

Apart from school, life is going 50/50. I do have a mother who loves me and fights for me (Although I think she can get angry easily) and I have a loving girlfriend (She knows about the brain damage and accepts it). On the other side, I have no steady income (Probably won't have until I get my degree.) and I have problems maintaining friends.

The steady income thing, I don't really know how to live with it. I can't get a job cause I'm not good with my hands due to overmobility in my joints (I have worked in a supermarket in the summer of 2014 though, I loved that job, it gave me a sense of accomplishment). I will have bills to pay, my internship didn't draw a dime and some day I will have to stop relying on my parents for money. Comparing this to my girlfriend and I get pretty jealous of her. (She has an paid internship) This brings me to tears (Already tearing up a little as I speak) and if I want to afford nice things, I'd either have to find very hard for a job and/or study further for years (Costing money in the long run). This is rather frustrating as I already have low motivation to begin with. Sometimes summarizing my frustration as ""I'd rather wrestle!"" (I'm a big pro wrestling fan since I was 11)

So, unless taking time and even more money to study further, I don't know how to really have income to buy nice things for me and eventually my girlfriend. This concerns me for at least a few months, and I'm becoming rather desperate for help (As much I hate to admit).

TL;DR: I've had a stroke at birth, damaging my brain and staggering my performance since I was born. Although I'm a good learner, I can't seem to find a job or any source of income for any nice things and I'm becoming rather frustrated."

- **[M4F]** ***A Human in the Court of Spirits***: 

How had it come to this? Shinsou stood in his normal form, totally bare to the High Tenkou Judges, each one individually stronger than a Lord like himself. His vague outline of a shadow burned with intense white eyes on a cloud of black and dark, angry purple, my silhouette seeming to pull light into itself as my tentacles danced upward from the mist that obscured anything below my waist.

But even my primal form of shadow paled in comparison to my Judges. Each owning an equal section of the spirit world, their Romans radiating outward from the High Chambers, splitting the spirit world into wedges. They had ruled for millennia, resolute, silent, feared.

Until today. The Judge of the Red Domain, Hope, The Virgin of A Thousand Dreams, looked down on him as though he was lower than a worm. She looked like a normal, Japanese woman in a kimono, excepting for a small series of origami fish that flew around her at all times, their small lifelike bodies attached directly to her heart with a silken red ribbon. A small, flat halo of silvery metal floated above a furrowed and angry brow.

""Lord Shinsou of the Black, Purveyor of the Shadows, Keeper of the Dark, you stand accused of Treason in the Highest. For bringing a mortal into these realms with intent to use her soul toward the subjugation of a High Judge. How do you plead?"" His gaze never wavered from hers, smoke of his mist curling upward slowly, the blackness somehow not taking away from the vaulted white marble done that they were under.

He took his time, looking slowly around and making eye contact with each Judge individually. They were seated around the outside of the dome, each facing inward from their respective domains under the light of the purest marble. Several lines separated each domain, wedges extending outward from the very point that he was standing on in the middle of the room.

Red, Green, Blue, White, and Black, each High Judge perched on marble thrones, gazing inward at him, instead of outward toward their domains. The Black Judge, Death, The Shepard of Secrets, my commander and father, looked disapprovingly from under his triangle face, knotted cords of decaying muscle flexing in anger, his rage leaving a palpable oppression on the room.

The Blue Judge, Life, The Wellspring of All who Rest flowed silently over his throne, waters splashing, but never making a sound as the pale blue orb of his essence never wavered from it's spot. His water ran down, but never seemed to go anywhere, the fluid simply vanishing before it overflowed into the room.

The Green Judge, Strength, The Rock of Eternal Fortitude floated silently as well, magma dripping to the floor with sizzling hisses as they touched the ground around him. He needed no throne, instead he floated above a small marble pedestal. Pebbles and rocks moved across the surface of his form, silent as well.

The White Judge, Knowledge, The Seer of All to Pass had his words flowing through his floating circle at the speed of light. Unknown symbols sped through his halo, teasing whomever viewed him with endless understanding. But with all knowledge, you had to study him to understand him. The white scarves that were tied to his ethereal form flowed around the wrists of a pallid young woman who simply looked downward toward the floor, her presence simply to keep Knowledge material in this realm.

Shinsou's eyes finally drifted downward, to the young woman who started all of this. It had been so long now that they had traveled together that she was part of him, part of his essence. He had been so wrong about so many things before seeing her, before talking to her, before being with her. His heart ached as he saw her prostrated in front of the Court, her fate deserved of so much more than what he had provided. He had to set things right, he had to make sure that after all of this was over, she was safe.

For the first time in as long as he could remember, he felt someone else there with him. She loved him beyond what he deserved. With one last look at her, he turned back to the Red Judge, eyes meeting her own rage with a peace that he didn't understand. He pulled the memory of the first time he'd met that young woman, fated forever to be entwined from their first gaze....

""I plead Guilty, Judge."" 

(This is the ending for us, but lets start from the beginning, shall we? I have pictures for all of the spirit judges, but we will encounter many people and spirits in our travels :&gt;)

- **[M/Futa4F/Futa]** ***Interplanetary Wrasslin' Federation!***: Want to suplex a planet? Put a God into an ArmBar? Sexualize every aspect of a pretty sexualized sport? Then, this is the prompt for you. In the near future, most conflic between the Galactic Federation is decided by a Pin and a count to three. Wrestlers from all over the galaxy fight for fortune, fame, and politics. But sexual moves are not only allowed, they are encourage. First to cum or get pinned loses! Let's get stupid and campy in this. I want to have fun coming up with ridiculous situations, worse outfits, and terrible bad guys with a tag team partner! This can be regular genders, or futas, i'm not too picky here. But let's bash some skulls and fight off an alien invasion that happens to follow out galactic wrestling's rules!

- **[M/Futa4F/T/Futa]** ***Crime in the Futa City*** Danger was written all over that pretty face, like the makeup that barely shined in the dim light of my agency. Her legs might have gone up to her chin if a gorgeous body didn't decide to stake it's claim on the world. Long locks like fell like my heart when I realized that she wasn't here for me, but for her husband. Lost to the streets of this city, and she wanted me to find him. Well, you couldn't win them all, but promises fell out of my mouth. Promises that I wasn't sure I'd be able to keep. Between the Brothels of Main street, the Sex-Queens that ran the crime and Racketeering in the city, and our corrupt government that would take a blow Job to lock someone up for life, I wasn't sure I'd even be able to make a difference. But your eyes, those beautiful baby blues, so filled with hope that all i could do was say yes and watch you walk out the door. I needed a drink to sort this case out.... I'd love to play a detective (Futa or Male) in a hyper-sexualized 1950's world of crime and noir. Maybe you are my partner or an intern, dedicated to watching my shapely backside to keep it intact for later. Maybe you are the client, pushing for me to solve the case. Futa and Male/Female live side by side, and sexual favors are traded like currency. I'd love an imaginative partner who love campy tropes to play with me and help me develop this world of mystery and sex.

- **[M4F]** ***Under the Veil***: There was a Vicky's Secret commercial a few years back, showing a gorgeous middle eastern woman dressing in a sexy black set of lingerie, complete with stockings and makeup before pulling on a Burqua and walking out with a saucy wink. That stayed with me for a long time as a kid. I'd love to have some sort of play with any woman that would wear a burqua, and start exploring a totally unknown lover who covers herself, but loved the feeling of silk on her skin. Maybe you are a co-worker and you want to show me exactly how much you appreciate my help the other day in the storage closet. Maybe we meet in a bar, and i'm the first guy to actually talk to you instead of insult your religion. Whatever we decide, I want it to be a slow burn. A little leg here in the office. A finger fuck in the backroom, where it's just my hand exploring you, without me being able to see. Let me undress you with my mind many times before you actually show me.

- **[M4F]** ***The Only One For You***: Gorgeous, stunning, enchanting, all words used to describe you. Your grace and beauty never fails to bring in the men, who walk all over each other to get just a glance from you. But you never care, you pick whomever fits your fancy, wink at them, and they are yours (Magically or otherwise). Except for me. I say no and go home. Whether it's because I have a wife and family or I just don't find you attractive. Whatever the reason, you are insulted and angry beyond words. No one says no. No one disregards you so blatantly. You tell your driver to follow me home and wait, plotting. You are going to show me exactly what I passed up, why you are to always get what you want. Crazy? Stalker? Never. Those words describe ugly people. You are Aphrodite incarnate, and you have been scorned.

- **[M4F/Futa/T]** ***Man's Best Friend***: My pacing back and forth would probably have worn a hole into the rug I was walking on. Today was the day, today, I helped someone acclimate to the new world of Humans. It's been a rough trip, the government wanted to make sure **everything** was on the up and up, including blood tests and personality tests (Did you know polygraphs now included a very uncomfortable probe?). But the Relocation Initiative was going to help all those effected by the Change to adapt to their new world. Ever since the sky ripped open and monsters started to appear everywhere, no one knew what to do. But it turns out that those monsters were just as scared as us. Eventually, we bridged the language gap with technology, and learned that they had been displaced from their own timeline, a slightly medieval time like something out of a manga. But they couldn't adapt by themselves, and since the rift sealed, no one knows what to do with them. Thankfully, someone suggested a foster program where you could 'Adopt' a Monster, providing them home and cultural/technological adaptation. And MINE WAS ALMOST HERE!! What would I find on the other side of that door? I'm looking for a long term RP with this one, no sooooo much focused on sex, but that will definitely be a fun part of it. Monsters of all kinds are welcome, furries, aliens even, and Futa are welcome in this prompt. We could even switch it up and have a Monsterboy visit you! Or a Futa ;&gt; We could even do a harem, with both of us coming up with new additions to the house!

- **[M4F/Futa]** ***Homecuming***: ""Hey mom!"" I called out, setting my bad down next to the doorway as I walked inside the old, familiar house. College had such a different smell, one of stress, release, sex, work... But home. It was always calming, the smell of cooking and warmth. It was nice to be home. I called out again with no response, and decided to check out the rooms upstairs, just in case you were napping or distracted with work on your computer. I know you worked from home, so you could just be on a call. But as I walk up the stairs, the sounds I hear are not any of these things. I hear sliding, I hear slapping and moaning. And instantly I am warped back to my teenage years, sneaking up to your door to listen, my heart beating out of my chest. You left the door wide open this time, my time at college leaving you with a sense of privacy. Or at least distance. It was true that since I saw you that first time and heard your lust soaked voice moan my name, I started teasing you. I would wear just boxers around, early morning wood poking out, and me seemingly unaware of my partial nudity. I would walk from the bathroom nude, right desire your wide open door. I'd fall asleep on the couch with my dick out and listen to your panting and moaning as your tried to hide your orgasm on the chair next to me. And tonight, your legs wide open, a vibrator shoved up your perfect pussy and your cock throbbing as you looked at your cellphone. Undoubtedly, you were looking at that pic i ""accidentally"" sent you that I asked you to delete, the one with cum on my chest for my ""girlfriend"". I slowly undress and enter your room, cock already free and throbbing. Tonight, you'd finally get what you wanted. I have all week off and for this week, I'll fulfill all your fantasies about me.

--------------

If there is anything I didn't cover, I'd love to talk to you about it! Talk to me about Demons fucking Nuns, Talk to me about Post-Apocalypse Sex and Survival, Talk to me about Prehistoric dinosaur fucking, talk to me about Werewolves hunting a mercenary group called the ""Riding Hoods"" and their Leader, Red, talk to me about Furry races and high fantasy combined.... give me anything, and I will work with you on it. 

I ***guarantee*** that I will answer every message I get.

And as for anything else, just ask. I am a fountain of creative energy, ready to explore the worlds that you want to fulfill. I am a GM, a storyteller, and a dirty minded writer who loves to turn people on. Hopefully, I'll see you at the checkout counter."

I am no superstar and find a lot of subjects demanding but I am coping. I have a few questions regarding mostly UK because it should get more love here, especially for new grad prospects in current tech market.

My issue is that I applied for around 20 companies, starting in late November for software engineering internships. Almost all banks rejected me without interview which cut down on number of internships available in UK. I now have three leads and will go to interviews but in case I fail to obtain internship, what can I do? Build projects over summer and start applying early for graduate roles?

I spoke with a recent graduate in CS who found work successfully without internships and he told me to do market research, i.e. what is in demand in combination with choosing what interests you and delve deeper into that.

Regarding application for graduate roles, I am interested in trying out embedded software path, data science or something more sophisticated because I want to get into the field of IT that is more in demand and has higher barrier of entry, mostly to reduce competition. For embedded, my plan is to go on and do EdX course on embedded systems and learn C/C++. However, at the same time that would make me too specialized and there are a lot fewer embedded software companies(ARM, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel?) and most are highly competitive. I am thinking of a fallback plan of learning something like C#/Java, i.e. build a project and apply to more generic companies like banks(Morgan Stanley, JP, some hedge funds etc).

So, I want to be madly prepared for technical interviews(Leetcode etc.) and have some projects in both embedded software and somewhat more generic apps to show off.

I am pretty happy with embedded project prospect(welcome ideas anyways) but would like to know what project would be something in C#/Java realm and would take at most 2-3 months to complete but still show my skills."

Has anyone had any luck transferring the scholarships between semesters? And if so, who should I be contacting?"
47vxlc,19,2016-02-27,Where to get a cheap bike for cross country travel and how to prepare?,Khayembii,motorcycles,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/47vxlc/where_to_get_a_cheap_bike_for_cross_country/,"I've taken a basic rider course and gotten my motorcycle license, but that was a couple years ago.  I'm a student and have a one month break between the end of my semester and my summer internship and I'd like to take that time to ride across the country.

My plan was to take a level 2 basic rider course to get back up to speed on riding, and then I hope that'll make me street ready so I can practice between now and May and be ready by the time my semester is over.

I don't have a bike at this point and I'm not looking to spend a ton of money, so I'm worried about that.  How can I find a bike that is cheap and rideable for longer distance travel like that?  I'm not sure if I'm going to keep the bike after the trip either, but if I do it'll likely be used mostly for city travel and maybe to travel upstate a bit (I live in Manhattan).

I don't need a huge or fancy bike, just something cheap that'll work that won't hurt too much to ride for long distances.  Any recommendations on how to get over this hurdle?  An extra plus if it's easy to work on.

Aside from the rider course and practicing by riding it around the city, I was also probably going to take it out of the city and maybe upstate over the weekends.  Any other ways I can get ready for something like this by May?"
47xgsy,1,2016-02-27,"I felt fine, and now I don't.",fuckfuckfuck128934,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/47xgsy/i_felt_fine_and_now_i_dont/,"So, my battle with depression started long ago when something really shit happened.  That was when I was 12.

I went to college and that was the first time I had ever told anyone about my depression.  I told my boyfriend and he told me to contact the school's counseling department.  So I called and turns out I was really sad because they set up an appointment for 20 minutes from then.
I went and told the guy about 5 different ways I have thought and planned on killing myself.  I told him I felt fine and I honestly did.  He asked me how often I thought about killing myself ""every day"" I said. ""How many times a day?"" ""I don't know, a few hours, sometimes all day?"" ""How do you feel about that?""  ""Fine.""

Anyway, they sent me to outpatient care but I didn't go because I didn't like my group.  So I made an appointment with a therapist who I liked and she is still my therapist.  
At this point in time, it was my freshman year of college, and I didn't want to take any medicine because I didn't want to not drink, or have headaches or any of the other side effects that you can get from antidepressants.  So, I continued to go to therapy with this lady and it was OK.
I did well in school and ended up scoring an internship in Europe starting in July (yay girls in engineering).  So what did I do?  I went to Europe and traveled from May to July first.  I visited Italy, Germany, Austria, Spain, France, Scotland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Poland, and Lithuania. I lived for about 25 euros a day, travelling by carpooling (that I found via facebook), and living by couchsurfing and sometimes hostels if I couldn't find a couch.  I was living the life.  And the ENTIRE TIME I WANTED TO DIE.  It sucked. I was having this amazing life experience that people only dream of and it was ruined because every time I went to the top of a building to see a view I couldn't help but want to jump off.  At one point a guy tried to mug me and pointed his knife at me and I literally laughed and walked away. Wtf?

Anyway, my internship starts.  It's in Lithuania.  I speak fluent Lithuanian so it's cool to be back in the motherland without my parents.  But I hate it.  It is awful.  Who would've thought that graphene research is really fucking boring.  And confusing.  I was waaayyy too stupid for that shit and they were trying to teach me how to use all the equipment and what everything did and I understood NOTHING.  I spent hours and hours researching and trying to understand and I just couldn't.  I hated it.

After two weeks I wanted to kill myself.  Not the way I used to.  Like I reaaalllyyy wanted to kill myself.  I wanted to die so hard.  I had an apartment that they gave me for the internship on the eighth floor.  I sat at the balcony for about 5 minutes and then somebody who I knew came out for a smoke and started talking to me.  I couldn't do this.  Not today.  I called my mom via skype and I cried and cried and cried and I told her how badly I wanted to kill myself.  She wanted me to talk to my grandparents or something but I hate them they're horrible people.  So I tell her I'm not willing to leave my room until I know I'm going home.  She changes my flight to leave the next day.  I tell the people I was working with that my aunt died.
I come home and I feel better.  I see my boyfriend and all of my other friends and it's nice.  At this point I decide I should start taking an antidepressant.  

So sophomore year starts.  I am fine. I see my therapist a few times a week and tell her I want to see a psychiatrist.  So she signs me up for an appointment in October.  The appointment comes.  She asks me the usual questions ""How many times a week do you think of killing yourself? Do you have a plan? How long do you think of killing yourself on average?""  Anyway, last time I did this I just told the truth, and at this point I'm pretty used to telling the truth.  So I say ""Oh, well this morning I thought of slitting my throat.  The thought lasted about an hour just as I was going to class, it was pretty much away by the time I was in class.  I feel fine, I felt fine this morning.""  And she gets very worried.  She tells me I need to speak to another psychiatrist so that they can see if I need out-patient care.  So I leave, see another psychiatrist.  Anyway I answered all the questions and stuff and in the end he decides that I need in-patient care.  I tried really hard to show I didn't need it.  I smiled, told jokes, said I have lots of support the whole nine yards because honestly I FELT FINE. 

Anyway, I'm in the hospital and my family finds out they end up telling my roommates and I am flooded with support.  Everyone loves me, everyone wants me to get better, and everyone wanted to hear stories about the psychiatric ward (""anyone fling shit at you?? hahahaha"").  Nothing like that happened it was actually really sad.  I kept on feeling fine.  I kept making jokes.  I kept smiling.  I told everyone if I heard anything about a lobotomy I'd run.  Jokes. Laughing.

I leave and everyone is happy I'm out, tells me that they're always there if I need to talk.  Nothing bad happens.  I change drugs because they were making me gain weight and I told my psychiatrist that being the fattest I've ever been was really hurting my self esteem and that's about it.  Drugs changed. But then finals come around.  I get really stressed, bang my head against the wall a few times and call this girl who tried to kill herself in high school who I was kind of friends with and talked to her because she does a lot of activist work for people with depression.  She tells me I should call my therapist.  I do. No answer.  Wait! All of my friends said they would always support me.  So I tell my closest friend that I'm feeling really bad and banged my head against the wall and that finals are just really hard.  She seemed to understand.  At the time I didn't know that this is where I fucked up because she was really freaked out.

I went home and she told all of my other roommates and called the cops on me because she thought I was going to kill myself.  Obviously I wasn't I felt fine.  Then I went home and they told me that they didn't feel comfortable living with me next semester.  Now i felt really not fine.  I felt horrible.  It was the worst I had ever  felt in my life.  These people were the only people outside of family that knew I went to the hospital.  These people said they would always be there to support me.  But no, I was wrong about these people.  They wouldn't support me when it wasn't convenient for them.

I freaked out.  I screamed, I cried, I told one of them to kill herself I wanted her to die I really did I was blind with rage and that is all I remember literally not being able to see.  That was when I was not fine.  They called the cops on me again.  They kicked me out of my university housing because ""one of them saw me bang my head against the wall on November 28th"" and even now I am so angry writing this I can't even think it was so awful these people were kicking me out because ""I don't want you to kill yourself in your room while I'm not there"" like BITCH PLEASE I WOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL AGAIN WAY BEFORE I EVEN FELT LIKE TRYING TO KILL MYSELF.  I was so angry.  I ruined our friendship by reacting the way I did.  By not being able to control myself.  By letting every bit of anger and sadness and hatred that I had built up for 7 years out in the span of around 40 hours.  My friends still won't talk to me.  They're still mad that I told one of them to kill herself (I get it but at the time I wanted to show that just because something is telling you to kill yourself doesn't mean you're going to)

Anyway, I move in with strangers.  They're nice.  I joined a club.  I'm really bad at the sport it is (I'm the worst on the team) but everyone is really nice and always invites me to team dinners and reminds me about practices even though everyone knows I'm terrible.  But I get so anxious going to these team dinners.  I showed up to the door of one of their houses yesterday (after TWO people told me they'd really like to see me there) and instead of knocking turned right around and went home.  I can barely talk to my housemates because I don't want them to kick me out.  I have never experienced this kind of social anxiety before.  And I want to die more than ever.  At least I'm crying often I think that's a step up from not being able to cry? I'm sorry I needed to vent I need someone or something I'm so lonely.  The only person I hang out with is my boyfriend because he is the only person who has stood by me time and time again.  And I hate being one of those girls who only hangs out with her boyfriend and I hate being in college and last semester I had a .9 GPA and if I fail a single class this semester I get kicked out of school and I don't even know if I care anymore. 

TLDR; I feel like shit sorry for the long post."

I know a little about features and roles. I Don't know much about server set-ups yet. I don't get to take a Linux basics class until next semester. The class will be using OpenSuse.

Starting on Monday I'm going to be teaching 10-15 classes per week, mostly teenagers. I've never taught language before, but I do have experience working with kids of all ages and large groups as a swim coach. I'd say that I'm almost conversationally fluent in Spanish at this point - I took four years in high school (in a pretty advanced program as far as high school Spanish goes), and I've spent the last month and a half pushing myself to interact frequently with locals and have meaningful conversations, but I do sometimes have to ask people to slow down or repeat themselves.

I'm really excited about this opportunity, and want to give it my all. Classes start on Monday, and I'm wondering if you guys have any tips and advice to share.

Thanks!"

I would like to get an internship to add more experience to my resume, but any internships I find require you to be an active student.

Is there a way to contact a companies HR department to ask for an exception? Are there companies out there (or maybe the government?) that do not require you to be an active student."
47zkjd,4,2016-02-27,Troubleshooting my internship hunt,amiateacher,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/47zkjd/troubleshooting_my_internship_hunt/,"Hi r/cscareerquesitons, I'm a second semester master's student at one of the big universities in the US. (The university is especially known for it's CS program)

I am an ECE student here, and I'm finding it particularly difficult to land an internship. I interviewed with Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple (three teams here), and also Nvidia. Apart from Nvidia and Apple, where I got to the third and second rounds respectively, I didn't go past the first round in any of the others.

My questions:

1. Is it time to panic?
2. I am from a EE background, and hence lack the CS jargon and sometimes miss glaring details while engaging in technical communication. What would you advice me to do to overocme this? It's like I understand stuff (I have done reasonably well in one of the core CS courses I have taken), I just don't know how to talk about it in a way that the person in front of me thinks that I know my stuff
3. I do not have any open interview calls right now. I aim to start afresh. How do I approach this starting now? Would there be companies still just starting to look? I know a few people who got their internships as late as April, in good companies. Thoughts?
4. Most importantly, I'm looking for Systems roles, as I thought the transition from EE to CS would be best if I did Systems programming and C first. (I have done a lot of embedded systems before, so it was easy to sort of blend in)

Any sort of advice is welcome. "
47zxoi,1,2016-02-27,"I'm a junior Computer Engineering major, and I'm facing a dilemma of choosing between hardware and software. Anyone have some experience with this?",Freelancer05,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/47zxoi/im_a_junior_computer_engineering_major_and_im/,"I would say that I have above average skills in both hardware and software engineering, but I don't think I'm good enough at either to have a job focusing solely on one or the other. I've been striving for a job as a software engineering, but I recently had an interview for an internship in which the interview said, ""you definitely have a mind for this, and you can easily learn, but right now you're about a 5 out of 10 in terms of programming skill."" I didn't really know how to handle that. It has just made me think I might be screwed come this time next year when I actually have to find a job. One of my classmates told me that he thinks it'd be better to focus on finding jobs in hardware engineering, like FPGA design and such. I'm not really sure about it though, since I've been so focused on software for these past few years. Any advice?"
47zy8l,2,2016-02-27,Software dev internship as a part time student,throaugahway,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/47zy8l/software_dev_internship_as_a_part_time_student/,"Due to financial constraints I am forced to study CS part time and unfortunately you have to be a full time student to participate in PEY. I am extraordinarily passionate about programming, I have a 3.9 gpa and by summer 2017 I will have some research experience (involving lots of coding) plus at least one nontrivial personal project (an interesting/useful website) under my belt so I initially figured that I could just get a great internship independently. However companies like google and facebook specify that they only accept full time students as interns. I believe I have what it takes to intern at the best tech companies but it seems that being part time is going to be a significant obstacle, at least in the near future. Has anyone here been in a similar position? If so, do you have any advice concerning how to get a great internship as a part time student? Thanks."

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  
If you have any feedback or ideas to make these updates better either message me or /u/LeonZetineb  
It's sure been a crazy week, the guys uploaded a ton, dex left the office and the new coordinator is in and I think it really shows, the last video is really good and feels very natural. Along with Hundar we got two new people that are hopefully join the creatures, the bigger the family the better. Wonder where's Stefani tho.

480fh2,7,2016-02-28,Decided to drop out of grad school. Have I ruined my life? Can I salvage anything from this? Could I go back?,Mash_Ketchum,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/480fh2/decided_to_drop_out_of_grad_school_have_i_ruined/,"I graduated from a 4 year undergrad with a BS in Psychology in 2013. I took a year off afterwards and thought I had firmly decided I wanted to pursue grad school in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. I was wrong, unfortunately. I got accepted into a PhD program in that field, but I soon realized how little interest I had in that field of research, *especially* compared to my colleagues. Even the notion of teaching as a professor became unappealing after a few months of TAing. 

I kept on going because I desperately hoped I would eventually garner a genuine interest in what I was doing. But fast forward to my 4th semester, and nothing has changed. I'm really no closer to defending my Master's Thesis than I was in my first semester (haven't even proposed). So I've decided to withdraw from the program. Faculty have expressed that I'm making a wise and informed decision, but there could be a lot of pity hiding behind that. Colleagues seem supportive as well, especially because they know how much I've been struggling to maintain even the slightest bit of interest. I submitted the withdrawal paperwork on Friday and I'm guessing it will take a few days to process, so I've actually done it. The Psychology department wants to keep me on for the class I'm currently TAing, so they've promised to switch me over from a graduate assistantship stipend to standard hourly wage employment. That gives me plenty of time to get a full-time job once the semester is over. 

I just got off the phone with my mom after letting her know what I'm going to do, and I'm sure you can guess how that went. Extreme disappointment and frustration, a huge guilt trip, I currently feel like scum, and I now feel as though I made a decision that will permanently cripple my life. 

Now that I realize I was wrong in thinking I liked I/O Psychology, I need to reevaluate what I want as a career. I still enjoy aspects of psychology, such as clinical and developmental psychology. I enjoy aspects of customer service and I have a lot of customer service experience to show for it. I have some unrelated interests, such as ornithology (bird science), alternative dispute resolution, and counseling (I suppose that's still related to clinical).  

I'm hoping there might be something to salvage from my time in grad school. I have 2 years of teaching experience and I have references here (I feel like I left on good terms, especially with my advisor). I also gained a lot of content knowledge but I doubt that will mean much. No internship experience. Not much research experience because I could never really motivate myself to actually conduct research.

I was also wondering how feasible it would be in the future to go back to grad school. Let's say I'm able to figure my life out and realize what I truly want, and I want to apply to a Master's program in counseling or therapy, for example. Would I have a really hard time at that, even if I'm honest and elaborate on my lack of fit with my previous institution?

Finally, I was wondering if anyone knows someone who was in a similar situation and could provide some perspective. Because I'm still reeling from that draining conversation with my mother."

480iny,12,2016-02-28,Put two week notice in and bosses are giving silent treatment to me.,throwawayJIC2016,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/480iny/put_two_week_notice_in_and_bosses_are_giving/,"(Used a throwaway and used different names just in case this is stumbled upon by anyone from my work. Sorry for the wall of text.)
 

I have worked with this company for a little over a year. I started as an intern through a paid school intern program, and so they were able to have me work with the company for free while I got paid through the school. I have done just about everything there, production, shipping, customer service, and their website management. I really learned a lot from being there and also won the intern of the year award through my school internship program. My bosses Steve and Jane were super proud and at the ceremony had nothing but good things to say. Steve also announced at the award ceremony that I was being hired as an intern directly through the company because as he put it “We honestly can’t live without her!” This was in August last year. 


At the end of the year they hired another person, Sara. Sara was laid off from a project management job that she had with a software company previously and she had experience in the industry as our company was in so Steve and Jane hired her. She was actually really nice and I was looking forward to working with someone that could help with our tasks because it was getting pretty overwhelming with school.
Some time went by, like a few weeks and Sara started talking to me about Steve and Jane in pretty weird way to me. She made comments about how the communication was really bad with Steve and Jane. She made comments about Steve behind his back about stuff too, sort of insulting things. For example, she made a comment about how Steve wanted the package to look a certain way and she said “It looks like shit!” behind his back to me. I just sort of sat there and didn’t know what to say. I ignored it until later she started turning on me.


Sara started sending me really condescending e-mails about my work. I ignored it until there was a shipping error with a couple of the international addresses where the country was entered in incorrectly. I had uploaded those addresses to our shipping software and they got shipped out. Sara sent me an e-mail basically chewing me out about it and had both of my bosses copied on it. I accepted responsibility for what happened and also knew this was a time-sensitive issue. 


I was heading into class and so I sent her an e-mail asking her if she could call the shipping company to have the package rerouted. I included instructions in detail with the package information; I was a little late to class but I wanted to get the problem taken care of. She responded saying she couldn’t call because it was a 2 hour hold time and that I needed to take care of it. The e-mails went back and forth because I told her I couldn’t do it because of class and she said she wasn’t going to do it because she didn’t have time. I missed out on half of my lecture because I was e-mailing her trying to get the issue taken care of.


The next day I talked to Sara about how she talked to me and also with the other condescending e-mails she was sending me before. I told her I don’t appreciate being talked to that way and I also addressed her not respecting that I was in class and had missed half my lecture because of the issue. It was literally a waste of time because the issue didn’t even get resolved. She went off at me and said “I’m cleaning up all of your mistakes!” I asked her to explain what mistakes she has fixed because obviously the other day she didn’t want to fix anything. She ignored it and said I messed up the shipping and expected her to fix it. I explained it was time-sensitive and needed to be taken care of, if I hadn’t been in class I would have done it. Now we have to wait for the packages to go overseas and then come back because she didn’t want to do anything about it.


I then went to talk to Steve about what happened. He said that maybe I should be taken off shipping and just have Sara take care of it. I felt pretty hurt by that, like he believed that I was being incompetent, even though I haven’t made a mistake like that before. He expressed how disappointed he was that I made that mistake and said that they were low on money and can’t afford mistakes like this. The total amount for the mistake was about $40. I know $40 may not seem like a lot, but for it being a small start up it is a big deal. I expressed how sorry I was for missing that in the addresses and that if he felt Sara should take over I totally understood. I was neutral about it even though I was really upset.


The next day, Sara told Steve that I was shipping domestic packages for $20 a package, which was a total lie (normal domestic shipping costs $3.70-$7.80 by the way). Steve brought me in the office and yelled at me. I was almost in tears trying to explain that I would never let that happen. I pulled the shipping report and went through it with him right there and he saw that I in fact did not send any domestic shipments out for $20 a package. He apologized, half-heartedly, and left the office to go work on production. It was at that moment that I decided that I didn’t want to be there and wanted to put my 2 week notice in. I knew if I stayed there Sara would just make it more stressful and difficult for me to be there. It’s really just 4 of us in the company and then some interns that do some graphics, so there isn’t really a way for me not to interact with her.


On Friday around 3pm, I put in my two week notice via e-mail (my other main boss Jane was out of the office and would be for at least a couple of weeks) and copied Steve on the e-mail. I basically just said that I wanted to focus more on my school work and that I needed to quit. I thanked both Jane and Steve for everything they have done for me and giving me the opportunity to work there and learn. I kept the e-mail very positive and didn’t mention anything about Sara at all. I have a hunch that my boss Jane has heard some things and I didn’t want to send her a notice with a bunch of complaints. 


I haven’t heard anything back from my bosses since I sent the notice. I just hope I handled everything right. I feel relieved that I am going to be leaving soon. The only thing I am nervous about is that Sara may have said stuff that I am not aware of that would cause Jane and Steve to not give me a reference for other jobs. She lied before, she could do it again without my knowledge I’m sure. I worked really hard there, and I will be pretty upset if they just decide not to give me a reference because of this issue with Sara. I was thinking of asking them, but I’m not sure if I should. I’m not sure how to move forward during the next couple of weeks.


Tl;dr
I work for a company as an intern, where my bosses thought very highly of me until a difficult employee started at the company recently. She has been nit-picking, and lying about me to my bosses. One of my bosses I am pretty sure has bought into it, and the other I don’t know how they feel. I am afraid that this difficult employee has lied and made me look so bad that my bosses are not going to give me a good reference. Should I ask them if they are going to give a good reference? How should I move forward during the next couple of weeks?

I'm strongest in Java, Python, and C++, and was wondering: how would I go about learning Javascript with prior knowledge of these languages? Is there any well known path that people like me follow?

Also what do things like Node.js, Angular, React have to do with Javascript? Are they different flavors of Javascript that I have to choose one to learn?"
481ddk,5,2016-02-28,Me [23M] with my gf [20F] of 2 years are about to enter a long distance relationship.,ldistancethrwaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/481ddk/me_23m_with_my_gf_20f_of_2_years_are_about_to/,"So I met her 3 years ago on an 12-month internship I was doing over in UK. She had just went to visit some of her relatives and earn some money.

After summer was over, she went back to her country for university. I stayed and we started chatting. a lot. Flash forward 9 months later and I was flying to her so we can go out on a second date.

either love or infatuation, doesn't matter. I've fallen for her. I'm 21 at this point and this is the first time in my life I've had relationship with a girl that lasts longer than couple of weeks.

Anyway, I had 3 more semesters left in my 4.5 year degree, so I transfered to an university in her town. It's definitely an inferior university, and I do feel a sense of regret when I reflect on my choice, but at least I was together with her.

The thing is, I'm finally graduating in June and will be going on to pursue my masters in a different country, but she has 2 more years to go.

Realistically, with some difficulty I will be able to visit her once a month for 3 days.

I'm really wrestling with this thing - should I just break up or try to do long-distance for 2-3 years?

I'm pretty handsome and athlethic. I don't have 'oneitis' and know that I could find another one easily if I wanted, but I do love my current girlfriend

At the moment we have been living together for about 9months (like moved in)

I've tried to have this conversation with my girlfriend, but it usually gets emotional and derailed, so we've settled for ignoring the elephant in the room at the moment.
   
**tl;dr**: I'm about to finish my studies and move to a different country. Should I try the long distance thing for 2-3 years (9-10months long distance, posibly 2 months together in a year) with visiting her once a month or just break up and deal with it?"
481xjo,3,2016-02-28,"27,~8 years in engineering (many many surgeries), need advice.",engr301,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/481xjo/278_years_in_engineering_many_many_surgeries_need/,"I just turned 27 this past month, and I am having no trouble summing up my life to a complete failure. Though I received a 4.0 last semester, but only with 3 classes so Im not sure if that counts, I am just battling this life with a sense that even if I finish my bachelors I will never get a job. My background started in Petroleum engineering, before the mad rush, and I had great grades, above a 3.5, solid internships, and scholarships. However, during my Junior-Senior (2010) summer I hurt my lower back. The surgeries consisted of fusions, all up and down the lumbar region.  Several years of recoveries and more surgeries as I had failed fusions. Further my parents got divorced, literally as I was in a hospital bed, and I was used as a financial and psychological sounding board for what seems to be an extended and continuing divorce battle that hopefully will come to an end after 4 years...but basically the past three months I have started to completely breakdown.

A little more background just so if anyone would be willing to give advice could use this to either tell me if this experience works against me or could work for me in future job prospects.

While I was recovery I did what I could do online in engineering. Finishing GECs and working with some teachers to get a few more 300 and 400 level courses out of the way, but the stronghold against finishing an online engineering degrees, even with documented disabilities, is just so reinforced, I don't see any school really offering bachelors for REAL ABET degrees in the foreseeable future. 


This is part of my background that I hope could possibly work in my favor. But it would only extend to the realm of work ethic and ""resilience""/ or better said just continuing to grinding forward in this very depressing life.

I took all the money I saved and invested it in the stock market, and with good research and luck, (the luck being I started investing in 2010 up until 2015 which was basically recovering mode in the market from the recession) I made enough to help pay for everything, from my moms mortgage, divorce, everyday bills, college, sisters college. Also was able to get an investment property for income.  

However I put that information there just so maybe those in the industry may be able to tell me if a recruiter would give any merit to that. Or if that should be left out of any sort of interview process? 

I have over 120 credits. (135 to be exact, with a mix of 300 and 400 level mechanical (fluids, dynamics, thermo, circuits, stats, statics, cs, and petroleum classes, also some industrial) I have all the baseline stuff finished. Calcs, Physics 1-3, Chem 1 &amp;2...etc Also was able to get some little minors while recovering in bed, History and Economics. (online through my university) and its not University of Phoenix.  These are ABET accredited universities, George Mason University, and previously for Petroleum engineering was West Virginia University.

 Once again, I would like to reiterate, I have not been just wasting money, as I am an avid scholarship applier/reciever, and after doing financial advising (Series 65) and investing I do have enough in which instate tuition + scholarships now, at age 27, is really not that much. Especially considering that school is great therapy. 

I promise to anyone reading this and hoping to appeal to a response, that I am not fishing for complements. I have become extremely depressed (which is so real and sucks so much, the mind is so powerful and can turn on you) and have been losing control of myself, with respect to not wanting to live. I don't have hate towards others. I say that last part because it seems like a week doesn't go by without hearing about people taking out others on ones way out. 

So with complete sincerity, and not just fluff comments, could anyone give me any advice, suggestions? Should I just give up trying to finish college, or would  a future employer just look at my resume or during an interview and say ""8,9,10 years, you took forever, you are not someone that will ever be hired by any company because you can't finish things in a timely manner""

I know some may say ""go seek psychological help,"" and I have, but I was hoping that I could hear from Engineers about what and if the competition is just to high for someone like me to ever be considered.

4820n1,13,2016-02-28,"INFJ issues, driving me nuts and starting to get really depressed. Similar situations or advice?",Martiaz,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/4820n1/infj_issues_driving_me_nuts_and_starting_to_get/,"Since the age of 15 I realised I'm an INFJ (sponsor and school guidance) and started to live my life the way I can get the most out of my life. At the moment I'm 22.

A small background: I had a gaming addiction from the age of 12 to 17, after that I got serious help and I can handle it now. From 17 to 20 i've been in an emotionally abusive relationship I couldn't get out from with the thought: ""I can't get any better, so better stick with her"". I thought I was healed, but these past weeks made me realise I'm still devastated from it and it makes me puke.

Since a few weeks I'm starting to feel really depressed. I know all the sources, but I just can not cope with it or know how to deal with it. Since this week I have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis, it's not that I am actually making plans on committing suicide or writing letters, but there is a thought about why I am alive, what I am supposed to do and the world wouldn't become a better or worse place with or without me in it. I'm wondering if any of you have been at these stages, how you coped with it or if there is any advice how I can pick my life up. I have good friends and the best sisters. But it feels like I can't talk about it with them, maybe they'll laugh at me or they'll start worrying about me, which I do not want them to be.

I'm in my last year of my bachelor degree. Normally you are supposed to start your internship in the first week of february, but I couldn't make the deadline. I still have a few assignments and reports to finish, but I just can not get myself to it. I just wonder all day thinking about how shit my life has been. One of the biggest assignments is to visit my internship company from last year, where I still have to get my grades and forms from. I haven't contacted them in a year and I just cant push myself to go there, since I'm scared that I've let them down and haven't been in touch  over a year. The result of my internship was really solid, though. I study logistics engineering and implemented a warehouse system so they save up to 100.000eu on a yearly basis. It just feels like an iron wall I cannot climb anymore, I'm scared and I feel like shit.

Also, I've been dating a girl since november. She is great and I can open myself the way I can (as an INFJ). It took me three months to open myself up, we talked a lot and she is totally understandable about my situation and past. I really feel like there is a long term possibility here, since I crave for that. 

However, she is going on a world trip with her best friend in november this year. She doesn't want to be in a relationship until after her world trip, due to the fact her last relationship ended on her trip to turkey for 6 months. I understand, but it does make me feel like shit. We both love each other, but the long term relationship, we as INFJ's, I value is a blurry image now. It's hard for me to change my mind from long term to: Just enjoy yourself with her and see where it goes. I cannot make the emotional bonding or aim for the perfect relationship I crave for. 

This friday night, she went out with her best friend. My previous relationship (see background at start) always cheated with others when she went out. I can handle it with her though, I'm not even thinking about it! But, last night she send me an image of a phone number she got from a guy while she was out. The guy had the same name as me, but it was a different number. All I replied was: ""That's not my number, and I don't even want to know."" Purely because it made my old scars open again. Thought train crashed into my head.

After that, I ignored her for 12 hours (partially on purpose). I had to many thoughts in my head and just had a blackout. I decided to put my phone away and to start reading 'Stoner' from John Williams I bought earlier that day. I fell asleep at some point and when I woke up I had the urge to go running (training for my first 1/2 marathon in June). While I was running I had all these shitty thoughts again and decided to text her and apologize. We also scheduled to do something today, but when I asked her if she still was available and had time or wanted to see me she said: ""Hey. Sorry, I have no time today. Enjoy your day!"" ..So even MORE thoughts came to my head. We planned Friday to do something today, since she had the part at friday night and was occupied at saturday. And now, out of nowhere, she has no time for me. We only see each other once or twice a week, due to the fact she started in time with her internship. All I do is working out, running and hating my life.

I'm not even sure if I caused her the damage I think I did, but it does feel like our current ""relationship"" just totally changed, I send her a big message (afterwards you always regret those ofcourse) with how sorry I am and I just needed some alone time to clear my head. She said she understand, but I feel mixed signals. And I know my feeling is 9/10 always correct..

The longer I struggle with school, the longer it takes me to get my bachelor degree. It's also an education I really dislike since the last 2 years. Everything is to much into detail, to precise and to serious. I'd love to do a job where I can help people, so my specialization is human logistics. But it is underrated at college, not even fun. This, combined with the unsecurity of the love of my life is driving me nuts. 

Do I deserve to be alive? Why am I alive? Why does she love me? Why am I fucking up college so hard? Maybe I'm overthinking it too much, but it is driving me crazy. Normally I smoke 5 cigarettes a day (at work (bartender) around 10), but these last weeks I started to smoke a package a day as a minimum. I decided not to text her anymore today, after talking it through with my best friend, but it's so hard for me to NOT text her. I love her, I want to communicate with her on every possible way and as much as I can.

Have you been in similar situations and how did you cope with it? Or is there any advice from, more experienced, INFJ's? This is driving me nuts, and although I have suicidal thoughts. I cannot bear the thought of abandoning my friends, family and the girl I love with every part of my body and mind. Also preventing me to make serious actions or plans about it, but just the single thought is driving me nuts already.

If there are any English grammar mistakes, apologies. Not native English.

After my exams (I finish mine last) on 1 March, the next day (2 March) we would all go have fun at the theme park before I spend my week preparing for internship, which starts on 7th. So all this while, I have been kinda looking forward to that, until this afternoon, when I got an email from my school stating that those who are going for internship need to attend some briefing on 2 March.

When I saw that, I shit you not, I was pissed as fuck. I ranted to my current school friends, as well as informing my other friends about my predicament. I felt like crying because, well, I have been looking forward to riding the rollercoasters and basically having a great time with my closest friends.

I was torn. I could skip the briefing, but miss important stuff, or ask them to rearrange for another date, but that would mean they have to take leave or rearrange their plans, which made me feel like I'm being the troublesome one. In the end, I just told them to go on and have fun without me, but inside, I was pretty devastated. I know it's super petty to feel like crying about this but yeah...

Anyway, my friends told me we can go another time together, but deep inside I feel like I'm missing out having fun with them, and to a smaller extent, feel a bit left out.

Ah well, I guess the silver lining is that I have more money to spend on my work clothes for internship... :')"
483flq,13,2016-02-28,"Me [25F] with my boyfriend [28M] of two years, found hairtie next to his bed that isn't mine",feedmesweetlies,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/483flq/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_28m_of_two_years_found/,"Hairtie next to my boyfriend’s [28M] bed isn’t mine [2fF], together two years

Throwaway, even though the details probably give it away. Names have been changed and ages slightly altered to protect the questionably innocent.

I’m worried I’m about to waste my life with a liar. Please help me see this situation from an outside perspective. It’s just a hairtie, but it didn’t walk into his apartment on its own two legs. 

The situation: Anthony and I have been together for two years, long distance for eight months. We live in major east coast cities about 200 miles apart, and see each other 3-4 times per month.  Last Thursday, I arrived to his apartment while he was still at work and noticed a hair elastic on the floor by his bed that wasn’t mine. The hair on it was also not mine. Anthony’s apartment is a studio laid out as a large square room. I cannot understand how a hair tie could get to that part of his apartment besides someone wearing a hair tie in that part of his apartment. When I brought up the hair tie to him, he suggested that maybe it was his sister’s and it had somehow gotten in his laundry while he was home over the holidays—which is possible, but doesn’t explain why it appeared where and when it did. 

The backstory: Anthony has lied before. Anthony and I met on OKCupid (Jan 2014). In April, we had the define-the-relationship talk while drunk (fail) and I couldn’t remember if our relationship was open or not, and felt too awkward to bring it up (also fail) so I went the safe route and stayed monogamous. I noticed he still went online on OKCupid (May 2014)—obviously I was also online as well to notice this—so I asked him why he still went online, and he responded, “I’ll delete my account.”. It surprised me that he didn’t go down without a fight since he’s typically argumentative and I was excpecting him to defend himself somehow, like maybe “I just like checking out women.” Anyway, I deleted mine account as well. Or should I say (spoiler alert), I deleted my account. 

Important detail: I have a fantastic bullshit detector.

Back to the backstory: Anthony had a summer internship in Milwaukee for that summer (arranged prior to meeting me). The week before he left (late May 2014), he finally brought up the question of whether or not we were in an open relationship. He said he wasn’t as “open minded as he had thought” and that he “didn’t want to share [me].” (He was drunk again, me less so—progress?) We decided to be monogamous. 

The day Anthony moved to Milwaukee (June 1), I got a funny feeling—I couldn’t reconcile his willingness to delete his OKCupid profile with his typical contrarian ways. So I made a burner OKCupid account and discovered that HE HAD MADE ANOTHER FUCKING OKCUPID PROFILE IN MILWAUKEE. This is the same guy who, a week prior, had said that monogamy was a necessary condition to continuing our relationship.  The worst part is that Google had a cached page of it from May 19, before he even moved. 

I kind of wish I had dumped him then. I kind of wish I had catfished him just to see how far he was willing to go. But instead, I immediately called him. 

He later said he did it because he figured our relationship wouldn’t last anyway. (This might actually be true; I know he’s had a bad experience with a long distance relationship in the past.) The explanation is somewhat irrelevant anyway. 

Perhaps the most concerning part about the OKCupid lie is the level of premeditation. What bothers me about the hairtie situation (in addition the potential cheating) is the possibility that he’s now, in effect, gaslighting me by suggesting that a hairtie can somehow spontaneously appear. 

tl;dr I found a hairtie that isn’t mine next my boyfriend’s bed. He can’t explain how it got there. Earlier in our relationship (June 2014), he lied to me and I caught him attempting to cheat.  I had started to trust him, but that hairtie didn’t walk into his apartment by itself. Please help me see the this situation from an outside perspective. 

EDIT: This weekend I happened to notice another hair that wasn't mine around the shoulder area of his coat. Couldn't tell if it was the same color as the hair on the elastic. "

About 6 months ago I requested an office transfer at my firm to start a new life. I had a medical scare and realized I hadn't been doing what I really wanted to in life, and this new location would provide me the stepping stones to my new goals.



Well in moving, I had 0 friends in this new location. My department was filled of mostly females who were much older than me. At the 1st of the year we started getting interns in. Most of them are in their masters program, so 22-23, which I thought great, finally people close to my age and maybe they could introduce me to more people around our age.

I took a liking to one girl in particular, because she seemed to be really passionate about getting hired here and truth be told I screwed up my internship at a firm, so I had plenty of advice on what NOT to do. I took her out to lunch one day and gave her the does and don'ts of this firm and tips to succeed. 


I began helping her with her work and she was always really nice to me. Instantly we just hit it off. We'd talk all day in person or over the work IM program. She would take my advice on everything, from if I mentioned a favorite movie, she'd watch it, to if I said do your hair like that, she would. She added me on facebook and asked for my number, and we do a fair amount of talking outside of work too, usually everyday. We also go to lunch everyday for the past 2 months. Most of the time just us two. I'm a sheltered food person so she has this thing were she takes me to try new foods and pays for it for me. And in these times we have gotten really close. We know more about eachother than people I knew for 10+ years know. Both just very comfortable telling things. So I thought things were good, and if she didn't have BF of 5 years, I honestly would have thought she liked me.


But now I'm starting to think more into this and I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not. First thing is, I've mentioned subtly that I don't know many people in this area and maybe go out with her. That gets shot down with things like ""I like that I can tell you anything because you don't know these people so I don't have to worry"". So that was kinda a bummer and I never really brought it up again. 


Then last week we had a big company thing. And I wont lie, this firm parties hard. Bunch of rich people with a lot of money to spend on booze. The whole time at the event she maybe said 2 words to me and that's only after I approached her. But she was hanging out with the other females, so I figured whatever. After 6 hours of drinking all the younger people decided to keep it going and we went to a local bar. Same thing, didn't really talk to me there. In fact the couple times I did try to there, she was rude/mean. At this point I was getting pissed. It was almost like HS stuff where gotta hang out with the cool kids only. Well as the night went on and 12 hours later of drinking finally ended. I found myself having to babysit her until I could get a friend to come and pick us up because everyone else bailed and they knew how close we were and she was super messed up (couldn't even read the words on her phone). So I spent 2 hours between waiting with her to dropping her off at her house all while she cried about her life, bf, family, etc.... But the whole time I was still mad about ignoring me and the stuff she said. But I sat with her and made sure she didn't make anymore mad choices (I guess there was a lot of questionable stuff happening).


Next day I gave her a run down of what happened that night and some of the things she did, including what she said to me. She apologized and said I'm like a best friend to her and it feels like we have known eachother for years and that wasn't her last night and to not hold it against her. 


But at the end of the day idk. We hung out at another company event on Friday and she was perfectly cool with me and we drove together and hit up some places just us after everyone else called it a night. 


So I'm not sure what side of her is the real her. But the biggest issue I have is, is she has almost now depended on me to do her work for her. It went from helping to, I'm making corrections before she turns stuff in that I know I've told her how to do 10x before. I can't say for sure if she is half assing it knowing she has a safety net or what, but it seems like it now. And the thing is every min I spend helping her is a min I gotta stay later and do my work. So on average I spend an extra 1.5 hours everyday later at work from helping her. Now I don't really mind helping, but I don't think she is really appreciative of it. Sometimes I don't even get a thanks. And the real kicker was I offered to meet one day after work to go over some things that I think she could easily learn and would improve her odds of getting hired. Instead she brings some homework from her class (which is actually very very closely related to what we do at work) and asks me to help her with it. I was like wtf, I'm not doing HW for someone, but at the end of the day its exactly what we do at work. We did some of it and she said she would stay after work the next day and finish it there using the work resources. Cool. What that really meant was she came into my office and asked me to walk her through it for an hour that day and the next day. Basically I did the whole thing for her and after she said ""God I hate doing HW, I never do it"", I started really thinking about this as a whole. 


Bottom line is she really wants to get hired at my firm. Its a prestigious place and I don't know now if I'm being taken for a ride. I'm starting to think that if she doesn't get an offer in the next 2 months I'll never hear from her again. Part of me says she isn't that kind of person (I've even subtly joked about this with her, about her only talking to me for help getting hired), but part of me says yes. 


I'm not sure what to do here. I have a really great time hanging out with her at lunch and stuff and she seems like a genuine person. We had a blast together on Friday and I agree with her its like we have been friends for years the way we act.





   
**tl;dr**: Not sure if ""friend"" is using me to get hired."

Over the past couple of years I've become more and more interested with pursuing a career in the IT field, specifically Networking/Network Engineering. I was able to shadow a friend of mine in the field and I was intrigued at the knowledge he seemed to possess and it sparked my interest. My problem is I'm completely new to the field.

Besides online courses, there is an accredited tech school nearby which offers both Network Engineering AS and BS degrees, as well as helping attain certs throughout the course. The school has an amazing campus, great reviews, and is known for helping students land great internships and jobs post graduation. The problem is the price. The total bachelors program would run me about 58-60k after help from financial aid. Is this absolutely absurd, or should I be expecting to pay that much for a good education?

I guess what I'm really asking is if this school sounds like a good option from the outside looking in for someone who has no experience in the field but is eager to learn? If not, what other routes do I have to choose from? Is there anything I can do on my own time to get ahead in understanding the field and brushing up on some knowledge? This is the type of work I would like to invest myself in, so I'm really trying to find my best route into it. 

Sorry if it's a bit lengthy, but any help is appreciated!"
485m2e,13,2016-02-28,QA Testing position concerns,bwargh89,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/485m2e/qa_testing_position_concerns/,"I've got an interview coming up for a QA Testing position at a decently well known company.  The position is also a contract. I am mostly concerned that it will end up hindering my chances of getting into Software Dev positions in the future.  I planned on asking the interviewer if it's possible to transition to a dev position at some point, but the fact that it is contract makes me think that dynamic is a little different, if that makes sense.

Little background:
I just graduated with my B.S. in CS in the Fall '15.  I graduated from a pretty shit tier state school ( I'm in SoCal ) with a 3.2 overall gpa.  My [github](https://github.com/AustinSong) isn't great and the projects aren't very impressive.  No internships, no relevant work experience.

I'm currently not making any money and just learning the Spring framework and attempting to build a web app with it in my free time.  So, it would definitely be nice to be at least making some cash for now.  Also, I figured maybe it would allow me to network within the company since I very much would not mind working there as an SE.

I know that it's only an interview and I haven't even been hired yet for the contract, but I just like to have some opinions on the matter before anything happens.  I have a good number of contacts related to this position, ( how I got the interview in the first place ), and apparently every referral has been hired by my contacts.

Would it be a mistake for me to take this position, if I'm offered it, if my aspirations lie within Software Engineering / Dev.

Thanks to anyone who reads this.

**EDIT**
Just to add.  I've learned that the contract is for 18 months, and that it can apparently be terminated at any time ( sorry if this is common knowledge, I'm not familiar with how contracts work out ).  Also that this is apparently in the ""Software Engineer dept"" as my contact has informed "
4860fs,1,2016-02-28,[Fiction] [3.4k] [Fantasy/Post Apocalyptic] Blessed,tamiveldura,tamiveldura,https://www.reddit.com/r/tamiveldura/comments/4860fs/fiction_34k_fantasypost_apocalyptic_blessed/,"Piet smoothed the grey robes of his service down over his chest and insured the ropes of his station lay flat. The tassels dangled by his knees. He checked in the mirror for any stray hairs the cleansing may have missed. He didn't recognize his own face. Something about the lack of eyelashes made it more alien than he expected. He smoothed the grey robes again. His sandals were wrapped tight, he carried nothing. It was time. He just needed to walk out the door and join the twenty or so other new apostates.

Before he could gather his courage, the senior Curate opened his door with an impatient look. Piet turned away from the mirror immediately and followed the similarly cleansed woman into the hall. The other apostates were quiet and their nervousness hummed in the air. Was there something Piet had to be nervous about?

The Curate lead them down the hall and into the main chamber. The roar of the river hummed low under their feet, here. It reminded Piet of exactly how important his position was. Not him as an individual, but the apostates as a whole. The Church in its entirety. Without their guidance Piet wouldn't be here to serve them.

After a brief interlude for prayer, the Curate lead them all to the worn stairs where they filed down and down and down to the bottom of church. The river churned. Piet stepped out with the other apostates into a metal walkway bordering a sacristy so large he couldn't see the ends of it. The walkway vibrated. The room was slanted from his right to his left, though there was so much water flowing through, he couldn't tell how deep the room fell beneath his feet. 

On regularly spaced walkways stretched across the river, apostates and priests held their hands over the water and chanted the words of consecration. The Curate lead them up the walkway and gestured them into a single-file line. They took their indicated places at the very front of the flow, where desalinated, filtered water from the river was released in gallons per second. 

This was the true power of the Church. This sacristy alone provided all the holy water that fed the last bastion of people on earth. It watered their crops, it protected their homes, it even flowed through their pipes. 

The roar drowned out even Piet's own thoughts, but now he knew what to do. As one, the line of apostates lifted their hands over the bar of the walkway and together they began the chant. They stumbled a bit over the words, trying to hear one another and match up. It was awkward at first, but as they found the rhythm their combined voices rose over the churning whitewater and Piet felt himself drift into a peaceful state. He was a small cog in a very important machine. The white noise of the water, the steady drone of his own voice and fellow apostates, they lulled him and any nervousness the group had fell away before this massive task.

The water passed under six rows of apostates, two rows of priests, and a final bishop before pouring out of the sacristy and out into the world, blessed as holy water. Gallons upon gallons per second of holy water, an entire river diverted for just this purpose. 

--//--

Kalya played with the links of the cross around her neck and leaned over her meal, eyes intent on Suree. ""Do I believe the water keeps them away? Absolutely. We've all seen the footage. It's definitely the water that hurts them so badly and I've studied enough of their remains to be sure. But the blessing?"" Kalya shrugged one shoulder and pushed her carrots to one side of her plate. ""I don't think the blessing has anything to do with it. I mean, it's just a hunch at this point, but I suspect that untouched water would work just the same.""

Suree put her fork on her plate and leaned her head into her palm. ""Kalya, you can't actually believe this? The entire city runs on holy water. Our industry requires it to even function--""

She broke off as misters overhead clicked on and sprinkled the entire commissary with blessed water for a two second interval. It dropped onto their heads and settled like dew.

Suree made a gesture at the ceiling that rested her case.

""How do you know it's not just the water itself? What if we're just told the blessing is what's keeping us safe from those things?""

Suree's eyes were flat. ""Are you going to run off and find some untouched water somewhere and pour it on one, then?""

""I've thought about it.""

""Kalya!""

She leaned over the table again. ""Suree, I have a live one in my lab right now. The military captured one a few days ago and I'm in charge of the research on it. If I'm right, think of what it could do for us. For this city!""

""Like what?""

""Like freeing up hundreds of thousands of gallons of touched water for the needy. Like providing a buffer if the a drought sweeps through, a hundred other things--""

""Yeah, like getting it into people's heads that we don't need the Church anymore. The clergy would hang you in the street! Are you out of your mind?""

Kalya scoffed and stabbed at her plate. ""They're only in power because they had a solution at the Rising. That doesn't make them correct in all things ever.""

Suree rubbed her face. ""You're nuts."" When Kalya didn't protest she groaned. ""Ok, so how are you getting your hands on untouched water? The desalination plants are miles away and no one but clergy get into the lower levels of the church.""

""I'll get it from the river before it enters the filtration system.""

Suree blinked at her. Then she dropped her fork on her plate, grabbed her tray, stood, and walked away.

Kalya scrambled to follow her. ""Wait, Suree--""

""You need to see a doctor, Kalya. You're talking crazy--""

""I'm not leaving the city. I don't have a death wish. One of my contacts in the military can retrieve it for me when they're out on patrol.""

Suree pressed her lips together and dumped her trash in the bin, sliding her tray on top. She crossed her arms and said quietly, ""Say you get untouched water. You throw it on the thing in your lab, and it burns into slag. What then? You've just proved that the entire church, their rules, their regulations, hell, our entire religion is based on a lie. You don't think that's not going to start riots? You're planting seeds of revolution here. You're going to break our entire system.""

The idea shook Kalya to the core but she kept her head high. ""Would you rather live under the Church's lies or with the truth?""

""I'd rather you never mentioned it at all.""

""Ignorance, then."" Kalya shook her head. ""What's the point of studying them if you don't want to learn any more.""

""You study them Kalya, not me."" Suree half-turned, then hesitated. ""Do… do you still want to have lunch tomorrow?""

Kalya sighed and dropped her shoulders. ""Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you then.""

Suree grabbed Kalya's arm. ""Since you're doing this anyway, be smart about it. Keep your mouth shut and don't release your results until we've had a chance to talk. What you're doing is dangerous.""

""I don't think it is.""

""Now who's willfully ignorant?"" Suree gave her sad smile and turned away from the commissary. 

Kalya groaned and headed for her lab.

Delphin tightened his grip and checked that his hose nozzle was set to a wide spray. ""Here they come,"" he muttered into his mic. Acknowledgements from Jerome and Mar echoed back at him. He couldn't see his backup with the suit and helmet, but he knew they were with him. The three of them covered the entrance to an old world building. Its glass was long gone, the concrete cracked and crumbling. There was nothing to salvage here. 

The rest of their squad stretched down the street in a line, backpacks full, hoses ready. A small mass of demons bubbled in the charred ribs of a gas station not far up the road. Delphin saw seven, maybe ten creatures. But one could never be too careful when the legion decided to contract like this. Delphin had seen forty demons in a smaller space, before. Had seen his squad slaughtered in ambush. 

The legion bubble popped and a dozen gangling things, inky black and wicked fast, raced toward them. Delphin pulled the trigger. A fan of holy water sprayed from his hose and identical fans burst on either side of him from Jerome and Mar. 

The demons collapsed on contact, screaming in ways that shook bone, steaming and bubbling into puddles of black goo. The demons tried to isolate themselves from the holy water and reform. Delphin switched his nozzle to a pressure stream. He punched holes in their growing heads and bodies, flooding the ink with touched water. The squad diluted what was left of the demons until the water ran clear. 

""All set, here,"" Delphin reported. ""Clear the gas station.""

The squad moved forward as one, hoses ready. Delphin checked his pack and noted he was still two-thirds full. With their hoses on spray, Delphin and his squad approached the station, soaking everything from the sidewalk to the signs as they went. If any demons were hiding in cracks or corners, they were flooded out or killed.

Delphin stepped over the frame of what used to be the station's door. Any supplies or food left from the Rising were long gone. The station was left only with broken glass, collapsed shelves, and walls that would crumble with the next storm.  

Still, that left plenty of places for demons to hide. Delphin walked the inner perimeter of the building while Mar soaked the interior down every aisle. The squad patrolled the space outside, expanding their clean zone.

Delphin's hose sputtered, then clicked. He checked the volume. ""That's it for me, I'm dry.""

""Same,"" said Mar.

""I still have a quarter tank,"" Jerome said. 

""Alright, form up, let's go."" Delphin swung his hose down to his hip and hefted his pack. ""Jerome and anyone else with water left, bring up the rear in case we missed something.""

But Delphin's squad was thorough and nothing followed them out of the city. They jogged back they way they had come, through miles of crumbling old world city that they or other squads had already cleared of demons. Soon, the demo crews would come through here and flatten the standing structures, digging up all the concrete. After them, the Church would asses the space for its best use and direct new expansion. Slowly but surely, the human race was going to win this war. 

Delphin didn't slide his helmet's visor up until his HUD blinked and indicated the river. In the distance, the roar of the water thudded through his boots as it poured out of the dam and into filtration tanks. From here he could just make out the blue glow of the city dome. He lead his squad through the isolation gates, waiting between locks as they were sprayed once, twice, and a third time with holy water. He grabbed a towel once past the fencing and was eager to strip out of his suit and into some dry clothes. 

Delphin reported their work to a clergyman he didn't recognize. It was always someone new and if it weren't for the database and automated nature of their sweeps, Delphin doubted they'd make as much progress as they had. He recited the coordinates they covered, the number of demons they washed, his opinion on the cleanliness of the area, and, as usual, reported no human survivors. He honestly wasn't sure what his squad would do if they found one. To his knowledge no one ever had.

The clergyman took all of his information with a disinterested grunt, typing rapidly on the tablet in his hand. Delphin's HUD blinked with updated orders. His squad was in line to deploy after a 5 hour break. That was just long enough for food and some shut-eye. Too bad he had another task at hand.

--//--

Kalya pressed her lips together as she dismissed the last of her interns from the lab, promising not to work too late on her own. She locked the door and turned off the light in the front room. 

She rubbed her hands on her coat to banish their sudden clamminess. Before her conversation with Suree, Kalya would have done this with at least two assistants, if not also the help of her fellow technicians. But Kalya trusted Suree's political instincts far more than her own and had changed her plans accordingly.

The isolation room was enclosed on all sides, but Kalya saw the demon bubbling in the middle of the small space, contained in a secondary chamber. Black ink occasionally sputtered and ran out the sides of the acrylic box, but other than make a mess of the exam table, the demon hadn't done anything in the several weeks Kalya had been watching it.

Now it was finally time to test her theory, though. Kalya twisted open a thermos and poured the clear fluid inside a small acrylic cup. From the faucet she filled a second cup with holy water. With the two labeled, she set them aside under a containment shield. 

Kalya sat the operations desk of the isolation chamber and manipulated the multi-axis robot arm to its rack of tools. She exchanged the tip for a flat scraper and, without touching the tall acrylic box, scooped a sample of snot-like ink from the table surface. Kalya leaned closer to the monitor. She scraped the sample into an acrylic cup and deposited it into the transfer chamber between Isolation and her containment. She slid the blast door closed.

The containment box had much smaller manipulation arms that Kalya found far easier to maneuver. With a three-pronged grasper she picked up the cup of ink and tipped it over the one labeled holy water. 

The inky fluid dripped into the water. As expected, it hissed and sputtered on contact, exactly like hot grease in a frying pan. Eventually the water overpowered her small sample and settled back down in the cup, now slightly cloudy. 

Kalya's heart thumped harder. She poured the same demon sample into the cup marked untouched. If her theory was correct the reaction would be the same. 

The sample dropped into the water. It bubbled a bit, more than Kalya expected, but there was no hissing or violent reaction on contact. The water did something, but it didn't destroy the demon sample. Kalya pushed up on her toes. She could see the lump of black in the bottom of the cup. It was still bubbling. 

Kalya frowned. She double checked her observing camera and returned to the isolation chamber to repeat her sample collection. Some ink in the holy water cup: it spluttered and disintegrated. Ink in the untouched water cup, it bubbled and sat, inert, at the bottom.

Annoyed, Kalya poured the untouched water out of the cup. The ink fell like a lump into the middle of her containment box. And once the water flowed away, it bubbled and grew. Kalya scoffed. She smacked the red button on the corner of the containment. Holy water sprayed from every corner, flooding the box and rendering the demon piece inert. 

Maybe there was something to the touched water, then. If regular water didn't destroy them, the holy water really was the only thing keeping humanity alive.

Kalya peered into her first containment box. A lump still sat at the bottom of her untouched water cup. But it wasn't black anymore. It was kind of tan, instead. Maybe flesh-colored? Kalya poured the water out of the cup, ready to press the red button and destroy the sample if she needed to. But it just sat in the middle of her box. She manipulated one of the arms to poke at it. It jiggled a little. Less than jello. She picked it up. It bounced a bit, floppy, when she dropped it. 

Kalya cut a smaller piece off and the lump bled. Just a little. Red, not black. She scanned the partial sample and the apparent blood. The computer told her it was human, but couldn't match it with a citizen of the dome. 

Kalya narrowed her eyes. How could she possibly have an unregistered human sample? New children were registered while still in utero. 

She looked at the bubbling demon in her isolation chamber. She'd seen videos of them, everyone had. They could take any shape, but mostly favored long, gangling limbs and a blob of a body. Maybe teeth or claws if they got close enough to a person. They could meld with each other and back out again, change their shape at will, and flowed more like liquid than a carbon-based creature. The one in her chamber appeared no different. It bubbled in a heap, occasionally oozing liquid ink through the air holes in its tall box. When it first arrived it had explored the small space but as far as Kalya knew, made no attempt to escape it.

Kalya didn't know much about the Rising other than the Church stepping up to provide gallon after gallon of sanctified water. Surely other methods had been attempted before that discovery. The Church said they were mindless. Only dangerous in legion. Kalya's military contact had agreed. They were generally stupid, attacked directly, and only had the advantage occasionally when discovered in numbers. 

Kalya opened the access panel for the isolation chamber and removed the holy water vessel. She emptied it down the drain and dried it out as best she could. She poured the untouched water from her thermos into the vessel instead. There wasn't much, but perhaps it would be just enough. She replaced the vessel.

Kalya traded the scraper for a nozzle, engaged the water reservoir, and guided the point to the top of the acrylic box. She lined the nozzle up with an air hole and sprayed. 

Water flooded the acrylic box and boiled on contact. The demon thrashed. Straps holding the box to the table and the table to the floor vibrated with tension. Kalya kept her finger on the spray button until her resevoir sputtered dry. Then she checked her clock. The sample had turned after only a few minutes. 

The ink and water on the exam table separated like oil. The demon stood up in its box, all gangly legs, then hunched down again, shaking. Maybe she didn't have enough water. She'd submerged the sample entirely. Perhaps that was necessary with the demon as well?

Then the creature wailed and Kalya jumped as the sound echoed out of her console. It grated across her skin and made every hair stand on end. In the chamber, the demon contorted in its box. Finger-like appendages stretched, clawing and tearing at itself. The demon ripped its own black ink away like a layer of dried glue, and the unearthly wailing became the sobs of a girl.

Kalya stood very slowly, watching with short breath and wide eyes, as the demon in her isolation room became a black-haired human girl.

Suree had been right. Not knowing what the Church was doing was far better than this truth. Kalya scrambled to replace her water reservoir. She filled it to the brim with holy water from the tap. With determination she aligned the spray nozzle and punched the release, dumping holy water into the box fast enough that it filled the chamber and ran out the air holes. The girl twisted in the water, pushing at her confinement, scratching at the walls. She eventually sealed her mouth over one of the holes and breathed while Kalya poured every drop of the holy water into the chamber. She didn't stop until her nozzle sputtered, finally empty. 

Kalya landed heavily in her chair. The holy water drained out of the acrylic box. The girl sank to her knees inside, wet, but alive. And Kalya knew that if she took a sample, that girl would not be registered. 

She covered her mouth to keep a sob deep in her chest. How on earth was she going to keep her test results a secret, now?"

* I'm piecing together rebuild supplies with a friend who knows more about Miatas.

* I have some car parts I can sell online (need to pay for boxes and shipping stuff).

* I'll likely not have any income source until summer when I can pick up an internship.
* I've paid my credit card balance.

I need advice about how much money I can put toward a rebuild. Is this even the best route for me? What other things should I include? (I looked through rules and wiki).

Edit: My friend is telling me he expects a rebuild to cost around $1200. I don't have that and I don't expect these parts to sell for enough to cover. Should I use my credit card and carry a balance until I can get a job? That sounds like a bad idea."

Then the interviewer said that based on how well the interview was going, that I may be eligible for a full-time position in sales and started to almost downplay the internship position that I had applied for, saying that its only a few hours a week, no pay, etc. At this point, I felt as if I was trying to be coerced into a position that I have no interest in. I was then told that they would like a follow up ""interview"" where I would basically shadow a current employee in their sales department for an entire work day where I would learn more about the position, what the position pays, etc. 

I agreed to go through with the follow up, however, ever since the first interview, I feel as though I have made a mistake because I really want to gain experience in an HR position, as that is the field that I want to have a career in. 

How should I handle this situation? The more I think about it, the more shady this whole situation feels, almost as if they just want to throw me into a sales position because they need people to fill it. I have applied to other HR internship positions but have yet to hear back from any of them. 

I appreciate any advice or information.

Endure: Sierra Leone saw 42 players fight head to head to prove that their community was the best of the best - ending with Drew Hilliard ultimately becoming our inaugural winner. Utilizing the skype format alongside proboards, Endure kicked off with a highly dedicated cast with heated live tribal councils, knockout challenges, and enduring friendships that last beyond the game.

Endure: Solomon Islands kicked off with 20 brand new players showing the limits and constrictions of loyalty. Through limits on their gameplay, and no tribe switch, players found themselves testing tribe loyalty and friendships as ultimately, the underdog won with Sean Faulk coming out on top of the competition!

Endure: The Sundarbans saw it's most dramatic cast to date as 18 new castaways and 2 returnees fought against constant tribal council. As players worried about their safety more than ever before, Jake Bell slipped through the cracks against all odds and won in a near unanimous vote.

And we're back! A once wealthy independent trade city, Palmyra is one of the oldest standing cities founded in second century BC. Rome attempted to claim Palmyra as a Roman colony, but the Palmyrenes fought, overcame and declared their independence. More recently, Palmyra fell to ISIS amidst the Syrian war as many notable and historic monuments have been destroyed alongside their freedom. It's here, a city lined in ruin, that twenty brand new castaways will fight once again for their independence.

Endure: Palmyra is casting! Over three seasons, we have produced three distinct, diverse casts with a lot to offer - and boy did they deliver. Eighty castaways, three seasons, the Endure experience is unique in all it has to offer - and we're looking for twenty brand new castaways. We look in all gaming communities for the best of the best to add on to our exclusive alumni community! If you are interested in adding on to our current success, please contact a member of production labelled below and we will find the best time to sit down for an interview.

Everyone is asked to take part in a interview over Google Hangout (a process that takes around fifteen to twenty minutes) as a means to get to know you both as a person and a player. For three season, we have averaged over 80 interviews each season, so this will be the time to show us who you are. Contact info below.
We are looking for an incredibly dedicated cast who will go above and beyond expectations to dedicate to this game - it's highly intensive and very live-oriented. Our interview process will only be carrying out for one more week until March 3rd with a prospective start date of Sunday, March 20th. We encourage you to interview, the sooner the better.

Good luck potential castaways.

I am currently a senior CS student who recently decided that infosec was the direction I wanted to take my career.

However, I've been struggling on figuring out where to get started. I have experience in programming and web development, and security basics in my last job.

But I'm sort of at a standstill right now, I've been applying to every internship opening I can find in information security (which is not very many) but even with a pretty decent resume I have heard nothing back.

How can I springboard my future into the infoSec field? Is there anything else I could be doing besides looking for infosec internships, like certs? I'm currently at a loss for what to do at this point.

487c01,5,2016-02-28,Short term housing downtown Houston,tomes5,houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/487c01/short_term_housing_downtown_houston/,"Hello,

Little Background:
I am an undergrad college student and have accepted an internship with a company that is located in downtown Houston.  I have been endlessly looking for a short term apartment in or around the downtown area (zip code: 77002), but have struck out numerous times.  The places I have found are either out of my price range, aren't so nice, or do not offer short term leases. 

The company I will be working for gives me a $1000 stipend for housing per month.  The internship is roughly 12 weeks long, starting in mid May and ending in early to mid August.

About me:
I am a 21 year old dude who's a pretty social person.  I love to go out to bars and clubs so being close to the nightlife action would be great.  I do not have any pets nor do I plan to get one during the summer.  As of right now I am looking to live alone (bad past roommate experiences) so a one bed/one bath, a loft, or a studio could work.  I want to get the most out of this summer and have a great time, but I am flying blind with this living situation.  

Research:
From what I have read online the best areas to live for people my age seem to be Downtown, The Galleria, Midtown, Montrose, or The Heights.  I have also read that the Medical Center is a pretty solid option too.  

What I need:
I need a nice, affordable, short term place to live in or around the downtown Houston area.  The max I would want to pay for rent would be around $1200. 

Important Keys:
1) Safety - Although I am a pretty big guy I would much rather pay a little extra to live in a safer area.  
2) I do NOT want a long commute.  
3) Apartment amenities are a must.  I have lived in some pretty s****y places and want to treat myself to a nice apartment for the summer.  

I am open to just about anything so don't hesitate to throw some ideas out there.  Also, I have looked into the companies offered housing options and did not like them at all (which is why I'm here).  Let me know if my expectations are unrealistic and if they are let me know what I should expect.  

Thanks for the help!"

I feel like at work all of my co-workers get along really well and hang out outside of work. While they are nice to me it seems that I am never invited and that nobody really talks to me outside of work. I also feel this way when it comes to school. I am currently in my capstone class and I feel that a lot of the group members are friends but I'm more just an acquaintance. I actually am pretty outgoing and not many people know I struggle with depression so it really hurts me when I feel that although I am trying to make friends I just can't. In almost any instance (school, work, internships, social media, etc.) I feel like a spectator and not someone who is truly involved and I am generally very paranoid thinking that everyone around me secretly hates me. I know I'm rambling and this probably doesn't sound very rational, but it's how I feel. How can I deal with this?"

Will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question?

Or maybe you'll make me the company slut - spreading my legs to help close business deals.

4887ji,15,2016-02-28,Seeking Solace Through Sound Engineering,Jarl_Zackeus,misophonia,https://www.reddit.com/r/misophonia/comments/4887ji/seeking_solace_through_sound_engineering/,"My oldest memory of having triggers dates back to when i was about 9 years old, the usual causes such as lip smacking, constant repetitive grunting and heavy breathing. Dinner table noises essentially.

So naturally my parents thought that a kid was just being a kid, exploring different emotions, having tantrums when something bothered me that i wouldn't/couldn't tell them about. I had no idea what made me so infuriated until i turned 18 (I am 20 now). It felt as if I stumbled upon a groundbreaking scientific discovery when I learned about misophonia through a teacher at University, who randomly brought the topic up for a few seconds during a lecture. He said that his friend has the condition, and stated that it seems to be some for of insanity. As he briefly described symptoms of misophonia my brain clicked, and immediately did a google search on my smartphone. I wanted to tell someone about it then and there, but after remembering that everyone in the class room were told that it is a form of insanity i decided to keep it to myself until i got home.

A couple hours before dinner was ready, i compiled some youtube clips explaining what the condition entails, anecdotal excerpts from people suffering from it, and some conceptual videos portraying what it feels like to have it. I showed it all to my family after dinner, to finally break the ice on why i was (and still am of course) so angry all the time, why i rarely come out of my room, why i get twitchy and jittery every now and then, and why i abruptly will storm off and cause a violent ruckus in the next room. 

My Step-Father was very open minded and understanding, told me he has always wondered why i behaved strangely from time to time, covering my ears, using my fingers to repetitively prod my ear holes as if i'm tying to dig something out my ear canals, as if there were bugs or something inside. My Mother on the other hand just had a condescending grin, and kept rolling her eyes when i presented the clips i have gathered, as if she's non-verbally telling me ""really?"" in the most arrogant and ignorant way. She still thinks that i am making it all up, that i am a hypochondriac, or that i am simply lying for attention even though I became an adult that year, so what would be the fucking point of trying to gain some childish recognition. Sometimes i wonder if she's got Asperger Syndrome or something, she is the absolute worst person to have conversations with.


Anways, sorry for going of on a tangent. So to bring this back in relation to the title.

During senior high school, i developed an extremely strong interest and connection to music and production of music. It'd help me sleep at night, it'd mesmerize me whenever I listened to it on the train (people will always give me weird looks because i move and sway to the music). I decided that after high school i will pursue a career in sound engineering. It didn't matter to me what particular field it'd be (music, T.V broadcasting, recording clapping at golf tournaments). I figured, since i have such sensitive hearing i might as well put it to good use somehow. Instead of treating it like an anomaly in my programming, i'll treat it like a gift, a talent. I don't believe in destiny, because your path can always be altered with the push of an action, but destiny is how i like to see it in this instance.

I am in my 3rd and final year of studying sound engineering at university. I have gotten an internship at a T.V station to work during a Grand Prix tournament coming up this March. I believe i have found solace in this path, a sense of relief being able to manipulate and control sound, a safe haven. I have always been put in a state of zen when i am mixing songs for band's my friends and i have recorded. It's the one thing that takes me away from the purgatorial reality, constantly feeling angry by accordance of normal sounds almost everyone on the planet makes. Listening to music and playing guitar has been extremely therapeutic in my life, as it is for most people. Waves and frequencies are strange, they can radiate energy within your soul without uttering a single word.

To fellow people on this sub-reddit, i highly recommend playing a musical instrument, or pursuing something sound related as either a hobby or career.

Thought i'd share my story, thank you very much for reading."

488f3z,0,2016-02-28,Chris Rock's soap box,youmademethink,popculture,https://www.reddit.com/r/popculture/comments/488f3z/chris_rocks_soap_box/,"I must start with a disclaimer. I respect all people (treat others the way you wanna be treated, amiright?) and it is not my intention to bash any body, group, race, religion or whatever. Just trying to look at this through an objective lens… I’ve actually never posted on reddit before, but I feel so strongly about this, I just felt compelled to post something!
Currently watching the Oscars. Only ten minutes in and Chris Rock has already shoved his major points down our throats and claimed that black people haven’t had enough opportunity to be cast in big Hollywood roles. As expected, all the “white” folks squirmed in their seats (okay, there was laughing, but was it just me, or did it sound a bit forced?). Chris, while I respect your opinions (and love your standup specials btw), I can’t help but feel like you only skimmed the surface of the real issue at hand here. What else could you have done to make a more tasteful and powerful stance?
Black people don’t have enough opportunity to be cast in big Hollywood roles. Hmm.
First let’s think about at what Hollywood has been cranking out to the public the last few years. Lots and lots and lots of sequels, franchises, adaptations of book series and novels, superhero stories and continuations of stories from TV to the big screen.
For example, take a look at the top grossing movies of last year alone, according to boxofficemojo.com: (an asterisk will go next to a sequel/franchise/adaptation/not a completely original idea- as far as my knowledge)
1.	Star Wars: The Force Awakens*
2.	Jurassic World*
3.	Avengers: Age of Ultron*
4.	Inside Out
5.	Furious 7*
6.	Minions*
7.	The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2*
8.	The Martian*
9.	Cinderella (2015)*
10.	Spectre*
11.	Mission: Impossible- Rogue Nation*
12.	Pitch Perfect 2*
13.	Ant-Man*
14.	Home (2015)
15.	The Revenant
16.	Hotel Transylvania 2*
17.	Fifty Shades of Grey*
18.	The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water*
19.	Straight Outta Compton
20.	San Andreas
21.	Mad Max: Fury Road*
22.	Daddy’s Home
23.	The Divergent Series: Insurgent*
24.	The Peanuts Movie*
25.	Kingsman: The Secret Service
26.	The Good Dinosaur
27.	 Spy
28.	Trainwreck
29.	Creed*
30.	Tomorrowland* (arguable, as this was based off the area in Magic Kingdom in Disney World theme park, but the story is original? Idk screw it, it wasn’t original)
31.	Get Hard
32.	Terminator Genisys*
33.	Taken 3*
34.	Sisters
35.	Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip*
36.	Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials*
37.	Ted 2*
38.	Goosebumps* (also arguable, as the story is original, but the material wouldn’t have existed without the goosebumps book series)
39.	Pixels
40.	Paddington*
41.	The Intern
42.	Bridge of Spies
43.	Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2*
44.	The Big Short*
45.	War Room
46.	Magic Mike XXL*
47.	The Visit
48.	The Wedding Ringer
49.	Black Mass 
50.	Vacation*
Okay so… carry the 1…. aaaand our ratio of unoriginal works to original is 31 to 19, in this sample. Again, this is just to my knowledge, and I’m not about to rake the internet to research each movie. 
Seeing the proof here, the majority of what’s in the box office is linked to something we’ve seen before or material that came from other media, like books or comics or TV shows with pre-existing characters and settings. And thus, if the original character was not black, could they really cast a black actor/actress? They could. But it wouldn’t make sense.
If it made sense, as it did with Star Wars and Creed, then Hollywood did it. Kudo points for trying to diversify in sequel movies? At least they didn’t feel like forced castings.
Bear with me, let’s keep breaking down this movie list here.  
As far as the originals go (to my knowledge):
1.	Inside Out
2.	Home (2015)**
3.	The Revenant
4.	Straight Outta Compton**
5.	San Andreas
6.	Daddy’s Home
7.	Kingsman: The Secret Service**
8.	The Good Dinosaur
9.	 Spy
10.	Trainwreck
11.	Get Hard**
12.	Sisters
13.	Pixels**
14.	Bridge of Spies
15.	The Intern
16.	War Room**
17.	The Visit
18.	The Wedding Ringer**
19.	Black Mass 

Let’s see what we’ve got to work with…. Home, Straight Outta Compton, Kingsman: The Secret Service, Get Hard, Pixels, War Room and The Wedding Ringer all have at least one black actor in a lead role. 7 out of 19. Ehhhh perhaps this is where Hollywood could improve and diversify a bit mor- oh wait, we need to take into account the settings of some of these stories…
Revenant- did any black fur trappers exist on the American/Canadian frontier in the 1820’s? Hmm…
The Good Dinosaur- I didn’t see this, but to my knowledge, there is just one human in this film. Something tells me, if they made the only loin-cloth-wearing, wild-looking, bone-picking, jungle-living human in this film black, there would’ve been commentary regarding on how insensitive Pixar is to African-American culture. Besides, where it really counts, it looks like they hired a person with black-ish skin to provide the kid’s voice. Is this dark enough for ya? http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3603996/?ref_=tt_cl_t8
Spy and Sisters- two films (is it the only two films??) in the comedy genre with female leads. Don’t be stealing their thunder now…
Bridge of Spies and Black Mass- these are based on real people and real life events. Both movies’ settings do not lend themselves easily to having black characters (BoS based in America/Russia during the Cold War and BM featuring the Boston Irish mob). 
Okay, NOW we’re really left with: 
1.	 Inside Out
2.	San Andreas
3.	Daddy’s Home
4.	Trainwreck
5.	The Intern
6.	The Visit
I think it’s safe to say any of these movies could’ve featured a black actor/actress in a lead role and it would’ve made sense, wouldn’t change the story, and all would’ve been well. 
6 out of the top 50 movies we could fairly have a bone to pick with. That’s 12%. I don’t know Chris Rock, I’d say this isn’t strong enough evidence to support how you stood up on your soap box and loudly “joked” about how there isn’t enough opportunity for black people to be cast in Hollywood movies. 
So Chris, let’s tap into a few other points:
1.	What constitutes white people? #OscarsSoWhite. Are we forgetting a large number of people cast in Hollywood’s movies are British? How about the fact the white can also be divided up into several backgrounds that have their own cultures and heritages? Italian, Dutch, Polish, German, Irish, Greek, Spanish, Russian, French, just to name a few? Mr. Rock, why are we oversimplifying to just black and white? We need to look past just the color of the skin. There’s huge cultural differences between all of these groups. And when you referred to the history of your people, how blacks once were more worried about being lynched than about being placed in movies, who exactly was doing the lynching? Middle-class white Americans? Or the extremist groups of the South, like the KKK? Try to know your audience, Chris. You’re preaching to the choir. Millions of white Americans love and respect you and other black artists/actors, and go to your shows and pay money to see you/consume your material. You don’t need to preach to us about gaining respect.
2.	What about Asians? And further broken down into Japanese? Chinese? Malaysian? Indian? How about Mexicans? Brazilians? #BlackLivesMatter. No doubt about that. But what about everyone else? Shouldn’t Hollywood be diversifying ACROSS THE BOARD? Asians constitute about 5% of this country’s population and it seems the only big stars they could possibly identify with are Lucy Liu and Jackie Chan. And, if I remember correctly, Asians were also oppressed in this country for a long time (and in some ways, still are!). Ever hear of the concentration camps during WWII? Chris Rock, why didn’t you use your soap box to spread the word about diversity IN GENERAL, not just for blacks? 
3.	 African Americans constitute about 12% of the total population of our country. Yes, in more urban areas the population density shifts that number to be higher. But in total, about 1 in every 10 people in this country is “non-hispanic black.” Knowing what we know now about how many films black actors could’ve realistically been in, in this year alone, is it fair to have made jokes protesting that there weren’t enough opportunities given to black actors?
4.	Most writers and producers and directors in Hollywood are WHITE. They are talented, they are creative and WHITE. Why would you practically beg these people to hand out roles to black actors, just feeding into the vicious cycle of white power we’ve been maintaining for so long? Why not say some encouraging words, preferably to your black audience members watching the show at home, about how we need more diversity in the creative side of the industry? Call out your black audience to be more creative, to break the mold, come forth as writers and producers, filmmakers, cinematographers, all of the behind-the-screen positions that would really affect the CHANGE you and the rest of us want. These folks could churn out more stories that lend themselves easily to casting black actors and actresses in lead roles, and create more of a black presence in the industry in general. 
Ugh it’s getting late… Let’s wrap this up. Chris Rock- thank you for making me think. But I wish you did some thinking before writing your jokes for tonight.
What are your thoughts? Think I’m wrong? Call me out! I don’t take it personally, I enjoy healthy, objective debate.

I'm interested in netsec, but I'm not entirely too sure which way is the smartest route for me to take. 

I'm interested in going to the [University of Tampa](https://www.ut.edu/cybersecurity/) and majoring in their Cyber Security program, but what ""worries"" me is that: 1. it's considered a ""business degree"" (housed under the school of business), 2. I've heard that many Cyber Security degrees are essentially ""buzzwords"" (for lack of a better term), and are just for a cash grab and they typically don't do a great job preparing students for the real world. Though this program seems fairly good, as there is an entire course that focuses on the CISSP certification. I've also heard there are some companies to do internships with, which would obviously help me out tremendously. 

Since the program is a ""business"" degree, I can knock it out pretty fast since I've taken my fair share of business courses already. One downside is considering that the school is a private school, it's going to be expensive as hell, and not sure if the debt is worth it. 

I know CompSci majors are more sought after, as they are more rounded out than typical CySec majors. I'd do CompSci, but I'd need to take all the pre-reqs to even start the program (all in all, it'd take me at least another 3-4+ years to graduate, and I don't want to graduate at 26/27).

What would be the best option for me? Should I just major in CySec at UT or should I do a different major? I plan on learning to code and work on some skills to make myself stand out from the rest.

I would set goals and go after them with a laser focus.

But eventually... I stopped being so successful in reaching my goals - actually to the point where whenever I decided to try to do something I would get this really weird feeling. It was like I ""knew I wasn't going to stick with it"". And I would basically give up after a few days.

I am trying to figure out what is going on with me and how I can be successful in my pursuits like I was a kid. 

And it hit me today - the weirdest realization.

I wanted to share because I thought maybe for some here seeking motivation - it might not be ""motivation"" that you need. But something else instead.

When I was in college there was a program where instead of doing an internship working for a company - you could start your own company. How cool is that? I was totally 100% in. So in order to do that you had to go speak to the ""Entrepreneurship Advisor"". Which I did... and at the end of our session he tells me: ""You know. People like you don't usually stick with the program. Usually people like you end up slacking off and watching tv all day for the last 3 1/2 months of the program. But you're an adult now so if this is what you're planning on doing that is your responsibility to deal with those consequences.""

and I'm like... ok??? I mean it made me feel AWFUL!  Why on earth do I to this day remember this conversation so vividly?? I even remember calling my mom after and telling her what he said to me.

So I'm AGAIN thinking about this conversation today - a few years later... and it hits me. I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS BEFORE. Almost the same thing - lots of times before - by teachers and coaches from elementary school - middle school - and high school.

""People like you never stick with it and end up slacking off.""

I think that whenever I try to accomplish something I always remember this! I believe I'm not going to get it done so I just feel weird and scared and don't even bother trying. It is like part of my identity now. ""I'm someone who never finishes anything I start.""


Anyway, I just wanted to share because I figured maybe someone here will read this and they might relate to it. "

**What I want**

I want to become involved with financial markets, I'd love to do equity research and eventually I want to move to funds/portfolio management.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here is my story**

(*Just to be clear, I take full responsibility for my poor decisions, lack of effort and general apathetic lifestyle.*)

I finished highschool with top 10% grade but didn't want to do anything.

Took a gap year, played video games, hung out with friends and accomplished nothing.

I then spent a year at Uni studying physiotherapy, it wasn't for me so I stopped.

Unsure of what to do with no goals or ambition I took another year off study and worked for 2 companies full-time.

After that year, Uni was back on the table and and I stuck it out this time (thank god) graduating 3.5 years later.

So then I had a Business degree majoring in Finance, no internships of work experience and a 4.25 GPA ( 4.25 is about 55% for people out side of Australia).

I spent the next 6 months not being able to get a job in the investment sector, got a job in a call center for few months, then finally got a job in a retail bank as a personal banker (in hopes to gain access to internal transfers/jobs).

&amp;nbsp;


**So here I am today**  
Sad, defeated, regretful and full of questions I don't have the answers to.

Also, no relevant work experience, low GPA and a limited network.

&amp;nbsp;

**My current network**

Through uni I was paired up with a portfolio manager who I have coffee with once every few months. He is really helpful, through him I met a man that owns a funds management firm that may have an opening (I'm meeting him this week).
I've cold called a lot of companies and also just shown up and dropped off a resume looking for work experience. These efforts have probably netted me 8 or 9 coffees with people that help me with information but no work opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;


**What I've been doing now that I truly appreciated the depth of how fucked I am**

1.  I've been studying 3-5 hours a day and 5-10 hours on weekends for my CFA level 1 I sit this June
2. I spend between 30-45 minutes a day reading financial reviews, investing blogs and related investing content.
3. I have a long list of books I'm going to read once I've finished my CFA level 1 exam.
4. I already have been but I'm trying to network as much as I can, less so now that I work and CFA preparation.
5. I'm involved with the ASX trading game to try and get a deeper understanding of trading.
6. I have a portfolio of two stocks

&amp;nbsp;

**My Plan**

Stay at current role until June, talk with my manager about my goals and ask for her support to move internally to a more suited position. 

While doing this apply aggressively to roles that I previously was out competed for (having passed CFA level 1 should open doors to a few more interviews) 

Come September move to Sydney as there is more potential and more networking opportunities if I still haven't found a role related to investing.

Failing any progression towards equities research or a junior financial analyst position I am contemplating doing my masters in applied finance, in hopes to network, gain access to IB graduate programs and increase my skills and GPA.

&amp;nbsp;


**My Dilemma**

First of all, because I never tried at university I've essentially spent last 5 years of my life struggling, feeling like a failure. After that, finishing uni and getting knocked back from everywhere crushed what little spirit I had left. I don't think I have let myself feel truly happy or appreciate much in the last year. I don't think I have depression or anything of that nature, I think I'm sad because I grasp the depth of how fucked I am, of how behind I am and how near impossible my position is. I just become so overwhelmed being able to see so clearly all the mistakes I've made and the horrid position I am in today because of those decisions. **HOW DO I GET PAST THIS MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY?** 

Second, I just don't know what else to do. I don't know if there is anyway I can undue my low GPA bar committing 2 years to a masters degree.

I'm terrified that my life is decided, that my track record on my resume depicts the person that I was in place the committed student to investing that I'm becoming. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What else can I do?**

What excel skills should I be developing?

Which programs that analysts regularly use can I become accustom with from home?

Can you offer any advice or guidance or at least brighten my bleak outlook on where I am?

If you are an analyst or a portfolio manager or anyone in this field with experience, could you set me a task? Say, review this stock and report back to me your findings, then critique my report?

If you are in the investing field, would you mind sending me your email in a message so that I can ask you a question from time to time, or hear your own personal struggles and triumphs?

I'm literally open to anything and everything.

My dad's side will probably not understand me transitioning but still support me. I'll lose most of my friends as a few are against gay people and probably trans, whereas a few are accepting of gay but not trans, and then a few are accepting of both. I'll lose probably 3/4 or more of the people i currently know if i transition...

I was talking to my parents and they said that being trans will hold me back in things like jobs and college...

Between the finances of college and life it doesn't seem like i can transition for a few more years, how much does it actually cost?

*sigh* i just don't know what to do anymore. It seems like the closer i get to being able to transition, the more shit gets dumped on me.

EDIT: Forget all that behind this update. I just received a letter from the university I'm looking at going to. They sent a list of data about internships at local companies around them: Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc... the average internship is a year and pays at $850 a week, Transition is possible!!! (I'm going into the computer science world with a lot of experience and prior knowledge) I just need to work harder and get an internship!"

I'm a 27 year old BSW student at Carleton and I am heading back to Nova Scotia to work for the summer and do an internship in the fall.  Finances are tight and I'm in a position to either 

1) Get rid of all of my property as quickly as I can and rebuy it once I get to Halifax

or

2) Fine an affordable option to move property.

I have approximately 1 bedroom worth of property (not a 1 bedroom apartment; 1 full medium sized bedroom).

The most important stuff to get sent down is stuff that isn't easily replaceable that I can't sell, such as clothes and odds and ends.  If anyone is travelling down and has some room and wants to make a bit of money, I would work something with you.

I've loved sports all my life, played almost every sport there is offered to American youth, and watched endless hours of ESPN growing up.  Something else I always loved was video games, for as long as I can remember.  


  
Human competition and video games are two things I love very much and E-Sports is the ultimate combination of those two passions. I have stopped playing physical sports in recent years and have only played computer games in recent years (while still staying physically active of course). I've put countless hours into the big E-Sports games such as League, Dota, and CS GO, though I know i don't have the talent to be a professional player, but I have the passion for them to be a professional in the scene somehow.   

I currently have 2 semesters left for my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology and I do not want to have that boring IT desk job on reddit all day doing nothing.  I want to do something I have a passion for and that is E-Sports, but I have no clue how to get involved in the industry.  I'm currently living at home while commuting to college and taking care of my daughter full time and living off the money I have saved up.  I'm slowly running low on funds and will be finding a job to work 2-3 days for gas and car insurance, but I still want to spend all the time I can with my daughter.  

  
I have many talents with computers, but I love the hardware aspect more than anything, although I am able to do coding and web site design.  I have a good personality and get along with pretty much anyone and have no problem talking to people.  I feel like I have the personality to do something like Beyond The Summit and having their couch panels, I think I would excel in an environment like that.  Whether it would be someone discussing the events, or simply the guy that sets up all the hardware or being part of production.  Being a part of the E-Sports scene like that and being able to make enough money to support my daughter is my dream.   
 
 I don't ask for much, if i made $50,000 a year and that put food on the table, paid for internet and bills and enough extra to enjoy things with daughter (she loves sports and video games too of course) then I would be the happiest man on the planet.  Greed is something I frown upon heavily and I just simply want enough to be comfortable and stable in life while still having enough set aside for emergency situations.  

  
 
I posted here because I don't know where to start.  I visit reddit often because it has become a large part of the scene and the community and I enjoy being a part of it.  I know many of the big names in the industry browse reddit and I hope someone will stumble on this post and find a way to give me a shot at an internship or something to make my dream become a reality.  

  
Anyone who is able to help me out feel free to message my reddit account and I will give you my private e-mail address to further communicate through that.  

Thank you

Backup plan?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/48bh8j/no_internshipsprojects_graduating_soon_backup_plan/,"I'm graduating in May with a BS in CS, and lately I've been having extreme anxiety over my job prospects when I get out. I didn't really realize the importance of internships and side projects until recently. I didn't start programming until I declared it as my major at 24. I thought that in this field, just having a CS degree with good grades (3.5+) would mean I could at least find *something* to start out and then get better learning on the job, even if it's not a high-paying job you read about people here getting. 

My GitHub by the end of the semester will probably just have some school projects I've contributed to. I'm already incredibly stressed just trying to keep up with my major in-class projects this semester, so the thought of attempting to complete a side-project before May makes me sick with anxiety. And even if I had the time I don't feel like I have the skill. Really, doing other things besides programming on the weekends is the only thing that is keeping me sane. Not that I hate programming, it just dominates my thoughts so much at this point that I can't imagine adding more right now.

I read a lot on this sub and elsewhere that finding a job without these things is very hard for CS majors, so I'm really scared about my future. 

What do I do? Should I bail on programming and start applying for helpdesk type jobs instead? The past two years I've been working a school helpdesk-type position so I would at least have a little bit of experience. Or should I just apply for internships? Or do employers hiring for those not even want someone my age (26) or who is graduating? Should I go for QA instead, or are internships and projects equally important for those jobs?

I'm really struggling with this, so I'd appreciate any advice."

I'm at work for my university at the moment, and didn't have a lot of time to talk since I had some people that needed help, and now I have to make other phone calls. So maybe some of my fellow bucco bros can shed a little light about it in the mean time.

They gave me a quote of $636 for lower level and $485 for upper level. Is that a set seat for my package or just kinda wherever there is room available at the time I purchase it?

It comes out to $31.80 per lower seat game and $24.25 per upper seat game. Is the upper seat one even a deal? I recall getting some awful, last second tickets with my girlfriend for the Cards right before playoffs, and I think I still paid pretty much the same. It seems to me that the lower seats were generally $40+ a game last season (I could very well be wrong though.)

Or is this just not really a good deal at all, and would I be better off just going to a game when I feel like it and picking up a ticket at PNC?

Thanks guys for any help, I'm really excited about being close to PNC this summer!

While I've completed the basic coursework in assessment (WAIS/WISC/Projectives/Personality and some basic neuropsych like the D-KEFS, NEPSY, etc.), I've received limited exposure to neuropsych testing during my practica.  In other words, I've administered about 5 batteries and have written three or four reports, but nothing beyond that. Two of my supervisors have been ABPP certified neuropsychologists, but I regretfully did not receive much exposure despite that fact. Despite my initial lack of interest in neuropsych, I've increasingly realized that I'm very interested in doing testing as my training has progressed.  

My question is this: What would be the best way for me to position myself to someday offer neuropsych testing in a private practice setting?  At this point, it seems like it would be impossible for me to do an APA internship and postdoc in neuropsych, which is what (as far as I understand) I would need to do in order to receive certification from the ABPP.  My reasoning is that compared to my peers who are pursuing neuropsych and getting APA internships in that area, my experience seems far too limited to make me competitive at these sites.  Then, without a neuropsych-oriented APA internship, I imagine that I would be precluded from gaining admittance to a neuropsych postdoc/fellowship. Given all this, it seems like I've already missed my opportunity, but I really hope that isn't the case.

Again, what I imagine myself doing in the future is offering testing (alongside psychotherapy) in my private practice.  However, I've heard a lot of conflicting information regarding whether I would be able to do that without formal ABPP certification. Some have said that any licensed clinical psychologist can administer neuropsych testing (and, most importantly, bill insurance companies for it), but others have said that ABPP certification is necessary in order to do these things. Which is the truth? If I plan to do testing in a private practice setting (rather than in a hospital) would it be sufficient for me to forego certification and instead piece together my own ""training program"" in order to ensure that I'm competent? My fourth year practicum will have more of a neuropsych focus, and I imagine that my APA internship (regardless of its setting) will as well. On top of that, I would seek some kind of informal fellowship/apprenticeship with a certified neuropsychologist, maybe take some extra coursework, and attend as many trainings and conferences as I can. If I do all of that, could I offer testing?

I really hope I haven't missed the boat.  Thanks!"

I'm a 24 year old female from Europe living in the southern United States.

I started teaching myself photoshop, illustrator and indesign about two years ago, and am now very adept in all three. I had used HTML and CSS since I was 12 and know bootstrap  ; I am pretty much fluent in both. I started marketing my programming and graphics skills in the last year and picked up about 6 individual paying clients, along the way I learned Wordpress and some basic php. 

I just recently started looking to get into a design agency kind of job. I had a few interviews but didn't get anything, the one that was kind enough to give feedback said they went for a candidate wth 'a lot more experience.'

I'm kind of wondering what my next steps should be? Internships, learn more skills, keep trying? 
Improving coding: get really good at JavaScript, learn angular or another framework.
Improving graphics: learn Adobe animate, or start with mesh 3D graphics
More applying: there's not a ton of graphic design agencies in the southern city I live in. I wonder if I should email the few that there are and ask if they have internship programs? Because there are so few I'm concerned about blowing my chances.

This led to multiple changes of circumstances in life. Socially and mentally. One thing that I've noticed through multiple mental battles due to these situations, is that sometimes it's important to let go of things, and build anew instead.

For me, this was when I got kicked out of college. Ironically, it ended up being one of the best things to happen in my life. It gave me the opportunity to self-reflect, and eventually, build upon anew. Which is why I can work so much harder nowadays, even if the cause of getting kicked out of college was not due to me being lazy.

When I was in the process of getting kicked out of college, I also could have chosen to stay in, actually. But the school in question would have given certain negative marks that would have made process difficult, if not nearly impossible.

I know of a few people who got into similar situations, and attempted to finish the education anyway. This almost always went wrong. Which was the reason I decided to change plans, and go through a different route in life. And as a result, it's going well right now.

If I had decided to finish my vocational degree, I wouldn't have been where I'm now this fast, and this well. Most likely, I wouldn't have gotten a better vocational degree anyway. If I had tried to *survive* the negative marks from my first internship, no doubt I would've had an even harder time.

Instead, I decided to stick with what I got, and build from there. Slowly, bit by bit, and as a result I just finished an internship with my new major, a bachelors in physics. This went well, I've *revived* through the process.

This has been a long post, but it boils down to the following; don't be afraid to let things go if it's necessary. You can try to rearrange the furniture in a burning house, but you won't get a good night sleep in that bed. Getting past past problems sometimes means letting go. No matter how hard it can be."
48cn1u,1,2016-02-29,Trying to escape a rotten local paper,ManNo3,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/48cn1u/trying_to_escape_a_rotten_local_paper/,"I could use some advice. Apologies if this is a bit nebulous (or perhaps over-specific), but I'm feeling pretty stuck in my career and I'm not sure how to get out of my situation.

The short of it is, I've been working at a really bad paper for a while now and having a hard time finding new work. In fact, I'm worried that working at this paper is actively undermining my attempts to find new work.

Quick background that explains some of my predicament: I wasn't a journalism major in college, and didn't plan on entering the business until right around the time I graduated. Thus, I didn't have any internships.

I started out after college freelancing for my local statewide daily, a job I got with clips from my college paper. It was great work, but after about a year I wanted to get out of my home state and move to the city. In retrospect, that was a dumb and arrogant choice and I really regret it. Severely overestimating the amount of opportunities I'd find, the job hunt took something like nine months and drove me into the job I have now, which is part editorial, part production, part staff reporter at a chain of local weeklies in the immediate suburbs of the city. It sounds decent on paper (except that the hours are even worse than you'd imagine from that brief description), but there's a problem: quite simply, these guys suck. The paper is completely, shamelessly in the pocket of the local elite. I'm not pearl-clutching about the harsh realities of the business here: I've literally heard bosses say things like ""he doesn't pay, he gets no play."" I've had stories as routine as municipal election write-ups and mild budget cuts spiked because of the POSSIBILITY that the mayor or some councilor will feel ruffled (once, after a state rep. who took out some ads with us lost re-election to a guy who hadn't, I was told to remove the election story from the paper altogether. Just make no mention of it. ""He's been good to us,"" I was told. ""Why rub it in?""). I've submitted stories only to hear the advertising director immediately call a city official and ask their permission to run them. I can't emphasize this enough: I'm literally NOT ALLOWED to write anything that isn't fluff or hagiography. And man, I tried to change the culture here. I fought and made my case for something like a year, and if anything, things have gotten even worse. They just don't give a damn.

Which brings me to the problem which brought about this post: beyond just hating my job and fearing that my instincts are going to atrophy, I don't have any opportunity to write decent clips. I really want to move on, find something at a bigger outlet, hopefully find something with a stronger web component, or at the very least a moderate step forward at a paper that isn't actively bad, but I just don't have a hell of a lot to show that I'm proud of from my time at this place.

The way I figure it, I have a couple options:
- Look for a job at a different local outlet which hopefully has a better culture. (This is more or less what I've been trying, and without much luck. In my market, there are basically super limited freelance gigs I can't afford to take and two big, prestigious papers who won't give me the time of day.)
- Keep at this job until my resume looks good enough to give me a leg-up. (I've been in my current job about two years now)
- Find a job that's nearish to journalism but with better hours, say public relations officer at a non-profit, and use the extra time and energy to submit freelance work. 
- Develop some technical skills and try my luck in a different news medium (I have a mild stammer, which has always kept broadcaster off my radar, but I'd happily pursue production if I saw a path).
- Accept that life is a vale of tears and be a happy Sisyphus.

Do any of those sound reasonable? Is there something I'm not thinking about? Really, any advice, even if it's just a chuckle and ""shitty papers early on are par for the course"" would be really appreciated."

I'm in my 2nd semester of 3rd year for my bachelors in CS and am on track to graduate next May. For the past 3 years (and currently) I've been working part-time as a computer technician (full time on school breaks) to pay my bills. I have quite a few concerns about entering the field and actually getting a job. 

----

Courses I've taken:

*   Introductory Comp Sci Courses (101/102 equivalent)
*   Computer Architecture
*   Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
*   Calculus 1/2 + Linear Algebra/Discrete Maths

Currently Taking:

*   Organization of Programming Languages (ProLog/Haskell/Ruby
*   Computer Networks
*   Web Development (Front End + Back End)

----

What field do I want to go into? I have no idea, should I know by now? I really like automation and I tend to write a lot of little macros in PowerShell/AutoHotKey to help automate software installs at work, and I've been learning how to make custom unattend files to get the most out of sysprep since I deal with a whole lot of imaging. Is there anything like this out there? I also really like video games but completely understand that it's no game actually making them, so I haven't really thought about that further at the moment.

-- --

Do I need an internship before I get a job? Sure i'll graduate with 3-4 years experience as a Computer Technician which is great, I've attained some people skills, obviously basic computing knowledge, and other things, but I'm not getting any real programming experience from this. I'm currently saving up so I can leave my current job before school ends so I'll have time to find an internship or job.

----

Is there a point where I should feel knowledgeable about CS? I mean sure compared to me freshman year I know a whole lot, but when I browse around on some programming subreddits I'm pretty intimidated by some of the stuff going on I feel like I should know, i'm not sure. 

----

How important are personal projects? I've done a little with some social network API's like making basic twitter bots and stuff, and am working with my professor and another student on building a drone and automating it with custom python software. Will I need to invest some time into bigger programming projects though? I love the idea of personal projects but for the life of me can't think of something that I know how to do (or know enough to get started) and feel like I'd enjoy doing it.

We did the long distance for 7 months and it was working out fine. We got to see each other once a month and during winter break. 

I'm an engineering major, so I found out that I won't be home for summer, spring, fall, and half of winter break due to an internship/co-op. She is also going into a graduate program, so we would have to be in a long distance relationship for 3 more years in total.

We broke up yesterday after deciding there wasn't a way to make it work. After doing this, we both noticed that it's impossibly hard and we still care greatly for each other, which we knew when breaking up. She holds that she thinks it may be the best for both of us. I believe that it may not be, but I do not know. We've always had a pretty good relationship with some bumps, like any relationship, and the only thing driving the break up was the amount of distance and lack of time to see each other.

I really do love her and I believe over summer break she would be able to stay with me for long periods of time. Is this just how breaking up is? Am I seeing it as greener on the other side of the street? 

I still care so very much for her and I never stopped caring about her. The main issue is the distance and lack of time to see each other, especially with the internship and co-op during the school year. 

Is it worth trying a relationship again or should we let each other go?

I know there may be someone else out there for the both of us, but it doesn't feel that way currently and she is wonderful. I think the feelings are mutual in our love and feelings for each other.

What should I do? Should I let it settle and see how I feel? Is this just loneliness/attachment?

Additionally we would like to stay friends if we decide to stay broken up. What is the protocol on that? Just whenever we're ready. Should we still talk during the healing phase?
   
**tl;dr**: SO of 2 years in LDR for 6 months. Mutually decided to break up due to 7 hours driving distance and lack of time to see each other. Once a month usually and no breaks (summer[internship; could see her some], and half of winter).

Should I try it again or what do I do?

Before anything, let me tell you a bit more about my situation :

Six months ago, I started working as an intern in a Swiss startup (4 employees including me). Although I have 2 years of profesionnal experience behind me, starting as an intern was my only chance to join the company immediately (at the time, they were still struggling financially and couldn't afford a full time employee). I knew the company's project was really promising so I didn't care much about my status and salary, knowing it would get much better in the near future.

During these six months, the company has signed major contrats while being financially supported by investors. Basically, they have money going in. I also learnt today that my boss in considering hiring me for good.

Since I never had to negociate a real contract for a position in a startup before, I'm asking you guys if you had any advices to share ?

I'm aware that a startup won't offer me a very competitive salary. All I want is not to get screwed because I'm kinda novice when it comes to negociating.

It might be irrelevant, but my boss and I are getting along pretty well. He knows I'm invested into his project and that I wish to work with him in the long term.

Any ideas fellow redditors ? What should I be cautious about ?"
48d4vy,3,2016-02-29,Advice for making a career in the craft beer industry?,throwaway5861976,CraftBeer,https://www.reddit.com/r/CraftBeer/comments/48d4vy/advice_for_making_a_career_in_the_craft_beer/,"Hey, everybody. I'm 28/M and a recent college grad with my bachelor's degree in business management who works at a very popular craft beer bar. I've also been homebrewing for a number of years now and has a decent pulse on the industry. I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable and capable when it comes to beer. I would say craft beer is a passion of mine and would love to make a living working in this booming industry. However, living in Michigan means I have to compete in a heavily saturated environment since craft beer is more popular here than a lot of other places in the US. Despite these challenges, I've taken to the streets by visiting various breweries/bars and inquiring about job opportunities and even volunteer work. I've also been hitting the Internet hard looking for jobs. I check sites like Bevforce regularly and apply for jobs that I'd like, even ones that are out of state. Despite my efforts, I've gotten no real promising feedback from anyone using both these methods.


Then about a month ago, I got a job offer from my General Manager at the bar to be a Beer Program Manager for a new bar location opening up most likely later this year. This job would be exactly what I want to do in terms of working directly with beer -- talking to distributors and sales reps and placing keg orders with them, designing the menus, planning beer-related events, that sort of thing. I told my GM that I was very interested and he said he'll try to get me some training shifts with our own Beer Program Manager soon. Awesome, right?!


However, while I've been waiting to see some training shifts on my schedule, I recently discovered that the starting pay would only be ~$14/hour and working around 60 hours/week (sometimes more), not to mention I'd likely have to relocate out of state away from my friends and family. When I heard that, it made me seriously reconsider following through with this. But on the other hand, if working with craft beer is really a passion of mine, it shouldn't matter what sacrifices I have to make or how much it pays or how bad the hours are, right? I could perhaps just use this opportunity as a stepping stone to bigger and better things somewhere else if it means I can get precious management experience. I think most of us know the problem that college grads face when looking for a job (how are you supposed to gain experience if every employer is already looking for experienced candidates?) so this could be my ticket to attaining that while staying in my desired field.


It's also probably worth mentioning that my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years now and are wanting to get married soon. I'm currently not making nearly the amount of money I'd like to in order to properly support us and a family later on down the road and that $14/hour wouldn't be enough, either. She is doing an internship as a forensic analyst and will be looking for a career in that field when she finishes that up in the summer. We had a talk about all of this and she said she was open to following me out of state if I were to relocate so that's not really an issue.
A number of people have suggested that I try to open up my own brewery. While this sounds great on paper, I'd like to keep the homebrewing a hobby and not get dollars and cents involved as it could ultimately destroy the enjoyment it gives me. There's also the extra challenge I would face with the aforementioned heavy saturation of craft beer establishments in Michigan already.


I'm also just as open to working in the business side of the industry such as human resources and administration type jobs, but like everywhere else, breweries and bars alike want years of experience so I keep getting the the same type of ""we'll keep your application/resume on file and call you if there's an opening"" responses.


So now I'm seeing what advice/words of wisdom the wonderful world of Reddit has to offer. Is there anything that I can do that I haven't thought of yet? Any advice would be so much appreciated. Thanks for reading."

My husband replied with a funny birth plan for us:

&gt; - On arrival, and as necessary afterwards, [heyfignuts] would like a cocktail of all the best pain killers modern medicine has to offer. Please be creative, and lean more bitter than sweet. 

&gt; - As well, please provide an unpaid marketing intern alongside us for the birthing process. His or her role will be to sarcastically live-tweet our baby's once-in-a-lifetime event.

&gt; - Once [heyfignuts] is settled, please play Ride of the Valkyries to get us pumped up.

&gt; - If any persons claiming to be our family show up at the hospital before or within three hours of the completion of delivery of the baby, please shoot foam bullets at their feet until they get the message and run away.  

&gt; - Please outfit the delivery room in full spectrum lighting because we need all the vitamin B we can get.

&gt; - During the second stage of birth, [heyfignuts] will assume the squatting position, or be on all fours. Not because it is the more ""natural way"", but because dat ass.

&gt; - In order to encourage [heyfignuts] to push harder while in delivery, we will be playing a marathon of Barney the Dinosaur at a slightly unreasonably loud volume with the monitor near her face, so there is nowhere else for her to look.

&gt; - Make sure the baby has an ""innie"".

&gt; - As our first meal following delivery, please charcoal-grill the placenta, as you would a fish at a fine Greek restaurant, along with a side of freshly made sushi and a foie gras torchon.  

Made me LOL after a stressful day!"

I am a (somehow given the market conditions) geologist that is wondering how to change careers into the programming field. I do a lot of VBA programming as part of my job and really enjoy solving the unique problems people need solved for their macros (we do a lot of tedious excel work). I’ve had some previous experience as an engineering intern at a software company as well with C++ and a bit of C, but my skills in those languages is all but nil. I signed up for a part time SQL and relational database course at a local post secondary school as well to start down this path, and start in April.

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for switching fully into a CS career from scientific career, and any useful pointers would be wonderful!
