I was told to write down my story as it’s rather extraordinary, or so I’m told. It all seemed so unsubstantial and natural at the time that I never noticed the unusual nature of it all until it had become my reality. So here is my story. 

I was 23 and just out of college with a shiny finance degree, gorgeous girlfriend and an incredible job offer. I was high on success and arguably justifiably quite full of myself. I had the best job of my limited friends, the best looking girlfriend of my friends and coworkers and what looked like an incredible future ahead of me. That first year was the best, filled with happy hours with coworkers, nights out with my girl Melissa, life was good. Towards the end of that first year at Smitt &amp; Liminz (my old company) I received a huge promotion, becoming the youngest employee at the firm to receive said promotion. My buddies threw a party for me to celebrate and I, well I indulged quite heavily.
We were at the club in the VIP section with bottle service. You’ve seen movies. We were living it up, and drinking incessantly. Around 11 or so I began to black out, and by 12 I was done. According to my friends I left, grabbed a cab and went home. Whether this happened I’m not sure, but what I do know is that the next morning I woke up in a college dorm next to a girl I had never seen before. Shit.
Freaking out, I grabbed my stuff, ran out the room and headed for the elevator. As I stood waiting for the elevator, I searched for my phone with no success. I had to find out what happened last night, I truly had no memory and felt sick with guilt. I loved my girlfriend and I knew this would ruin her, she’d never forgive me. The years of egotistical neglect of her all flushed away as I recognized she was light-years out of my league and there was no way I could keep her if she found out about this. The doors opened and I stepped in, still wrapped up in thought and the increasingly loud internal debate on whether I should tell Mel or not.
The doors shut and I look over to see the girl standing next to me. I had never seen that face before. Rather I had never seen that look of disgust, or more so anger on Melissa’s face before. I stood there with my work shoot unbuttoned, my bare chest showing through it, my pants on but the belt undone. I was a billboard for one night stand walk of shames. I could tell in her eyes she knew and there was no escaping. Not only were we done, but she hated me. I didn’t blame her. 
Seemingly as fast as that look of disgust took over her face, it had left. What remained was what I can only describe as dejected acceptance accompanied with a slight consistent nodding. She hit the next floor, turned forward and away from me; still nodding slightly. As the doors open and she walked out, she looked back and to this day I’m not sure what exactly I saw, but at the time I could have sworn it was a slight smirk. That was the last time I saw her for a year. 
I accepted it, I fucked up and got caught. That’s life. I couldn’t bare to apologize though, it was one of the more cowardly things I have done. In the elevator I couldn’t find words, and the following year I never got the balls to apologize or explain or anything. Sometimes I wonder if I had the balls then, if I’d still have them now. 
Life carried on. 
I found continued success with firm, though more gradual. I found a new girlfriend, albeit not as sexy or smart as Melissa. But that would be hard to do. Melissa was a PHD student at a very reputable university, she majored in something related to psychology though I can’t remember what. She had told me, but most of our relationship I was too obsessed with myself to pay enough mind to her. My new girlfriend though, Sara, was a bartender and overall pretty simple. I enjoyed the lack of effort things required with her, she liked sex, drinking and having fun. Which after Mel, was all I could really handle, so it worked. At least they worked for a couple months.
It was around 2 months into our relationship, about 3 months after Melissa, that things began to spoil. Sara was more or less moved in with me but towards the last month she decided she wanted to sleep in my guest bedroom. The reason being, my Mom had a form of narcolepsy that caused her to not enter a type of deep theta sleep, which causes her to be extremely tired throughout the day. The doctors have told me that I most likely have some form of that, but they’ve had success with a new type of sound machine that repeats rhythms that resemble the sleep waves experienced by the brain the cycle of sleep that I don’t enter. Or something like that, I was never too sure of how, but I knew it worked. So when I would go to sleep at night I would have to wear these sound proof headphones hooked up to my, what I call, sleep machine. This machine is a little noisy as it runs which caused Sara some sleep issues, so she moved to the other room. Where she slept is really inconsequential honestly, we split up pretty soon after she moved rooms. 
It started off as gradual little fights, which then kind of carpet bombed into bigger fights. Sara was a very social girl, she had a huge group of friends. So when we would go out we’d spend a lot of time with her friends just kind of hanging out and drinking, or going clubbing or hitting bars. Sara had always liked how as she described, ‘manly’ I was, which I took as her meaning protective or as a therapist would probably call, defensive. I always kind of took no shit, if guys would throw jabs at me or poke fun I’d always shut it down. I guess this turned Sara on, so when I had stopped doing it and began taking more jokes and insults she took notice. 
The situation where she eventually called me on this and brought my attention to it was at her apartment on a Friday. We were hanging out in her living room with 5 or 6 of her friends. Most of which were male. One of these guys I would later find out was her ex, who she dated for like 3 years. I guess he wasn’t completely over her because he was NOT a fan of me. I was wearing a salmon colored polo with some blue chino’s this night, an outfit I had bought recently. I was normally not into wearing pastel colors or really any bright colors but as I was walking past the stores to work I saw it in the store and just had to have it. The first thing Jared said as I walked into the room was less than flattering; ‘Damn bro, you mix up you and Sara’s clothes in the wash or something?’ This was of course met with a round of laughter and all eyes on me. Sara’s included. I was taken aback and not prepared for this. I was expecting a fun night, I didn’t know why he was being so mean to me. 
“Uh heh, no I guess I mixed up my whites and reds again” I murmured off trailing off with a disheveled laugh. 
It registered with me that that made no fucking sense at all. I didn’t know why I had said that, why didn’t I come back at him with one of my usual, self-admittedly funny comebacks. Something like ‘I stained my other shirt, so I had to use one of the ones we threw out of yours when you got dumped.’ Or something, anything besides that. It doesn’t even make sense, whites and reds? My shirt is salmon colored. Now it’s something when it wasn’t anything. What the hell. 
By the time I realized what I said, Sara was already up and out of the room. I followed her instinctively out and into the kitchen. 
“What the fuck Mike, what the fuck was that?”
I couldn’t figure out why she was being mean to me too, if anything she should be nice to me here, I had just been embarrassed in front of all her friends. I couldn’t think of what to say, again. 
“Uh, I’m sick of this, you’ve been acting so weird lately. Like, I don’t know, you just seem like a little bitch lately. I need a man Mike, what happened to the aggressive guy I met at the bar so many months ago huh?”
She was screaming now. 
“Sara, quiet, please. You don’t need to yell, I’m sorry okay? What do you want me to do? Jesus, stop yelling.”
“I’m sorry? What do you want me to do? Are you fucking kidding me! Get the fuck out of my apartment, call me when you find your sack” 
I didn’t even say anything. I just grabbed my coat and walked out. That was humiliating for me. I had always been the alpha if you will and had just been fully emasculated in front of all my griflriends friends, including her ex. I went home and took a nap. 
When I woke up I went up to go watch some Netflix on my computer. As I opened up Chrome I habitually opened up Facebook and Instagram and then went to Netflix. I looked through the shows and couldn’t decide on anything. I flipped back to Instagram and paused. The first picture on the feed was Sara. She was at the club now, in different clothes too. Before she was wearing a cute little sundress with floral print. Now she was in a tiny little leather black skirt with a white bandeau, leaving a good 5-6 inches of bare stomach. What was more shocking than her clothing was the picture and the people in it. She was on the left, her left arm around Jacob, her right arm raised with a glass, and her right leg hooked and raised up around Jacob, so that her knee was right above his crotch. What the fuck. 
I couldn’t think, my head was spinning. Was she cheating on me with him right now? I just fucking left her there with him while she was pissed off, I’d have never done that before. What is going on? 
I picked up my phone and called her. It rang twice and went to voicemail. She fucking ended my call immediately. I texted her, trying to not act panicked, I wanted to come off like the old Mike. Remind her of why she was with me. So I typed “Hey Sara, I really am so so sorry about earlier tonight, anyways I hope you have fun tonight!”
I felt better, I knew she would get the text remember she was dating me and that she did like me and I’m sure things would blow over tomorrow. Feeling better I got into bed, put on my headphones and closed my eyes. 
The machine whirred on and the rhythm began to play, putting me in a trancelike state right away. Conditioned from years of the same sleep habit, I think that my body had grown so accustomed to the sleep machine that as soon as I had the headphones on and the rhythm began to hum in my ear I would immediately go into sleep mode. 
The machine hummed in flowing beats, raising and lowering in a consistent rhythm. 
I slept deeper into unconsciousness.
The machine continued its humming.
The warm blackness of sleep began to envelop my body as all the muscles in my body relaxed and I sank into my bed. I sank like I was afloat in the middle of an immense lake.
“Yes, you are in the middle of a lake. 9. You sink deeper into the lake, the dark waters rising around you. 8.”

I woke up early the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to go. I instinctively check my phone to see the apologetic responses I was expecting from Sara. I found none.
No apologetic responses. I did have 1 unopened text from her though. I click the text app and opens up onto my screen was a picture of Sara’s beautiful face. Her beautiful face covered in what I can only surmise was Jacob's thick white cum. Ropes of Jacob’s seed stretched down her hair, over her right eye and down to the corner of her lip. Under the eye was traces of running mascara. The corner of her lip which was raised in a huge teeth baring smile which showed more slimy coating across her entire mouth. 
Under the picture was the text accompanied this portrait of infidelity; Jacob’s balls still work, sorry yours don’t. Bye

Several weeks passed. I went through these weeks in a bit of a daze. No day sticking out in particular, everything just seeming to be a blur. Reminiscent of when you drink heavily the night before and upon thinking back over the events you get bits and pieces but everything has a muddied quality to it. Maybe just nothing of importance happened, or that the event culminating this period of unconsciousness was so substantial that it shadowed the period prior. 
My boss walked into my office and closed the door rather abruptly. 
“Mike I need to talk to you, and it's nothing serious in terms of your job or anything, your performance is fine. It’s more about your behavior.”
“Wait, what? I’m sorry sir, I’m a little confused, what do you mean?”
“Well I mean c’mon Mike, you have to have some awareness of the change in your behavior, its been quite substantial?”
“Sir..”
“Okay Michael, if you’re going to make me say it I will, I personally don’t care but some people have been talking to HR. Some people are reporting that you’re being a little to touchy with them, and then that incident with the bathroom. You had to know something was going to come of the bathroom incident. Now what you do in your spare time is your own business, but when you’re here the only business that's yours is our business.”
With that he was up and heading out of my office without saying anything else. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about. Nothing had happened the past couple weeks, in fact from what I noticed I had seen less of people than normal even. What was he talking about? Being touchy? The bathroom incident? I was so confused. 
I went to my closest friend at work, Allison, and asked her if she knew what he might be talking about. It was pretty embarrassing bringing it up, but I was too worried about my job to care.  
“Hey Allie, so this is kind of weird and I’m not sure how to bring it up, but do you have any idea why Charles Smitt was telling me I need to be more careful about my uh, behavior? I honestly have no idea what he was talking about, have I been touchy with you or any other of the girls?”
She giggled at this, which confused me even more. 
“Oh Mike c’mon, are you kidding? No of course not, you haven’t been touchy with any of the girls at all. And whats up with you calling me Allie all of a sudden? Only my girlfriends call me that”
I didn’t call her Allie did I? I had known Allison since college, I had never called her Allie before. 
“Okay good, I’d never want to do anything to make you uncomfortable, I hope you know that Allie.”
“There you go again calling me Allie, whats up with you silly. I wouldn’t get too happy though, I think those complaints were coming from a couple of the male interns. That and I’m sure that whole bathroom thing was probably what he meant”
What the fuck. Male interns? I had worked with them the past couple of weeks but I don’t remember ever really being around them. 
“Bathroom incident? Why do people keep bringing that up, I don’t know what they’re talking about!”
“Oh Mike c’mon, I’m you’re friend and you know I’ll have your back but you can’t deny that it was weird and inappropriate”
“Allie I really don’t know what ‘incident’ you’re talking about”
I heard it that time, I really did call her Allie. Why?
“Mike you really don’t remember?”
“No”
“You don’t remember standing at the stand up urinals in the bathroom and blatantly looking over at the guys next to you?”
What the actual fuck. That never happened, no way. I would literally never do that. I’m not gay at all, I would never do that, only if I wanted to see what theirs looked like. I would absolutely never do that, what is going on right now?!?
“Allie that never happened..”
“Okay listen Mike, you’re starting to kind of weird me out. You keep calling me Allie and you keep acting like you haven’t been overtly flirting with the male interns. Look you know my brother’s gay, I have no problems with it but don’t bring it into work and just don’t pretend like you’re not to me. I’m one of your few allies left here.”
With that she got up and left. I didn’t know what to say or do. My head was spinning. As soon as she said what the bathroom incident was it all came back to me. How did I not remember this before. It was as vivid and clear as a picture, I saw myself walking into the bathroom with both Peter and Andrew standing at the 2 outer urinals and me going to the middle one. I remember myself standing there and starting to go to the bathroom and then standing up on my tip toes to look over both panels separating the urinals. No acts of sleuth or trying to hide it, just as blatant as day. As if I wasn’t even thinking, just acting on sheer impulse. 
I felt dizzy and nauseous. I went to my office and immediately threw up in my trashcan. I hadn’t felt this sick in years. Sitting down gently, trying my best not to arouse any stress in my stomach, I type up an email to my boss informing him that I feel terribly ill and will need the week off to improve. I immediately get an email back saying to take two weeks off, recommended by HR. I was too sick and my head was spinning far to fast to worry about my forced time off. I left work and got a cab home. 
As soon as I got into the cab the nausea dissipated and I felt better. Not great, but certainly better. It occurred to me then what might be a good idea to take off the edge and help me not think about what was going on; since that was the last thing I wanted to do, think about what had just transpired. I tell the cabbie a new destination, to which he complies. When we arrive I go into the red brick apartment building, buy some weed and then return to the cab to go home. I was almost excited to get home and smoke to my heart's content and not have a worry in the world. Seemed like the perfect escape to whatever the hell just happened to me.
I did just that. I went home and smoked weed, ate, watched TV and slept for 2 weeks straight. I found when I smoked weed I got incredibly tired but at the same time couldn’t sleep without my sleep machine on. So I spent most of those two weeks in bed in and out of sleep with those headphones stuck to my head. 
“8. You’re going deeper and deeper into the lake, as you go deeper and deeper, you leave behind all your regret, all your guilt, all your worries. 7. As you float down your left with nothing but a feeling of peaceful relaxation. You can feel it all through your body, as you go deeper and deeper. 6”

	Now that I’ve heard the tapes while out of trance, so many years later after all this took place, I’ll tell you what I didn’t know at the time. My ex girlfriend Melissa was studying behavior psychology and the effects of sleep induced hypnosis and her thesis was on administering hypnosis during sleep. I guess when I had cheated on her, she decided I was a fitting specimen for her experiment. She had a spare key to my apartment and had let herself in one day while I was at work and changed the sleep machine tape to long gradual hypnosis tape. So for every night for several months I had been listening to that tape, and then for my forced time off, due to the weed’s ability to induce trance like states and my oversleeping, I had fit about a month's worth of tape into 2 weeks. This would later become the focal point for Melissa’s thesis. She found kind of inadvertently through her act of revenge that in order to reach maximum acceptance of the hypnotic suggestions, the subject must experience gradual induction followed by a huge uptake in hypnotic suggestions. 
	It was after these 2 weeks, my hypnotic boot camp if you will, that things changed drastically, all without me ever realizing it. 
	
	It was Monday and I was able to go back to work now. I woke up 2 hours early to make sure I had plenty of time to get ready, I wanted this to be a new start for me. My time of cloudy mindedness is over. 
	I bounced out of bed and headed to the shower. I admittedly hadn’t been very hygienic the past two weeks, and needed a shower. I hopped into the shower and began to lather myself up and go through all the routines of a daily shower. I was washing my chest and my stomach when I noticed how horribly un-kept my crotch area was. I figured I had plenty of time so I’d get in some well deserved trimming. I got out my razor and shaving cream and went to town. After 15 minutes of cutting off a forest of pubes I turned off the shower and got out to towel off. 
Wait, I cut off all my pubes. I didn’t mean to make me completely shaved down there. What the fuck how did I zone out and cut off all my pubes, I look like a fucking baby down there now. 
I toweled off, combed my hair and brushed my teeth. I opened the medicine cabinet to get out my deodorant. 
 Wait did I just use Sara’s old deodorant? That doesn’t smell like mine
I finished up getting ready and went out to catch the cab for work. 
I was on my way and as we were coming up to my building I realized that I had gotten up 2 hours earlier than normal and it's still way too early to go in. So I decided to walk a bit and clear my mind, figured it’d be good for me anyways. 
I began to walk and started to zone out a little bit, you know how you do when you’re just walking without a destination, just lost in the passing surroundings and people. I passed a little brunch place on my right with a bunch of chairs and tables set out on the sidewalk for customers. Sitting down with her back facing me was what looked like a pretty blond girl with a really cute pink blouse on. At the top of her jeans was a lacy pink thong sticking out. I remember thinking that was a good color of pink as I passed by. 
The next hour or so passed by really quickly and before long I was in work at my office and it was like nothing had ever changed. My secretary was coming in frequently like she did before the ‘bathroom incident.’ Everything seemed back to the way it should be. I felt an immense sense of relief. 
I sat back in my chair, finished my coffee and almost immediately felt the coffee hit my bladder like a brick. I nearly knocked over my desk getting around it to run to the bathroom. I may have my own office but we all share a bathroom. I run for the only open stall, which of course is the one in the middle. I slam the door shut, turn around and in one fluid motion, drop my pants, my pink lace thong, and sit down on the porcelain toilet and let go coffee in what felt like more of a relief than realizing everything was back to the way they should be. Over and done like a bad dream. 
I felt that sense of relief for only a few moments before a voice rang out from the stall next to me. 
“Uh hey Miss, I think you’re in the wrong bathroom. Just a warning, don’t want you to come out and be freaked out when you see a couple guys” to which he gave a chuckle and ruffled his newspaper to let me know he didn’t pay much mind to the situation. Or at least he didn’t until I responded without thought.
“Oh no, I’m in the right bathroom, I may have been gone for two weeks but that doesn’t mean I forgot where to go potty!”
What the fuck did I just say. What the fuck fuck fuck. Why am I doing this. 
“Excuse me? Mike is that you?”
The man in the stall next to me angrily yanked off a piece of toilet paper, dropped it, and got up and stood outside his door, seeming to be waiting for me.
This was it. I could tell by the way he was standing there, or so it looked from his feet that I could see under the door. I could tell he was going to fire me. I couldn’t think of why though, was I not allowed to use the bathroom anymore? 
I stand up, pulling my pants and thong with it and step out of the stall.
It was Smitts standing there, my boss.
“Mike what the fuck is wrong with you. Now I’m no pervert, and you know that, I wasn’t looking or nothin, but its hard not to notice that bright fuckin pair of womens underwear you’re wearing there. And why in gods name are you sitting down to pee?”
He’s right. Why did I go to the fucking stall if I just had to pee.
“Sir, I really I dont..Sir I uh..”
“You know what, forget it. Get your stuff and get out of here. This is a prestigious firm and if you can’t go a day without your perversions in the workplace you don’t deserve to be here. Get the fuck out of here now.”
He was yelling by the end, and being in the bathroom, or should I say echo chamber, the yells rang out to beyond the doors. As I walked out there were several other people there covering their guilty smiles and judging eyes. I went to get my stuff and left as quickly as I could. 
I went home pissed off, confused and pretty hopeless. I got home and dropped my stuff off and proceeded out to the nearest bar, where I spent the next 6 hours drinking myself in a brutal blackout and a $400 bar tab. I woke up in my own bed thank god, this time without a different girl in my bed, just me. The hangover was worse than getting fired. There was a pressure behind my eyes that seemed to flow through to the back of my head. I felt like death, wanted death. 
I tried to lay back over and go to sleep but to no avail. Once the headphones were on sleep was right around the corner though. It was near instant now. As soon as the voice came on I drifted off into a heavy sleep.
When was there a voice?
I slept for damn near 12 hours. Upon waking I felt I needed a shower, I just felt dirty. It was summer and hot out but I didn’t remember sweating much or anything. Despite the reasoning, I headed to the bathroom and hopped in the shower. The voice I remembered hearing briefly on my sound machine came back to the front of my memory. I tried to remember what he was saying. As I was reciting what I remembered hearing, all in the woman’s voice on the sound machine. As I repeated what I had heard I began to zone out, just kind of staring off at the wall like you would when recalling a scene or picture.
“5. Yes deeper and deeper. Your mind is empty now, you don’t have any thoughts now. No worries, no regrets, nothing. You’re mind is empty. You are empty. 4.”
My attention remained in my head and to the words I was reciting, but was forced back to reality as I heard water overflowing from the tub. I look down and see that my entire tub is full of water and overflowing onto the floor. 
How long was I daydreaming for? Jesus it must have been like 30 minutes.
I turned the shower off and look down to see a black washcloth covering the drain. I bend and go to put my hand on my knee to support myself as I leaned forward in this now indoor pool. As I put my weight down on my hand, it slipped out from under me and I fell forward into the full tub, shoving more water out and onto my now soaking floor. My hand is now planted on the washcloth. I straight up and go to pick up the cloth which is when I realize both why I slipped so easily and why the drain was clogged. It wasn’t a wash cloth, it was a giant mat of hair. I look down and onto my now entirely hairless body. 
What the fuck, when did I.. why did I? Something is going on, am I having seizures or something? What the fuck. 
I was scared at this point. I didn’t remember any of what must have been a half hour of me shaving my entire body. I was there and then I wasn’t. I had no clue as to what was going on. I stood up and planned on going to get a towel to mop up the floor but when I stepped out and onto the wet floor. That was when I felt a jolt of pain in my ankle and realized I had sprained it or something when I fell in the tub. I was seriously damaged at this point, both physically and mentally.
For being a finance major, and my performance prior to the recent developments being significant, I acted incredibly recklessly financially in the following days. 
I decided I needed to go to the hospital to get my ankle checked out, and figured it’d be a good eye to get my head checked out while I was there. CAT scan or whatever it was called. What I didn’t think about was that I had just been terminated and had no health insurance. 
Anyways, the financial problems don’t come till later.
I go to the hospital and get my ankle braced up and then wait to get my head checked out. It was several hours of course but they gave me a scan and the doctor came back saying in layman's terms, that the part of my brain dedicated to sleep was overly lit up and that it was worrisome of lack of sleep and might cause problems. For this he prescribed me some type of heavy duty sleep medicine. And told me to take it every night till I run out. 
I get home pretty late and go straight to bed, taking the pill and using my sound machine. Those pills must have been something short of a horse tranquilizer because it put me out for about 13 hours. But when I woke, I felt even more tired, lethargic and just total apathy towards anything besides sleeping. I tried to roll back over but couldn’t sleep. I figured it couldn’t hurt to take another sleep pill, not like I had a job to go to. So I grabbed the pill bottle and popped another. 
It was when I was putting the bottle back down that I saw the label on the side.
“Warning: Do not take second pill within 18 hours of last dose.”
It was too late now. Whatever, I took multiple advil all the time. Sure I’ll just sleep, probably only dangerous for people with like pre-existing conditions. Or so I thought. 
I’m not a chemist, and I have no idea why or how but that second pill knocked me out for almost 2 days. It must have been some borderline coma or something, I’m not sure. All I know is that when I woke up I felt incredible. 
I nearly jumped out of bed! Everything felt great, my ankle still had a pulsing pain but that was shadowed by how amazing everything felt and looked. It was almost as if the world had a slight pink hue to it. The fractals shooting off lights all had pinkish tips, shadows even had a purplish pink tint to them. It was honestly reminiscent of MDMA. 
I of course couldn’t travel with my leg so I had to find something to do around the house. Despite my ankle brace I think that was one of my most productive days ever! I cleaned the house, did laundry, baked some cookies and even cooked a great dinner! It felt great to be doing the house chores like I knew I should be. It felt right and so natural.
I went to sleep feeling so accomplished that night. It was something I hadn’t ever felt before, especially not while doing my stupid job before. I laid down in bed, and put on my headphones. As I was reaching over to grab my bottle of sleep pills, it crossed my mind with a sense of indifference, that my thong felt great on my smooth skin. I grabbed the pill bottle, poured out two and took them while leaning back. As the sound machine turned on and the rhythm came on (I’m not sure at this point there was even a rhythm anymore or if the woman's voice just came on immediately) and as I dozed off into my deep sleep, I realized I was almost quivering with excitement. I had been for weeks.
Why was I so excited to go to sleep?
I woke up 2 days later again. With the same feeling of ecstasy I hopped out of bed. With all the chores done, I felt I needed to reward myself. What could I do without much strain being put on my ankle? I knew right away.
Shopping.
I had never really liked shopping before but just the thought of new clothes and more importantly new colors got me giddy with excitement. I was so sick of all my black clothes, and the brightest piece of clothing being my bright pink thong. 
When did I buy a thong? And How long have I been wearing it? Whatever, I really do need new colors. 
So I got my crutch and hopped outside and hailed a cab. And from there I went to the shopping district. 
I started at my usual store of choice, if not out of a habit. I was thinking about how much money I had and how much I could spend as I walked to Men’s wearhouse. As I was thinking of how much money the hospital trip cost me and how I have no income and the world seemed to change, almost blur. The pink aftertone of everything seemed to diminish, the feeling of happiness was near gone and I felt sluggish and tired. As I paid mind to these changes and forgot about my finances and my worries the world lit back up. I felt good again, I felt alive. 
I walked into Men’s Wearhouse and proceeded over to the blazers. I found a nice darker blue blazer and went to go try it out. It fit of course, I had been the same slim size my entire life. I had to do something I rarely did however, I had to look at the price tag. I flipped it over in my hands and read it.

“3. Deeper and deeper you go. You have let go of yourself, you have given yourself to me. You know I am right. As you go deeper and deeper you become more willing to accept what I say. Deeper and deeper.”

I woke up I don’t know how many days later in my bed. The feeling of happiness and jubilance was gone. I felt normal again. Normal except for the smooth material covering my mid section. I pull up the covers and see a pink silk slip covering (loose use of the word) from my chest down to my upper thighs. I didn’t recognize it as me. With my slim smooth body underneath the slip, it looked like a woman's body clad in lingerie. As I was looking down over my body, not quite believing it was actually me, I was given absolute confirmation it was in fact me. As my penis started to become erect and poke up under my slip. 
The feeling of extreme ecstasy came rushing back over me, I trembled with a sensation of complete happiness. It was the most intense orgasm I ever had. I didn’t even recognize it as an orgasm it was so unique to all the previous ones. 
Did I just cum from looking at myself? What was that
I felt gross and a little ashamed. I wasn’t sure why, but I felt I had done something wrong, like I had let myself down. 
I walked over and grabbed a towel to wipe myself off and get dressed. I went to my dresser and opened up my underwear drawer. The fact that inside my underwear drawer there was nothing but women’s panties, not a single piece of male underwear didn’t surprise me or startle me in the slightest. Without acknowledging the difference I grabbed a pair of purple cheekies that said ‘slut’ on the back and slipped them on. 
I reached down and opened up my pants drawer. To which again, what was in my pants drawer a week or so ago was no more. In my pants place was a combination of skirts, yoga pants, women’s dress pants and leggings. I reached for a pair of white leggings and slipped them on, heading over to the closet.
As I got the leggings up to about my thighs they began to get really tight so I had to hop kind of side to side to get them up and over my butt and clitty. I opened my closet and grabbed a black halter top and slipped it on as well. 
I walked over to my kitchen and grabbed a water. I looked over and saw a small pile of mail piled up under my door. I grabbed them and started flipping through them. What caught my eye was an envelope with ‘EVICTION NOTICE’ on it. 

I won’t trouble you with my financial troubles because that’s not what this story is about. I’ll summarize the events that took place following this notice. Basically I went into panic mode, which in doing so kind of knocked me out of my girly daze. I sent out my resumes to a couple places immediately. The next thing I did was go to my landlord. I’ll start off there because that was the beginning of where I am now really. I had headed there after sending out my resume, and I was still dressed like I was when I found the notice. 

“Hey Mr. Dunlap, can we talk?” I said smiling and poking my head around the corner of my Landlords office.
“Woah, hey uh Mike. I wasn’t expecting to see you, nobody’s seen you in like 3 weeks. Hey listen I didn’t uh… Mike what are you wearing?”
He had stopped mid sentence as I walked around the corner, revealing my slim smooth body under my top and my tight white leggings showing my panties underneath. 
“Do you like it?”
Why was I talking like this? I can’t believe I’m wearing this, what the hell. I guess I have to roll with it though, I’m already here. 
Mr. Dunlap wasn’t an attractive man, he was a 40 year old man who was probably 40 pounds overweight, was balding and dressed like he went to the bottom of the hamper for every piece of clothing. 
“Well I.. I just can’t believe it you look so different.”
“Do you like it?”
“Wha.. Yeah I guess. Why, why are you here right now? You need to leave this building Mike, we gave you 2 days notice” 
2. Deeper and deeper now. You forget who you were down here in this darkness. The water is cold, you feel cold. The only way to feel warm is to listen to my voice. Deeper and deeper, all you need to do is listen to my voice. Listen to my voice as you go Deeper and Deeper.

2 Days notice was the last thing I remembered. 

Well that’s not entirely true, after he told me of the events that took place while I was daydreaming about my sound machine and they came flooding back to me.  
Apparently after telling me I had 2 days notice I had walked over to him and sat on his lap. At first he had put his hand on my shoulder to push me away, but as I put my hand on his he seemed to accept it. From there I had taken control. I had quickly dropped down on my knees, the entire time my mouth lolling open. He said after I had his cock out, it was in my mouth within seconds. He held my head as I bobbed up and down on his cock. His cock wasn’t very big, but was still bigger than mine. I had taken the whole thing down my throat like I was a pro and done this many times before. According to Dunlap it was after about 10 minutes, but as I remember this all taking place it was closer to 3 or 4 minutes before I made his cock tense one last time and unload a mouthful of cum into me. As he pulled away a few drops fell from my mouth and the tip of his member landing on the old cement office floor. I didn’t think it was true but as soon as he finished telling me I remembered it. After he pulled out of my mouth and dripped on the floor I swallowed the load I had in my mouth and bent forward to lick the drops off the ground. Upon remembering this I felt an almost sense of relief, like I dodged a bullet. This feeling reminded me of when I was trading stock and would trade on something last minute to find out it was a good call, like licking up the last bit of cum was better than letting it go to waste. 

That’s how I got free rent for the month. And that was just the beginning.

However, my interest in compsci came to me by accident when I took some electives my final semester in college. After careful consideration, I decided that the second degree is going to be the route I take. It will take 5 semesters and that's a good amount of time out of the full-time work force, but I figure that allows me to have two summer internships (which apparently pay more hourly than my current position lol).  
  
I hope to find a career that can utilize my passion and talent in the humanities and my ambition in programming (working on the talent...all I have is the drive to learn all I can, but I'm still new to STEM). Any advice would be helpful, whether you were a second degree candidate or not.  
  
I keep asking myself ""what the hell am I thinking?"" but I guess I'm crazy. My biggest worry is that I'll almost be 30 when I graduate again. But whatever.  
  
To add to this, I'll be paying for this degree on my own this time and have budgeted my savings so that I don't have much debt when I graduate (I'm lucky that my alma mater, UMass Amherst, has a decent compsci program). So I'm very invested in this and have a lot to lose, which I think is also going to push me to success."

I've been interning with a small (but international) healthcare software/hardware development company and I've heard that they may be interested in hiring me after completing my internship. I've also heard I should have some choice which career path I would like to take. It seems I may be presented with essentially three options: Application Design, Project Management, or Coding.


My current thought process is somewhat along these lines:

It seems there are a lot of project managers currently in IT that have pretty weak insights into both coding and technologies. To me it looks like there is a large number of people that land in project management because they are not particularly capable or interested in coding or the development side. I generally enjoy coding, but I think making decisions/interacting with stakeholders on IT projects would be something I would be very good at. I don't think it would be particularly wise for me to go directly into project management until I have some time (2-5 years) focused on development/coding though. I also don't think I would be very interested in just coding for the next 25 years and would like to be able to transition to a more influential/decision making position than a software developer.

I wanted to reach out to this great subreddit for any input/advice on the following: 

* What are the Pros / Cons you have found of each of these career paths? (Application Design, Coding, Project Management)

* What career path would be most likely to be the most lucrative after 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? A short term goal (under 5 years) of mine is to generate/invest a decent amount of income.

Any input/information is appreciated!"

I have redisgned it and stuff but the one issue I am having is making a decision on where to host this new website as the current contract expires and my boss does not want to go back (FirstComm). I made a web application using PHP that interacts with our MS SQL server that works well on my test environment using IIS7 and port forwarding to have customers track their orders. I also made a working version in a  CentOS virtual machine on my laptop. The reason I made both is because I was originally told we had windows web hosting, but we do not. I was also not told we would not renew the current web hosting service when I made the CentOS version. 

I see GoDaddy has windows hosting with MS SQL support, but I have heard bad things about it. I also have considered a Digital Ocean VPS running CentOS. Has anyone else used either or have suggestions on what to use? I'm fine with using either Windows or Linux hosting, shared or a VPS, I just want to use what's best and also not incredibly expensive."

My summer internship is over. 

I really love the place I worked at. The company is medium size in the west coast. It is not a big company so that I could know a lot of people from different departments; they were always friendly and nice to help me out. In terms of my job, I spent most of my time writing automation testing codes with Jasmine and Selenium. 

Unlike most of my CS classmates who have a clear goal of their career, I am still not quite sure which specific things I want to do with my CS degree. I've talked with several friends of mine and they suggested web development could be a good start for my CS career. That is why I posted this question here and wonder if you guys think the same way? All kinds of advice and suggestions are welcome.

Thank you guys very much!

4vkulj,2,2016-08-01,"I [19M] have a romantic interest in my friend of &gt; 1 year [20F], but am not sure if I'm ready and I've publicly denied it in the past. Not sure how/if to pursue her.",Throwawaygeek1337,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vkulj/i_19m_have_a_romantic_interest_in_my_friend_of_1/,"Before the background story, here are my 3 main concerns:

I don't want to lose the friendship, I enjoy her as a friend and don't want to damage our existing friendship.

I don't think I'm emotionally ready for a relationship that might head towards marriage (that's how highly I think of her), and I'm moving out of state for school this fall.

Despite of all of the above, I don't want to ""lose"" her, as I think she might be (for lack of a better term) ""marriage material"" as opposed to a casual fling.


Back story: Met this girl over a year ago during an internship, and within a week I had feelings for her and we hung out a LOT (almost daily). Fast forward a couple months and the internship is over and both her friends and my friends ask why we're not dating. Between not wanting to possibly upset her and because of ""attraction by proximity"" I denied having a romantic interest.

Fast forward to now, and hindsight is making me question myself. I still have strong feelings for her over a year later, when we've seen each other no more than twice a month for pretty much the last year, so I think my interest in her is legitimate.

I also have no clue on how to guess her potential interest due to the fact that I've never had close female friends or dated before which makes it really hard for me to tell whether the stuff we've done together is normal for good friends or not. I would guess going to a mall for 3-4 hours would under normal circumstances be considered a date but maybe that's normal for close friends?

I wouldn't be as apprehensive about mentioning it if I wasn't moving out of state for school, would dropping that news when I am about to make maintaining/creating a relationship very difficult be okay? Is it even fair to say ""hey I like you but I wouldn't be able to escalate it for another 4 years hope you don't mind!"" ?

So my question is should I leave it for later or go after her? If the latter, how do I do that without making awkward and minimising the risk of killing the friendship? If the former is it even possible to maintain a proper friendship when there's a potentially ulterior motive?

Also, I apologize for the word barf, I just don't want to miss some good advice as I can't trust my gut on this one (it's as clueless as my brain right now).

TL;DR: I like a girl, lied when asked to define the relationship. A year later, second-guessing myself on how or even if the approach her about my feelings."

Its been crazy and messy and now she wants to start a life with him and I feel like I should tell him.",spiffynsnazzy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vl1ps/i_25m_had_a_long_hard_drawn_out_break_up_with_my/,"This is going to be a long post and I apologize. I'll try to keep it brief but I also haven't really had anyone to talk to about it so I'll inevitably be venting and it will be long.

I'll start with the TL;DR for those who dont like novels


**tl;dr**: Ended relationship after weird 2 month period of half figuring things out. Ex starts seeing new guy less than 2 weeks later. Lies to me about it for a month. After I find out about it she sleeps with me a few times, talks about leaving him, entertains ideas about a future with me and seems like she's close to being mine again. Then one day decides she wants him more and has no problem continuing despite us cheating and doing things we never thought we were capable of.


My ex and I were together for 2+ years before things went south. We've lived together since about 4 months into the relationship.  It was too soon, but she had started the idea at that point and then a family situation on my end kind of kickstarted it into happening. We had a lot of chemistry and we really functioned well together and were similar people, a fun pair, and we really loved and respected each other. We were inseparable, spent most days together and neither of us had a lot of friends but we enjoyed doing anything and everything together. We were happy for the most part, didnt argue to much or fight for dumb reasons. Both logical and reasonable people. We fit well together and had fun. 

Fast forward to **March** of this year. Driving somewhere one night she looked like she had something on her mind so I asked her about it. And inevitably she told me that she wasn't happy, wasn't sure if her and I should be together anymore. She talked about wanting a break, and that came out of nowhere and to me that is the same as breaking up so I got defensive and questioned her and tried to figure it out. Things cool down, we're still living together and things are okay but this weird thing is out in the open now. One night she goes out to a bar and she doesn't respond to me and comes home really late. This really inst like her so I ask about it. She was out with friends I trust, but she was mentally trying to get away from me and tells me she flirted with a guy and got his number. Again its so unlike her, it hurts and we talk about it. That was the first thing that made this seem like something was definitely wrong. We had a Disneyland trip a week later and it was weird, we had fun and were okay, but she was still not wholly with me and admitted something about dating new people was appealing to her. We get back and later that week we talk about her taking some time to herself to think and get away. The thought scared me but I let her go. I ask her to check in when she gets to the hotel in a place that's 5 hours away. She doesn't check in or answer calls, I start to freak out and think the worst. The next morning she finally texts me and tells me shes not where she was, she took sleeping pills and was out. She doesn't reply much for a while, but later that day she tells me she went out of town with some ""people"" and I dont hear from her for days. This was the worst time of my life up until that point. It was so unlike her and I was only thinking the worst. I lost like 7lbs that week and my heart didnt stop pounding. The day she was planning to come home from the original trip, I get a text saying that she's on her way home, she's sorry, and she'll explain later. She gets home, she tells me what happened, she ended up taking up an offer from some girl friends to go camping and she went camping. It was in the desert and she didnt have service, but not letting me know anything was horrible and she really was just trying to get away. We talk a little, she apologizes, she seems sorry and like she had some realizations and wants to work on it. But conveniently the very next day she was leaving for a week with her dad and family to go to DC and it was such a relief to have her home and know what was going on, but then she has to leave again, I'm still reeling from the thought of having actually lost her. So the week she's gone, I have a hard time, end up wanting to talk a lot and try to figure things out. I guess it was overwhelming for her, she blows up at me a few times, says things about being done with me, and she comes home and we're in a worse place than when she left.

A week or so later when we were having a conversation and probably fighting and she ends up telling me that the few weeks before when she went camping, she got high on E for the first time and ended up fingering and cheating on me with a girl. I was shocked, but it honestly didn't feel like she had cheated. She'd talked about being interested in girls a little and I was trying to explore that and so a part of me was kind of glad she got to experience that, and E, but it kind of sucked because I just associated it with that time where she was gone and I had no clue what was going on.

**April** was a lot of the same, arguing, fighting, crying, and then kinda getting to a place where she'd want to work on it. For months we had been talking about moving into a new apartment, and in April she ends up finding a place, and signing a lease without telling me. She tell me one day, and now an immediate deadline is put on figuring our shit out. She says she doesn't know if I'm moving in with her or not, we'll work on things and try to get there. That scared the shit out of me and I cant remember much of April other than us both being busy with school, and her seeming to find more and more reasons and times to spend less time with me. Which was so unlike her again and it was just weird and sucked and I was paranoid and worried all the time. But I loved her so much and didn't want to lose her and kept fighting to try to keep her with me.

At this point I should probably go over the stuff that lead up to all this coming out. This was my first real relationship. And I was admittedly pretty selfish, but always loved her, cared for her, and never did anything to hurt her. She came from a wealthy family, had a Bachelors degree at 21 and was working in education. I came from a poor family and when we met, was working and saving money for school. I was 22, and had been saving for years as it was my only way to go to school. The money I saved represented the life back home I grew out of and left, and big choices I made to better myself and my future. I was frugal and had saved about 20k at that point and the money really did represent a paradigm shift I had, coming from a shitty town with no education, poor parents, very little real world experience and no drive. I had made strides to put myself in a good direction. When I moved in with her, she offered to pay rent for a while while I saved for school. I got comfortable with this when I shouldnt have, and down the road it caused some conflict because although it was her idea, she felt taken advantage of after a while, and there were a couple occasions I spent some money on things that she didn't approve of and it added some resentment. My only real hobby and passion is mountainbiking, and winter 2014/15 I spent a decent amount of money on a bike and she understood but was a little upset at the amount, and that ended up being something that she didn't like and later held against me. She admittedly loved that I biked and what it did for me, but spending money on the bike while she paid the majority of rent didnt sit well with her, understandably. There were some other selfish things like this with money on my end, that I completely can see and acknowledge now, but didnt at the time and made excuses for instead of affirming her feelings and trying to work on a solution.

One aspect that broke down our relationship or at least caused some tension and maybe a little separation on an emotional and compassion level was her stress job hunting, starting a new Masters program in a new field and being very stressed, worried, and uncertain about things. I was there for the whole process. GRE studying, GRE testing, application, acceptance, internship and job hunting that never worked out and left her deflated week after week, school started overwhelming classes, hard learning curves. She was really stressed a lot and I wasn't the best at handling her stress, comforting her all the time, and a lot of the time she would just shut down so I couldn't really do much if I tried. Sometimes it got to me and I made things worse. There were definitely periods where our relationship suffered. There were times where we were definitely just coasting and it was rough, but our day to day was good and we were still us, I always saw it as life just kind of being blah and us needing to get out of it. Leading up to March, our winter was very blah, we didn't have a lot to do, we didn't explore our relationship much, or really grow, and it was overall a crappy time. We didn't have much going for us. Money, school, career woes, and just generally we were in a less than ideal place. 



On of the biggest things that happened that got a ball rolling on us falling apart was December 2015. I got laid off in October, but I was aware that it was going to happen all the way back in May 2015. She and I liked to travel, that was a big drive for us to be successful. Anyway, I knew I was getting laid off, and I was getting a severance. Since I'd been saving so much money for school, I selfishly decided to spend it on me. She was going on a 10 day trip with her family in December that I wasn't really invited on, I was recently unemployed with a small severance check and between semesters. So in august I started thinking about going on a trip to new zealand, I talked to her about it and although being a little upset, she understood that things lined up and knew it was important to me. 
She had gotten to travel a lot as a teen and young adult, sometimes alone, and at that point I had only left the country once to Canada with her that summer. I was kind of excited to do something like that on my own as I had never had an experience like that in the world, alone, on my own. That was a drive for me that I regret, but it was real, and a rewarding experience so at the end of the day, I only fault myself for being selfish with the money. I could have spent it better and spent it on us.
I ended up going, it caused some resentment but we also had a lot of really loving text conversations while I was there and when I got back it was kind of intense and fun for a bit but she still ended up holding it against me and later admitting that she wasn't competently okay with it, thought it was selfish, wished I would have asked her to come too. I was upset she only told me that now, but I also didn't really apologize much and I stuck to my reasoning about going. This in hindsight was a major shortcoming of mine. I often tried to defend my feelings and decisions immediately, and sometimes failed to just affirm her feelings and acknowledge them, which I believe was a big part of it for her.

In our two years together, there were a lot of ups, and a few downs. The downs I will absolutely admit were mostly mine. There were only a few really irrational and unneeded arguments her and I had that I can really point my finger at and say she was in the wrong. She thought I was too close to a girl at work, and despite everything I would tell her, it caused a few big arguments and it sucked and took away from us a few times. I hadnt done anything with this girl, would never, and was so flabbergasted that it was even a conversation we were having. The other really hurtful thing she brought up and we argued about a few times was my level of education, where I was in life, accomplishments and that type of thing. Every once in a while shed make bad comments about it and it would feel like she wished she was dating someone with a degree and money. It hurt and definitely took a chunk out of my love for her a few times. Overall we were happy though, we laughed a lot and did a lot together.


At the end of April, she ends up moving out, I move in with a friend in **May**, and we tell ourselves that we're going to give it some time. Really take this time apart that we'd been talking about but was so hard for me to give, and see what happens in a few weeks. This was really hard for me. The most depressed Id been up to that point. The friend I was living with lived in a horrible part of the valley and waking up there every day really took its toll on me, I'd immediately have to just leave every say when I got up. It was a depressing time, really lonely and uncertain, and all the while I was supposed to and trying to give her some time and space. But this sadness and uncertainty made it hard and I wanted to talk to her a lot and it usually didn't do any good. About 10 or 12 days into that, she tells me its over, its done, I'm not moving in with her. Complete heart-brokenness. We didn't stop talking though, I still fought for her and often she would tell me things that would both give me hope and feel like we weren't really done. It was still so easy for her to tell me that I was her best friend and the best thing to ever happen to her. We would talk and try to make plans to spend an after noon or evening or night together to try to rekindle old feelings, sometimes it worked for a bit but there was still this underlying problem for me of us obviously not being together, so it would always devolve into my talking to her about it and usually getting nowhere. We'd meet for sushi or to hang out every once in a while, but for the most part May was me feeling lost, her feeling really gone, but we were still kind of talking and she was still giving me little nuggets of hope here and there.

**June** rolls around, and something weird happens. At this point, I've been forced into a place where she wants to move on and wants me to move on, but we're still kind of talking and there is so much unresolved with us that I'm still going crazy and still wanting to fight for her. I try to start meeting new people and dating as a distraction but it just sucks, I'm not over her. One day I meet a girl at a food place, hit it off and get her number. I'm still talking to my ex a little, and she has been wanting to date and get out there, and telling me to as well, so I tell her that I met someone and that after looking her up on facebook, I saw that she and my ex are mutual friends. This kind of drives my ex crazy and she gets a little mad and wants me to tell her who it is, I find it kind of weird and also get a little amusement out of it as I've been trying to get real attention from here for weeks and weeks. I end up going to my ex's place the next day to pick up stuff, and at this point I'm still dying to get our lives back together and I'm not even thinking about this person I met. She asks me who it is and we start talking about dating, and I learn she has been seeing someone since the week after we really ended things the prior month in May. This is immediately so hard to hear, because she has been lying to me about it. Lying about dating, and keeping this huge thing from me while also talking to me and still somewhat entertaining the idea that her and I are a special thing and there may still be something there. The only reason this even came up is because she got jealous of me potentially starting to see someone. So eventually the conversation gets to this person, I'm so taken back by the fact that she lied to me AND she started seeing him a week after we really were done. She was I think mentally done a bit before that, but still. A week. And she had been talking to me since. It sucked so bad to hear that she was seeing someone else, spending a lot of time with someone else, having unprotected sex with someone else. It just sucked. I had slept with a couple people at that point, but that was solely as a distraction from this place I was trying so hard to get out of. My ex on the other hand was at least at this point a little interested in this person. I hated hearing that and we talked a little about it and I feel like we left really upset with each other that night. Its not even really until that night that I realize how long shed been seeing him and lying to me, so I send her a text pretty much saying what the fuck, how could you have been lying to me, why have you been seeing someone for so long without telling me. I'm really pissed and she calls me a few times, I don't answer, she leaves me voicemails pleading with me and trying to explain. The whole next day she's sad and sorry and actually talking to me like I'm someone she cares about. And it seems like this has sparked some realization that she wants to come back to me. Or at least that's what it feels like. She's really pleading with me to forgive her, and that she didn't want to hurt me. She talks to me all day for the first time in months, and after work she calls me and I expect her to start talking about us, and what is going to happen for us to fix things. After a minute I ask if I can come over, and she tells me she has a date that night with another guy. I'm really pissed and confused at this point because she's been talking to me all day, pleading with me, saying she wishes she wasn't at work so she could talk to me more, and then I hear this and I'm all confused and weirder out. I ask her who it is, and she says just a guy from class. I tell her to cancel it and that I'm coming over and we need to talk. She doesn't want to but she does. So I go over we talk, I try to figure out whats going on. If shes been seeing someone else, why is she going on dates. She says its because they're note exclusive yet and she didn't want to turn the guy down. I understand that and all it's just so weird to try to reconcile with the fact that she's seeing someone, still talking to me, and was about to go on a date with someone else. During this conversation, we're pretty civil and we're always nice and respectful. She's sitting in front of me, and I just all of the sudden lean forward to kiss her and she immediately melts into me and my lips and just falls into my lap so naturally. We kiss like we haven't kissed in months, shes on top of me, its passionate and raw and real and we end up going to bed and we have sex like we haven't had in forever. She is so into it. She tells me she's missed that so much and that nothing compares to sex with me. She admits to me she cant get wet for anyone but me. We're so wrapped up in eachother. Its so great, its so us. We both get off, its great. We lay there and we say sweet things to eachother like how much we missed each other and how great that was. For a minute after, we just lay and then start talking about us. Were both confused but this was the closeness I've been yearning for for months now. She starts to come down from it all, and its the worst. She says that she really likes this guy and that she doesn't know what shes going to do. We talk about it, the conversation kind of breaks down and eventually we just stop and leave and decide to go get dinner and try to be done. I hate this, she's practically telling me what just happened meant nothing and shes going to keep seeing this guy. We leave dinner and on the sidewalk we talk and have a big embrace and share some smiles and reminisce and it eventually turns to the incredible sex we just have, and I ask her if she wants to do it again. She says yes, but she can’t do it at her place because she doesn't know if he'll come over. So we decide to go find a place to park and have fun car sex. We do, its great, its so fucking real and so fun and so us. We come together in a big fantastic climax. Then that high comes down, realities hit and we cry in each other’s shoulder and she’s adamant she's going to keep seeing this guy. I’m so sad. Crying so much. I drop her off, we hug, say goodbye and its the worst feeling. I don't know how long I go before talking to her again, it’s not long, and I just am so beat up about her picking someone else over me, and now the shitty feeling of this poor fucking guy doesn't know shes cheated on him. So I tell her she needs to tell him, she doesnt like hearing that but she kind of agrees. I ask her to do it soon, she doesn't and I spend a few shitty days wondering about it. She tells me shes going to tell him and then see what happens. Apparently she tells him, he ends up being okay with it because they admittedly weren't exclusive. After a while and some prying, she tells me she's picking him and although she loves me and knows there's so much here, she just cant do us now. We have a weird argument and then I leave. In all of this, I put myself in such a hard spot because I always kept trying to talk to her, trying to get some bit of love or hope. It was dumb but I love this girl so much. The next day she agrees to meet for a minute after work as the day before kind of sucked when it fell apart and we both were angry. She doesn't tell me anything new, it sucks, we cry and leave. Later that day we talk on the phone and have a really long conversation where I remember a lot being said, a lot of love coming from her and a lot of good feelings and thoughts of me, but she's just cant commit to me. But she's still so high on the physical connection and that night we talk a little dirty in text, she sends me a picture of her, and it just immediately starts back up again. 

At this point it pretty clear she’s not coming back to me. I try to be nice in our farewell text conversation, and it ends in a good place. I try to be selfless and let her leave it with a clear head and happy, all the while I'm completely fucking torn up and haven't stopped missing her or wanting her companionship and love. I let a few weeks go by without talking to her. 

After letting her go, and letting her know I wasn't mad and letting her leave with some resolution and closure, I had to give up so much of my own resolution so for those few weeks I typed up the thoughts I would have during the day with the intent of sending it to her at the end of summer. I ended up having a really hard day earlier in July and I sent her the email. She immediately sends me a text and asks if I want her to reply to it. I half do, I really did just need the closure but I was hoping I'd get something more.

**July** The next day we talk and it quickly starts just naturally flowing like we’re us. And we talk about travel, and about a few of the us things, and eventually we talk about sex a little. And we talk about how great it was and how we miss it. We get to a point where I ask if she can separate herself enough to get together one night and just have a good experience and feel that us. I obviously want this for the physical reason but I absolutely want to just get a change again to plant a seed. I still feel like there’s so much between us and I just want to be with her more. We decide to get an airbnb one Friday evening, but the Thursday before she invites me over to makeout. I get there and we immediately fall into each other and its just like before. So real. So much energy. We talk a little, share the normal and good us and then we end up having sex. She feels good about it, we hang out a little and we enjoy eachother. I leave later and I immediately get a sweet text from her, saying things she loves about me. She goes to class and that evening she asks if I want to come over and spend the night. I get so excited to just get to spend time with her, and then she texts me later and says that the guy she’s seeing and now in a committed relationship with is there. It feels so weird and so wrong but we still want to see eachother the next night. We get together, we enjoy ourselves and inevitably end up talking about the real stuff and it really sucks. But we end up setting it aside, having a really good night together, lots of wild sex and some really close and passionate sex. Sex the next morning and she drops me off home shortly after. At this point, I feel like she’s coming back to me. I get a text from her saying she’s glad we did that, and she loves me and that we have such an energy together. For the next few days, her and I talk and text. It’s so easy, we’re talking about all good things, we’re talking about the great things we did in the past. She’s sending me pictures of us things and starting to talk about the future. When we spent that night together, I told her I needed something by August 7th which was a month from that day. And then during all this talking it gets to a point where she realized that I need her to make a decision before that. I tell her that I don’t need her to make a decision, everything she’s telling me shows that she’s already made that decision. She agrees but also admits she needs time to tell him and it will be hard. I understand and we keep talking about it. Sometime shortly after, she comes over to my place and we try not to talk, just be us and we end up having the most incredible sex we’ve ever had. We both admit that and she leaves in a really good place, but just a few days later she’s having a hard time with the idea of hurting this guy, and she cant do it for a few weeks because they were both in their final semesters of grad school and she didn’t want to have that in the way for either of them. It made me feel so sick but I agreed and it made sense. A few days go by, I ask her if this is really happening and it is. But she put herself in a really shitty place because they were planning on going out of town to celebrate graduating the weekend after the semester ends. I practically beg her not to do it, but she does and my worries are confirmed because the next Monday, she pretty much tells me shes not leaving him and we’re done. We tried to talk about it a little but its just so damn hard and it seems so lost and so distant. There seems to be so much one minute and like she’s another person the next and it has been the hardest rollercoaster. 

In all of this, especially since May/June when, I've spent countless hours thinking about the past, myself, who I am, mistakes I've made and who I want to be and who I am now after all of it. I've changed so much as a person in this. I'm so much more conscious of myself and love and the world around me. I've thought so much about everything. I seriously have had so many small and big character traits that I absolutely hate, and as much as I hate what has happened I am so glad something has made me come to these realizations. Throughout all of this, my ex would sometimes say that she wished we would have met each other at a later point in time. That our timing sucked and that she wished we had a few other relationships under our belts. I always hated hearing that, but after this experience I can understand and agree with it. If we would have started at this point, with my newfound self, none of this would have ever been a problem. I've spend so much time trying to tell her this and tell her how I'm bettering myself and refining all the traits that aren't the best. And also acknowledging that I know that words don't mean shit at the point, the only thing that can convince her is my actions. So I've practically been pleading and fighting for any chance I can to show her who I am now and how much I regret the past and am capable of being a better person. I’ve had so much introspective, so much energy put into looking at myself and being a better person and trying to show her that. All I’ve been doing is trying to get to a place where she’s not surrounded by all this bullshit and can finally make one good decision and just get some space, and I kept hoping that would lead her back to me.

And now she’s practically telling me she wants a life with this guy, we’re completely over and she just wants to be done. This is so fucking hard to comprehend after the great stuff that we talked about and shared just a couple weeks prior. I hate the situation her and I are in, and I hate that she’s now a cheater who is willing to lie to someone for potentially the rest of her life. It make me sick. She’s caused me so much pain, so much suffering, and she gets to be happy on the other end. I don’t want to spite her. I’m mad and pissed off and confused, but that alone isn’t going to make me message this guy and tell him. But it’s just so wrong. I keep thinking I would want to know if I was in his shoes. I keep thinking that it’s a &lt; 3 month old relationship, started with a person who shouldn’t have been starting a relationship at the time and now she’s cheated on him, fantasized about life with me, and is now going to lie to him. It’s just so wrong. And there’s a huge part of me that really just wants her to get out of that relationship, have some hard times but get some time to herself to where she can truly think. I’ve been urging her to do that for a couple months, and early on it was too fresh and too hard to give that to her myself. All these things add up and at the end of the day I want to tell him. We’ve talked a few times since and its apparent that she’s done with me, but I hate that she never once gave me a chance to prove myself. To just be me. To let herself get some time and space. She made poor decision after poor decision and now wants to continue with something and be happy when she’s just completely fucked with my world and now this other person’s. I know Ive made it harder for myself, and for her, and now I’ve helped her cheat. The only way I justified it is because I knew there was something more between us and she was still my girl. And that was so close to being proven. She got wrapped up in me all over again and then couldn’t make the hard choice to hurt someone, so she kept hurting me.

Its gotten so twisted and fucked that I don’t know what to think anymore. 

Reading this, its probably pretty clear for some to just immediately thing I should have left, or she was totally right in leaving. That I should have just moved on and forgotten about it. But there is so much more than text can ever explain. She did some things to hurt me. She lied. Made some really ill-advised decisions, but at the end of the day I loved her. I knew her more than anyone. Her and I had shaped eachother so much. Lived through so much. Been such good friends. Had so many laughs. Shared so many plans for the future. She really is amazing. Beautiful, endlessly adorable and sweet, unbelievable intelligent and kind and fun, and so perfect in her beliefs about life and the world. We match up so well and the only negative was just the times that we slacked on eachother or environmental factors took a toll on us.

There’s a part of me that cares about her just as much as me. And I don’t want to ever do anything to hurt her. And I truly want her to be happy because she’s an incredible person and I can fault her for so little. I hate what she’s done, but I try to tell her that we can just move on and chalk it up to one big clusterfuck life experience that we can learn and grow from. I want her to be happy, but I really don’t think this is what she needs right now and I know she doesn’t want to have to hide something from someone for so long. Her parents both cheated and she hates it and she doesn’t want to be that. I’m never going to be with her either way, I have nothing to gain. Part of me is selfish and wants her to suffer a bit. The part of me that thinks it’s so horrible that she can make bad decisions, hurt people, and then want to be happy. I want her to figure herself out. Outside of a relationship with me or this guy. Part of me feels bad for the guy because he sounds great, and if only he knew what she had done and said to me. It’s so hard to make sense of. I’ll be a huge asshole for telling him, but I like to think that he deserves to know. It means I’ll have to sacrifice any last positive opinion she has of me. And part of me thinks that you know, its going to suck for me, and her, and she’ll hate me. But she’ll be clear of this. She wont have to spend her life hiding it or trying to justify it. Its not my decision to make, but I’m in the middle of it and I can rationalize it either way. And neither way is easy. I’m so hurt and sad and scared after losing her, I miss her and care about her and hope that things end up okay. I just really don’t want her to have moved on so early, into a relationship that is built on a lie after hurting me so much and lying to different people now. 

There’s so much more to this but I tried to keep it simple. Its crazy. Im crazy. Shes crazy. I know. Love is crazy though and in this we would say that we never thought we were capable or that anything like this would ever happen.

4vl3o7,14,2016-08-01,My [18 F] Father's [53 M] Boss [~33 M] started an online conversation with me that was very inappropriate.... I'm at a loss of what to do.,MJWatWat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vl3o7/my_18_f_fathers_53_m_boss_33_m_started_an_online/,"I'm gonna take the liberty to apologize in advance, I don't post much and when I do, I tend to ramble in my very eloquent teenager-ish ways. So I hope this makes sense, as I'm still so shocked and confused. At this point I'm freaking out and mostly need to vent since I don't know what to do. Brace yourself, for a long one; Here goes nothing!


Some background: I turned 18 late last December, and after, due to school, I wasn't able to visit my dad who lives 3 hrs away, whom I tend to stay with for week-long visits periodically. I have also tended to date people ~5 yrs older than me all my life, regardless. My father works long hours, so I usually go with him to his office and study, read or play video games in an empty desk and take lunch with him and what not, as I have for a few years now. His boss, lets call him Dave, one of the CEOs and founders of his company, has always been very nice to me and has welcomed me into the office. He would often take the whole office to lunch when I was around (I thought this was a regular occurrence, apparently not) and being a bit of a gamer who was also the youngest person in the office, he would often take his breaks with me, and chat about games, watch me play or just make conversation. It was never anything strange or out of place, we seemed to have a bit in common, but it was never anything other than platonic. He offered me a job as a very well paid intern once, since I already do things around the office like water plants, make coffee, fetch mail or lunch, etc, but I turned it down because of school. I though nothing more of it. I also once opened up to him about a fight between me and my dad about a much much older boyfriend of mine at the time, but he didn't say much about it. He also has a wife and a ~1 yr old kid.

So this last week I decided to come by and visit my dad again and I came to his office again, like usual. His boss wasn't around, but all of his co-workers were. I guess one of them might have mentioned I came around because he messaged me later that day. WAAAAY late. Like 12:30 pm late. I initially thought it was strange, but I figured he was still pretty young, even kinda acted like a teenager himself sometimes (shows up late to work in t-shirts, does fad diets, games and does his work until late at night), so this might not be too strange for him. I admit, this should've been a bigger red flag. And it only gets worse from here (read: this is where I start to become a naive young idiot)

He starts off asking me how I am, and then telling me that hes hiding out at the office due to a fight with his wife. Okayyy, strange thing to tell me, but whatever. Maybe he just feels comfortable with me? But he doesn't say more on the subject. He goes on to ask me out of the blue how old I am again and confirms that I am indeed 18. Most of the conversation is platonic at this point and continues for a while as we catch up, but he still keeps asking me strange questions out of the blue, like how much older do I tend to date, while giving me strange compliments, like about how ""mature"" I am. He opened up about a thing or two, as did I, as I originally thought of him as a generally cool dude, but the conversation takes a weird turn about sexually oppressed relationships, like ones that include.... you guessed it, older people! Now this is where it gets gross.

He goes on to tell me, again out of nowhere.... that he changed his diet and that he wishes I would have seen him because he looks so much better now....okay? good for you? But then he tells me that he probably tastes better too. 
Um.....what?
I change the topic as if I'm actually interested in what his weird diet entails and tell myself he probably meant something else, like more efficient taste buds of something. But he changes it back and keeps asking me about my past relationships with older people.

Then he begins to tell me about when he was 18, and a relationship he had with an older woman.... Alright, maybe this guys really just thinks he that cool with me. Okay. But then he also says that he really just finds ""beautiful minds"" attractive. Which I figure is innocent enough. Nothing I wouldn't tell a friend. He asks me for a more recent picture since its been a while since he saw me. Again for some reason I don't think this is strange.... Until he replies with a shirtless picture of himself and calls me hot. He then starts asking me about what I like in bed and stuff he likes that I don't even want to type. I say something about not wanting to get anyone in trouble and ask him if hes been drinking. He says no. I stop replying. I figured maybe he'd think I fell asleep. I'm absolutely shocked and furious it didn't hit me earlier. He sends me some cryptic message about talking without judgement. I don't reply.

I'm weirded out. He's got a very jealous wife, whom I know, and he's known me since I was a lot younger. He's had other young interns, and I don't know what to make of this. I doubt I'm the first he's made a pass at. I don't even want to think about his very recently born baby. I'm insulted he thought I'd go along with this. I've always been a flirtatious girl, but I've never given him any reason to think I would want to start a sexual relationship with him. I'm floored, and I'm nauseous, and I'm lost. I can't tell my dad, this has been the best job he's had and my dad couldn't handle this information. He'd freak out and confront him in some outrageous way, as he has always done. I've thought about contacting his wife, but I'm not sure I'm ready to be a homewrecker like that. Would she even believe this isn't my fault? She never did like me. I've thought about maybe reaching out to their company's HR, but I wouldn't even know how to do that, let alone what I would say. Nothing even actually happened between us. What if this isn't even actually against company rules? I'm deathly afraid of costing my dad his job, but I feel this is way out of line and incredibly unprofessional. Maybe I should just ignore him? Should I say something to him about being uncomfortable? What would I even say?? Am I freaking out way out of proportion because I find the situation so creepy? 

Any and all advice is appreciated. 




---   
**tl;dr**: My dads boss messages me, and after confirming my age, tells me incredibly personal and perverse things while asking inappropriate questions. He has a wife and newborn child, and I'm completely insulted by what the conversation suggested. I cannot tell my dad as he is prone to violently exaggerated reactions, and I'm clueless as what to do in order to reject him with the least possible fallout. Any and all advice is appreciated.   "

4vlfpr,4,2016-08-01,"My Solution to Herniated Disk. (Could not walk, can now run).",mutar5,ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/4vlfpr/my_solution_to_herniated_disk_could_not_walk_can/,"Hey everyone! I am going to post a letter that I have just sent to my Doctor and will do some background talking before.

First of all, it makes me sad how many people have this problem now. It is HORRIBLE I know myself. I am 21 years old. The injury happened in August 2014. I could not walk for about 2 weeks at the beginning, like at ALL! Later, I had to sit down after walking 10 meters. I cried when it was getting crazy. (Although I am strong Russian Man ;) ). I literally never cried, I could stick a knife through my hand and not cry. So I am sure people know how horrible this pain is. 

I was told by a doctor in Russia: ""Forget sports son, stay in bed and walk calmly."" I was offered a surgery about 10 times by 8 different doctors. Only 2 doctors have said, try to beat it. I ended up with being with one Doctor in Dubai. A GREAT FUCKING DOCTOR. He is considered one of the best on the world. I met him in December, I was crippled up. I was like bent sideways. Driving was a joke, had to stop on the side to stand up. Sleeping was painful. Sitting in lectures? Lol forget that shit. Basically this doctor told me. I can perform a surgery on you, but I cannot guarantee that you will not be in this hospital again 5-10 years later. He said: I will get rid of your pain for now, but there is no guarantee I will not be putting cages on your back in far future. I was like what the fuck... Basically long story short. In April I could not handle this shit anymore, and I messaged him saying, listen cut me up I can't do this anymore. He said okay, we met in person with my father there, 2 days before the surgery and that's when he said all those scary things hahaha.

Basically me and my dad thought, fuck it, lets try give it more time. I was so sad, but I thought I am a man and I gotta try again. My Doctor decided to give me Cortisone shots in the end. Motherfucker that was fucking painful. They gave me a towel to my mouth. That shit was sooo painful. Basically, it fixed my back! Fixed it for a while, as he said, this is your chance to fix yourself up dont let it go because the shots will end. But not my leg, my leg was still fucked, my back was wayy less sore. Basically the inflammation was gone, it was such a relief. I could sit for longer, walk with less pain. But please do not get this wrong! I still had leg pain and AND AND AND!!!! I started getting fucking arm pain, probably because the pressure released at the bottom and it was a shock to the spine. My body was shocked, because I was so weak by then. Omg. The arm pain was horrible, I was very scared. 

Anyways I think my letter to the doctor explains the rest. Please comment on this thread, I promise I will reply. Because I KNOW, how much help people need regarding this! When I was hurt, I was searching for solutions literally everywhere! I have tried sooo many things, you wont believe it, and there it goes. I found a solution.

Dear Dr. *****,

How are you doing?! I thought I would write you a letter letting you know how my recovery is going! 

So remember when you did those ""painless"" injections? Right after them, I felt good. My back definitely felt relieved, felt like a lot of pressure went off, but my leg was still hurting of course, not as bad but it was. I would like to tell you one thing though, is that after the injections my right arm started hurting a lot, same feeling as in my like like one of my nerves got pinched there as well. I told the physiotherapists, they did the checks and said they were scared that it might be another pinched nerve. On my flight to UK it was hurting a lot, that I actually got scared. I went to Uni again, and started my part time job again. My arm and leg were still hurting, it was only my back that was kind of okay. So I even felt like the injections did nothing.

One day I realised that nothing and nobody else is going to help me and that I must do something about this problem. I did always know that surgery is never a good idea, especially now that I have met a lot of people who have done a surgery and got more prolapsed disks later on, especially in the upper back. Simple mechanics as you said, you remove a small part, and all the proportions mess up. Therefore, I decided to finally do something about my back. I threw away all the exercises that my physiotherapists gave me, because they were not helping me at all, and I have been doing them for a long time. I knew I had to get muscles around my back, and not just muscles. Very strong muscles! 

I got myself a pull-up bar in the doorway, and every SINGLE DAY, I was doing about 3 pull ups, and some hyper extensions on the floor to strengthen my lower back, maybe some push ups as well. The pull-ups were horrible, painful, and difficult as my back was very weak. I never gave up, I knew I had to do it. About one month later Mr *****, the pain in my arm was 99% gone. I never thought about it anymore, unless I overstretched it or something, this was the first big push to me! I realised that it was working and I started pushing myself even further. I started working harder, even if I was ever in pain, I pushed myself to go and exercise. About in May/June I started working on the rest of my body, once again it was hard because I was weak. However, all my exercises were at home, I had one small dumbbell and a pull-up bar. I kept working.

In July I traveled to Siberia, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Look it up! It is far! I got offered an internship in a very big oil company here, I am leaving in 2 weeks actually. When I came here, I made a big decision to go to the gym. I was scared to hurt my back. But slowly, slowly, slowly I started building my body again. I never miss a gym session now. I now do hyper extensions with a 15kg plate, I do 20 pull ups, and do a lot of weights. But, I always, always watch my back! As soon as I feel something is wrong, I immediately stop. 

I am now much bigger, I weigh about 87kg, my back is literally SOLID, I always ask girls to touch it! I got much bigger arms. But most importantly, my pain is nothing to what it was like before. It only hurts in the mornings, or if I sit for too long. Therefore in the mornings I do my stretches, and always walk 40 mins to work, it pumps blood to my back, and the pain is literally gone. I actually have 0% pain when I am lying down, about 5% when I walk and maybe 5% when I sit, but may get to 20% if it is too long, so I immediately get up and walk. I have never felt better, obviously I do understand it will never go away, but I just had to learn to live with it. It only hurts a lot if I party too hard, but next day I stay in bed and it all goes okay! I can sprint if I want, I ride a bike, I live a healthy life. I am just much more careful, and of course gym gym gym! I am going to start doing dead-lifts literally with an empty bar to start with, to strengthen even more. I now realise that I can never quit gym, it is now my life. My only savior.

I would like to say a huge thank you, for not letting me do an operation, people will do anything to get away from this horrible pain. And it is horrible pain. Unfortunately it is a very long process for recovery, and a very painful one. And the fact that it will never fully heal is sad. But! Fortunately!! You CAN drop the pain to literally 0%. But it requires a lot of determination. It is also the fact that no one will never understand you pain, and always say ""I am sure it is not that bad"" or ""It will get better soon"". I know other people now who have herniated disks, and have taken examples from their success, and sad stories followed by surgeries. They all say, a surgery treats the problem for a while but then other problems occur. 

Thank you again Dr. *****, and hopefully you will use this story as an example to your other patients. You can never give up!

Best Regards,

Guys, never give up. Fight through this horrible pain. But fucking fight. Do not listen to doctors who say stay in bed, and get rest. Spit at those doctors.

(Could not walk, ca not run).",mutar5,Sciatica,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/4vlgyd/my_solution_to_a_herniated_disk_could_not_walk_ca/,"Hey everyone! I am going to post a letter that I have just sent to my Doctor and will do some background talking before.
First of all, it makes me sad how many people have this problem now. It is HORRIBLE I know myself. I am 21 years old. The injury happened in August 2014. I could not walk for about 2 weeks at the beginning, like at ALL! Later, I had to sit down after walking 10 meters. I cried when it was getting crazy. (Although I am strong Russian Man ;) ). I literally never cried, I could stick a knife through my hand and not cry. So I am sure people know how horrible this pain is.
I was told by a doctor in Russia: ""Forget sports son, stay in bed and walk calmly."" I was offered a surgery about 10 times by 8 different doctors. Only 2 doctors have said, try to beat it. I ended up with being with one Doctor in Dubai. A GREAT FUCKING DOCTOR. He is considered one of the best on the world. I met him in December, I was crippled up. I was like bent sideways. Driving was a joke, had to stop on the side to stand up. Sleeping was painful. Sitting in lectures? Lol forget that shit. Basically this doctor told me. I can perform a surgery on you, but I cannot guarantee that you will not be in this hospital again 5-10 years later. He said: I will get rid of your pain for now, but there is no guarantee I will not be putting cages on your back in far future. I was like what the fuck... Basically long story short. In April I could not handle this shit anymore, and I messaged him saying, listen cut me up I can't do this anymore. He said okay, we met in person with my father there, 2 days before the surgery and that's when he said all those scary things hahaha.
Basically me and my dad thought, fuck it, lets try give it more time. I was so sad, but I thought I am a man and I gotta try again. My Doctor decided to give me Cortisone shots in the end. Motherfucker that was fucking painful. They gave me a towel to my mouth. That shit was sooo painful. Basically, it fixed my back! Fixed it for a while, as he said, this is your chance to fix yourself up dont let it go because the shots will end. But not my leg, my leg was still fucked, my back was wayy less sore. Basically the inflammation was gone, it was such a relief. I could sit for longer, walk with less pain. But please do not get this wrong! I still had leg pain and AND AND AND!!!! I started getting fucking arm pain, probably because the pressure released at the bottom and it was a shock to the spine. My body was shocked, because I was so weak by then. Omg. The arm pain was horrible, I was very scared.
Anyways I think my letter to the doctor explains the rest. Please comment on this thread, I promise I will reply. Because I KNOW, how much help people need regarding this! When I was hurt, I was searching for solutions literally everywhere! I have tried sooo many things, you wont believe it, and there it goes. I found a solution.
Dear Dr. *****,
How are you doing?! I thought I would write you a letter letting you know how my recovery is going!
So remember when you did those ""painless"" injections? Right after them, I felt good. My back definitely felt relieved, felt like a lot of pressure went off, but my leg was still hurting of course, not as bad but it was. I would like to tell you one thing though, is that after the injections my right arm started hurting a lot, same feeling as in my like like one of my nerves got pinched there as well.

4vlkq1,21,2016-08-01,Just finished The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle for the first time. Some thoughts... and questions.,ColtonCM,murakami,https://www.reddit.com/r/murakami/comments/4vlkq1/just_finished_the_windup_bird_chronicle_for_the/,"*Edit*: Perhaps the most important question: has anyone translated the missing English chapters, and can anyone tell me what the ""proper"" order of chapters are, so that when I reread the book I can do it in the way Murakami intended? Thank you. 

First off, I should apologize for making what must be the thousandth ""general discussion"" thread on any number of Murakami's works. I haven't read anything else of his, but now I'm definitely going to. I studied abroad in Japan two years ago and now feel like I have a better ""window"" into understanding some of the themes he goes into. I also need to apologize for the length of this post. I type extremely fast, and its 3:30am. Having just finished the book, I simply cannot go to sleep. 

Secondly, let me say that reading this book was a very strange experience for me. I'm sitting here in this tiny little room in Nashville, Tennessee, and I'm not even sure this summer happened. I had an internship here before I begin working towards a Masters in astronomy in a few weeks, and it all happened very fast. One moment I was worried I wasn't going to graduate on time, the next I was here, and now I'm worried about finding a place to stay in San Diego where I have to move in a week or two (I've been trying to look, I've just failed). 

Anyways I know this isn't directly relevant, but I just wanted to say that the dream-like nature of this novel had a very intense effect on me. I feel a bit like Toru, sitting here in this small room, sort of isolated from the rest of the world. And I can't quite explain it, but for some reason it was very *difficult* for me to read the book. Not because I was bored, but because I honestly feel like Toru, and I was *afraid* of how the story was going to end. I started reading this book maybe two years ago. I got 200 pages in, life picked up, and I didn't finish until now, during this very strange, surreal summer. 

Well, to get back on point, I have some very broad-stroke questions about the novel. Not necessarily in search of hard explanations to anything, though speculation in that regard is always fun! 

First of all, **what the hell is going on with all the psychic events of the novel?** At first I thought maybe none of it was real, and this entire book was a deep-dive into Toru's mind... learning how he copes with the reality of his wife leaving, possible due to him being inadequate sexually. In certain ways, I do still believe the novel is very much an exploration into how an individual deals with suffering from their own, internal, entirely subjective viewpoints. We see this with Toru, we see it with May Kasahara, we see it with Lt. Mamiya to a certain degree. But there is also something else *definitely going on here.* 

There's too much ""hard"" evidence in the novel to discount the existence of real psychic phenomena having actually occurred. Firstly, the Kano sisters. They know things they shouldn't know, like Creta knowing that he dreamed of her. That was because *she* was the one orchestrating it. And the mark on Toru's face after that first trip into the well, and the cuts that Toru had after his fight in Room 208 still being there even after the ""dream."" 

So, the first question is really to what extent are we dealing with a real ""battle of psychics"" so to speak? It seems Noboru Wataya (whom I despised ever since he was first described in the book) really does possess some sort of dark mental powers, and that he draws some sort of perverse sexual satisfaction from using them. He exercises his authority over people (just women?), reaching inside of them, feeling for that ""something"" inside, and dragging it out, altering it (destroying it?), and leaving them broken in a way that is almost impossible to recover from. He did it to Kumiko's older sister, and tried to do it to Creta, but she survived due to her unique case (having already haven existed in a strange state before?). 

It seems to me, that upon reading the novel, one can't almost come to the conclusion that Toru was used (and not in a bad way) by these strange figures in his life to take down Noboru, that Noboru had some sort of sinister master plan that he was working towards as he relentlessly pursued his political career. Malta Kano wanted to take him down because of what he did to Creta Kano, Kumiko wanted him dead because of what he did to her sister and what he was doing to her, and one might even get a sense that Nutmeg and Cinnamon want to be rid of him as well. It's like these threads overlapped with each other right at Toru, and for some reason he was the only person they could all use to have a shot at taking him down, perhaps because Noboru Wataya would never expect such a ""low-life"" type character to be any threat to him. This is further reinforced when I think about what May Kasahara says, that Toru is somehow trying to ""help everyone."" 

Secondly, **Where does Lt. Mamiya and the his story of Manchuria and the Soviet labor camp fit into all of this?** When first reading the chapters about Mamiya's story (perhaps my favorite chapters of the book), it seems to me that his role is a sort of ""chipping away"" at Toru's emasculation. Toru is this guy who is in every way the sort of ""reverse"" role male in society. He's going nowhere career-wise, his wife is the ""bread-winner,"" and he is relatively mundane, enjoying simple things. I don't know about you, but if my wife left me and I was in his position, I don't think I'd be able to handle it is a calmly as Toru, if indeed you agree he handled it relatively well? In this regard, I kept thinking that perhaps everything happening to him, everything he was seeing, was his own mental way of avoiding a complete mental breakdown, but I'm not so sure anymore. If indeed part of Kumiko's decision to leave was sexual inadequacy, perhaps this feeling of self-worthlessness appears in Toru as he realizes that without Kumiko his life has no purpose. But in comes Lt. Mamiya, and with the simple act of telling Toru his story, feels a sense of relief afterwards. 

Lt. Mamiya mentions that he feels at least some bit of contentment at having told his story to Toru, that perhaps he could die with a certain sense of having fulfilled something. So maybe, through relaying this idea to Toru, he indirectly somehow gives Toru the strength to keep searching for Kumiko? Does Lt. Mamiya know he is doing this? Did he unlock some sort of psychic ability when he was at the bottom of the well in Mongolia? I can't help but draw parallels between the frequency with which he reminds us that he is a shell of a man, and the fact that the ""faceless"" man in the hotel reveals that his name is the Hollow Man. Part of me thinks, either literally that Lt. Mamiya was there leading Toru back to the room as a service in repayment of Toru's role in his own life, or that it was the part of Toru's mind that recognized he was capable of helping others, even something as small as giving an old man that had been through the horrors of World War II some small measure of peace.

Thirdly and lastly, for fear of length, **what connection(s) do you think there are between Noboru Wataya and whatever his goals/ambitions/powers are with Kumiko and her reason for leaving Wataya?""** This is perhaps the theme that struck me hardest throughout the novel, the desire for Toru to at least have the *real* ""answer"" to Kumiko's decision to leave. He senses all along that there is a deeper reason than what her initial letter offers, and he refuses to believe that she is lost forever. For most of the book, I could have sworn it wasn't going to end well for Toru, that his wife was truly going to leave him and for a very heart-breaking reason. To a certain extent the book did not have a solidly happy ending for Toru, but there was at least the hope that they would be reunited eventually, or if not, that some great accomplishment had been achieved throughout the course of the book. Anyways, Kumiko herself has taken upon the mission that she *must* kill Noboru Wataya. I was wondering what others think the cause of this might be? Is it because of his psychic defilement of her and her sister? Was the psychic defilement just a way of explaining the trauma of being literally raped by him? Was Noboru Wataya planning anything more sinister once he reached office? So much going on here, I have no idea where to begin.  

Anyways, sorry to drag on, and sorry for a redundant post, but new people gotta start somewhere. "

So to go straight to the point. I'm 23 years old and I'm a recent graduate. I obtained my Bachelors degree in Finance and Accounting. I have 1.3 years experience as a Marketing intern in a retail company, 6 months as an Account manager in a financial services company and 1.6 years as a Business Planning Analyst in a pharmaceutical company. All these positions were internships but I worked about 200+ hours a month. 
Now that I'm finished with Uni my employer says he cant give me full time normal employment despite promising me the position for 6 months. I received the news 2 weeks ago and i'm fed up with the overall situation in my country and I would like to work abroad. 
I'm fluent in Croatian, English and German.
Currently I'm just searching career sections on big bank companies web sites. 

- My question would be do you think that the above mentioned abilities are enough for an entry level job at an investment bank? 
- How much do I need to have saved up to go abroad and have enough to survive until the first paycheck?
- Do you have any suggestions on where I should look for new opportunities?

I would like to start working as soon as possible but since I just recently found out that I cant work here for too long there are now that many positions available where I can start working this year.

Any help is appreciated.

Thank you!

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

I have relocated before for an internship (however, it was only 3 months in Maryland), so the idea of relocating overall isn't what is holding me back. I have never been to Illinois, so I was hoping this subreddit could help me figure out what Itasca is like!

For context, I am a 22-year-old female, and my first priority is living somewhere safe. From my preliminary research, I don't get the sense that Itasca is unsafe, but I would love some first hand info. I see that Itasca is not too far from Chicago, but I am nervous about traveling into the city, as I know that some parts are quite unsafe.

This next question is pretty vague, but what is there to ""do"" in Itasca? Will I be able to meet/socialize with other (young) people?

Kinda complicated but that's where I'm at, almost finished with my law degree and considering a career in law. I have a big sum of cash saved up from service and working in college/graduate school, so I'm financially set for a long time with free schooling. 


My (read: fantasy) plan right now, is to practice law maybe for a decade or two, save up a big sum of cash, probably get married somewhere in that timespan, and live pretty economically for awhile. 

Then in my mid 40's or so, get my teaching certificate and whatever training is required if time allows, and slowly transition over to being a highschool teacher.

It's kind of late to enter the game, but I have such an itch to teach that style of classroom, to be opening minds to new schools of thought at that pivotal turning point in becoming adults, maybe move back to my hometown and teach at my old highschool to be nostalgic if it came to being that mobile in that period of life. 

Then spend my ""retirement"" from then on as a teacher or potential higher up for the next few decades until actual retirement.


Is that feasible? Or am I just throwing away a future career as an attourney and being far more wealthy in the end?

Thanks for the help, it's a weird concept to grapple in my mind that I want to do this, so I appreciate any words of advice or experience you can give me."

I have only taken 1 java programming course and concurrently with this internship. I learned most of what I do at my job on my own. The job was mostly IT at first but I demonstrated that I could program so my duties have changed.

I have created a lot of java programs with gui's for users to do things like searching for information or running reports with our data in jde using sql injects. The tables I draw information from will often have hundreds of thousands to millions of entries and the querys can be quite complex, taking from many tables all with various relationships. Then I parse through the data and display it based on the needs of my employers. I have also created and managed my own databases in sql server. These are the main things I do but along with that I have created various tools like massive list compare, writing to excel/access from java, java robots, etc. and general IT work.

I feel like I have come so far but I don't know how I compare to others at my level. I'm the only person in my department that knows how to program, so I never had a mentor. I really like this job but it's somewhat isolating to have no one understand what I'm working on. They just tell me we need x,y,z and then I figure it out on my own.

Now the school year is about to start and I am wondering if I should try and find a different internship that has more in house resources for me. Also if I do look for another internship I want to know what my skill level is.

4vnn1e,7,2016-08-01,Relapsed after a long stretch. A word to my girlfriend... progress journal begins today.,satmornbusker,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4vnn1e/relapsed_after_a_long_stretch_a_word_to_my/,"Day 0 - Aug. 1st 2016 

I just used porn to relapse for the first time in about 4-5 months. This wasn't the first time I had glanced at porn during that stretch (maybe 3 other times), but the first time I wasn't able to quickly snap out of it. I acted upon it, and that's where I'm at today.

I will be the first to admit that I have never committed fully to NoFap. I want that to change today. I want to become more active within this community in the hopes of kicking this for good. This helps so much to log on and read other peoples words of encouragement. I always feel empowered after checking out this site. I want to start this thread with the hopes of posting daily reflections and thoughts. To start this whole journal... here's a bit about myself:

I'm 22 years old, and I started looking at porn when I was a freshman in high school. Throughout high school the addiction grew. I was watching every day, and it for the most part controlled my life. College came and things got a bit better. Having a roommate helped immensely. It became a once every week sort of thing, but I still felt tied to the addiction. Living in a new place last summer during an internship and being home alone much of the day, I quickly fell back into a bad stretch of watching porn and masturbating basically every other day.

My senior year of college new hope came in the form of a new found relationship with prayer and one of my best friends. I was living in a faith centered environment with three other people. This helped me to really realize this needed to stop... but it didn't completely. 

That best friend I mentioned is now my girlfriend. She became available after getting out of a long relationship, and she was someone I always could see myself with. This gave me a new motivation to quit for good. Throughout the year I would go through consistent 10-20 day stretches, all ending in hard relapses. I made it about 30 days this past January before losing once again. My girlfriend and I became official about 5 months ago, and that's when I really wanted (and started) to stop.

My girlfriend has been truly amazing throughout this process in supporting me. She knows about my problem and helps me through it. Everyone who wants to quit: find at least one person you can talk to about this. If you are truly hooked, it's damn near impossible unless you can talk it out (in my experience at least). 

I love my girlfriend her very much, and the amazing part of it all is that I am so attracted to her. This was always my biggest fear with porn, that it would somehow mute me to true love and attraction (which don't get me wrong, it totally can). Once I was able to pull away from PMO I felt amazing. I am in an amazing healthy relationship with a girl I adore. 

So that was all fine until school ended. We are now far from one another, and I live alone in a place where I don't really know anyone yet. With living alone I saw the temptation return. As mentioned before, a few times I opened up my phone, glanced at something, but then was quickly able to snap out of it. I feel that I now have power over porn and masturbation, instead of the other way around, but on a day like today it got the better of me. That ""glance"" today within minutes led me to relapse. I told myself no. I looked at a picture of my girlfriend to snap out of it. I didn't, and I slipped up. Boredom is my biggest trigger.

NOTE FOR THE FUTURE: Relapses often happen quick. It's essential to snap out of the thoughts/temptation quickly. Find something to do fast. Distract... call your supporter, call a friend. 

Isn't it amazing how shitty you feel after doing it? Wow. Like probably one of the worst feelings in the world. Let me tell you, the thought of the impact this has on my girlfriend is enough to make me sick. She deserves better. I feel worthless. These are the thoughts that race through my head. I know this is how I'm going to feel, why do I keep doing it?

It's because just like alcohol, heroine, meth or whatever, I am trying to get a quick fix. You can't explain it. I like so many others are addicted. Those that have faced addiction understand. Admitting that alone will help to address the issue as it is. I can overcome it, I will and I must. Don't you wish you could go back in time to your first time and smack that little zit faced puberty ridden version of yourself? 

Seeing my progress I know that I can press on for another killer streak. This is the start of another chance, another new step towards freedom. 

My plan is to post here every day for the foreseeable with a quick update on how my battle is going. I want to use this as a place that I can put my thoughts into words, and study them over time. Hopefully throughout I'll be able to share what I've learned in the hopes of helping others.

Over the weekend, I have been dealing with (I believe to be during a manic episode) a client's mother texting &amp; calling me all hours of the night, as well as finding me on multiple social media platforms that I believed to be private, and asking if I'm okay, why am I ignoring her, why don't I care, just cause its not an *emergency* doesn't mean she doesn't need me, etc. (She has all the appropriate emergency numbers, and knows I will be calling on Monday to check in about our next in person appointment... she has blown through all that however.)

Is there a way to make things 'private' while my friends &amp; family can still find me / share my posts / retweet me / etc? Or does making all things FULLY private mean just blocking everything for everyone....?

I've been following the sub for quite some time now, and have taken most applicable and good advice thus far.

I'm a fourth year Computer Engineering major at a top university in the California Bay Area. I'm doing alright in school (~3.3 GPA, expecting to finish above 3.5 this coming year). I have been receiving pretty decent financial aid, but have had to take out about a little less than $20,000 in subsidized (luckily) federal loans to cover the rest (including rent [~$800/month], food[$90/month], and school).
I don't really like asking my parents for money, and never have. They need it more than I do frankly. 

Over the summer I received an engineering internship where I'll have over $10,000 saved by the end of the summer in a month or so. I also make money on the side as a freelance white-hat hacker, and it pays well when it happens.

I've always been interested in investing the little money I've had. I never spend too much money on anything except for a new computer if I need it, or my cheap hobbies. I have tried investing in precious metals, but it's not as fast paced as I'd like it to be.

Should I, a student in debt, worry about my loans before investing anything, or would it be safe to put a small investment into something with the little spare cash I have until the end of the school year when I have to pay the loans back. I've figured that I should have about $4,000 spare by the end of the year with my savings and loans.

My job prospects are looking pretty good right now, and I'm not too worried about the loans in the long run what so ever. 

Does anyone also have any advice on how to live frugally after college in the Silicon Valley, and when a good time to buy house, car, etc. would be? 

Thank You

TL;DR: Been working as a QA Manual Tester for almost 2 years. Want to find a development job, but may be have to relocate in 1 year. Should I still search for a job that I may have to eventually quit to relocate with my girlfriend? Also how do I make myself more hire-able. I have no development work experience, no internships, and a very minor side-project.

I graduated from college on May 2014 with a degree in Computer Science and landed my first job at a consulting company in the Bay Area on Nov 2014 with the position title Software Engineer Associate. However, the first project I was assigned to was a QA manual tester role. I was a little disappointed but the company did inform me that not all projects would involve development and since most projects last 3-4 months I thought I would just suck it up, complete this project and then hopefully my next one will be development. 

To my dismay I found out that this project would last 1 year, but decided that I could still suck it up and stick with the project for a year. However after a year, the project got extended for another 2 years and there's no end in sight.

I spoke to my supervisor about changing projects but he stated that this project is already understaffed and he really needed me on it. So it looks like I'll have to find another job if I ever want to work as a developer.

And this is where I kinda messed up. Instead of searching for another job right away. I kinda just gave up and continued working there for another 7 months and it just hit me that I really need to get out of here.

To make things even more complicated, my girlfriend is applying to Med school and I will be moving with her to where ever she ends up going. So that gives me about a year left in the Bay Area before having to relocate.

So my question is, should I even bother trying to find a new job right now with only 1 year left in the Bay Area? Or should I just be practicing coding and algorithms and working on side projects until I relocate?

Also, how would I make myself more hire-able? I am now 2 years out of college with no professional development experience and I didn't have any internships while in college. I have been trying to brush up on algorithms and coding problems and the only side project I've worked on recently was a small game made in Unity. Would attending a boot camp purely for the connections and networking possibilities be a good idea?

Sorry for the wall of text and thanks for any advice or suggestions!

We were married for 4 but were physically separated for the majority of that time because the physical abuse was severe and he was very dangerous.


I was in grad school during the time of the separation and completed an internship one summer at a small family-owned business as a requirement of my program.


It was a great experience for me and I worked with a very kind and caring family. I am generally a very private and professional person so they did not know that I was separated from my husband, I still wore my ring and carried myself as though I was married.


One of their employees was a nice and jovial person, we will call him Randy. He too was married though he at times complained about his wife and her medical issues. I never commented and focused on my work.


I worked closely with the business owners and he had more of a front-desk/customer-facing role. One day I needed to sit at the front desk to work on a program on that computer. I was doing my work and minding my own business while he was doing his regular job. Out of nowhere he starts to tell me that I am the perfect woman. I had never gotten any indication that he liked me romantically but I am generally pretty oblivious. I get along well with people, especially in a professional setting so I didn't see his kindness as interest. That weirded me out and he quickly apologized. I really didn't even acknowledge his admission. For the rest of the summer I simply avoided interacting with him on a one-on-one basis.


Since that time I have gotten divorced and so has he. I don't know any of the details surrounding that divorce, nor do I care to.


He reaches out to me periodically and has wished me well or asked me to coffee. I would say once every six months or so. I'm really not interested in him for various reasons. For one, his admission creeped me out, especially considering that we were both married at the time. I felt that he'd crossed a boundary. For two, he seems purposeless in life. He works a menial job and is involved in some things that are typically of interest to a much younger demographic. 


I am still a pretty private person, one for my own safety...I don't really need my ex-husband to know what I am doing...and just because I don't see the need for everyone to know what is going on in my life. I was in my first serious relationship after the divorce. It lasted about a year and a half and we broke up pretty recently. I have social media but rarely post anything. From time to time I am tagged in something. Every time someone tags me in something Randy reaches out. I don't want to be rude. And I also don't want to assume but it does seem like he is trying to connect with me romantically. I recently met a friend of his (I didn't know they knew each other) and the friend and I hit it off. He asked about my relationship status and I indicated that if recently broken up with my boyfriend. He asked for my number and wanted to go out. When he found out that I knew Randy he stopped contacting me. Shortly thereafter Randy reached out again to see what I was doing and said that he hoped I was well.


To be honest, I'm not interested in meeting up with Randy for coffee even because I feel like he will read it as interest. 


Am I too harsh for not wanting to entertain even a friendship with this man? Am I reading too much into him contacting me? Is there a way I can communicate that I am not interested without being rude? I'm fine with maintaining a 'Facebook friendship' but am not interested in anything more. I felt like he would get the hint after 5 years...

---   
**tl;dr**: Guy expressed interest in me under circumstances that made me uncomfortable. He has been trying to establish/maintain a relationship/friendship over the course of 5 years and doesn't seem to get the hint that I'm not into him. Worried I may be too critical because of his lack of ambition or that I'm reading too much into things. How do I make it clear that I am not interested?"

I'm currently doing an internship and one of my co-worker is looking for a new car. Trying to be the helpful intern, I'm trying to get him the most value for his buck. He currently drives a loaded Chevy Aveo (manual) which is on its way out. He is seeking a replacement that's close to the size of his Aveo and wants a few tech features such as a backup camera and CarPlay. He has a budget of 17k but the lower the better. He is above 30 and not married so I don't think he cares for practicality. 

The (new) cars he was considering included the Jetta, Focus but fell in love with the Cruze after sitting in it. He's also considering the Spark since with various rebates he can get one new for ~$9000 with his desired tech (half the cost of the cruze). I tried to explain to him that Chevy wasn't all that reliable and there are much better used options on the market - if he swaps out the head unit on any car he can get his tech...right?.

I've already run the Golf (doesn't like the look), Mazda 3 (can't remember his gripe) Fit (doesn't like the look) and the new civic (too big) by him which I think would be the most logical choices. 

Given his budget and tech wants, what do you guys suggest and why? If any of the cars i'd suggested deserve a second mention, let me know as well!

It might be important to note that, even after 3 years of experience, I still do not know all the systems we have in place - I.e. Those 3 years I was actively being trained.

Anyways, my boss approached me not too long ago and asked what my minimum salary would be to be employed at this company.   He also noted that the person making the decision is a ""hire contractors, don't employ full time"" kinda guy, who also has never directly seen me work.

Anyways, what tips would you guys have for me for researching my minimum starting salary requirement?  I have a very specific skill set and I don't really know how to compare it to (or even find) salaries with similar skill sets.

D: Needing to get years of negativity off my chest and I have no one else to talk about this with.

I grew up in a lower middle class Chinese family that spent frugally. I'm in my early 20s now, but when I was younger, up to my late teens, my mother chose my clothes for me. 

I'm a fairly thin girl, somewhere around size 2, and the hand me downs I got (from my mom's friends usually) were quite baggy and unflattering on me, and of weird colours. If you've seen cheap Chinese clothes before, they often have misspellings on them in giant letters. I sometimes fought with my mother about the issue but since it was her money, I couldn't win. I'd be called ungrateful. Obviously I understood that money was short, but I had some unpleasant times. I remember one time after arguing with my mom about clothes, she forced me to walk into my class in an all white baggy tracksuit with weird orange Chinese English translations and being the butt of everyone's jokes that day (I was late to class from the arguing that day which attracted even more attention ugh). 

In elementary school, my classmates who were better off often made fun of me, but the worst was a girl who bullied me for it. I've always suffered low self-esteem from these experiences, but at least I didn't get bullied in high school, partially because I kind of withdrew socially.

In university, I didn't get bullied at all because I made friends with nice people, who are nerdy just like I am. I started making a bit of money from internships, and I would experiment with clothes and hair a bit more to pass myself off as ""a regular person"". I even started getting attention from guys! I started feeling better about myself. That is, until one time, my boyfriend of the time and I had a fight, and he started hanging around this girl who has a much better style than I do. Well, he is an ex for a reason, but... Although I don't really care about him anymore, I can't stop thinking about that time and comparing myself with her. I don't think that she is prettier (in the face) than me, but her clothes are definitely better and her style is sophisticated. That's why I can't let go mentally. If she was just prettier than me, I would find it easier to just accept it and move on. But now it feels like I'm punishing myself for being lazy and having bad taste, and it is eating away at me. This was compounded by another incident that this asshole guy I know who talks trash about everyone, was throwing shade about my clothes (I still dress plainly, but not as bad as before).


I'm about to graduate university soon and now I'm afraid of ""merging back"" into a crowd I didn't feel accepted in. I'm afraid of being tossed aside by guys in favour of girls like I mentioned. I'm afraid of being seen as the tacky girl I had been for 20 odd years.

I am actively trying to improve my style, but I feel very negative and crappy every time I go shopping and it's not a fun experience. I buy things that don't work on me (simply out of inexperience) and I feel horrible for wasting money and limited time towards improving myself (I feel very rushed about improving too, even though no one's imposing any deadline on me). I'm obsessing over not being good enough and I feel insecure every time I see a nicely dressed girl downtown and I think, ""if I tried harder, I could be that -- why am I not trying??"" I have a lot of other important things I need to do related to my career (need to learn a ton of things) and this style thing is distracting me from it. It's honestly EATING ME ALIVE.

At the same time, I think unfair thoughts like, ""if only I weren't a woman; it's much easier to dress well as a guy"" which are unhealthy things that don't exactly help my problem.

This thought pattern is making me miserable and I want to hear if you ladies ever went through similar experiences and what you did to get through them, any hindsight, etc.

Wow it felt good to get it all out."
4voqig,89,2016-08-01,The time I was a babysitter,princessofsalt,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/4voqig/the_time_i_was_a_babysitter/,"Hello everyone, I come once again with a story from my internship!

I am an unpaid intern for the public defenders office in a particular city. I work on the misdemeanor docket making phone calls and copies, doing client interviews, helping people fill out paperwork, and going over police reports with clients.

A few weeks ago, we had a number of show causes on the docket where clients came in to give excuses about why they have been ignoring their probation and hope the judge doesn't send them to jail. A woman comes in to her show cause (a hour after her scheduled time, naturally, just as we are done with all the cases and are about to start calling bench warrents) with two children in tow. She has two sons who are probably 4 and 2. Since the court room is empty, she plops her kids on the gallery benches and is told to just go up to the stand. The toddlers are upset about being left by their mother and start to fuss so I quickly go back to sit with them/ let them scribble with pens on the back of my copy of the docket. 


Apperently this woman had been arrested on a drunk driving charge two years ago and had done nothing for probation. She had been to court a number of times on showcauses and had always dragged her kids with her while she whined on the stand about how she promised to do better and about how she has her kids to take care of. The judge had always let her go with the threat of jail the next time she came in without doing her probation requirements. But he must have felt bad for her kids because he never followed through on his threat. 

The first thing the judge says when he sees her is ""I though I told you last time to not bring your kids to the court room again!"" Not a good start for her....

The woman starts telling the judge all the reasons why she couldn't comply with probation (she doesn't have the time, she doesn't have a ride to the office, she doesn't like her probation officer, they are unfair to her), but the judge isn't hearing it. He tells her he is sick of her excuses. I see where this is going and so does one if the bailiffs because he begins to position himself behind her with his hands on his handcuffs. The other interns and the deputy bailiff in the court room are looking at me and the kids anxiously, and the deputy signals for me to take them out of the court room. As the mother is being put in handcuffs, I scoop up the 2 year old and take the 4 year old by the hand and lead them into the conference room outside the court room.

So I'm sitting there with an incarcerated stranger's children and thinking ""well what do I do now?"" I try to ask the old kid what their names are, but I can't understand what he's saying. I'm not sure what their names are, what to do if they have to go to the bathroom, or if they have any medical conditions. The mother had no diaper bag or purse on her that contained anything a 2 year old would need and the 4 year old is complaining about being hungry. I put an episode of Scooby-Doo on my phone for them to watch and one of the other interns comes in the room and says ""so (public defender) told me to tell you to just sit tight while we figure out what to do with these kids....""

So I sat there with those kids for a half hour while they scribbled on scrap paper and watched Scooby-Doo. One of the other interns found some fish crackers in the break room and we weren't sure if we were supposed to take them or not, but we figured it was an emergency. 

Eventually, the public defender came into the room and said she has never had something like this happen before. She told me the mother was trying to call someone to pick up the kids, but we would have to call CPS if no one could be contacted. Eventually, the kid's uncle came to pick them up. I never figured out what their names are. I hope they are doing OK."

4vpaxb,261,2016-08-01,How TF2 helped me achieve my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley (xpost /r/tf2),LoopsCode,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vpaxb/how_tf2_helped_me_achieve_my_dream_of_getting_a/,"This is a story on how TF2 got me a job in Silicon Valley, the place of my dreams to begin my career as a fresh new computer engineering grad. If you are struggling to find a job right now, perhaps this may be a little bit of motivation that you could find a good company fit, well, really anywhere. Let me know your thoughts. If you're still looking for a job after graduation - keep fighting. Here's my story. 

_________

This story started two years ago, when I was invited to sub as a Soldier in a UGC Silver Highlander team from a friend, his name Borat, I met in TF2Center. We played a few games while we chatted in Mumble, and in the first few games, we clicked pretty well. A few days later, this friend asked if I was interested in joining their team full-time as their main soldier for the upcoming season. I first hesitated, but eventually agreed because I thought the dudes were all very swell. 

Fast forward a few months, we were deep into the weekly games. Our team didn't have the best DM, or the best players, or even the best strats, but gosh darn, we had team work and good vibes. The group of guys were just great people that encouraged each other when things went south, and in general, made the sometimes-toxic UGC environment tolerable, and even fun!

Speaking of toxicity, this is how the story *really* started. 

As you all know, some teams would bring in unregistered ringers (often times higher skill divisions than what the current team is), imposters with the same name and display picture (played by a higher level player), or sometimes, the team leader just doesn't know it's against the rules. Prior to a match, there isn't much time to actually check one-by-one whether the player on the team is really who they say they are, or whether they're in the official roster. My team leader, let's call him Messiah, knew that I was a software developer. He is also one. He expressed to me his frustration, and it clicked to me that maybe I should try to take a stab at solving this problem.

A few weeks later, the UGC Roster Verification tool (now offline) was born. Initially, only the players in the team used it. After awhile, I started sharing it on /r/tf2, /r/truetf2, the UGC forums, TF2Center forums, and more, and it kinda blew up. I recall over 1000 unique players used it, and for a kid like me, that was pretty insane. Hearing people's thoughts on the tool prompted me to learn to gather user feedback, test for bugs, and ultimately implement new features to it. This was a great feeling, and it really trained me to become a better software and product developer.

Fast forward a few more months, the team sort of disbanded because we all had real life responsibilities to attend to (although no worries, we all shoot the shit on our Slack channel on a daily basis). I was talking to Messiah how I was graduating soon in June 2016, and whether he has any tips for me for job search.

Little did I know, Messiah, who I absolutely admire because he is *also* the main dev of a Steam based website, works in a company in Silicon Valley. I was absolutely flabbergasted. Recall, I've known him for around a year and a half by now, and this is the first time I knew about this. He keeps it very low key, a hint to his character. He asked me if I was interested in his company, which is conveniently located in the center of Silicon Valley. 

Am I interested? *Am I??* My life long dream has been to work in Silicon Valley. I think interested was an understatement. I was more like - ***fuck yes I am***! 

I honestly tried to apply for internships in this area all five years of my college career, with no luck each time. Being able to begin my career in the Valley would actually fulfill a long-time dream of mine.

Messiah put in a good word for me to the CEO of the company knowing what I did with the UGC Roster Verifier tool (and our fun technical discussions on coding and tech in Slack/Mumble), and I scheduled my first call with them. 

One call led to another technical call. Then a third culture call. Then finally, I was invited to their office in the Valley for a full day of on-site interviews. I flew over from the East coast; everything was paid for. Was I nervous? Goddamn I was. At this point, I was rejected by a few companies already, and morale was at a new low. 

I arrived at their office a few weeks later in beautiful California. I went through the rounds of interviews starting at 9 AM. After the seven and a half hours of interviews, of testing me everything from algorithms, data structures, building simple apps, asking me questions about design/UX/UI, career motivations, culture fit questions, and more, it was over. I was emotionally/physically/mentally exhausted, but I felt good. I even got to meet Messiah in person for the first time in two years, and he gave me a TF2 shirt. Even after meeting him in person, I still can't put a face to his voice from Mumble. It's just too unreal.

After I flew home, I went through one more phone technical interview with them, just to get more data. Considering they are a data analytics company, that made a lot of sense. 

So after around 11+ combined hours of interviews, one day, my now-boss called me to extend me an offer. It was my first offer, from a company of my dreams, and after all those rejections! I don't think happiness described it. After literally nine months of rejections after rejections, of reviewing those excruciating data structures and algorithms questions (which takes time away from me from developing great applications), of waking up knowing I *still* don't have a job while friends around me were getting offers - it was finally over. It actually took me three days to fully process the mental load that it's over. 

I achieved my dream, but I didn't do it alone. Playing TF2 actually helped me achieve my dream. Thank you Messiah, Borat, and the rest of the team for being such good people. I honestly can say I couldn't have done it without them! 

____________

So this is my story of how TF2 helped me achieved my dream of getting a job in Silicon Valley. 

The lesson I learned is - just be a good person. Be a good person even under the veil of anonymity. You don't know when it will bite you in the butt, or when it will literally help you achieve your dreams. Just do it!

4vppe6,29,2016-08-01,"The long, cringeworthy truth: I decided to quit college before I lose my interest in tech and life.",techorrekt,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/4vppe6/the_long_cringeworthy_truth_i_decided_to_quit/,"**BACKGROUND**: During middle and high school, I hated school. I even hated being in G.A.T.E. in my elementary years. Don't get me wrong, the testing was enjoyable, but I did not like being singled out and tested. And I still don't. Anyway, I've always traveled long distances to go to school (minimum 1 hr + 30 min to and from, total 4 hours *at most*), I've never been an early bird, the instruction always bored me except an teacher who made me love math and my AP English teacher, and I grew up in poverty. 

**But the best thing about 6–11th grade?** The amount of time I had to read, web design (tumblr themes and random layouts), research CS- and math-related topics, and even waste time was unfathomable. I rarely did homework or paid attention in class because I taught myself the material (my AP English teacher even allowed me to read in class because I would jump right into discussion and answer questions despite being in the middle of reading). I burned through a minimum 250-paged YA novels almost every day and still managed to incorporate web designing, drawing, etc. into my days. Even though I had personal issues like financial instability and a dysfunctional family (we're so much better and unbelievably close now), all hobbies that I mentioned above was my escape and I loved it. 

In my senior year, however, that's when my well-being and motivation started to take a toll. Had I known I would be in this position right now, I would have taken a further step to build a portfolio throughout those beautiful 7 years.

***

**DECISION AFTER HIGH SCHOOL**:  Now, I never wanted to go to college because the school environment and structure isn't for me no matter how much I try to make adjustments. Despite this, I still went because everyone else did, I was told it would be worth it, and I didn't want to disappoint my mom. Because of my financial situation and disinterest in a 4-year, I went to a CC. 

***

**CURRENTLY**: Now I regret attending college in general. My grades have severely slipped along with my motivation (3.00 GPA ready to fall to 2.something). I thought I was bouncing back because I completed my website (I've since wiped it out since I want to revamp it), got more online recognition for my artwork, and got an unpaid internship. After finding out that I'm being used for free labor instead of actually interning, it's only pissed me off and made me think, ""Fuck everything."" I haven't told my mom this because I don't want to crush her since she was so proud, so I'm just sticking to this ""internship."" I'm just not putting any effort into it.

***

**HOW I TRIED TO OVERCOME**: I've tried daily and weekly planning, visual journaling, managing a studyblr (for motivation), etc. While I did have small bursts of ""I can do this,"" it only lasted about a week or two and I ended up sinking *further* into indifference. I've been battling with my opposition to school for years and consulted in people including teachers, but doing so has only made me not care for school instead of hate it, lose interest in my passions, and become procrastination and exhaustion itself.

I've read countless insight/feedback on similar situations, from ""College is just a way to prove that you've matured and can complete something"" to ""People with degrees tend to get paid more."" But I never cared about any of that. I never cared about proving myself to others, never cared about making big money, never cared about working for top companies like Google and Apple. 

If I did, I know I'd be able to stick to my guns and plow through school. The only thing I've ever cared about was just being able to do something as small as freelance web developing while working a regular part-time job (specifically in a bakery, library, bookstore). I do have bigger aspirations, but I would be wholly content just freelancing.

***

**VERDICT**: The only thing holding me back from diving headfirst into working: my mom. She even recently told me, ""Well, go ahead and quit college and become a loser like me."" As much as it hurts to hear her say that, I want to live for *myself*. It doesn't help that we argue every now and then over me not having a job (another reason why I want to quit school. I've been surviving on financial aid). 

If I at least lived with roommates, quitting college would be so much easier. Under my mom's constant watch, though, it's damn near impossible. 

So I've already decided that I'm done with college, I just need the push to start working, save up, move out in a few months, and start my life. If I don't, I'm going to be an empty shell in the next year. My first year was the longest year of my life so far, I can't imagine what 3 more is going to do to my sanity. When I couldn't continue studying this past year, I cooked or baked, exercised, read, drew some portraits, or did some web designing or research on CS topics. Now, I rarely study, rarely eat (not even a full meal a day, so my physical health has been getting worse), and I just sit around tired not doing anything.

I've tried to enjoy school and stick to it, but I can't. And it sucks that most people seem to think that *everyone* needs to go to school or they're failures, stupid, and/or lazy. 

***

## TL;DR / Summary of why I decided to quit college:
1. The concept of tests, homework, and sitting in a class for prolonged periods of time with restrictive instruction is literally destroying my sanity.
2. I'm no longer happy, and I have since lost interest in the things I've loved.
3. My emotional and mental state is taking a serious toll on my physical health and productivity.
5. I've never had a desire to prove myself to others.
6. I've come to accept the fact that I'm just not fit for college. 
7. I'm pretty sure the reason why California is no longer in a drought (so they say) is because my tears from my many breakdowns have replenished earth's water supply.
8. Competition, big money, and working for top companies doesn't motivate me.

4vpv1i,1,2016-08-01,"Had severe PR Bleeding, can take a shit now.",Fuckingdying,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/4vpv1i/had_severe_pr_bleeding_can_take_a_shit_now/,"I am 22, male, white, 6'1, 143lbs. The rest of my medical history is unremarkable. I have no family history of medical disorders related to the GI tract. 

For a while I've had fairly bad constipation a larger than normal bowl and in order to deal with it I've done enemas and manually removed fecal matter from my ass with my finger. I've done this almost everyday for 8 years sometimes for a two hours a day with warm water from the shower, I used my bare finger and nothing else in order to this. I know this was a horrible abuse of my intestinal tract but despite this I could defecate normally just a week ago with no assistance or trouble without enemas or my finger despite of abusing my rectum for years. The shits I had prior to this were smooth, light brown and covered in mucus. 

A few days ago my finger nail ripped a fucking hole in my ass I bled a fair but and then it clotted up so I left it. Two days later I took a piss and did a little push and all hell came loose and I was squirting blood from my asshole all over the place so I went to the hospital. The blood was fresh new blood that was bright red. I bled from an artery in my mid rectum for 2 days in hospital had a HB of 103 by the time it stopped and my pulse was 126 and BP at 106 at the the worst. The bleeding was bright red with large dark red clots in it that I passed every 2-3 minutes for 2 days. Got discharged with a HB of 123 yesterday. I have shit small tiny little rabbit droppings that have the consistency of clay for the past two days after the bleeding stopped. I have defecated 6 of these rabbit droppings since I last went to the bathroom and since the bleeding stopped which has left me bloated and uncomfortable. The bleeding lasted for 2 days and it has been 4 days since I've had fresh bleeding which means the bleeding has stopped. Right now my rectum is filled with brown/black tar like old blood which I suspect is giving me constipation in addition to the senstivity of the injury and my own paranoia and fears related to shitting. 

The doctors did no surgery, they gave me an IV drip and took blood before releasing me. I had no colonoscopy or any other medical procedure other than a CT scan showing that I tore an artery. The doctors told me that due to the location of the artery and the constant fresh bleeding they could not perform any procedure to stop the blood and told me that they were hoping it would stop by itself, which it did but I still am skeptical of their decision and think that a colonoscopy and a clip on the artery would have been much better than waiting for my blood to clot and the tissue to scar up. I realise now I might have been better off bleeding at home since every doctor from the colorectal surgeons to the ED doctor shoved their finger up my ass which I suspect made the injury worse or at the very least prevented it from clotting and I could have just bled at home and it would have healed up in 12-24 hours instead of 2 days of people fingering my asshole.

In any case I have been released now and am concerned that even the slightest of stress on the injury could cause it to reopen and for me to start shitting a fountain of blood again. I am worried about this because I lost 30% of my total blood volume during this episode and I know it'll take a while for my body to replenish what I've lost and even though I could hold out and bleed for 2 days before while still remaining mobile I know if I were to have the same severity of bleeding a second time in such a short space of time I will not be so fortunate. I am currently on a diet of oats, prune juice, water, probiotic yogurt and metamucil in order to help a giant soft log of shit form that I hope clears out my entire rectum as when I pass gas the smell could be considered a human rights violation as the mixture of shit and old decaying blood would make the scientists who made mustard gas proud. 

I am also worried I'll just get fecal impacation and a brick hardened shit from hell will get lodged in my asshole that'll just rip me open again and I'll end up looking like a vampire gave me a rimjob and I'll probably bleed out on my toilet floor before I get to the hospital. My plan for the next few days is to just have a diet that consists of these foods and do some light walking in order to move things around a bit so I can slowly clear out my intestines and hopefully have normal function return.

My question is, what do I do about the constipation, how do I shit without the injury reoccuring, how do I prevent fecal impactation during the next few days and basically how do I return to being able to shit normally without having PTSD over my torn asshole. Also how long until my finger fucked artery heals up. I can't get a colonoscopy yet because the doctors where I live (Australia) don't take me seriously and no matter what I say. I've talked to several at both a GP and two hospitals over the past few days only a surgical intern, specialist surgeon and an ED surgeon seemed to be the smallest bit concerned about my problem the ED surgeon got me the CT scan and the intern wanted me to get a colonoscopy but I'm guessing since he wasn't the team leader he didn't get final say. The specialist surgeon wants to see me in a month which is stupid because I can't take a shit by the time I see him he'll be using power tools to remove the concrete block that's stuck in my ass and/or I'll just end up getting my anal period again and dying half naked in my bathoom.

Thanks for your help guys!"
4vpzg2,3,2016-08-01,300ug 1P-ETH-LAD (Update!),full_silver,researchchemicals,https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/4vpzg2/300ug_1pethlad_update/,"Boy was that intense. If I could describe that trip in one sentence it would be: heaven and hell, but mostly heaven. I dropped 300ug 1P-ETH and my GF took 100ug ALD-52 (she absolutely hates ETH because of the nausea, body load and heavy headspace) and we went to [this park](http://www.evexperience.com/patrick-island/) on a nice sunny day.

I ate a decent meal with chicken and potatoes before, knowing I needed to fuel myself. I made a big shake with three scoops of whey protein, peanut butter and oats which always tastes like hell during trips but I know I need it and it makes me feel better knowing that I fueled myself. Took my usual magnesium + ibuprofen + curcumin since ETH has a heavy bodyload and makes you conscious of muscle soreness/aches, which I have from powerlifting. I also bought 2L of Gatorade with us to stay hydrated, applied bug spray because fuck mosquitos, and applied sun screen so I don't fry.

We were coming up about 40 mins later and we decided to sit down by the river in the shade. It was a nice sight so I figured we'd weather the comeup storm here. Typical ETH comeup: heavy bodyload (you can feel every muscle fiber and aches), [unreal bruxism](http://rs1143.pbsrc.com/albums/n632/runninbare1/chattering-teeth.gif~c200), and just a general feeling of discomfort in your stomach. Zero nausea though, contrary to lots of people. I remember that I kept comparing lysergamides in my head (ALD-52 vs 1P-ETH vs AL-LAD) and I was getting annoyed at myself for not trying to enjoy the trip, so I stopped making comparisons in my head.

About 1.5 hour later I was peaking hard. Visuals were pure insanity, very futuristic and tons of fractals. Everything just looked so beautiful and HD, it was very crisp. It wasn't quite like AL-LAD kaleidoscope visuals or as colorful, it was just different in a beautiful sense. At this time I was feeling very euphoric, life just felt grand. I've been a bit depressed this past year because I haven't been enjoying my internship so much - it's just not what I expected out of engineering. I am also recovering from a shoulder injury so I can't bench press right now which is part of my sport. At that moment, I felt immense gratitude and happiness for everything that I had in my life. I have an internship where lots of people couldn't find one so I could kick start my career (I'm graduating after this final year), I am mostly healthy, I am able to go to the gym and practice my sport, and I am in a decent financial situation. Everytime I do ETH I somehow feel that I am dying, either because of negligence towards my body (injuries, aches, sleep deprivation) and I still had it this time but I realized that I made some improvement. I am becoming better, I don't take as many stimulants to mask my fatigue as before (down to 200mg caffeine + 50mg modafinil daily now). I used to take 600mg caffeine + 24mg ephedrine daily before. I have a thyroid problem (hypo) but I finally found a good endo who's treating me on free T4/T3 instead of just TSH. I got a blood panel to check all my hormones and nutritional deficiencies, everything is in the high range since I've made an effort to improve my micronutrition via diet and supplements. Overall, I felt like I was making great progress in my life which made me content.

I was thinking about a conversation I had with my buddy earlier. I don't like tripping in public around people because I am afraid they know that I am ""fucked up on drugs"", and he said they don't know and if they did they would not care because you are not harming anyone. If anything they find it amusing. A few people/kids started coming by us and making noise, I wasn't annoyed at all. I felt genuinely upset that psychedelics are illegal and stigmatized in our society. It's utterly illogical, it's such a benign substance that leads to much self improvement and internalization of thoughts hidden away in your subconscious. Meanwhile it's ok to get drunk as fuck at a bar and ingest literal poison. I wanted to go up to the people near me and tell them: I am on psychedelics and this is a good thing for me, I am improving myself. I basically skipped the middle step of not giving a fuck about what they think to wanting to tell them I'm on acid haha. 

After this wave of euphoria, I decided to play some Shpongle. I was listening to Tales of the Inexpressible (album) - my god this was made for tripping. Shpongle whilst tripping is just magical, it's analogous to opening a portal to a world of psychedelia. I closed my eyes and got lost in the CEV's, I hallucinated that I was in the jungle with a bunch of wild animals. I was roaming free and semi-naked. I've never felt anything like this before, I hallucinated being another person/being because of the music. I kept tabs on my GF, she was crying so I asked what's up. She was going through some realizations about her friendships and social relationships, which I helped her reconcile. Can't really say much more that would make sense here. If you know anything about the ETH headspace, it's very lucid, you can talk to people but you're still tripping balls. 1P-ETH at this dose was more lucid than 300ug ALD-52 but not as lucid as 200ug ETH-LAD. I don't know if this is because of the dose or because of the propionyl group.

About 3 hours later, I was having a bad trip which lasted maybe an hour. I was gasping for air, I thought I was dying and couldn't breath. I had no idea why, but I knew that when this happens it means I need to eat or drink or sleep. I was drinking Gatorade and that disgusting protein/PB/oats shake, which made me feel better but right after I felt EXTREMELY sedated. This always happens on ETH and 1P-LSD, the peak always sedates the shit out of me. I don't know if this is my body telling me that I am sleep deprived, but I slept well this week and actually had great energy before the trip. Anyway, I never felt sleepier in my entire life. I was seriously going to black out, I felt that my body was in danger and that I absolutely needed a bed right now no matter what. I was still gasping for air, and then I could no longer see. I went blind in visuals, I couldn't fucking see for a few minutes which freaked me out. I forgot I brought 4mg etizolam with me but I'm glad I didn't use it at that moment.

So we start heading out so I can go to sleep, but then a storm came out of nowhere! It was getting dark, people were leaving, it started raining and lightning cracked the sky. Everything got better at that moment for me, I gave my GF my umbrella and I proceeded to chill in the rain. What a feeling this was, it was absolutely glorious. No one was here to bother us, I was getting soaked by the rain but it felt great. I saw streaks of lightning, I was thinking of Norse mythology and Thor. I really had to pee too because of excessive paranoid hydration, so I thought if I somehow synchronized my piss with the rain drops it would be socially acceptable (wtf? acid logic). As we were walking, we came across [this](http://www.avenuecalgary.com/2_-George-C-King-Bridge-and-BloomWeb.jpg) which reminded me of Fallout 3. This is where my GF thought it was the end of the world, some post-apocalyptic event. She saw people leaving, heard sirens and was getting rained on so she started freaking out to which I responded by giving her an etizolam (1mg). It didn't do shit, and later when I took 3mg before bed it didn't feel like it did much either besides hunger. I can't post the source here but I won't be buying from them again. Anyway, even though I was enjoying myself I needed to get her indoors so we went to a hotel and chilled in the hotel lobby as we were coming down. What I love the most about ETH is that it's relatively short - you peak for 4-6 hours and then there is a 3-4 hour plateau/comedown. It's like an on/off switch, it's not gradual like regular lucy. At this point I'm comfortable enough to walk in public and interact in public. We chill in the hotel lobby for a couple hours looking at some neat painting while I try to convince her it's not the end of the world. We later go to a Korean bar, I pop my 3mg etizolam and eat this pork bone soup like my life depended on it. I fucking love eating on benzos. We grab dessert (which I devoured) and go home, talking about our trip.

In my experience, ETH has a fantastic afterglow effect the next day and week. I feel like my brain has been washed and cleaned up, I'm eager to go out and live my life. I love this a lot about ETH. I don't get this at all from ALD-52, if anything I get slightly depressed. I think this has to do with the lucidity of the ETH headspace, it makes you actually **remember** everything during your trip without writing it down! It's my favorite chemical for self-improvement so far without a doubt, but I still haven't tried 4-ACO-DMT. My next trip in a month will be a mix of 1P-ETH and ALD-52, from what I've read on Bluelight it's godly. One day, I'd like to take 400-500ug in the comfort of my own bed. I didn't intend this to be a trip report, I just wanted to report on what the experience was because there is very little literature online but I started typing all this. I guess I wanted to internalize it. Cheers."
4vq1k0,9,2016-08-01,Fast turnaround for social media?,Eviltechie,VIDEOENGINEERING,https://www.reddit.com/r/VIDEOENGINEERING/comments/4vq1k0/fast_turnaround_for_social_media/,"My boss came to me today with an interesting problem. Our social media guy wants to be able to put our football highlights on Facebook/Twitter immediately after they happen.

I'm trying to figure out a good way to do this, ideally with things I've got laying around. A couple options came to mind.

* I think our 3Play has some social media features. I'm not sure if they're going to be of any use though. We have the older 820 which is pretty limited on features. Having to stop recording and exit a session to share a video is a deal breaker.
* Our Tricaster 8000 definitely has some sort of social media features. (We cut our shows on a Carbonite now, so it would be free to use.) Unfortunately it's hosed up right now, so I can't mess around with that. I'm not sure how wieldy it will be to operate either.
* Pop a Blackmagic card into one of our editing computers and use it to record. Drop the video into Premiere, trim the ends, throw on a logo, render.

I suspect that the 3Play won't pan out. The Tricaster may work, but I don't really have any place to put an operator. I think my best option so far is just to plop an intern down on one of our editing computers. In fact I already have coax and intercom lines run to our office.

Any thoughts? Any of you doing this already? What do you use?"
4vq9a0,4,2016-08-01,Is my educational background sufficient to get into computational linguistics?,AtaruEwok,compling,https://www.reddit.com/r/compling/comments/4vq9a0/is_my_educational_background_sufficient_to_get/,"Hey guys, I was wondering if I could get some input from this sub about getting into computational linguistics (I know these types of questions are asked a lot, but I feel my situation is a bit different).

So I’m one quarter away from being able to graduate from a well-known state school, with an BA in Information Systems (Which is in my university’s business school). Originally, I wanted to work a business analyst position, but after a couple of internships I feel that it isn’t the right career choice for me. After deciding that I want to work in a more quantitative field, I want to work in computational linguistics/NLP. However, I’m not too sure if I have the sufficient background. 

Some relevant(?) classes I’ve taken so far are: 

An introductory linguistics class (I know NLP/compling doesn’t actually use that much linguistics, but I’ve been fascinated by the subject since high school). 

Introductory programming classes in Java. (I’m also going to take a Data Structures &amp; Algorithms class next quarter). 

College-level calculus (pre-req for upper level math/stats). 

An introductory business statistics class. 

Additionally, I’ve been teaching myself Python recently and taking some MOOCs on Machine Learning/Data Science/Probability/etc. 


However, looking at various Master’s programs in computational linguistics, most programs seem to want either Computer Science/Math/Statistics majors or Linguistics majors. And looking at the course listings for the various Master’s programs, I feel that I should have taken more upper-level courses in math/statistics/programming. I also don’t have any relevant writing samples/academic work for the applications.

If I want to get into the field, is it worth it to stay in school and to add major(s)/minor(s) in Math/Stats/CompSci/Linguistics so that I can get in graduate programs? Or would it be possible/better to get into computational linguistics through work experience via working my way up through data analyst-&gt;data science positions? (Even though I lack a “quantitative” background/degree).

Without giving too much away, I've been with my current company for a little over 3 years. I started out as an intern in college and eventually moved up into a salaried position after graduating. The company I work at is very small and tight knit, but there have been some serious problems with the management in the past half a year. In May, my girlfriend gave me a Come to Jesus moment where she helped me realize that internal drama at my job had been extremely negatively affecting my personality. 

As I saw a huge storm of work coming, I quickly prepared my portfolio and applied to a place that I knew was extremely interested in me. Unfortunately that fell through due to problems with their own management. Poor planning on my part, but oh well. You live and you learn. In the past 2 months, I've had to give up much of my outside personal life for my job and now things have finally slowed down. During this time, I really stepped up and took on a ton of responsibilities I didn't previously have. Performance reviews are coming up tomorrow and I know that I'll be offered a raise. I don't know how much of a raise, but now that things have slowed down, I plan on actively searching for a new job elsewhere. I don't want to work at this place anymore, but I can't just outright quit since I have bills and student loans to take care of. I'm working on building up my emergency fund, but it's nowhere near enough to support me while I search for a new job.

While it's extremely extremely unlikely that I'll have an interview and job offer by tomorrow, what are the ethics involved in this scenario? If I'm offered a raise, would it be unethical to accept it knowing that I'd ideally like to find a new job by the end of the month?

On one hand, it would really be nice to see a small bump in my paycheck and I'm not sure what would happen if I expressed my willingness to leave since they'll likely ask why I declined the offer. I might be fired on the spot or they'd fully support me and give me the time I needed outside of work. On the other hand, my company has been super supportive of me in the past and it feels deceptive to take the money and leave my first career job, and my only reference.

I'd appreciate any advice!

TL;DR – Will likely be offered a raise by tomorrow, but I want to find a job elsewhere. Should I accept the offer or decline it knowing that I want to leave in the near future?"
4vqglo,1,2016-08-01,Would Cryptologic Warfare Officer be a good role for me?,tanachbarski,newtothenavy,https://www.reddit.com/r/newtothenavy/comments/4vqglo/would_cryptologic_warfare_officer_be_a_good_role/,"Hello all. I am a recent graduate from a large Big 10 University with a major in mathematics, and a GPA of 3.98. I spent the summer doing an unpaid political internship in DC to make sure that I don't want to go into politics (which I don't). Anyway, I have been mainly searching for finance jobs lately (I am quite close to securing one); I am somewhat ashamed to admit that searching for a job in this field is quite influenced by a desire for the finer comforts in life. Deep down, I know that money won't buy happiness, and to that end, I have been exploring opportunities in the military, mainly in technical and mathematical areas, in line with my abilities. A couple that I have found interesting are the cryptologic warfare officer role in the Navy, and the operations research analyst role in the Air Force. As regards the former, I have a few concerns that it will be almost entirely a managerial role, and I would like to get into some hard core cryptography or related cyber operations if I join the service, or at least have a strong knowledge of the theory, even if I am not directly implementing anything. I am comforted by the fact the job description implies a high probability of my getting a M.S. in CS or EE if I end up in this role. Also, can anyone provide at least a vague description of the types of duties of such an officer? I have scoured the internet, and I haven't found anything very thorough (perhaps because of the secrecy surrounding the role). Anyway, I am grateful for any insight anyone could provide. During my internship, a fellow intern spoke of a friend who is a CWO and who finds his job simply incredible, secret though it is. Hopefully if I join up I find it that way too. Last question: If I end up getting out after a few years, would I likely be equipped, even as an officer, with the technical skills to found a company of some sort. I know that the Navy ""hands out certs like candy,"" but I am just curious about getting a first-hand account. Thanks for your time."

I did end up going to a programming bootcamp, although it wasn't Code Fellows. I still get people PM'ing me every few weeks asking what I found about Code Fellows and/or bootcamps, so I wanted to post this followup with my experiences so that people find it as well.

The bootcamp industry wants you to think that they can take anyone and, in a few months, turn them into a developer where big companies hand them jobs with $80-100K salaries. TBH that's a lie. Companies will fight over senior engineers, but it's a dog eat dog world for any junior engineer who didn't graduate from a top university. As a bootcamp grad you're at the bottom of the dog pile. Not impossible, but it's not sunshine and rainbows either.
Honestly, programming is half innate aptitude and half learning. Go take an intro programming course at community college. You should be getting the very basic concepts without a problem. If you struggle at all with the beginning stuff, you might not cut out to be a programmer. And that's ok, but don't let the bootcamp industry dupe you into giving them money.


There are a bunch of bootcamps available now, even more so than a year or two ago. They typically run for 2-6 months and cost $10-20K. To be successful, you have to be the kind of person who is self driven. The instructors and curriculums are really hit or miss, so you can't just count on them carrying you through the experience. Also be wary of schools that hire their previous students as instructors. They're doing this for two reasons: one is to pad their statistics so that they can say X% of our graduates are employed, and the other is they might be having trouble attracting real teaching talent. Expect to spend 40-80 hours a week on learning and networking, so you can't have a job while doing it.


Expect to go the full time of your bootcamp plus 2-4 months after you graduate with no salary. Most bootcamps work with lending agencies to finance the cost of tuition, but living expenses are not included in this so have enough savings built up. None of these programs are accredited either, so you're not eligible for government education loans or education tax write-offs. If you're an underrepresented minority, you can often get a small ""scholarship"" for tuition, but it's usually not more than 10%.


When it comes to finally getting a job, bootcamps will help you practice interviewing. So far, I haven't seen any real network for hiring bootcamp grads, so you're on your own. This is another place where you have to be self motivated. You have to network and promote the shit out of yourself. Go to events. If you're just submitting your resume online somewhere you will get ignored. You need to network. You're also most likely not going to get a job at a top company. Google, Facebook, Apple and the likes all have their pick of the best young talent, and they're probably out of your reach for now. 


Most bootcamps grads that I've seen end up at startups or small companies. In general, companies I've talked to don't have a negative opinion of bootcamps, it's more about the total lack of experience. Even new college grads will have internships under their belt. There can be things that work in your favor though. If you come from a STEM background, especially if you have a college degree in a STEM field, it can help soften the blow.


My class finished about three months ago, and I found a software developer job with a well known tech company before I even graduated. About a quarter of my classmates are still looking for jobs. Two dropped out before the course completed, and at least three others finished, but found non tech jobs. Bootcamps can be good for the right person. While overall I don't recommend bootcamps to people, if I had to make the choice over again, I'd still do it.

**EDIT:** Since this is attracting more attention, I wanted to add that several companies are starting programs aimed at taking in bootcamp grads. Microsoft has one called Industry Explorers. Allstate and airbnb have similar programs. So it's not totally bleak :)"

4vqoz1,1,2016-08-02,The transfer dilemma,scurtis28,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4vqoz1/the_transfer_dilemma/,"I am a rising sophomore at a top 50, non target school in the South (NC/VA area, don't think Wake or W&amp;L, I'd consider those semi's) double majoring in Econ and Finance. I currently live around 30 minutes outside of NYC, and I am fortunate enough to have a pretty large network of people around the IB/PE/HF spaces. My school currently has a very young alumni base, with about 15-20 alums in the banking space (mostly BB's or MM's, think CS, BAML, WF, Cantor, HSBC), and maybe 30-35 total alums in areas across those 3 industries I've listed above. I've already been reaching out to plenty for the last several months during my freshman year, and now's about the time I'm going to try and follow up on a few. There isn't a whole lot of structured OCR, but I know that CS and WF come, and there are a couple alums also at BAML. I am super involved in the student run investment fund, to which I'm a sector head (as a freshman). My real knock comes from my freshman year GPA, though. I lost my grandfather about a week before finals during my freshman fall semester, and pretty much tanked. I finished with a 3.0 GPA at the end of freshman year, despite having done well in high school (3.7/3.8). With all this in mind, I did manage to land a IB SA position at a boutique investment bank in my town this summer through a close family friend, which is a fantastic resume booster and looks great to future recruiters, yet my dilemma still remains.

My dilemma is this: I have very deep connections at an Ivy league school (multiple legacy, uncle on the admissions board). I never considered this school during my high school application process because I had yet to learn about banking entirely, thus having no real grasp on the competitive nature of it w/ OCR and the difficulty coming from a ""non target."" Also, this Ivy was ~$20k more per year than my current school which DID factor into my decision making (I'm paying a portion of my own tuition). Keep in mind, while my school is not completely in the dark, it isn't like the semi-targets that you'd think of in the south (like Wake or W&amp;L where several students make it across the BB's).

For me, however, my situation is a little more unique, in that I'd be able to pull up my grades from a 3.0 cumulative to a 3.3, and a major GPA of a 3.6 by the end of the fall semester (aren't liberal arts schools beautiful?!?). I've yet to even delve into my double major classes in Econ and Finance, so this upcoming fall could be a great opportunity for my GPA. This is a fairly realistic goal for me by the end of the upcoming semester, especially because I've yet to fully get into classes surrounding my major until this next fall. Ideally, by the end of sophomore year, I could have a 3.5 cumulative and a 3.7 major GPA heading into SA recruiting in the fall of my junior year at said non-target, which is miles better than where I stand now. My issue really comes in lots of different parts, though. I would much rather stay at my current school because of my close friends, girlfriend, and I just enjoy it more. I really don't like the idea of restarting socially (even though I'd be getting a clean slate academically). I also really love my girlfriend (had to throw this cliche stuff on here, it's Reddit). I know these reasons will really throw my credibility as a wannabe investment banker out the window, just hear me out. I like my current school, and don't want to transfer unless I really do have to. While I'm not an 100% shoe-in at said target Ivy league, I think I have a very solid chance with my high school test scores and involvement on my current campus with the added connections and legacies, being that I'll also be able to raise my GPA before having to apply in February of next year.

So, the age old question is: do I make the transfer to for my junior and senior years? I actually ask this question amongst people in the industry I've spoken to, and have gotten mixed reviews. Some say that it's too late, I won't have any credibility given that I'll jump into recruiting without any real academic performance at said target, there is far more competition alongside your classmates, or that my transfer shows disloyalty and does not guarantee me a job necessarily (which is more than true). That being said, some people also recommend it given that the OCR is a massive advantage and that I'll have more leeway in terms of grades (I won't need a 3.7 or 3.8 from said non-target, a 3.5 will do just fine from the target). Those people suggest I transfer ASAP (do junior and senior years at Ivy). Some people have even suggested I work for a break into IB or ER from my current non target, then pursue an MBA at the Ivy league target school and then work towards my goals from there, or even try for an MSF right out of school. Another super interesting (and my favorite) scenario would be to do 3 years at my current non-target, raise my GPA to a 3.7 or so, go through IB SA recruiting and have my plan B (if all else fails) to transfer to the Ivy, delay my graduation (which could be easy if credits don't transfer fully) and then repeat my junior year at the Ivy and potentially go through the recruiting process once again w/ all the added benefits of OCR and extensive network. This one seems nice but is a bit complicated, not too sure how realistic it is but I'd honestly prefer this situation if transferring seemed like the right path to choose.

I'm pretty certain on either breaking into IB or ER, as my long term goals are at an HF (should've put this earlier). I'm curious as to whether my aspirations to make it to HF affect my transfer dilemma as well, being that some I hear still consider school pedigree when going through their recruitment process (this is, in hedge funds). I'd obviously love to pursue something like the MS Equity Research Sophomore Associate internship next summer as a great way to either follow that path down ER or perhaps leverage that into a IB SA position (I do not care about the size of the bank at all, I have no preference between BB/MM/EB).

I'm incredibly torn and stressed about this decision, especially because it is becoming quite late. I have a terrific internship currently, but my grades were pretty lackluster in my freshman year which makes the uphill battle coming from my current non-target even steeper. I have been networking like crazy in any way, shape, or form, and followed all the guides from this site which has been a very useful tool over the last few months.

Also, I know some people are going to be INCREDIBLY skeptical of my ability to transfer into the school I'm talking about. If you are THAT skeptical and choose to focus on that detail, then just pretend I'm hypothetically a ""shoe-in"" and treat the situation as if I'd get in 100% no doubt.

ANY insight would be incredibly helpful, and sorry for the length it's just a rather long and weird story. Thanks to anyone w/ any advice!"

So, I'm applying to UTD this fall and am almost surely going to UTD unless I miraculously get into Rice and get offered full tuition (which will *not* happen haha, I don't have a perfect score on my ACT, but I know I exceed UTD's assured admission criteria as listed on their website). Here's what I'm concerned about:

I want to be a data scientist. I've shadowed a data scientist who works for a US fortune 50 company, I've had some exposure to database stuff, SQL, DBMSes like Postgres, I know R at a decent level, I'm learning Python, I already have taken some stats courses (I have the basic credits for stats at UTD knocked out already because I took a dual credit stats course with UT Austin last year), I've explored development and testing with an internship in the same company that data scientist guy worked for this summer, and I still like data science. 
However, I want to get a useful internship just about every summer during college, and I want to know if internship/full time job recruiters would laugh at me after an interview (edit: or an equivalent, or simply dismiss me because I have the wrong/too weak of a degree) if I get/pursue a CE degree. I still want to be able to apply for internships with companies like Intel or TI on the hardware side, and I could start off there instead of in software development since I hear the hardware field typically doesn't start layoffs until their employees turn 40. I've still had a passion for hardware for quite a while though, I researched a particular type of electronics component in the summer at UTD 2 years ago (won't say which for anonymity purposes), regularly make contraptions with my Arduinos, mess with my Raspberry Pi, etc, as well as design improved instruments for my school's lab instruments that have low resolutions.

**tl;dr:** I'm pretty sure I want to be a data scientist and I don't need to do any more exploring. 
Question: Could I still get software development internships while pursuing a CE degree, or would I have practically no chance? I also hear the CE degree practically eliminates the possibility of a social life because it is so demanding (is that true?). Should I bother getting the BS in math with a focus on stats in combination with the CS or CE, or should I just get good GRE scores and get a company with a tuition reimbursement program to pay for an MS in data science at SMU or something?


Computer science options
- CS degree (BS)
- CS degree (MS), will need to spend more money though so not preferable (but may be viable)
- Double degree: CS (BS) with specialization in data science, get company I eventually work for to pay for MS in statistics (data science focus) via tuition reimbursement program
- Double degree: CS (BS) with specialization in data science and Mathematics degree (BS) with specialization in statistics, get company I eventually work for to pay for MS in statistics via tuition reimbursement program
- Double major: same as directly above except not double degree

Computer engineering options: 
- Essentially the same stuff as above but replace CS with CE"

4vqr3c,12,2016-08-02,My small state school has almost no research going on. I feel like letting go of my grad school dreams.,_Converge_,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4vqr3c/my_small_state_school_has_almost_no_research/,"I go to a relatively weak state school known for liberal arts and partying. I could have taken an extra year at community college and gotten into much better schools, but after a brutal break up and rough home life I just wanted to get away from my past life and focus on school.

But now at this school I cant find any professors performing research for my department (computer engineering) and there are only a dozen computer engineering students at the school total. 

I talked to the head of my department, and asked him what I should do and he responded ""I dunno. You're kind of on your own there.""

So I'm not really sure what to do. Should I try to talk to professors in other departments to see if they have research going on? How can I land any research internships elsewhere? I dont know where to look. 

And I dont know why anyone would take me for a research internship over other students from better schools.

This is the struggle with going to a weak school. I see the students from Stanford and MIT and UCLA getting amazing, meaningful, highly publicized research and internship experience while I'm sitting here at an unknown school in the middle of nowhere with the head of my department with no knowledge of research going on on campus basically waving me off. 

I cant help but feel that the path is already set for me to never get into a top grad school. All I can brag about is a 3.6 gpa, while my competition is getting internships at NASA, SpaceX, Google, and getting experience under their professors who are top researchers in their fields. I look like absolute shit in comparison.

Anyways, what should I do here? Talk to CS or EE professors? My school's resources for finding research are lacking. 

Also does anyone have any success stories of getting into good grad schools from smaller schools? Because from the stats I've seen its unrealistic for me to try to get accepted to top grad schools if I'm not from a great undergrad school."

Do you think that my background with an actual job, albeit not CS related, is something companies (namely Big N) would take over someone with equivalent credentials?

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

4vs0tk,2,2016-08-02,I (29 M) am thinking about ending a 2.5 year relationship with girlfriend (30 F) due to living locations and Flexibility of Moving,TThrowTThisAAway14,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vs0tk/i_29_m_am_thinking_about_ending_a_25_year/,"Hi R/Relationships,

Obviously this is is a throwaway account based on name. 

To give you a brief background, I (29 M) met my current girlfriend (30 F) by chance at a local young adults event set up through the local Catholic communities.  Over the past several months, the times have been extremely testing and thinking about ending everything because of a constant struggle and desire to potentially move closer to home (Illinois).

I originally moved to the area (san francisco bay area) from college due to work with the understanding that I would only be here for ~2 years due to work relocation transition. As to moving, that is something I am very familiar and comfortable with.  Born and raised in Illinois, college in Oklahoma and Kentucky, along with internships in a different part of Illinois and Louisiana. I always had the ambitions to move back to Oklahoma, Kentucky, Illinois or somewhere close to home due to aging parents and being close to other older family figures.

My girlfriend is a San Francisco Bay Area native. All of her dad's family is from San Francisco area,  and her mom/mom's side is from Los Angeles, and has never necessarily experienced being away from home/family. The furtherest she has been away was college in Reno, where she had extended family as a support group. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but definitely something to consider when it comes to understanding the whole story.

We first met, at the church event, when I had approx. 6 months left in my first rotation located in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I was very upfront about this, considering that I could end up anywhere in the United States/world given the process. Thankfully, I was selected to work in Canada on a 28 day on/28 day off rotational schedule.  During this time, we decided to condense all our living arrangements into one apartment to save on expenses. Plus, this allowed her to move from her parents and to ""grow"" on living on her own.  Unfortunately, the Canadian position was cut short (anticipated 2 years to 6 months), and I was sent back into the relocation program/process.

As the new process started, I knew that I needed to move to show career ambition for the company by moving, wanted to be close to her, and try to figure out a new living situation, while maintaining a relationship.  Unfortunately, I was sent to an operation in Los Angeles, and had to make it work.  During this year, (2015-2016), I spent time on my own, yet traveling back/forth approx. 2 weekends a month to Northern California.

At the same time, the girlfriend is extremely career driven too, and was involved in the teaching profession at the community college level (northern california area; sf bay).  Not only was she very active in this career, but she was on the roll to get the next full-time faculty position.  A position that hasn't happened in over ~20 years. Yes, she got the position, and I decided to look for positions closer to her since her position isn't the move flexible when it comes to moving.

Towards the end of 2016, I was able to find a new position within a new company performing a similar role as before.  This is my current position, and the organization is vastly different from my previous role.  An organization that is extremely stressful, and brings a lot of unwanted stress, emotions into our relationship.

This unwanted stress, emotions has caused the last 6 months to be a living hell.  One that has caused numerous sleepless nights for I.  In the past several weeks, I have been put on various medications to help me sleep, anxiety pills, and other depression medications to see if its my attitude. During the same period of time, a death to a significant member in my family occurred and has only caused more of a want to move home (or closer to home). I have thought about leaving this position and trying to go back to school, applying back to my old company in the local area, all sorts of stuff, but just stuck in a rut.  Not only, have I been put on medicine, but she and I are also going to counseling in the next few days to see what else can be done.

TLDR: Met current girlfriend on a work assignment relocation, had to move a couple times which created long distance relationship, took job to move back, new job has created tremendous stress which affects relationship, family death has caused an increased desire to move closer to home.

I graduate with my degree in CS in 3 semesters. I like that my job is mentally stimulating. I like my team. I would also consider myself a decent programmer and often help my classmates. So why am I contemplating a career change?

On my spare time I volunteer at the animal shelter, go to adoption events, etc. Also, I have an interest in science, but I am going to take more science courses next semester to test my interest or dedication to science. Do you see where this is going? I have been obsessing over being a veterinarian. No I don't fantasize about being a doctor or anything. I am in it for the animals, giving back and a physical job. A lot of veterinarians have told me that loving animals is not a good reason, an ignorant response and that the classes are hard and vet school is hard. I find science courses easy compared to my computer science courses and I use to be a tutor in math and programming. I also have a 3.9 GPA. I am not by any means bragging, but it can get annoying to always hear people say how hard it is all the time. And sometimes i wonder if every STEM major thinks their major is the hardest. Anyways, as a volunteer i don't like driving long distances, picking up poop, staying late, etc. but i do it for the animals. I know a love for animals isn't enough, but i think when there's something you care deeply about behind what you are doing makes a big difference.

I've read that veterinarians are not in demand, plus I would have to take an additional 4 years of school granted i get in. I would also get a starting salary of about 50k probably. As a developer who would graduate next year, I would make a whole lot more with no more school. But i can't seem to move past being a veterinarian. It would be a physical, mentally stimulating job, that would allow me to give back and learn about and work with animals and their owners.

I've decided i want to find a position as a veterinary assistant or technician to make a better decision. That would mean leaving my nice paying, competitive co-op. Should i leave my co-op to see if this is for me? Am i being crazy? The obsession has really died down and I am at a more rational state, but it just wont pass. Advice and experiences greatly appreciated

I need to select and purchase a Micro Controller, specifically one that comes on a developement board similar to the an arduino or beaglebone is, so I dont have to waste time with the circuitry.
The thing that confuses me is that a lot of the MCUs coke with no more than 1MB of flash memory.
So I'm assuming that
1) somehow that's enough memory for most embedded applications
or
2) I'll most likely have to expand the system with an external flash memory or ROM

4vs4o5,45,2016-08-02,I [29F] want to find a nice way to tell my sister [36F] that I'm not ready to move home.,_sister_sister_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vs4o5/i_29f_want_to_find_a_nice_way_to_tell_my_sister/,"**Short background**

I moved abroad and worked in a job I hated for 3 years. During my third year in my crappy job I took an online course in a field I'm interested in. Last summer I landed an internship, I moved one city over and after 3 months they hired me full-time and things have been getting better ever since.

The culture in the company suits me so much. I am genuinely friends with my co-workers, we often socialize together after work or during the weekends. This company hasn't just been fantastic for my career but I'm genuinely really happy here. I'm one of those people who looks forward to coming to work.

**The Present**

Up until a recent pay-rise I was living in a not so great apartment with a few other people (not friends, just other tenants). With my increase in salary I was able to afford to move into a much nicer apartment, and am now living with a good friend.

A couple of months ago I found out I was pregnant. I had always thought if I were to become pregnant I wouldn't be able to go through with an abortion. When it came to the reality of it, I absolutely had no interest in keeping it.

My job was just one of the many factors for me making the decision - I would have to leave the country and give up my job (due to laws here).

I leaned pretty hard on my sister for support. She was incredible and I wouldn't have been able to go through it without her. She gave me financial support as well as emotional (I have paid her back).

So, between me accepting and getting over the abortion, and settling into the new apartment, I finally feel like I've really settled into this new city. Although I don't plan on ""settling down"" here I am genuinely very happy where I am for now.

**The Issue**

I had planned on keeping my abortion from my parents, they found out accidentally. They have been incredible about the whole thing and really supportive.

They are also, as is in their nature, pretty worried about me. I'm the youngest and they've always seen me as their ""baby"", they encouraged me to move abroad and they have no problem with me being here, but now they have all these big concerns - am I lonely, am I unhappy etc etc

They put on a brave face when we Skype and beyond the initial call after they found out and one or two conversations since, they've been pretty normal. But they have always been worriers over the tiniest things so it's not new or unusual, it comes from a place of love and I'm grateful to have parents who care so much about me.

Since I changed career, which happens to be a similar field to my sisters (so she has lots of connections at home) she has been encouraging me to move home. It used to be every now and again when I got given more responsibility in work or whatever (having X experience will be really great on your CV, it'll really help when you move home) but now since the abortion and with my parents added worry she's been pretty intense with the whole thing.

I've mostly been ignoring it, or if she sends me articles (this is what people in X industry are earning in Y city) I thank her and tell her I'll keep it in mind for when I come home. She thinks I'm coming home next year... I'm not sure I want to move home that soon.

After my parents found out about the abortion and talked to her about it, she told me what I already know - my parents are worriers, and as long as I'm away they will continue to worry about me and a good way for me to ease their concern would be to move home, not before the end of this year, but by the end of 2017.

Yesterday I put in an application to take time off to go home over Christmas, a few other people, including my direct boss have already requested that time off so I'll be here. I expected it so although I am disappointed I'm not too surprised or upset, it's all part of the gig. Both my sisters are married and we haven't had a ""all the family together"" Christmas in a couple of years, so again, although disappointing, it isn't the end of the world.

This morning I woke up to message from my sister saying she'd heard the news about Christmas and it's ""all the more reason to get out before Christmas 2017"".

We're planning to Skype soon and I want to tell her, as nicely as possible, that I don't feel any urgency to leave.

I know I'm an adult and it's my life and my career and this shouldn't be a big deal, but I don't want her to feel like I'm being ungrateful after everything she's done for me, nor do I want to be selfish and ignore the fact that my parents are upset and worried.

This is already really long so I'll stop here, but if anyone can share a ""script"" of what I could / should say to my sister to get her to drop the ""moving home next year"" thing, I'd really appreciate it.

**TL;DR I live abroad, I love my job and really feel like I've finally got into my groove here. My sister keeps mentioning that I should move home soon, I don't want to, but I don't want to be ungrateful after she was recently a huge support me. Help!**"

It helps to let it out, and there's no one to really talk to about it, so...


            
I had a mental breakdown last spring. I've had a lot of ""episodes"" in my university experience, but this one took the cake. I overwhelmed myself, and I overwhelmed the people around me. I overwhelmed the person I was seeing at the time, and he distanced himself away from me. This made me more neurotic and as a result, in hindsight, I ended up getting worse and staying worse for a longer period time than usual.

I have depression episodes. I have anxiety. It runs in the family. It's bad. I need help, but I don't get help due to the dream career position I want. Maybe I could reconsider this career, but for now...


            
This summer, I left the country for an internship. Two hours before my flight, I got kicked out of my living arrangements for next year. It was a very shady ordeal - instead of being honest and transparent, my roommate stated that they were not going to get the house back and we should all look for different arrangements.

Finding a new last minute place while working full time in a country with limited internet access was difficult. 

Coming back to the states, I have no friends left on any level. Just trying to talk to my roommate about the security deposit and my items, has been beyond frustrating. It's like he doesn't even care. We were good friends and respected each other and now he treats me like I'm trash. It feels shady, creepy. Uncomfortable.

             
I have this huge pit in my chest where I feel like everything is going wrong. Add on to this, two deaths in the family, parent losing their job. My job is under new awful management - and I tried to escape, and didn't get a position I interviewed well for - I feel like I'm trapped into this job.

I feel sick to my stomach. I feel anxious. I feel like I have no place here, that I'm starting all over again, but this time, with enemies. I've lost my friends - how is that even possible.

I need to work on myself. I need to better myself. Take care of myself. Stay away from alcohol. Do my best. 

             


But how can I do that....it feels like I'm drowning when I don't have a support system to push me through my failures and celebrate my successes. It's made things so much more difficult, more lonely. Everything hurts and pains. I know I'm just at a rough time in life right now. But I feel I need something to push me. 

How do I move forward when I feel like I'm drowning in these problems? Doing the internship in another country was great to escape these issues and focus on improving myself and having a good time. But now I'm back in reality.

4vslb5,492,2016-08-02,WI-FI Electricity,tehpruno,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4vslb5/wifi_electricity/,"Hey. It's my 1st post, ever. And i'm sorry (for humanity) to say that it's actually a true story...

This happenned during an intership i had to do for my studies.

I was working in a tech support company.

Basically, all i had to do was to go where my boss told to me go and fix what had to be fixed. 

I was working in pair with my brother who also is a technician in this company (that's actually how i found the internship).

Here's what happenned :
#me = me
#lebro = my brother
#stupid= the woman i had to deal with

Our boss told us that a company bought some new computers without asking our company, and made a call saying the new computers weren't working.

Our coworkers, after a little remote troubleshooting really thought that the said computers were, indeed, broken in some way since they weren't showing on the showing on the network (no IP delivered from the DHCP) and the woman who called said that they were **PLUGGED** (keep this in mind, it's important). 
Also remember that the computers WERE NOT laptops.

So they sent us to go check what's happening.

We arrive at the company's office at around 10 am, asking to talk to woman who made the call or whoever could explain to us what happenned.
Of course, we were told that this woman was never there before 10:30 am and nobody else touched the new computers. (she was the ""IT referent"" in this company, basically, she was the one with whom my company would talk for any IT related topic).

Well, whatever, we waited 30 mins.

AND FINALLY, THE WOMAN ARRIVES !

&gt;**ME**: Hello, we are from [ITcompany's name]. We're here to see what's going on with the new computers you said you had troubles with.

&gt;**STUPID**: Oh yes, please come with me.

We follow her and she shows us the computers, which she f*cking put back in their package because they were ""broken"".

My brother and I take them, go into an empty room and start unpacking them and plug them in. Everything works fine.
My brother goes to talk to the woman.

&gt;**LEBRO**: So we've checked the computers, everything's working fine, could you please tell me exactly what you've done ? Maybe we can recreate the issue and know what happenned.

&gt;**STUPID**: I've unpacked them and **PUT THEM ON** (it's important too) the desks they're supposed to be.

&gt;**LEBRO**: Okey, Are you sure you've plugged them right, the desks you're talking about are all ready to have a computer ? (new desks, new rooms, maybe the electricity could have a problem that's why he asked)

&gt;**STUPID** : What do you mean ? We're in 2015, aren't these things supposed to work without wires ? Like my computer ? (she had a **laptop**)

&gt;**ME** : (holding myself together so i don't let even a little smile out) Hum, ma'am, these aren't laptops, they're desktop computers, they need electricity to work. That's why there are wires in the packages.

&gt;**STUPID** : I'm not that stupid (hum...) ! I know what i'm doing, i'm telling you that everything works via WI-FI nowadays !

&gt;**LEBRO** (staying surprisingly calm) : Okey then, come with me.

My brother starts to unplug one of the computer (which was shut down) and tries to power it on. Obviously, it doesn't work.

&gt;**LEBRO** : See ? It doesn't work without the wires.

&gt;**STUPID** : Then why is computer working without being plugged all the time ?

&gt;**ME**: It's a laptop, it has a battery which is reloaded every time it's on your docking station. 

We later found out that she never moved the laptop off the docking station, and since she didn't know what that was, neither saw any cables coming out from it (the desk had a hole under the docking station where the wires were going through), and had a wireless mouse+keyboard, she really thought that everything was working via WI-FI.

YES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ELECTRICITY VIA WI-FI

(for those who don't know what a docking station is, it's a device in which you plug your laptop, it can add some USB ports, a video adapter (VGA, HDMI, w/e...) and other stuff)

Long story short. I came here for a training and internship that was supposed to end up in a job but the company kind of screwed me over and hired someone else. So now I'm on the hunt for viable legal options to stay in Cape Town as that was the original intent. I can extend my tourist visa (and I will), but I am looking for longer term options that I can pursue in the meantime. Someone had suggested a volunteer visa but I'm wondering if /r/capetown knows more. I'm in the tech industry (as well as NGO industry), 27 year old male. 

Any advice you can offer is highly appreciated :) 

Thanks!"

I want to wait but I also want to find other options?,ynot269,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vssgh/how_should_i_handle_this_situation_i_want_to_wait/,"I have a friend who is a manager at a software company in my area, and I have another friend who works under him. Lets call them John and Derek. Now John is trying to find out the intern situation at this company , some interns are leaving for school out of the area so they're looking to hire new interns. He said it would be about two weeks for him to find out. Now I talked to Derek prior to this summer about a position at the school as a web developer (front end, cold fusion related). The position at John's company is an intern position using Django (which i love), and the position that Derek was going to help me with is a student developer position at my school. School starts in about 2-3 weeks, my internship ends in 1 week. Will my asking of Derek about the position (he said to talk to him towards the end of the summer) harm my chances of getting a job at John's company? They're close friends. I think I have a higher chance getting a job with Derek's because it's a student developer and I know the manager, he was my professor last year. But the job at John's company is the one I really want. What should I do?

tl;dr Will asking my friend about a job harm my chances of getting a job at the company he works at with my friend who'd be my manager? If I'm late with the student developer and don't get the intern position at John's company I'll still be able to work at school at a student tech but I want more dev experience as far as real world goes.

Im a soon to be graduate of Accounting and Business Information Systems currently interning at a ICT company. From my experience at my internship I have found that networking/ sys admin roles really interest me as they seem a lot more hands on/ technical and more site work than accounting. 

After searching around a bit it seems like BIS is more a business/ theory degree rather than technical which puts me in a funny position. Throughout my degree I have done SQL, SAP and Visual Basic classes but never anything about networking/ actually installing servers etc which is what I am more interested in. 

To get to this position would a BIS degree be fine? or should I continue my education by getting certifications related to networking/ sys admin areas? 

Thanks in advance"
4vszw2,1,2016-08-02,Advice on how to build a media server for my company?,theuser_17,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4vszw2/advice_on_how_to_build_a_media_server_for_my/,"I'm a paid intern at a media and web design company.  We have around a 10 terabyte server running on 10 gigabit Ethernet that connects to all of our work machines.  This is very important because about half of the people working in our office are dedicated to video production.  They make info-graphics, advertisements, and tutorial videos on how to use our software.  Most everyone in the office is using OSX, and our server is currently working great, but for some reason is having compatitbility issues with the newer versions of OSX and we are never able to stay up-to-date.  On top of that, we no longer have anyone who can maintain the server, and my company is looking to replace it.  The only problem is that we are a small company, and when we called in a professional (who'm we trust) he quoted us around 10 grand just to get a new server.  

I know it is in a RAID set up, but I'm not sure which kind.  I also know that we have crazy amounts of 4k footage that is stored only on that server, without any external backups.  All of my co-workers do not have room on their hard drives to work on the files locally, so they need a server that is fast enough they can edit large 4k video files in real time, with no latency.   It is important that the server has some form of redundancy or backup in case one drive fails, or a power outage, as I have seen the power completely go out for the entire building at least twice in the past three months. 

Obviously, I don't know much about servers or their maintenance, but I would love to hear some expert advice on this.  What options do we have?  I would not mind building one myself if there was a decent tutorial online.  Alternatively, my company might prefer buying a pre-built one that is easy to install, so long as we know that we can service it ourselves. 

Thanks for the help!"

I'm responsive, well-written, creative, and of course dominant.

I love the exchange of power that happens during sex, especially in a dom/sub setting. Together I'd like to set a scene where I dominate you and peel you back layer by layer as you submit to my will.

I want to craft a passionate story together where our characters get to explore their kinks, as we explore ours. Let's write scenes that leave us craving the next little orange letter.

Let's work together to negotiate the scene, but my ideas are:

- I'm your boss. Perhaps you are an intern, or a new employee. here's been tension building up and one night we are both alone in the office working after hours and I make my move.

- You are my good friend's wife. I'm married too. The four of us double date sometimes. Maybe our kids even play together. There's always been a tension between you and I. Something happens and we find ourselves together without our spouses and the tension is worse than ever.

- You are my submissive little slut and I've got work friends over for dinner. I order you to only wear your collar, a thong, and that bra that's a size too small. Things heat up as the guests arrive and I push you further and further past your limits.

I'm open to other scenes, but hopefully that gives you a feel for what I'm interested in. Can't wait to start writing together."

Vale’s northeastern ports were been bustling, and merchants from all walks of life had come to the area with wares and skills. However, as dusk settled on the little towns dotting the countryside, it seemed that a cloud of heaviness was trapped between Remnant and the stars. Iris was supposed to leave at sunset. Instead of heading off for the mountains – a trek that would take days – the girl found her feet drawing her closer to home. After all the time she spent waiting, she never thought this moment would make her feel so ill. She didn’t know how late it was now, but it was late enough to be early. Finally deciding that she had to go while she still had the willpower - and while her loved ones were sleeping - she packed her bags. As she stepped out under the curtain of stars, she took one last look at the coast, longing to remain.* 

*Almost invisible against the hills, Iris spotted her brother and came to another halt. Other than the soft ripples of his coat in the breeze, he was completely still… and the sight of him felt like a chilled knife wedged into her chest. As she reached his side and put down her bag, the young man didn’t move, or even turn to her. Without really thinking, Iris sat down next to him and laid her head on his shoulder, hoping he’d put an arm around her. He didn’t.*

“You should get going, Iris.”

*Iris winced at the sharp response. She always knew when he was angry.* “You know I can’t go just yet…”

*With a restrained sigh, the young man stood up, leaving Iris in the grass. With his hands in his pockets, he started to walk towards camp.* “Fine, then,” *he began in a hard tone,* “I’ll *help* you.”

“Wha…?! No, wait, no. No! Come back!” *Bolting to her feet, Iris ran to her brother and grabbed his arm, stopping him dead in his tracks. As much as he wanted to shake her off and leave, the girl had an iron grip. If she wanted him to stay put, he was helpless.* “Just… agh! Listen to me! Come on, wait!”

“Why?!” *Finally breaking free of her, he jerked backwards and recovered his balance.* “Why do you think you have to go?! Do you really think this is all we have?!”

“Yes!!!” *Throwing her arms down, the look on her face was one of pure shock. Her brother’s eyes narrowed in return.* “You know we’ve tried everything! We just keep fighting and fighting but nothing’s changing, it’s just getting worse! I can’t keep watching-”

“Then just go! Leave!”

“I’m not ready, okay?!”

“Aaaagghh…!” *For a moment, Dietes spun away, but only to hold his head in his hands. For a moment, he almost looked like he was about to storm off… but then he turned on his heels to face Iris again.* “If you’re not ready, then stay. You know you want to stay. You can’t tell me you want to go.” 

*Relieved, Iris sighed, but did so with an exhausted look in her eyes.* “I don’t want to go… but I have to, we’ve been through this…”

“You DON’T have to! I…! Iris… listen to me…” *After a pause pausing to collect himself, the young man stepped back to his sister. To any other person, it would seem like he jumped to a calm, negotiating tone in a heartbeat. Iris knew better. He was stressed, and very, very upset. Likewise, he knew she was at the end of her rope.* “We’ll be fine… we’re growing up and getting stronger, I know it’s hard, but it’ll be enough-”


“What if it’s not?!” *Iris blurted out, closing the distance between them.* “What if everything we’re doing and everything we’re fighting for isn’t enough to keep us all alive one day?!” *As Iris started to rant, Dee groaned and held his head, starting to walk away. He wasn’t up for this, and she didn’t seem to care.* “We’re at a breaking point and everyone’s acting like it's fine! It’s like we’re all walking on the edge of a cliff and nobody can see the rocks, it’s driving me crazy! Everyone’s just so stubborn that we can’t admit we’re losing, and WE’RE the ones paying the price! I’m tired of watching! I’m tired of having to say goodbye to EVERYONE and never knowing who’s gonna come back! I’m losing my mind, Dee! I’m losing my mind! I can’t live like this anymore! I’m tired of never knowing who’s gonna be next! We’re out of second chances!!!”

*Dietes finally snapped. He whirled around to face her, tears springing up in his eyes.* “You can’t save everyone, Iris!!!”

*Without even a thought, she came back screaming.* **“LET ME TRY!!!”**

*A heavy silence fell between the two. As tears began to escape from Dietes’ eyes, his vision cleared, and he realized she was crying too. However, he knew with a pang of regret that these weren’t her normal tears. A softness came over the eldest’s face as he realized the girl was shaking. There was a familiar look anguish in her eyes that she was trying to mask with anger… or perhaps resilience. Whatever she was thinking, it wasn’t working. He sighed, reached out his arm, and then quickly grabbed the girl as she started weeping in his arms. Wordlessly stroking her hair like he had done for his sisters hundreds of times before, he held her close as tears rolled onto his shoulder.* “L-let me try…”

*Before long, the pair was sitting down as Iris cried on his shoulder. It was far too late at night – or rather, far too early in the morning – for either of them to be up. Holding his sister close, he whispered apologies and words of comfort, while Iris tried to do the same. Over time, they settled… Dietes tried to speak up. Unlike before, his voice was hardly a whisper... softly and without confidence. As the childlike girl sat up and rubbed her eyes, he considered not speaking at all.* “Iris,” *He finally began,* “you don’t have to do this.” 

“Yes I do,” *was her tired reply. He sighed.* “We… someone has to go. And if no one-“

“We can get someone else-”

“No one else wants to go.” *Quickly butting back in with her piece, Iris was still for a moment, then sighed. She lost her train of thought.* “I… I’ve been asking around. Nobody wants to talk about it.”

*Pausing softly, Dietes waited to see if she’d speak again before saying his piece. She didn’t.* “You know what they want to say to you. We need you here. I know you’re scared but this isn’t the time for doing something drastic.”

*After a quiet moment, Iris sighed.* “Dee… I *want* to. I want to stay here more than *anything*. But… every time I try to stay where I’m safe, or stay where I’m happy… it seems like I’m just waiting for it to all fall apart…” *As Iris went on, her voice began to crack. She turned to her brother, only to huff and turn away when he didn’t respond. She felt tears springing up in her eyes and forced them away.*

“Then I’ll go for you.” *He quietly replied.*

*There was a pause, and Iris looked up in shock.* “What…?”

---

---

*They had been gone far too long. As he pulled his coat up over his chin to fight back the cold, Dietes struggled to fight off what felt like a chilled knife boring through his chest. He was checking his gun for the fifth time that night when he saw a blurry figure trudging through the storm, and seconds later, someone raised an alarm. The young man was on his feet before the figure even reached the gate, but on his way, the rising sound of yelling and shouts set his nerves on fire. As he turned the last corner, he found himself paralyzed, eyes wide with horror. For a moment, he couldn’t breathe, let alone move. As his father stumbled through the door, he passed off the small, unconscious figure he’d been cradling in his arms. As Crocus buckled in the doorway, Dietes realized he was looking at his sister. He then saw the blood.*

*An impact against his back was what snapped Dietes out of his shock, and as his mother rushed to the scene with bandages and needles, he started running too. Gauze, medication, blankets - every and any task at all to stop his head from spinning. As he raced through the halls, the stories started weaving through the grapevine, pieces falling together one by one. Somehow, someone managed to get Crocus in a bed; as the best medics rushed to save the young girl’s life, interns and old friends struggled to calm the father down. He sobbed as his allies tried to wrap his wounds. As Iris’ mother worked on her, she kept Dietes away in an effort to keep him calm, but all he felt was numbness and shock. Iris’ sisters - Freesia and Tritonia - weren’t even allowed in the room. As the family’s eldest rushed out to get more supplies, he locked eyes with his sisters. They asked him why he was crying. He was silent.*

*Iris screamed when her father went down. As rocks and debris tumbled down the shallow escarpment behind him, Iris turned and jumped down, with her aunt and uncle on her tail. Everything had gone horribly, horrifically wrong… but she wasn’t letting go. Not now. As the girl tumbled to the bottom, she reached her father’s side and found herself surrounded by flickering, red eyes; with fury raging in her own, she stood to full height and drew her weapon. Within seconds, they were on her, and she started slashing at them like mad. The girl was untrained, and was already losing in the seconds it took for backup to reach her. Nivenias was the first to touch soil, and he blasted the pack of beowulves, giving Iris a moment of respite. At the same time, Azorina began to heal Iris’ father, all while screaming at her niece to fall back. She refused. Nobody knew how long the fight went on, but even though Crocus was brought to his feet, the storm brought nightfall early. It could’ve been midnight, dawn… no one knew. Already exhausted from hours of fighting their way home, the battle pushed the quartet far off route… and the Grimm just kept coming. Iris was quickly running out of steam but refused to stop fighting. Vague memories of a bridge to the West pushed the group onwards, but as they made a run for the plains, they found themselves surrounded. It was a nest.
They chose to run.*

*With her legs pumping as hard as they could, Iris felt like she was running through wildfire. Pure animosity sprung to life all around her, and she fought back screaming, with every ounce of strength she had left. Somehow through the roar of the fight, someone called out that they saw a bridge, and Iris felt something… relief. Hope. Longing. With her head spinning, she was already planning on how they’d reach it. ‘Kill the grimm and run… no… shield them? What would work?!’ As Iris bolted off towards her family, her mind was far ahead… too far. She didn’t see the one she nearly killed as it lunged for her leg, and knocked it out from under her. Hearing a sharp cry of pain, her father whipped around to find his daughter on the ground, fending off an Alpha from the ground. Her leg was bleeding. She didn’t look like she could hold on. Crocus cried out to her. Iris turned up to look at him.*

*And in that moment, the pair saw mirrors of themselves. Time seemed to slow as she watched two beowulves arc through the air, bloodied claws and teeth reaching out for her father’s neck and head. In that same moment, Crocus saw his daughter’s hand slip. As her weapon clattered to the ground beside her, he watched the alpha dive down, and he lunged for it with a roar. As his feet left the air, the girl reached out, and Crocus’ world became blurred. A soft, lilac light surrounded him like a cocoon of glass - weightless but strong. He heard teeth gnashing at the nape of his neck, but the wound never came. In the moment when the Alpha reached his daughter, he reached it as well, and the force launched it clean off of her. Man and beast fell to the ground, and as Iris screamed behind him, he brought his axe down again and again, crying out as he bludgeoned the creature that DARED to touch her. Crocus wheezed as it finally died, fading to dust in his hands. Hearing gunshots above his head, he watched as his brother shot down the pair that had lunged at him first… and reached his little girl.*

*Time came to a standstill.*

*Seeing what happened to their niece, the pair fell back into the fight, killing anything that tried to approach the wounded girl. As Crocus pulled her up in his arms, it seemed she was dead. The girl was gravely wounded, and her torso had been torn open completely. As blood flowed out of the wounds, he wondered if moving her would take her life. But when he found her breathing, when she opened her eyes… it was all he needed. Wrapping his coat around her body, he picked her up, ignoring a cry of pain. As rain poured down, it grew harder and harder to see any sign of freedom. But he wasn’t letting go. Not now.*

*With Iris down and Crocus out of the fight, Azorina and Niveneas pulled out all the stops trying to make a break for the bridge. Wildly unprepared, they knew any blow could be their last, but still they fought on. After a war that felt like hours, dawn finally began to break, and they saw it: an old, rickety bridge that would take them across the canyon. Clutching his daughter, Crocus ran across, covered by his family. The storm howled as he crossed and threatened to knock him over the edge, but finally, he reached the end. Setting Iris down in the grass, he turned to face his brother, drawing his weapon from his back.* 

*Niveneas ordered his little brother to halt. For a moment, Crocus didn’t understand what was happening… but as the realization hit, he screamed at them to stop. For a moment, all he saw was the silhouette of the two lovers in the night. They didn’t say a word, but there was a knowing in their eyes… something unspoken and more real than anything that could be said. As Nivenias let loose a blast of aura on the Grimm, his wife turned and fired at the bridge, red light enveloping the weapon. Just like that, the final link between the family was set ablaze. Crocus looked on in shock as Niveneas took his wife by the hand and started to run, trailed by scores of Grimm behind them. Without him slowing them down, they ran free, unhindered by the storm or even the world. As they took off for the woods, both of them looked at him, with smiles and warmth in their eyes. They fought and fled as one with a synergy that was indescribable, holding hands like little kids who had discovered love for the first time. Crocus fired into the horde from across the canyon, tears flowing from his eyes. He even ran along the edge of the canyon, chasing the pair for as long as he could. But as the storm roared through what was left of his world, their images grew fainter, and then, faded away. Sobbing into the night, he finally realized that they were gone.*

“Dee… no. We need you here. You know you can’t leave.” *Iris was in shock, but as the first break the silence, it was her this time who pulled her brother out of it.*

“Well... I say you can’t leave either.” *Iris huffed and placed her head on his shoulder, trying to fight off tears. Dietes simply embraced her. For a long time, the pair sat in silence.*

---

---

*After quite some time, Dietes brushed a lock of hair off the girl’s face as she tried to stifle a set of tears. With a resigned look in this eyes, he tried to hold her attention.* “Listen… if we’re gonna send one of us… then why can’t it be me? You’re strong enough to watch ‘em on your own. You’ve grown up. But I’ve had more training. If any of us are gonna be a huntsman, wouldn’t I be better? Then you could stay home. You can handle it. And I know you want to.”

*Iris sighed as her brother tried to convince her. It wasn’t what she expected him to say… and somehow, she wanted to hear it. But although some tension left, her heart was still heavy. She shook her head.* “No. No way. We need you here more. I couldn’t take it without you. But… I’ll be okay alone. I need you to hold ‘em until I get back. Then I’ll be stronger. And I’ll bring back my books and teach you everything. But if you left now, I…” *Shaking her head again, Iris stopped to dry her eyes.*

“I know you don’t want this, Iris,” *Dee interjected. Instead of refuting her point, he simply jumped to changing her mind. At least he knew she’d agree on this.* “You can’t hide it. Nothing bad’s gonna happen if you don’t. I mean, I… I’ll train you. I’ll teach you everything. And if that’s not enough, we can find a better trainer. Someone from home. You won’t have to be gone so long, and you could come find us whenever you wanted…” *A faint, brief smile cracked across Iris’ lips, and Dee smiled too. Tucking his knees up to his chest, he placed his arm around her. He saw that quick spark of longing in her eyes.* “Come on. Wouldn’t you like that? You don’t have to do this… please.”

*The sun was coming up. As the darkness around them began shifting to grey, Iris couldn’t help but look up at the stars. As the first whispers of dawn started creeping up the horizon, it seemed the night was shying away… but for now, it hung over her, silent and calm. For a few moments, she reveled in it… the peace, the darkness, the warmth around her. But it wasn’t meant to last. As her face turned back down, the sadness returned, and her voice shook.* “I… I would. I’d love to. But I don’t think it would be enough…”

“What if it *is* enough?” *With a weak grin, Dee stroked the girl’s hair with a look of worry in his eyes. She was thinking.* “What if you could stay here and everything would be okay?”

*Closing her eyes with the gentle motions, Iris tried to deny the sunrise. She didn’t want to make this choice just yet… she didn’t want to go at all. However, as the greying horizon began to glow, she was forced to open her eyes. The day was coming whether or not she left, and as she watched her time run out, she began to cry. All these years fighting, all these months trying…*

“If staying here could make it all okay, then… then why hasn’t it happened already?”

*As a soft wind came through the valley from the West, Iris’ words hung in the air. Dee didn't respond. With a weak sigh, the girl shut her eyes, listening to the air wash over the grasses and wildflowers around them. Soon, she felt a sudden heaviness at her side. She knew it was her brother hanging on her shoulder… but looking closer, her eyes narrowed. Immediately, she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him close, hoping the motion would comfort him. In return, he embraced her tightly, tears falling down onto her hair. He finally couldn't stand the silence. As desperately as he wanted to stop it, the young man started to shake as his sister tried to console him. Iris nuzzled up against his shoulder and rubbed his back like their mother always did, but this time, she knew it wouldn’t stop the tears.*

“I… I don't know, Iris... I don't know…”

---

---

**“Iris. What do you really want?”**

**“I’m… tired of being helpless. I want to keep everyone safe.”**

**“Iris... no. What do YOU want?”**

**“I…”**

*As the light grew thin on the countryside, Iris tried to keep her thoughts ahead - and focused on why she was here. She hated being alone like this, but she knew it would be worth it soon. The preparations had been made long ago, her friends and loved ones knew of the journey, and all she had to do was get there. Still, the girl couldn't help feeling an ache as she realized how alone she truly was. Hearing a crackle at her back, Iris whipped out her weapon and swung behind her, bisecting a small beowulf at her heels. Her brow furrowed as she watched it fade like dark fire, its embers disappearing like dust. The forest had seemed eerily calm this whole time… nothing like the first time she passed through this place. As she sheathed Ensata, Iris let out a cool sigh. Was this... getting easier? Or was it a trap? The one thing she feared was getting cocky, but at the same time, she wanted to believe she was getting stronger. As she turned to continue her journey, she hoped that this easy night was a sign of good things to hold on to.*

*After what felt like hiking for hours, Iris saw the building she'd been looking for, and her heart began to flutter. With the winter's snow melted away, sprigs of ivy had enveloped the familiar stones and beams, but the sight was familiar as always. With wide, hopeful eyes, memories of children playing in the meadows and bright, cheerful laughter filled the scene before her. Every time she came back to this place, the rush of familiar senses left her breathlessly overwhelmed. The rainbow of wildflowers twisting in the wind, the clean smell of trees and fresh air, the birds chirping in the first streams of dawn, the soft, tender grass under her feet... for a moment, she couldn't process it all. Slowly, however, a smile came to her face... and she finally realized she was home.*

**“At the end of the day, I don’t wanna lose anyone. It’s not knowing that kills me. I need that to end. And I’ll do anything.”**

*Iris felt like she was going to jump out of her skin as she made her final steps through the plains. There was so much she wanted to say, and so many different places to begin. Reaching the door, the girl was practically quivering with anticipation. For a moment, she hesitated. It was so early outside, and she didn't want to startle anyone still asleep. Finally, a childlike spark came to her eyes and she couldn't wait a second longer. She reached out for the heavy oak doors and knocked hard, then started bouncing on her toes. Nothing happened at first, and Iris started fidgeting like a little girl... but slowly, she heard footsteps and muffled voices approaching. After a few moments, the door opened to reveal a pair of sleepy, pajama-clad girls.*

*For a few moments, the trio stared at each other without a word. Iris started down at the twins with wide-eyed joy, and her sisters looked up with drowsy confusion, then sudden shock. For a moment, all three were frozen, and a grin slowly crept onto Iris' face. All of a sudden, the twins screamed and jumped into her arms. Iris jumped forwards to catch them, and within seconds they were dogpiled on the ground. As her baffled little sisters started cuddling her and crying in her arms, Iris squeezed them back, and uncontrollable laughter took over. Even as tears streamed down her face, the relief flowing through her veins washed away months of worry in an instant. All she wanted was to hold them close, and there they were. Embracing them as she nuzzled their heads, Iris felt like she was breathing for the first time in weeks. She didn't want to let go.*

**“Every time I come home, I wanna see mom and dad… and the girls, and every one of my friends…”**

*Drawn in by the commotion, the sound of footsteps echoed through the halls, stopping short as their owner reached the entrance. When Iris looked up, she locked eyes with a familiar, loving form. With that warm grin Iris loved to see, Dahlia smiled at her girls as she swept a lock of hair behind her ear. With an elated smile and pride in her eyes, Iris laughed and squeezed the little girls. Dahlia finally couldn’t resist a hug and went to sit on the floor, easily wrapping her arms around them all. Iris nuzzled her forehead against her mom’s hair, and sighed as the woman pulled her close. She kissed her daughter's head and started stroking her hair, causing the overwhelmed girl to melt in the embrace. Chuckling at the state of her baffled daughters, their mom finally suggested they all come inside and get ready for bed. Standing slowly, the kids begged Iris to let them take her gear inside, and as Iris shrugged off her backpack she let out a weary laugh. Wiping tears from her own eyes, Dahlia pulled Iris into a tight hug, briefly having her all to herself. Iris shut her eyes and rested her head on her mother's heart, relieved to hear the steady rhythm. Slowly, she felt at peace again.*


**“… and you. I want that more than anything.”**

*For the remainder of the night, things were calm. As Dahlia watched over them, the pajama-clad trio cuddled themselves to sleep, exhausted from travel and shock alike. Sitting down with her daughters, she couldn’t help but chuckle… the twins were mirrored as always, and even asleep, Iris kept them under her wings. As her girls snoozed away, she went to bed nearby, thankful to see them together again. Dahlia woke with the dawn and crept to the gates while her kids slept in.* 

*Spotting a pair of figures coming home with the sunrise, a delighted smile came to her face, and she ran out to meet them. Her husband and son were quick to scoop her up in a hug. Knowing their peaceful morning wouldn't last, Dahlia innocently asked how their trip was, plus all the motherly things that good mothers ask. Seeing that everything was well, Dee set off to pack away their camping gear, leaving his parents alone. The couple spent a few tender moments together, but when their son was out of sight… Dahlia started to snicker. Knowing that their secret plans a success, Crocus simply shook his head and smiled. Although their parents tried to slip back to the fortress quietly, the girls weren't fooled; three drowsy heads poked up above the sofa as they entered. The twins were the first to react, practically leaping over the couch to tackle their dad with a squeal. The bear of a man scooped them up effortlessly, trying not to laugh as they shared their news in hyperactive stereo. Although Iris was stunned, her sisters were wide awake. As she realized what she was seeing, she watched the scene with big puppy eyes, just waiting for a chance to jump in. With calculated wit, Dahlia revealed that Dee was ALSO home from camping; the twins raced off to find him.*

*As Dahlia laughed at the display, Crocus simply scratched his head… then grinned and walked to Iris with outstretched arms. The sleepy girl vaulted over the sofa, jumped into her father's arms, and was swept off her feet. Overwhelmed with relief at seeing him safe, she couldn't help but to cling to him, and he did the same. Iris had sworn that she wouldn’t cry, but as her father started tearing up, she did too... but this time, from joy. Finally letting her go, Crocus looked down and saw a years' worth of stories written in her eyes. Days of fear, days of triumph, all kinds of heartache with brightness to match… and always, that look of longing. Longing for home, or comfort, or safety... and sometimes just the little things she had once taken for granted. She never lost that big, wide gaze that meant she wanted something, but felt she couldn’t ask. With a soft smile, he pulled her back into his arms, and she squeezed him tight. Iris shut her eyes and refused to let go, not knowing knowing how much her strength had grown.*

**“When I lay down at night, I wanna know that when I wake up…”**

*Dietes was enjoying a brief moment of quiet when his sisters burst into the stables, shouting excitedly and waving their arms. He could usually understand them when they were like this, but for once, it was almost impossible. Trying to calm them down didn't work, and he was just about to let them tire themselves out when two words slipped through to him: “Iris”, and “home”. As the realization hit him, Dee dropped his bags and let the twins lead him away.*

*Finally pulling herself together, Iris was at the gate when she spotted her siblings in the morning light. While the twins rushed out to greet her, the eldest stopped in his tracks and stared in shock. Iris gave her girls a squeeze, then rushed to her brother and just about tackled him to the ground. As she laughed and held him tight, for once he was speechless. The young man was normally stoic, but the surprise was too much for him this time. A bewildered smile came to his face, and he started to cry as he pulled her into his arms. Fighting through the shock and disbelief, he started to realize he wasn't dreaming; he really was standing here. She had really made it home, and she really was okay. As cracks finally broke through his composure, he embraced the girl as she did the same, and fell to the ground.*

*When their parents finally poked their heads outside to watch, they found the entire quartet sitting in the grass, hugging and crying like little kids. Overwhelmed and overjoyed, Iris was trying to recount all her adventures, but could hardly think through the relief buzzing through her head. Finally, after so long, they were all here... and all okay. They hadn't been hurt or lost while she was gone, and finally, the danger was over. Months of pent-up stress started to dissolve all at once - a feeling she'd longed for that whole time. Iris melted into the bundle of hugs, and for the first time in months, she had her whole family at her side. Tired of being brave, she simply let go and allowed herself to be young again… small and held dearly, like she’d been wanting desperately for so long. Warmth, comfort, and everything she needed in life was right here, and for once she could relax and let it be hers. She never, ever wanted to let go.*

**“... in the morning, I’ll open my eyes...”**

'And I won't be alone. I won't be terrified. I won't… be *expecting* someone to die on me... all the time, every day… it's driving me crazy. I'm tired of giving everything I have only to find it's not enough. I'm tired of being useless and weak, ‘cause when someone needs me, I want to be there… no. Not just that. I want to be there and change things. I want to know that everything's gonna be alright. But it's not. Okay? I admit it. It's not. And honestly, I don't think it ever will be. But if the next best thing is to fight and win then I'll take it. I'll take everything. I'll go to the ends of the earth if it only means that they'll be okay. I can't survive alone. I'd rather die than be alone… I can't say goodbye.'

'… I'm so scared.'

'I need… something. Because I know we'll never make it if we don't change. And if no one else will do this then I will, but… God, why couldn't someone else?! Why couldn't all those stupid fairy tales be real for once?! I can't stand living on the brink like this and never knowing who's gonna be next, I just want to live! I'm tired of being scared, I'm tired of fighting… I don't want to be a hero. I want to be home. I want to be with the girls and Dee… I want to watch them grow up. And I want to stay with mom and dad. I want to be home with my friends and see them every day. And now I want my team… and all my friends from Beacon… oh, why did I let myself do this? I wasn't supposed to get attached... I know I can't protect them all. I want to keep everyone with me and I know that'll never happen… stupid. I'm stupid. But if they’re gone… if I lost even one… I don't think I could go on. I already feel like my whole world is just falling apart…'

'I have to stop this. I'll do anything. I can't say goodbye, not again. Later… okay, I can say later. I can live knowing they're out there and okay. But not goodbye. Never goodbye. If doing this is what it takes to turn everything around, then so be it. I'll give everything I have. It's not about me anymore, and that's okay, just… please, I can't let go. I've fought before and I'll fight again, so if this is my life then I'll never stop trying. I'll take down every monster in the kingdom if I have to, I don't care how much it hurts. But… please. Please let this work. I think this is the only chance I have… and it aches. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Please, just… make it worth it.'

'Let me have times like this again. All my life. I want to be paid in love and serenity… just enough relief to keep me going. I can fend for myself and I don't need to live easy. But… let me keep my people. Let me close my eyes and never wake up alone in the world. Bring me someone to hold me when I'm scared. Or even when I'm not scared… just someone to hold me. I want to come home to friends and loved ones, every time. I want to be happy when the danger’s all gone. And... I guess I want to be a kid again… sometimes, can we do that? Playing games, and telling little stories, and sleeping by the fire… with everyone. That's what I live for. If I can only have the peace that I earn, it'll be worth it. I don't wanna leave here, but if I have to go, keep them safe for me. I'll get stronger. And when I do just let it be enough.'

'When I need to rest, let me sleep easy. If I run out of strength, then have someone ready to take my place. When I give everything I have, and if I can't take another second, give me shelter for the night. And when I'm finally home, let me have love around me, so I'll never be afraid. But no matter what, just promise me... please. For everything I've done, and everything I'll ever do in this crazy, insane life... just give me peace. Let me be calm again. That's all I want.'

'When I lay down at night, I *need* to know that when I wake up, I'll open my eyes…'

4vt5y4,2,2016-08-02,Converting a PHP table to a CSV file,RebootTheServer,PowerShell,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/4vt5y4/converting_a_php_table_to_a_csv_file/,"So the Call Center has a backend setup that will generate reports of all their calls, how many they pick up, ignore, etc and it generates it to a nice little PHP page with charts and a cute little table. 

What we need to do is on a weekly basis is have that table emailed to other people outside of my organization. My first idea was ""Don't we have 3 interns?"", then I picked up Learn Powershell in a Month of Lunches and decided there would be a better way. (I have since picked up the tool making one as well)

So I got it halfway working but can't figure out the rest. As it stands now I kinda got it halfway working. I was able to get the HTML of the Table but its still in HTML. Even if I save it as a CSV Excel opens it as one big column of markup.

A workaround I thought of would just be to use powershell to replace all the &lt;TD&gt; and &lt;TR&gt; with commas and shit so excel would be able to open it correctly but there has to be a better way

4vt9s6,2,2016-08-02,I [19 M] am a college student and have been falling for a girl [17 F] from my hometown this summer and will be leaving for school again in the fall.,bendmahon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vt9s6/i_19_m_am_a_college_student_and_have_been_falling/,"I'll start with some background information about where I'm at right now.
Last fall (my freshman year), I started college with a girlfriend of two years from high school. She went to a different college in the same city as me, which I was excited about.

By October, she had dumped me. It was especially rough for me for the rest of my freshman year. My grades suffered, I was depressed, I didn't take great care of myself. But in the end, I went back home for the summer having passed my classes, made a few great friends, and landed an internship in my field of study. My summer has been mostly consumed by work since then, with a week's vacation, and I'm happy with that.

Then comes the night when I meet this new girl for the first time about a month ago.

We were both participating in the long-standing rural American tradition called a 'bonfire where you mostly just smoke weed and talk about how much you'd rather live somewhere else'. It was mostly people I graduated with and a few others. I met her that night and didn't think anything more than ""Nice, I probably have a new friend."" We started messaging each other on Twitter and Snapchat fairly regularly after that night.

A month later is this past weekend. She invited me to another one of these gatherings with the same friends at someone else's house. No bonfire this time, but add drinking and a DJ friend to getting high, and you have one of those parties you will remember for years.

Around midnight (we started pretty early), most people start picking their places on the various furniture to pass out ( don't drink and drive, kids ), but I am out on the patio sitting on the brick steps with her. We talked about our lives, got to know each other better, and most importantly shared our Spotify playlists with each other. This is when I realized I liked her as more than a friend. Even the  cliché where she got cold and I gave her my flannel button-up happened.

We stayed outside together until about 2AM when we started feeling sober and came to the conclusion that we were tired. We slept in the same bed that night. There wasn't anything sexual about it, it was the only furniture not occupied by a sleeping person. We both fell on opposite sides of the bed face down and let the exhaustion take over for the next 6 hours.

In the morning, we found ourselves staring at the ceiling and just talking again, but feeling comfortable enough to be touching. It eventually evolved into holding hands. When she said she had to leave, we kissed. There wasn't anything nerve-wracking or stressful about it. It felt like the most natural thing in the world. Like breathing.

This girl is clever, intelligent, has a great taste in music, is absolutely beautiful to me. We have continued talking since that night. I want to try to pursue a relationship with her, but I am just so hung up on the fact that she will still be in my hometown next year, while I'm away at college. Granted, it is only an hour away. She's been part of turning my depression from last year into the happiest summer of my life.

Is it worth the risk of being disappointed again? What do I do?

TL;DR I'm really falling for a girl who will still be in high school next year, but I'll be an hour away at college. Is it worth pursuing this relationship?"
4vtaej,3,2016-08-02,I'm a computer science major that went to 3 schools. Do I include all of them?,ColdCaulkCraig,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/4vtaej/im_a_computer_science_major_that_went_to_3/,"I started at a somewhat basic school, they had an honors college and I got in, but not that impressive to me, only needed a 26 on ACT and a decent gpa. But the plan was to transfer to a very high ranking engineering school after 2 years and thats what I did. But then after another 2 years I started an internship and had a bit of an identity crisis. Wasnt sure if I was serious about being a programmer. Didnt like my life, and got all depressed, and blah blah blah. Anyway I transferred out to another still pretty good state school but more diverse and liberal artsy. I finished my CS degree but thought I might just do programming on the side until I figure something else out. But now I'm actually serious about programming :P

The point is, if I include the awesome engineering school on my resume, it raises questions. To me anyway, I feel like employers are gonna think I couldnt handle the high work load because i transferred out. It's embarrassing.

It also looks weird to have 3 schools listed.

I originally had all 3 schools and landed a good job out of college as an android programmer but after 1 year, my company is laying off everyone in my building. Time for a second job.

I want to just put the school i graduated from and leave it at that. Is this okay?"
4vtco1,1,2016-08-02,My [30M] friendship with my best friend [23M] is apparently destroyed due to his boyfriend [23M],silentalpaca,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vtco1/my_30m_friendship_with_my_best_friend_23m_is/,"First of all, be aware of grammatical errors as english is not my language but I'll try my best.

April 2013
Everything started a day at the company I used to work on in 2013. They asked me to hire an intern, so I published an ad in the closest university's internship department offering a job for students that were close to finish their studies. I interviewed several people, but one of them was above the others so I hired him. We got on very well, very fast. After a few months, we were good friends. At that time I was 27, and he and his boyfrend were 20. As I was in charge of him, I tried to teach him everything I knew about my job (IT). I was good on it, so after a few months he was very professional with his job.

September 2013
I decided to leave the company, so I wrote a very good review about him and sent it to the university. After I left, he got for a short time all my tasks. But he couldn't handle so after a few months he left the company as well.

October 2013
One day, he invited me to hang out with his friends and his boyfriend. We had a lot of fun, so we took some pictures together and uploaded them to FB. The next day, one of my ex [25M at that time] asked me about my friend. We had a good relation, so we were able to talk about everything. My ex was interested in my friend in a more than obvious sexual way. I told him he had a boyfriend and I refused to introduce them.
A week later, my ex told he met a very cute guy in his master's degree class. He talked about him a lot, even about all the times they made out. I was very happy for him, but as he was very secretive about it I never asked him to show me a pic of this guy. 

March 2014
I had a fight with my ex and we stopped talking. A week after that, I discovered that his ""friend"" was my friend's boyfriend. I told my friend, and some weeks later they broke up.

April 2014
As a result of the good review I sent about my friend, they gave him the opportunity to go to Amsterdam for 4 months to work in a startup. He accepted. I was very proud and very happy I could help him to achieve that.

June 2014
My friend sent me a pic of a guy he met on Grindr that was like 95% me, he was even confused as he thought I went to Amsterdam for a surprise visit. He told me that he liked him a lot, and that he reminded him of me while they were doing it. My boyfriend at that time was not amused.

July 2014
My friend came back, and my boyfriend told me that I couldn't hang out with my friend. I confronted my boyfriend and told him to never do that again. So I had to handle his trust issues. My friend told me he missed me a lot and was very happy to see me. A week after that, he went back with ex-boyfriend. I started working on a new company whose owner is one of the investors of the startup in Amsterdam. My boss and my friend hanged out one night with their friends, but my friend's friends never showed up. All of them were upset with him. A few weeks after, he was OK with his friends again, but he never understood why they were upset.

December 2014
I leave my boyfriend. My friend and his boyfriend were surprised, especially his boyfriend that was very close to my boyfriend.

February 2015
I found out my ex-boyfriend cheated on me. My friend and his boyfriend decided to keep him as a friend.

May 2015
After several fights, my friends breaks up again with his boyfriend. A week later, we were hanging out one night. We were very drunk walking on the street with some friends, when suddenly my friend grabbed my junk and started laughing. I questioned him about it but he told me he was only joking. I didn't care and it didn't worry me as I wasn't seeing any sexual tension going on.

Summer 2015
My friend started hanging out with an english guy. Also, he started working in a new company. He moved to his own place and after that I only saw him twice in the whole summer.

September 2015
He called me and asked me to go dinner. He confessed he went back to his boyfriend again and thought I was going to very upset about it. He was feeling guilty of all the times he ended up crashing up crying at my place. I told him I didn't like his boyfriend and that I don't approve that relationship, as he's very toxic and cheated on him.

November 2015
For months, I haven't heard a word from him. I called him and told him I would pick him up and go for dinner. He confessed me he stayed away from me because his boyfriend started hating me. His reasons are that I'm trying to destroyed their relationship because I like my friend. I got very upset about it, and confronted my friend on why he didn't do anything. He says he tried, but his boyfriend doesn't care at all and just tells him he's blind.

December 2015
My friends birthday, and I didn't attend.

January 2016
My friend, my boss and me spent the whole month working abroud in Thailand. My friend and I shared a bed several times, and almost all of them we ended up cuddling with obvious hardons. But nothing happened. My boss told me that it was obvious something was going on, but we both denied. I organised the whole trip, and looked after them as I acted as the father of the group.

February 2016
My friend disappeared again for 3 weeks. I told him to have dinner and he agreed. When he showed up, he told me that his boyfriend wanted to have dinner with him, so after 5 minutes he left and didn't apologise. He didn't even think about it. I got upset.
One night, hanging out with some friends, I discovered that they had proof that my friend's boyfriend was cheating on him again. But this time I didn't tell him, as I was upset and didn't consider him as my friend anymore.

April 2016
For some months I've been talking to my boss about the option of hiring him to our company. My boss asked me if I was sure about that as I was very upset with him, and told him it was OK. We hired him, but my friend noticed something was wrong. He asked my boss and he told him that I was upset, so my friend called me. One day, after work, we went for drinks and talked about it. I told him that our relationship was not going to work. I didn't resent him, it was just I wasn't interested in that. He admitted he'd been selfish and that I gave a lot to him. He even admitted that I changed his life for good and he admired me. He was sure he didn't want to lose me, as I was one of most important people in his life.

May 2016
After some weeks, I decided to forgive him and we began to very close again. But all the cuddling we had in Thailand came back. He used to hang at my place playing videogames or watching movies while we were constantly cuddling, hugging, tickling and even nipple touching/licking. We even slept together semi-naked, and cuddled all night long. He sent me a 3 minute song he composed for me in my birthday, and everytime I went to his place, he played my favourite songs on piano and guitar.

June 2016
It was pretty obvious something was going on, he was always complaining about his boyfriend. I got mixed signals, and got very confused. When I realised, I was in love. The first day it hurt, I confronted him and openly talked about it. He told me he didn't feel anything for me and that he was completely in love with his boyfriend and was not planning on leaving him. I went nuts and told the get the fuck out of my life. But we work together, so it's been a nightmare. A week later I couldn't take it anymore, and talked to him again so we could be OK. All the hate I was feeling wasn't good for me. He burst in tears when I told I was willing to work on this, and that we couldn't allow to ruin our friendship. We even had a trip planned for this summer. After some hours, he left my place. Two hours later he called me sobbing that his boyfriend went crazy when he told him we were OK again.

A few days later, I asked my friend why all of this happened. He told me that he had to tell the truth to his boyfriend. But at the same time he confessed that he wasn't weirded out by me having feelings for him. One thing led to another, and then I told him the truth about his boyfriend. I told him that there was proof of his boyfriend cheating on him. He started trembling and almost fainted. He started crying telling me that he needed me, that he's addicted to him and he's not able to escape from his feelings. I hugged him, he relaxed and then he asked for proof. I asked one of my friends to send me screenshots of that chat, but he didn't respond until some days later when he sent them to me.

The next week my friend asked for the screenshots, but told me that he didn't want to see them unless his boyfriend was with him. He later explained that he was sure his boyfriend didn't cheat on him and everything was a lie. I refused to show him the screenshots on those terms, as I was not willing to see his boyfriend after how he had been to me for the last months.

I confronted him about him not defending me, and being selfish. He told me that all of this is not his responsibility, and it was a problem between me and his boyfriend, so we had to solve it for him. He told me that he's not guilty of anything and he doesn't deserve nobody telling him he fucked up very hard. After that, he stopped talking to me for weeks.


July 2016
Last time we talked I had to call him and ask him to talk, and he told me that I was right. He acted very selfish. But not with me, but his boyfriend. He told me he was feeling guilty of hanging out with me knowing it would hurt him and hanging out anyway. Tried to convince me that slowing down our relationship is the healthy thing to do, but then he asked me to stop hanging out together. I clearly said that I didn't agree with that, and that the way he was acting was going to clearly kill our friendship. He told me he needed his boyfriend, and that he wanted to be with him. He also told me that he didn't want to lose me, but his boyfriend wouldn't allow our friendship to exist anymore.

I called one of my best friends and told him everything, and he told me that he knew and he saw my friend's boyfriend making out with some of his friends for months. He tought they had broke up again, so he was extremely surprised with my story.


August 2016
We work together, but I'm extremely resentful on him. He even avoids me, and of course doesn't say a word. I'm feeling that I wasted a lot of time and effort on him, and that I don't deserve to be treated this way. I don't have romantic feelings anymore, but I'm increasingly angry about everything. I need to heal, I won't be able to do that with him at work. I feel I'm trapped in a nightmare and I'm lost. A lot of coworkers know what actually happened, and they say they support me. But I feel that I'm losing my mind over this. I'm even thinking about leaving my job, but I know it's the worst decision I could take. I want him to leave, and get the fuck out of my life forever, but I deeply know that it's not true.

Sorry for the drama, but I had to spill this somewhere. Now, I don't what to do or what to expect. I don't know if there's a solution at this point, or if I should be expecting a solution to this. It's been a month ago, but I'm still in shock.

---   
**tl;dr**: Best friend of 3 years broke up several times with boyfriend. Boyfriend started hating me. Best friend started acting strange. Confronted him. Got too close for one month. Fallen in love with him. He rejected me. Told him his BF was cheating on him. Best friend kicked me out of his life because boyfriend asked him to do so. Left me broken in pieces."

So I work as an intern for $Localgovernment  
I come in monday morning and my boss who will be referred to as $Boss is a woman in her early 50s who has been in the IT field for ~20 years, has a desktop sitting on my desk 
I will be $me  
Apologies in advance for poor formatting, this is my first post on this sub and I'm at work typing this before $boss gets back from work
&gt;$boss: $nurse's computer won't start up, I was back there trying to get it started for probably 30 minutes this morning, I think the power supply went out
&gt;$me: ok let me clock in and I'll see if I can get it started or not, it I can't I'll switch out the PSU and let you know

So I take the desktop into the Network room, take the side off and see...absolutely nothing wrong

&gt;$me: Huh, well maybe it's something I can't see, lets see if she turns on

And (like magic) it turns on, boots into windows, and lets me log in with no problem, I turn it back off, and on, multiple times. It always works without a hitch, fans start up no excess noise, no nothing. So just to be sure I installed speccy on the PC and checked rail voltages, almost perfect, 5.05V on the 5V Rail was the one that was most off. So I turn it off, shut the side, take it back to $nurse plug everything back in where it was....and it doesn't start....

So without even thinking about it, I switched the power cord from one outlet on the surge protector, to another. And it worked, like magic

So I come back up to $boss and tell her

&gt;$me: Worked without a hitch, but we should probably get the surge protector replaced, because the outlet you were using went out, the rest are fine though
&gt;$boss: Really? I spent 30 minutes trying to get that thing working!
&gt;$me: Yup, remember to try a different outlet next time
&gt;$boss: *headdesk*

So I've been coming here for awhile for advice on some anxieties I feel as I get ready to start my career (recent grad).

I've expressed doubts about my ability, which people tell me is probably Imposter Syndrome. I've expressed my worries that I'm not gonna last at my first job, which most people say ""well all you can do is try your best, the rest is out of your control"" which I agree with.

But then other times I come here and read threads where seniors express how much they hate working with juniors, how if you're not a great programmer with huge projects, internships etc., you will not get a good job and won't do well at your job, even if you do.

I realize this is a large sub with lots of different opinions but it's hard to reconcile a lot of what I read. I really am worried about what to expect at my first job. It sounds like I might be hired this week, but I'm really apprehensive about starting because a lot of what I read makes me feel like I'm not prepared at all. I never had significant personal projects, I never did an internship (I worked for two years basically as a helpdesk guy during school). I hope I'm not walking into a minefield at my first gig...

I guess I'm just hoping to find that there are people like me in this field who are NOT superstars and probably never will be, who just want to make a living (not make six figures) at this, not make it their life."

Have I missed an announcement that Mozilla wants to make an effort to appeal to that wide segment of teenagers who think reading changelogs is cool? Is it some risky summer intern experiment? In any case, I think it's a change for the worse. Not only are changes now buried beneath a pile of noise, some of them are actually worded in a way that is misleading (is Browser Console really a ""new hotness""?). And the contrast between the technical style of a half of the page and the rest is jarring.

Some examples:

&gt; * Roar for moar protection against harmful downloads! We've got your back

&gt; * GNU/Linux fans: Get better Canvas performance with speedy Skia support. Try saying that three times fast

&gt; * Heyo, Jabra &amp; Logitech C920 webcam users. We fixed those pesky WebRTC bugs causing frequency distortions. Buh-bye, squeaky voice! 

&gt; * Want to move absolute &amp; fixed positioned elements? (Who doesn't, right?) Now you can with our geometry editor.

&gt; * The memory tool now has a tree map view for your debugging pleasure. It's a little bit of ""boo"" and a whole lot of ""ya.""

&gt; * Old and busted: Error Console. New hotness: Browser Console for your debugging pleasure.

&gt; * This theme is hot, hot, hot! Say hi to the Firebug theme for Developer Tools."

I was in the middle of finishing my master's thesis, so I told them I wasn't really in a state of mind to think about joining their company.

I reached out to them after my defense and they are now offering me an ""internship"" with the possibility of full time employment.

I was going to counter that I am not interested in an internship (I have 6 years work experience in the field before I did my MS) and that they should just hire me. My thinking is that since CO is an at-will employment state, they can fire me at any point anyway if I'm not a good fit. But before I do that, I want to know if being an intern gives them flexibility that they would lose if they hired me as an employee (part time or full time).

The ""internship"" wouldn't be unpaid, although they have been vague with compensation.

To these people, software development is like money for nothing. It's an alluring prospect. Does anybody here want to try that route?

Currently I live in Waukesha, but I'm willing to commute any distance really. I've touched/worked with multiple languages, however I do feel pretty raw and would love to learn more/contribute. Any opportunity would be great as I don't have a preferred language and if I'm not familiar I can familiarize myself with it on my own.

Hey let me first introduce myself. I will not make the story very long but just to understand the phases i went trough. I am 27 years old currently and from the Netherlands.

I got diagnosed with autisme when I was like 3 years old they first thought I was crazy but my parents pulled on and found the right doctor and 2 years after I got diagnosed with pdd-nos. I got ritalin as a medicine it made me super focus but of course there where side effects as well. I stopped using it when I was around 10 and it went fine without it.

It was not a easy road but I pulled on I managed to finish normal school and middle school ict level 3 I would call it that for now.

Social contacts where never been easy I never had a girl friend yet while today thats not where me advice questions is about. :) More work and financial related.

The interships at company's where hard for me to anjust on but with some adjustments I made it trough and could work fine in the IT. The 2nd internship didn't went fine I got pestering by someone that was 1 year older then me properly because I got autisme.

So after all those experiences I wanted to forfill a dream and thats start a own company I did that in computer service and build websites (wordpress) not coding.

2 years beyond that I don't really earn a lot from this. Social I am not very strong to seek new customers all the time and computer service more bigger companys are taking customers away from me.

At this point I am clueless and just want a stable financial future.

So I thought lets study further but i am entering unknown territory. higher school its expensive. If I can find a company that want to pay it for me I am not sure if I can handle study - work - own company at the same time. 

My parents are getting older and I am still living with them. I want to grow financial so I can buy or rent a own house and possible live there with a wife one day. 

I now pretty much still told a long story further I am still standing positive in life and I am proud that I come this far even with limitations and exceeded prognosis experts gave me how far I could come in study. Just want some advice thats all. I just notice I am at a very important phase in my life that needs to by decided right. Thanks.

4vtzby,2,2016-08-02,What should I focus my time on: side projects or studying CTCI?,fuckincraig,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vtzby/what_should_i_focus_my_time_on_side_projects_or/,"Fall semester coming up, will be trying to land an internship the upcoming summer and I'm taking data structures this Fall so I feel like I should know that material beforehand for interviews. However, do you think it would be better to spend my time on 2-3 projects or just completely understanding the Cracking The Coding Interview material. With my time constraints now, I'd prefer to focus on just one. 

Side note: I have no previous internship/relevant work experience on my resume and this upcoming summer will be my last chance to get an internship because I graduate next Fall 2017. But it feels like I would need those projects on my resume to even land me an interview but then I never spent the time studying the interview material. So I feel like I'm in a predicament. Would be interested in hearing everyones thoughts. Thanks."
4vtzsy,1,2016-08-02,Should I quit my internship?,tankinturtle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4vtzsy/should_i_quit_my_internship/,"I'm an IT Intern for a local school district. I'm currently a senior in college, majoring in Information Technology with a career goal in network administration or something of the like in a medium sized business or school. 

A year ago I got an internship with a local school district. At first, it was to help with a summer project (which consisted of me putting laptop charger cords together, labeling laptops and laptop carts, and writing down serial numbers). They decided to keep me indefinitely and here I am today.

During the year, i work about 8-10 hours a week with college and 1 other job (basically geek squad for my college's on-campus students). My normal work day consists of sitting in a small office waiting for teachers to request help with their laptops/technology. I love helping people in terms of IT, its a part of the job that I enjoy, but I 'm never able to help with any serious issues. Most of the time, I'm fixing very simple hardware/Windows issues that I've fixed a million times over, and its the kind of stuff the other IT employees can fix in 5 minutes, if they had the time. I feel like my impact in my workspace is minimal and is a waste of time for me. 

This summer, the school's principals have decided that we're trashing hundreds of heavy, old computer/technology equipment, and I'm being put in charge of taking inventory of ALL of it. Its a mindnumbingly boring and frustrating process (I get to enjoy literally wading through piles and piles of irrevelant and outdated technology crap) and write down serial numbers. Just so that their inventory list is ""100%"" accurate. The buildings are poorly cooled so I'm also having to constantly run in and out of the building to keep myself from having a heat stroke. Every time I finish inventory and it seems like I can finally relax and do something other than inventory, they assign me with more inventory work. I understand that they're trying to find things for me to do around here, but I absolutely HATE doing this stuff. 

This summer work has made me think about quitting. I'm rather fed up of being basically our department's personal janitor. The main reason I've kept this internship so long is that they pay somewhat decent for a college student job and they have the possibility of hiring me full time when I graduate this year. 

I'm not really sure what to do. My biggest worry is that I lose out on a chance to have a job right out of college and that I have trouble finding a better internship after leaving this one. What should I do?"
4vu1ab,8,2016-08-02,Letting it go.,offmychest985,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4vu1ab/letting_it_go/,"I really don't know how to tell my story.
My real life name isn't important but i'm 21 years old living in sweden and here is my story.

I was born in a town a few miles outside main capital of Iraq but before i was born(not 100% sure since i really don't want to ask her,she told me once and that's enough) my mother tried to kill herself by setting fire on herself from our abusive father,lucky she didn't die but she still has burn marks 80% of her body.
I don't remember anything from it nor the any memory of been in Iraq because at age 2, we moved to germany to a little town called Metternich.
My childhood wasn't bad atleast from what i remember which isn't alot but there is 1 memory that keeps repeating now and then about when i was 5-7 years old when i bullied someone ( me and my ""friends"" ) and his name was Pascal, the memory's of him crying really makes me sad and cry and i'm truly sorry and i know that it doesn't make up for the things that i've done but i'm really sorry and i hope you are doing well in life.

My dad used to beat my mom giving her black eyes and our self as well but my mom got the worst out of it, i didn't like dad nor mom because she used to beat me as well and there is 1 memory of her beating me with a metal stick ,don't remember why but i ran outside and she promised me that she hurt me but as soon i came inside, my older brother hold me and she was beating me but managed to escape and crawl under my bed and this isn't the first time my brother did something like that, there was 1 time when me him and Timo ( our friend ).
Timo's grandpa used to own a horse stable where kids could ride horses and i really enjoyed it but back to the story.
Me and my brother we were about to ride horses that day but for some reason he didn't want me to be there and said that i should go home and i refused so he smacked my head into a metal pipe and i still have the scare from it even now when we are older, he hasn't changed abit,same old dickhead.
When i was 8 years old, i tried to take suicide by cutting myself(still have the scares left),i don't know why or the reason behind it because i only have like 2-3 seconds memory of that event but lucky me, i didn't die which is because i was cutting my arm instead of my wrist but how was i suppose to know where to cut myself at the age of 8?


At the age of 11 we moved to Sweden not because we didn't enjoy it but because my mom wasn't allowed to travel back to iraq to visit her father and once the government knew about it,they removed our citizenship and told us to wait again another 10 years which dad didn't like so instead of waiting, he moved to sweden ( i didn't knew until 6 months of living in Sweden because he said it was a vacation but i realized it wasn't..6 months later.)


I don't speak but i do understand some german words and the reason on why i don't speak is because we always got beat up for speaking german by our dad.
I really wasn't popular in sweden like i was in germany, people looked at me differently and maybe because i barely spoke any swedish but i quickly learned since i was a fast learner so after 1 year, i spoke decently.
High-school was hard, not the learning part but talking to people since i really was uncomfortable and i really had hard times defending myself when someone accused me of something.
After high school i went to college for cooking since i had my first internship at a restaurant and i feel in love with cooking because it was enjoyable and i could see myself doing it until i die without getting tired of it.


College was pretty much the same as high school,first year atleast but after that, i was better at swedish and all ""coo""l kids was smoking and so was i and i made connection with people thou smoking since they come up and ask if i had 1 to spare and i always said yes,i have hard times saying no to people.
I didn't show up to graduation party because i really have hard times letting things go and i just avoid it by not showing up.


After college even thou the school said that 100% of the people graduating had a job before graduating but it wasn't in my case.
After sending tons of emails to different restaurants, i found one but it wasn't long lasting because i got fired from it after 2 months.

I work 11-12 hours a day, 6 days a week and barely any sleep but it didn't matter because i was happy every day going to work.


I wake up at 04:00 (4 am) and i quickly went to torrenting a few tv shows like breaking bad,game of thrones,suits,marvel depending on what day it was but there was atleast 1 tv show per day i could download so i downloaded it and while it was downloading i could gear up ( brush teeth,make coffee,take a shower and so on..) by 04:30 ( 4:30 am ) tv show was ready and so was the coffee and most tv shows lasted 40-55 mins since i skip the start(trailer).

5:30-6:00 i had to have my gym bag ready and my protein powders(couldn't eat real food and i barely ate at home since i worked long hours and i went straight to bed as soon i came home )

The bus was leaving at 6:12 and i was at the gym by 6:16, did some workouts for 30 mins and by 6:45 i had to take a shower and change since the next buss was coming at 6:57.

By 7:06 i was at the train station and by 7:32 i was at work which i'm suppose to be there at 8 but always came 20-30 mins sooner so i can make coffee for the team and check our inventory.
After making coffee and checking what we need for tomorrow and what needs to be done today, i checked myself in around 7:50-8:00 since i didn't wanted the restaurant to pay and mainly because the other chefs keep saying ""He is doing it for the money"" which i wasn't because i care more about happiness and knowledge then money.


2 months later, i was at the grill station cooking some lobsters when another chefs started yelling at me that i should ask the chef(boss) how many orders i have and i knew how many ( 2 lobsters in 4 mins, 2 in 6 and 4 in 8 mins.) and i told him that but he continued yelling for a good 5 mins that i should ask the chef even thought he was stationed at the fries.
I asked nicely 15 ( I don't know, i lost count) times that he should calm down and stop yelling because we were an open kitchen and customers are paying $30 for a lobster that is 100-150 grams (0.22-33 pounds ) which is quiet expensive and i'm sure that the customers don't want to listen to a chef yelling so i continued asking nicely but he refused until i asked the chef and so i did but the chef didn't respond since i could clearly see that he was busy but he continued yelling at me saying that he didn't hear me and i really wanted him to be quiet for the sake of the customers so i asid ""Chef"" and the chef turns around and starts yelling at me ""Can't you see i'm busy!?"" and after that i calmly returned to my station but i was mad about the whole situation so i quietly( could barely hear myself ) said ""fuck off"" and the chef heared it and i got fired because of that+ he made me leave in the middle of service for something that clearly wasn't my fault.


There has been previous internship with almost same situation even 1 time i got hit by another chef when i wasn't doing anything because we were closed(done for the day) and he went out for a smoke while i was upstairs cleaning and brushing the whole kitchen, not once or twice but 3 times and still he wasn't back so i waited and out of boredom i started dancing with the Brush and he comes back and puts his hands on my neck and pushes me down and yells ""stop playing""



Anyway, i think this is enough."

My first day as an assistent to a prestigious senator. This really was a dream come true. Walking into the office building I couldn't help but appreciate all the hard work it took to get this intern position. The essays, the presentations, the interviews. I must have beat out at least a hundred other applicants but here I was. My face beamed with pride as I knocked on your door. I could feel my heart thumping in my body as you called me in. I opened the door and saw you hard at work at your desk. ""Hello, Lisa Lomis. Nice to finally meet you in person."" I said. I walked over and shook your hand before you gestured for me to sit down. You looked me over before saying, ""Yes Ms. Lomis, you are here for the personal assistant position correct?"" I nod my head emohatically. ""Yes, I'm here to be your personal assistant. I think it's great the kind of work you're doing and I can't wait to be a part of it."" You can hear that I'm talking but you're not really listening. I keep going. ""Also if you don't mind I'd like to suggest some things like.... and...."" 

My voice drones on into white noise as you pretend to listen and care. You nod your head occasionally and ""mhm"" at the right times but you're much more preoccupied with something else. Your eyes scan over my chest with lust. Even in a suitjacket I can't conceal how big my breasts are. They protrude out heavily which contrasts greatly with how slim my waist is. You look up and stare at my full lips. They looked like they were made for sucking cock and the red lipstick really complimented my long, silky crimson hair that draped my face. You also remembered how slender my legs looked in my tiny pencil skirt when I first walked in and felt more blood rus they your groin. The aching in your pants was too much to bear anymore. 

Cutting me off mid-sentence you said, ""Alright, well here is what you'll be doing here in the nation's capital."" I shut my mouth and listen. You could see me lean in to hear a bit better. ""You're going to be my personal assistant which means if I need you to do anything you're going to do it."" I nod and say, ""yes of course! I'll do anything! If you need something, anything, don't hesitate to tell me!."" You smile and say, ""alright then, first things first. I'm going to need those luscious lips of yours to suck my cock."" You can see an inquisitive look on my face. ""I'm sorry...what?"" I must have heard wrong. What did he say? You lean in closer and say, ""I need you to suck my cock."" You can see the look on my face turn from joy to disgust. ""What?! No!?"" I say. ""No I will not suck your cock! Do I look like a whore?"" You just smile as I yell at you. ""You're ridiculous, thinking I'd suck your cock."" I say as I start to collet my things. You let stand up and almost step out of the door when you say, ""If you'll be my personal assistant for the summer, I'll give you a glowing recommendation."" I stop. A recommendation from a senator so prestigious would go a long way. It could cut maybe 10 years off my career. I could actually get things done, make change for the better. I turn around and see the sleezy look you're giving me. You were an appalling asshole, but maybe this would be worth it. If I could get the changes I wanted through then people like this wold be out of office in the next generation. I wait a bit before walking back and sitting down in the chair. It took every once of effort I had to completely let go of my self respect. ""Alright... you have a deal."" I say.

I wasn't the first girl you've done this to and I wasn't going to be the last. The benefits of being a senator. Getting hot young girls to intern for you, to be your personal assistant. For years you've done this taking advantage of their hope and optimism to get your own personal slut. And I was the cream of the crop. I was the hottest. I had the biggest tits. And now I was yours for the summer."
4vu8fa,8,2016-08-02,"Me [24/F] with my BF [22/M] of 1 year, unsure if I am being too ""money driven"" about his lack of ambition",ambi89a,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vu8fa/me_24f_with_my_bf_22m_of_1_year_unsure_if_i_am/,"Hi everyone. I've been dating my BF for about 1 year now (known eachother for 2). I am 2 years older than he is. 

Throughout college, I worked really hard, got good grades, had internships, volunteered, etc. This spring, I was accepted into a very competitive Masters program and I begin in September. My BF, on the other hand, dropped out of an Associates program after half a year (""I forgot to do my financial aid so I guess I just stopped going"") and does not have a degree. This wouldn't be an issue for me as I know that there are tons of intelligent, driven people out there who make their own success, degree or no degree. However, my BF spent those 4 years (after dropping out of college) not doing anything to help craft a career. He spent that time playing videogames, getting high, and occasionally working the odd retail job. A few months ago, he was kicked out of his mom's home and began renting a room with a couple of other people. I've lent him maybe 1000$ for rent and gas, while he gets back on his feet. 

Because of this, I've tried to stress to him the importance of planning for his future and having a career. Eventually, he decided to begin a 4 year program for computer science. This decision came about around June, and I'm starting to get frustrated because school starts in about 2 weeks and hes JUST gotten the ball rolling on admissions and enrollment. He is very kind and sweet, although he is not the most logic/academic oriented person at all. I don't know how else to say this without sounding horribly mean, but he has a lot of issues with being able to think critically. He gets confused and often misunderstands what people are trying to express. He currently works a temp manual labor job.

The issue is I don't know if we are compatible. I am turning 25 soon and I have my whole career planned out. I don't want to sound like a gold digger or something. My parents came from Asia but we were dirt poor growing up. They've always stressed to me the importance of being able to take care of myself, by myself. I think I am ambitious and very success driven. I won't lie; I want money and financial independence as well. I want to be able to afford the things in life I never could, but I would never depend on a guy just for his wallet. This has been my first long term relationship so I don't know if I'm crazy for feeling this way. Lately I've been really irritated and short with him because of this frustration. I'm scared I'll lose my respect for him, but at the same time.. is it horribly shallow and stupid to be scared of turning 30 and being well into my career while my long term BF has just barely finished college (hopefully)? Honestly.. I don't know if it's worth ""investing"" more time into this relationship when I am uncertain if he will ever truly care about his future. He tells me he wants financial security and sucess as well, but do I believe him? I often have to tell him to save his money and stop eating out, stop buying expensive groceries, etc when he only has $14 in the bank. My biggest fear is being 30 or so and realizing that I wasted the last 6 years of my life with someone who has not progressed in theirs at all. But is it truly wrong of me to not want to have to wait 5 or so years for him to finish his degree, before he even gets a job? Any help is appreciated. If I am being way out of line here, please let me know. I'm not afraid of the truth, I'm just tired of stressing over this. Thank you in advance. 


---   
**tl;dr**: I am success/money driven while BF is not. I don't know if my standards are too high, if I'm being greedy or unreasonable. I am turning 25 and BF is MAYBE starting school for a degree in computer science. Don't know if I should invest more time in this relationship."
4vuobh,1,2016-08-02,I´m [23/m]. Today my girlfriend [22/f] told me she no longer loved me after three years of one heck of a relationship.,LiveandLetLivexx,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4vuobh/im_23m_today_my_girlfriend_22f_told_me_she_no/,"Some background - We met during University on the very first semester of first year, and for two whole years we had a perfect adventure together. We saw the world together, studied together and the best was that we ended up  snuggled in bed watching a movie on a cold rainy night everyday. 

We ve also went through rough spots in our lives. My girlfriends father passed away in second year. I was always present to make sure she was doing okay, as anyone would. That consequently made us stronger, but after a few months our relationship deteriorated. I could feel part of her died that night (understandable), and along with it, part of our relationship. Her feelings toward me changed,we  no longer had sex (which is not really a problem for me, but I suppose can have its consequences in a relationship).

After that it seemed our relationship lost that spark, that energy and the drive. We still were together, and I was and still am as madly in love as I was in first year.

Come third year, being an  engineer student, my workload was borderline unmanageable. I was under severe stress and anxiety, and I started to be less present in her life. We always managed to talk everyday and meet up few times a week, but I take full responsibility in fuckin up there. A few arguments come and go, which started building up some pressure in our relationship. 

Come present time, semester ends and we each go to our respective internships half across Europe. I  desperately try to rekindle our relationship, by trying to meet up or skype quite often, but her response is not very open. She says I am selfish in the way after exams are over, I decide its time to spend time together (I understand where she is coming from, and again I know I fucked up, but you would think after two and half great years a rough patch would not be enough to break us).

Today, she told me she felt guilty of not loving me (which just kills me inside out), that she does not love the person I am as of now. e agree to give this a shot another time, but where the fuck do I go from here? What to I do? I feel like she seems me like a stranger now. 

I am going to see her next week for the weekend, I was wondering if you guys had any tips? Similar experiences?

&amp;nbsp;

*Five years later*

&amp;nbsp;

*“No matter what, you cannot deviate from this course of action.”*

&amp;nbsp;

Alice smoothed her dress greys, hair tightly coiled at the nape of her neck. A nostalgic wave of déjà vu hit her. There were no gleaming medals or rank this time, not even an insignia marking her a member of the U.S.S.F. but the familiar cut to the uniform and the tight pull of the her bun brought a flood of memories.

&amp;nbsp;

It was hard to believe she was back here, standing among dozens of others from nations all over the world. Convincing the U.S.S.F. that The Other Alice was real hadn’t taken as long as she would have thought, but they’d been thorough in their investigation.

&amp;nbsp;

It helped that The Other Alice had the time device, even if the power cell was burned out. It was a single use device that had taken Wonderland’s top scientists decades to make. During her deployment on Wonderland, Future Alice told her, Kat had briefed the U.S.S.F. on the technological advances their scientists were working on.

&amp;nbsp;

At the time, it’d appeared as though Wonderland was eager to share knowledge and trade in research and development of new technologies. Alice knew now that it’d all been a diversion, a smoke screen to cover the White Queen’s true intentions.

&amp;nbsp;

Those first reports were only a year off now.

&amp;nbsp;

“Standing before me are some of the brightest minds our world has to offer,” Commander Falstead said from the raised platform. “I personally consider it a great privilege to be here among you all. We’re on the edge of the greatest breakthrough since the invention of the hyperdrive nearly thirty years ago. Dr. Nagasaki and his team were interns on that project and I’m grateful to have their assistance and that of Japan’s Astrophysics Research and Development Department. I look around at the different countries represented here and I can’t help but feel a sense of pride. There aren’t words enough to thank you for what you’ve done, for what you *continue* to do. So I’ll just get off the stage and let you all get some grub.”

&amp;nbsp;

The room erupted in polite laughter as the Commander stepped down from the platform. The crowd broke and began mingling around tables laden with food and sparkling cider.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice watched the tide of people ebb and flow, catching tidbits of conversation. She felt removed from the proceedings, a silent sentinel with devastating knowledge. 

&amp;nbsp;

A tap on her shoulder made her spin. A young tech from the Medical team cleared her throat and begged Alice’s pardon but *the other one* needed to speak with her.

&amp;nbsp;

Without another glance at the glad-handing and triumphant jubilation of those behind her, she made her way to the medical wing. The lights in that part of the base were bright, flooding the corners with sterile white illumination. Despite the chill in the air the deeper she went, Alice found the absence of shadow comforting.

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of a long hallway she stopped, just before a door without a window. The outside label simply read ‘Quarantine’. An armed guard sat in a plastic chair just to the left of the doorway. He stood quickly to attention, familiar enough with Alice to stand aside without question. There were precious few who had permission to enter that room.

&amp;nbsp;

Commander Falstead had agreed with both Alice’s that the less who saw there were two of them, the less interaction she had with others in the U.S.S.F., the better their chances were. The White Queen couldn’t “listen” in on singular moments. It wasn’t like picking up a phone and dialing someone. She could only see in broad strokes. Endgame plans.

&amp;nbsp;

So the fewer who came in contact with the seemingly impossible anomaly of two Alice’s existing in the same timeline, the better.

&amp;nbsp;

Not to mention…

&amp;nbsp;

Alice entered the room, her heart quickening in her chest to a thud in contrast to the steady rhythmic beeping of the life support machines. Even for all the times she’d seen herself in that hospital bed it threw her. It was her and it wasn’t. They’d broken in their timelines, owned different memories, but the soul of herself still resided in that body, still as it lay now.

&amp;nbsp;

…future Alice was dying.

&amp;nbsp;

Radiation poisoning. The few doctors who'd been allowed to work on Ali had theories on how she'd been exposed to such a fatal dose but no answers because of the rate in which she was dying. Ali had been tight lipped on what tortures she'd endured on Wonderland and eventually they stopped asking, working only to make her comfortable in her final moments.

&amp;nbsp;

Willing her heart to slow, Alice reached into her pocket and pulled out a new red gem, twirling it between her fingers. A sister gem gleamed on Future Alice’s white scrubs. For a moment Alice watched the rise and fall of the other’s chest, knowing soon, it would cease all motion. The gems allowed them to communicate despite the fact her future self had slipped into a coma some months ago.

&amp;nbsp;

It’d come as quite the surprise, learning the device could be used in such a way. Already the technology was being outfitted for hospitals around the world, breaking ground in the treatment of coma patients.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice pinned the gem into her lapel and reached out with her mind.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;Ali.&gt;&gt; They’d agreed on the nickname to make conversing easier. Alice felt like she had a twin sister which made it all the worse, watching her fade away. They’d grown close in the last several years, each of them healing the remote and terrible pain that had taken up residence in both of them. Understanding each other in ways beyond empathy.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;Alice.&gt;&gt; The voice was weak, struggling for volume.

&amp;nbsp;

A lump formed in Alice’s chest. Too soon. It would happen too soon. &lt;&lt;They said you wanted to talk to me.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;She will be watching you.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Alice knew this and wondered why Ali had taken what was left of her limited strength to say as much. She clasped a frail hand into her own wrinkled one. What a pair they were, growing old while the world grew new around them. New technology, new exploration, new hopes and dreams. 

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;Are you resolute? You must be one with your destiny.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I am resolute, Ali. I will not be swayed from my course.&gt;&gt; The truth of it filled her with courage, chasing away any doubts. There was nothing left in her but commitment. 

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I will likely be gone before they finish the shield. Promise me. Not later than the date I told you. You must return to Wonderland that day, whatever may come, you *must*.&gt;&gt; Ali couldn't squeeze her hand but Alice felt the intensity of her emotion through the connection.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I'm not sure I'll convince them to let me go alone.&gt;&gt; Alice had been gnawing over that tiny detail in their plan. At the time they'd begun planning it'd seemed to distant she'd been able to tell herself, “when we get to that bridge.” Now the bridge was here and she wasn't sure she could convince who needed convincing.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I couldn't risk you using it before you were supposed to, even to save Kat.&gt;&gt; Ali's voice grew weaker in her mind.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;Ali? What do you mean?&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;The night I came I hide a portal device in your house. Behind the nightstand. Pull away the false panel and you'll find it. Do not use it before that date.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Alice promised she'd retrieve it. Before severing the connection she sensed a hesitation, as though there was more Ali wanted to say. 

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;&lt;I have one more story to tell you. If everything goes according to my plan it won't come to pass. But it did, for me, and I need to tell it. The story of how Kat died.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Alice listened to the recount, tears welling in her eyes at Kat's sacrifice. At the sacrifice of everyone aboard The Looking Glass. They'd never know how their lives had paid the toll for Earth's salvation.  The remorse was heavy in Ali's tone, so familiar as to be her own. She'd hopefully never have to live with similar memories.

&amp;nbsp;

When she'd finished her tale, Ali paused before adding, &lt;&lt;I'm sorry.&gt;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

It wasn't till Alice severed the connection and exited the room that she realized Ali had called it *her* plan.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

*Five Years Later*

&amp;nbsp;

The night before the test, Alice dreamed of Weiss. 

&amp;nbsp;

In the years she'd had Ali as a companion the nightmares had receded into the background – never truly gone but diminished in force. Her death had brought them back full force. 

&amp;nbsp;

Always a hand reaching for her. Always the darkness pressing in on her. Always and forever he was out of her grasp.

&amp;nbsp;

*Hold on.* 

&amp;nbsp;

“Alice...” a whisper in the dark, just at her ear.

&amp;nbsp;

Then a voice cut through the black, a silvery thread of sound that filled Alice with hope instead of dread. Ali's voice.

&amp;nbsp;

“Stay the course, Alice. It will call for sacrifice but the price of failure is all of humanity.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice woke, the words “I am resolute,” still on her tongue.

&amp;nbsp;

She dressed that morning in solemn silence. Today was the day. No matter what happened, today was the day she would return to Wonderland. Alice stood staring into the face over the sink. It was her, it was Ali, it was determined. She picked up the old cracked earring, pinning it just beneath the lapel of the dress greys.

&amp;nbsp;

The other half of their plan was also coming to fruition today. It would be the first test of a worldwide shielding system. For the last seven and a half years brilliant men and women had worked tirelessly to make Ali's idea possible. Inspired by the technology Wonderland used to cloak itself from detection, the system would use a series of specially power plants to generate a force field. Linking to its sister stations around the world, the plants would protect against attacks from space by enclosing the entire planet in the field.

&amp;nbsp;

Ali hadn't been lying either. Even with ten years to prepare they were cutting it close. Already the White Queen's vessels grew close. They'd be upon Earth in a few days. Everything hinged on the success of todays.

&amp;nbsp;

The weight of the portal device pressed against her thigh, down in a second pocket she'd sewn into her suit. She'd nearly laughed at the symmetry of the act. Almost fifteen years ago she'd made a similar pocket for holding the blade she'd used to take the Red Queen's head.

&amp;nbsp;

The atmosphere at the U.S.S.F. headquarters was one of tension and apprehension. Every single person understand the gravity of the situation. If this failed, they were doomed.

&amp;nbsp;

People hurried around her towards their designated stations and check points, each carrying a chart, talking on a phone or whispering with a colleague. A junior intern from the Commander Administrative Office approached her, dipping her head but refraining from any form of salute.

&amp;nbsp;

“Commander Falstead asked to see you before they begin the test.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice followed behind the neatly dressed woman, the sound of her low heel slip-ons squeaking on the newly polished marble. The administrative offices where just off the north side of the plant. From a large window in the second floor they could see out over the generator and teams of scientists checking off the last markers of their pretest diagnostics.

&amp;nbsp;

“Alice, please, come in,” Commander Falstead greeted her, waving at her to join him. He dismissed two stern looking soldiers who passed Alice without so much as a glance. The Commander folded closed the file they'd been looking at and slipped it under a stack to the right of his desk.

&amp;nbsp;

From a second stack he pulled a small sealed envelope. Across the tip was a single word in familiar handwriting – 'Alice'.

&amp;nbsp;

“Before your future self passed away she asked that I hold onto this and give it to you on the day of the test. She said not to read it until you 'returned'. She wouldn't explain further but said you'd know what she meant.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice took the letter, tracing a finger over the black lettering. “Thank you, Commander.”

&amp;nbsp;

They sat for a moment in perfect silence, the sounds of a hurried world outside their bubble of awareness. Then he leaned onto his elbows. “Alice, between you and me...”

&amp;nbsp;

She looked up to a soft, understanding expression in place of his usual good humored but firm countenance. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Had it been someone I cared for, I'd have done the same.”

&amp;nbsp;

He didn't say more, just gave her a nod motioned for the person waiting at the door to enter. Alice dipped her head and removed herself.

&amp;nbsp;

Stuffing the letter into the same inner pocket where the portal device rested Alice took her position with the observing teams on the lower level. An hour to go and she'd be back in Wonderland.

&amp;nbsp;

“Commencing countdown,” a voice said over the loud speaker. Bodies stilled, eyes turned towards the observation windows around the center of the plant. Unessential personal had been cleared from the facility, leaving only the base crew who'd run the generators during the onslaught and a couple ranking members of the U.S.S.F.

&amp;nbsp;

A whining, whirling noise filled the air, pressing against Alice's ear drums uncomfortably. The technicians all wore headsets so she plugged her own as the announcer counted down to one. Before they reached their mark noise was cut in half by the shrill sound of an alarm. All through the halls red light began to flash.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice looked around, watching lab technicians running towards consoles and others still racing towards the observation windows. They relayed information back to the technicians who frantically pressed buttons and spun dials.

&amp;nbsp;

The moment they knew, Alice could see it on their faces. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Abort!” The Lead Technician screamed, sending a flurry of underlings out from his side to do his bidding. The whine grew quieter till silence, deafening and whole, filled the facility.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice felt her shoulders drop. The test had failed. Running a hand along her slacks she felt the portal device, waiting just beneath the fabric.

&amp;nbsp;

*No matter what, you must go to Wonderland.*

&amp;nbsp;

It was almost time.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice started for one of the cleared administrative offices, seeking privacy for this last act. Behind her the alarm renewed its vigorous wail. 

&amp;nbsp;

Over the intercom a mechanical voice said, “Warning: Containment breach. Warning: Containment breach.”

&amp;nbsp;

Pandemonium erupted. White coats dashed in a dance of chaos, running for exits. Someone bumped into her, hitting her shoulder hard enough to knock her back a step. Down the hallway Alice spotted Commander Falstead calmly directing people out of the facility. He spied her watching him and gave a final order before coming to stand beside her.

&amp;nbsp;

There was shock everywhere, write on people’s faces, laced through their words, but the Commander’s face was surprisingly devoid of the emotion. Instead he was composed, a look of resignation hardening his eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

He said nothing, didn’t demand she evacuate or run, simply looked at her. 

&amp;nbsp;

Nearly time. Minutes now.

&amp;nbsp;

Commander Falstead gave a simple nod and rushed to follow the others out of the facility, leaving Alice alone in the hallway.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice pulled the portal device from her inner pocket, counting down the minutes with her wrist watch. As the final minute approached an explosion rocked the building. In the center, the generator exploded, shattering all the observation windows and knocking Alice off her feet. She felt her skull crack on the floor, blood running hot underneath her cheek.

&amp;nbsp;

Thirty Seconds.

&amp;nbsp;

It took everything within her not to activate the device sooner than the agreed upon time. Then a voice over the intercom said, “Warning: Radiation Levels Rising. Warning: Radiation Levels Rising.”

&amp;nbsp;

The building had been designed to prevent the expansion of radiation in the event of a breach but everyone still stuck inside before the lockdown would be cooked from the inside out. Meaning…her.

&amp;nbsp;

Ten seconds.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice groaned, pressing a hand to her scalp. The wound felt shallow but there was no way to tell how bad it was without medical attention. There was no time. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Warning: Radiation Levels Fatal.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice thought of Ali, realization dawning on her. *This.* This was how she’d died the first time. 

&amp;nbsp;

“No matter what happens, you must return to Wonderland.”

&amp;nbsp;

She’d known the test would fail. For a moment Alice was frozen in place by the flood of questions running through her head. Why? Why? Why? It was so tempting to drop the portal device and give up. Just close her eyes and go to sleep. One final trip into the dark.

&amp;nbsp;

Then, Ali’s voice drifted to her. Whether by way of memory or the hazy delusion from her head injury, Alice couldn’t tell. “It will call for sacrifice but the price of failure is all of humanity.”

&amp;nbsp;

Raising herself onto her elbow she gripped the portal device. “I am resolute.” Then she met her fate.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

The darkness pulled at her, tugging like an expectant child in need. *Follow me*, it beckoned.

&amp;nbsp;

But something else pulled on her too. Awareness yanked her up into a blinding white light. It took a moment for her eyes to adjust and when they did she was staring into the face of the Red Queen.

&amp;nbsp;

No. 

&amp;nbsp;

There were similarities but the shape of her lips was different, the color of her eyes a shade darker. 

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen.

&amp;nbsp;

“Hello, Alice.” 

&amp;nbsp;

The guards threw her into a cell alongside Kat and the crew of The Looking Glass. Radovich and Yu pulled her towards a corner, propping her up. Pain was already beginning to ripple through her. Sores were not long off. Already the skin felt tender, ready to split. Nausea clenched her stomach, threatening to expel everything till she was hollow.

&amp;nbsp;

“Alice!” Kat rushed to her side, gripping her shoulders painfully. When Alice winced her friend apologized and loosened her grip. “How are you here? Did the U.S.S.F. send you? Are they sending reinforcements? The White Queen sent ships to Earth. We couldn’t warn you.”

&amp;nbsp;

The words came rushing out of Kat, her voice washing over Alice with familiarity and warmth. A sense of relief made Alice sag against the wall. There was still life in everyone’s eyes, though they were ragged and worse for the wear. Whatever torture they’d endured the first time around hadn’t happened yet. She’d arrived earlier than the previous Alice.

&amp;nbsp;

And alone.

&amp;nbsp;

“No reinforcements. Just…me.” Her hand brushed against her slacks, reminding her of the hidden inner pocket. The guards had taken the portal device from her, ripping it from her hands with terrible ferocity. Red welts were beginning to bloom where their nails had cut into her.

&amp;nbsp;

But, they hadn’t taken the letter.

&amp;nbsp;

Delicately she reached into the pocket and pulled out the crumpled envelope. All eyes watched her as she unsealed it and read the contents. When she finished she folded it back up and held it in a shaking hand. 

&amp;nbsp;

“What’s it say?” Kat asked.

&amp;nbsp;

“It’s for the White Queen.” Everything except the last line. That had been for her.

&amp;nbsp;

*I’m sorry, Alice.*

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

Two days or maybe a million years later – everything ran together – the White Queen had Alice brought to her private command room. Screens dotted the far walls, coms filling the room with unfamiliar voices rattling off checks. The Queen sat alone in a narrow chair before all the screens and digital readings. She spun to face Alice where the guards dropped her on the floor.

&amp;nbsp;

Sores oozed pus, staining the pristine floor. The pain rolled her stomach over but she held back the bile. There was nothing to throw up anyways. She hadn’t eaten in over a day. 

&amp;nbsp;

“I wanted you to be here, to witness the retribution I will rain down on your pitiful planet. You, most of all, need to see what happens when you take from us. Even if it is the last thing you will ever see.” The White Queen’s voice was filled with righteous indignation but her face remained rigid, stoic as stone.

&amp;nbsp;

“While I would have liked to have time in which to exact the punishment you so deserve, I can promise you these final moments will send you brokenhearted into the void. I’ll learn to be satisfied with that.”

&amp;nbsp;

Alice watched the Queen through hazy eyes. Everything was clouded by pain and misery. 

&amp;nbsp;

*Hold on.*

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen turned back to the consoles, leaning over to speak into one of the coms. Alice was amazed they’d reach as far as Earth. That was amazing technology indeed.

&amp;nbsp;

“Commence attack.” 

&amp;nbsp;

A screen fed back telemetry of the vessels approaching Earth’s atmosphere. Two thousand in total. Distantly, Alice mused over how the Queen received up to date information. How powerful was her deep space radar? Mysteries for another time, another *someone*.

&amp;nbsp;

“Command, we read no vessels in orbit.”

&amp;nbsp;

This made the White Queen pull up straight. Her hand hovered over the transmit button. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Leader One, I’m getting a strange reading from the surface. Power fluxuations.”

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen pressed the button. “Their shield technology failed. Likely residual radiation.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Engaging-“

&amp;nbsp;

The com went to static and a single blinking light on the radar dropped off on the next pass.

&amp;nbsp;

“Command, they’re firing on us! Where are their ships?”

&amp;nbsp;

Another blimp dropped, then another and another till more than thirty were gone. The White Queen called out commands, yelling into the transmitter.

&amp;nbsp;

“The shots are coming from the surface!” Someone shouted.

&amp;nbsp;

“They’re cutting through our numbers. We’ve lost Leader One and Twelve. Three and Four are crippled. Command! What do we do?”

&amp;nbsp;

A hundred, two hundred, three…blimps on the radar fell like flies.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice watched in silent fascination, recalling that first conversation with Ali. 

&amp;nbsp;

*”The magician’s oldest trick, misdirection.”*

&amp;nbsp;

The shield technology had been a diversion. Never intended to actually work because Ali had already known it wouldn’t. 

&amp;nbsp;

*”That’s her Achilles’ Heel. She only sees plans made with conviction.”* But she hadn’t seen the ground to space weaponry, which had surely been built with conviction because that hadn’t been what Ali meant. She’d omitted a word from that sentence. 

&amp;nbsp;

*”She’s watching you.”* 

&amp;nbsp;

It suddenly clicked into place. Alice felt something bubble up inside of her.

&amp;nbsp;

In less than twenty minutes the radar revealed nothing remained of the White Queen’s armada. Silence fell on the room. Alice broke it by reaching into her pocket for the letter, not sure she could hold back what rose up within her.

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen turned to see her hold the letter up. Cautiously she plucked it from between her peeling fingers. “What’s this?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Everything you need to know.” A bubble of bile rose but behind it was a throaty laugh.

&amp;nbsp;

The White Queen read the letter, hands trembling. When she finished she crumpled it into a ball and tossed it to the ground.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice laughed. She laughed till her sides ached and her chest burned for air. She laughed as the White Queen stared at her in horror. She laughed when that horror turned to fury.

&amp;nbsp;

""You laugh?"" The Queen’s voice was shrill.

&amp;nbsp;

""Pawn takes the Queen,"" Alice said, when the laughter had died in her enough to allow speech. The euphoria took the edge off the worst of her pain.

&amp;nbsp;

""She did this knowing full well that she, *you*, would still die?"" The White Queen seemed genuinely confused.

&amp;nbsp;

Alice understood what her future self had placed all her faith in - The White Queen's inability to understand the concept of *sacrifice*. Ali had counted on the Queen’s need for revenge.

&amp;nbsp;

""Yes. It was the only play she had. I think a part of me has always know I'd die here."" Pain seized her, making it hard to concentrate. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before the rolling wave of darkness could wash over fully, dragging her down into blissful nothingness, Alice beckoned the Queen closer.

&amp;nbsp;

Apprehension marred the porcelain features of the beautiful, terrifying woman. She leaned in just enough to hear the last words Alice had the strength to say.

&amp;nbsp;

""The destruction of your fleet was only the beginning, White Queen. They’ll be coming.""

&amp;nbsp;

Alice laughed at the look of fear that finally broke the mask of the White Queen. The sounds of her own mirth followed her down, down, down into the darkness.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

*I know this will be hard to believe. Unfathomable. That we beat you. But you handed us the key to your own demise, the day I returned to Wonderland. It won’t make sense even as I tell you, because it won’t have happened if you’re reading this. Though perhaps your insight is sufficient enough to grasp how you gave yourself away.*

&amp;nbsp;

*You were waiting for us when we came. I thought it was because of your ability to see the future. And in a way it was, but it wasn’t just any future you were watching. It was* mine *you focused on so intently. Waiting, watching, trying to plan how you might bring me back to Wonderland. How you would make me pay for what I’d done.*

&amp;nbsp;

*I knew going back was a risk because you’d see both of us. It would tip you to the fact I managed to time travel in an effort to stop you. But you watched me tell Alice what to do. You watched me give her the idea. Watched me give her the exact date and time in which to arrive here. You could see the conviction of her fate. No deviation.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Because, White Queen, I used her. You might have seen* her *future but you couldn’t see my past. And I knew Alice would not let me down, because I am her.*

&amp;nbsp;

*It wasn’t broken legs Yu repaired in me the day we broke free. He was trying to heal the radiation poisoning I was suffering from just enough that I would survive to do what I needed to do.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Then, while guiding her towards the same fate I’d endured, I set in motion another plan without her knowledge, knowing it would be* her *you watched. I lied to her knowing that even if you tried to watch me, the only certainty you would find would be my death.* 

&amp;nbsp;

*By the time you read this you’ll see the full resolve of Earth. You’ll have witnessed what we are capable of when we stand united.*

&amp;nbsp;

I got an internship at a small game place and did their vfx work in unity for them and I've been thinking of getting more into that. I was recently laid off since the company folded and have been looking into going back to school.

I was thinking of getting another AA in programming, but it appears you can't get another AA once you've gotten one from a school. I could get an AS in game programming, but I was kind of hoping to just get one in straight up programming.

I can't get a bachelors in programming since I don't think I have really anything of note to get accepted in a good undergrad. So...I'm not quite sure what to do.

As for major goal: I just want to be employed to be honest. I dreamed, I tried, I failed. Now I just want to be employed and programming, from the bit I've done is kind of fun and if I could do it for games, especially with VFX, it could be the best thing ever.

So, any advice?

thanks!"
4vuux2,7,2016-08-02,I´m [23/m]. Today my girlfriend [22/f] told me she no longer loved me after three years of one heck of a relationship.,LiveandLetLivexx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vuux2/im_23m_today_my_girlfriend_22f_told_me_she_no/,"Some background - We met during University on the very first semester of first year, and for two whole years we had a perfect adventure together. We saw the world together, studied together and the best was that we ended up snuggled in bed watching a movie on a cold rainy night everyday.

We ve also went through rough spots in our lives. My girlfriends father passed away in second year. I was always present to make sure she was doing okay, as anyone would. That consequently made us stronger, but after a few months our relationship deteriorated. I could feel part of her died that night (understandable), and along with it, part of our relationship. Her feelings toward me changed,we no longer had sex (which is not really a problem for me, but I suppose can have its consequences in a relationship).

After that it seemed our relationship lost that spark, that energy and the drive. We still were together, and I was and still am as madly in love as I was in first year.

Come third year, being an engineer student, my workload was borderline unmanageable. I was under severe stress and anxiety, and I started to be less present in her life. We always managed to talk everyday and meet up few times a week, but I take full responsibility in fuckin up there. A few arguments come and go, which started building up some pressure in our relationship.

Come present time, semester ends and we each go to our respective internships half across Europe. I desperately try to rekindle our relationship, by trying to meet up or skype quite often, but her response is not very open. She says I am selfish in the way after exams are over, I decide its time to spend time together (I understand where she is coming from, and again I know I fucked up, but you would think after two and half great years a rough patch would not be enough to break us).

Today, she told me she felt guilty of not loving me (which just kills me inside out), that she does not love the person I am as of now. e agree to give this a shot another time, but where the fuck do I go from here? What to I do? I feel like she seems me like a stranger now.
I am going to see her next week for the weekend, I was wondering if you guys had any tips? Similar experiences?


TLDR&gt; Great relationship, me not being very present due to study lead to this situation."

I'm going into my Junior year now and I have a few loans from my first 2 years. I had an internship this summer, so I am able to do one of two things:

a) Use my money to pay off some of the previous loans, BUT get a new loan to pay for this year

or

b) Use my money to pay for this school year, BUT sit on the older loans until a future date

Here's what my plan is so far:

Take the subsidized loans being offered, and then pay the remainder with my money to cover this year. Then, use whatever I have left of my money to pay off my older loans.

All of my loans are not due for repayment until after I graduate, so this is all early. I have a mix of unsubsidized/subsidized loans from the past, so I'd pay off the unsubsidized loans first if that was the plan.

Any advice is appreciated!"
4vv8t8,1,2016-08-02,Help with first AEG!,lolzMaNin,Ask_Airsoft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Airsoft/comments/4vv8t8/help_with_first_aeg/,"Hello everyone,

At the moment, I'm at the stage of researching models, brands and possibility of future upgrades of airsoft weapons that I can find in my region.

I chose the G36C model to be my first AEG for two reasons: 

1)It's possible to play CQB and perform well on a mid-long range field.

2)The model can support a lot of upgrades in the future. Red dot, flashlight, front grips as well as intern parts.

Now I'm in doubt of which brand should I get. In my region there is only two options: Classic Army or G&amp;G.

Price wise, in my region the G&amp;G is considerable more expensive than a classic army. Thing is, I did not found a consistent review comparing both of them. From specifications, all I can tell is that the G&amp;G version comes with all the rails, while the Classic Army model just have the upper and lower ones. Also, from what I've heard, classic army discontinued this model, but I'm not sure of that.

I would like to ask experience players, airsoft gurus and G36C owners which one of these two models is better and why.

PS.: Bellow is a link of the two models. I live in Brazil, so this is just for specifications. The price of these models here, converted to US dollars will be displayed with the links(Yes, unfortunately, it is too expensive after taxes).

G&amp;G (BRL 3064.68~USD 938.3)

Also there is a SRC version, which I did not found much info yet. It costs a little more than the classic army version.

Thank you!

Edit: I've decided to buy a G&amp;G CM16 raider-l, not the prettiest or the best gun around, but it has a wide availability of parts and accessories around here and it's cost x benefit is fair. Thanks for all the information and tips!"

I'm hoping maybe I can make it a regular thing - or at least maybe a foot in the door to this hospital.. but I'll cross that bridge later.

Anyway, I wanted to throw this topic out there because I want to go AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE and ready to soak everything up that I can.

I put the current questions I have below... let me know PLEASE if there is anything I left out, or should include while I'm talking and shadowing her. I want to make the most of the time. So I know - this list is LONG... but I figured I won't be able to ask them all, I'll feel the whole thing out and ask as they become appropriate. I tried to incorporate as much of a scope of the job as I could!

**Work Experience**

* Internet Page - Director of a publishing website in Spanish and Portuguese delivering over 60 million page views per month (up from 6,000 views per month total when I started), as well as reaching 20 million people a week on Facebook. Job duties include all aspects of running a major publishing page, with strategic decision making for development (front and back end), content (text and video), advertising, and social media being primary day to day responsibilities. To put it simply, aside from actually writing the code and stories, I do everything else for the website. I manage about 25 employees total in LATAM (primarily Brazil and Argentina, where I travel to frequently).

* Soccer Marketing - Worked with family in creating marketing decks for sponsors wishing to be part of a major soccer event. Within that, I additionally utilized the overlap in audiences for the event and website to develop interesting projects that can create recorded actions online for sponsors - something traditional billboard advertising has difficulty in generating. I can expand on other actions I have done here if necessary.

* Farm - Assisted in the planning and realization of a family farm. This included deciding on animals to raise, how to sell goods, the type of goods to produce aside from beef/poultry/pork, services we could offer outside of purely raising animals (hunts, etc), and other facets of running a farm (primarily financial-related).

* General Store - Needing an outlet for the farm's produce, we rented out an abandoned storefront in a local town. This allowed the farm some leeway in the form of vertical integration and developed a sales channel for our goods. Currently working on increasing average customer spending and generating greater margins as well as increasing sales in non-perishable and compact goods. This and the farm together are generating over 500k/year

* PWM Firm - Summer Analyst for PWM Firm, received training on investment philosophy as well as tailored investment portfolios.


**Extra-Curricular**

* Compete in Powerlifting (Next competition in November, current maxes of 455/345/545 on S/B/DL)

* Racing (Attending Bondurant after R1 applications go through)

* Scuba Diving

* Free Diving/Spear Fishing

* Target Shooting

* Sports (Football/Volleyball/Basketball)


**University - Top 20 School**

* BS in International Economics

* Recipient of competitive Honors Certificate (competing with Master's and MBA students)

* 2011 Sports League Honor Roll Certificate

* Member of University Football Team (D1)

* Winner of weight class in Regional Powerlifting Meet (2010)

* Co-Captain of Club Volleyball Team

* Member of Collegiate Investors Club


**High School - (Irrelevant for the application, but some info may be pertinent to an essay I write)**

* Intern at Goldman Sachs at 17

* Captain of Basketball and Volleyball Teams

* Treasurer and VP of National Honor Society


**Race/Nationality** - White/USA - Dual Citizen, however, with a non-Brexit EU Nation


**Stats**

* GMAT - Only took BASELINE prep test, this was without study, so I have room to improve. 710, 45Q, 41V, 8IR. Goal is 750+ by September 15th.

* Undergrad GPA - 3.2  (mediocre, I'm being fair here, and I identify this as the weakest part of my application. The average econ degree during my time was a 2.9-3.0 due to the curve only allowing 10-15% of students per class to receive A's, but that is irrelevant. My GPA is the main reason why my current goal for the GMAT is a 750 or higher)


**Goal of MBA**

* Network, Learn, Absorb - I really want to go to the West Coast as a goal for my MBA as working with Technology in any facet has been my calling. I've taken basic HTML/CSS and Comp Sci classes (the latter from EdX), and even since my time working at Goldman as a high schooler I was in the Technology department. Ideally I'd like to sell the website I run and get into technology consulting, because I worked a few times with people who were absolute geniuses and had amazing products but were myopic in how they approached bringing it to market and its true functionality. Also working with people smarter than me is always inspirational. Sounds silly but it gets me working.

* Target Schools - H/S, Sloan, Haas, Tuck, in that order.

Thoughts? I posted this before but only got 1 true review. My main MBA Goal needs to really be refined, working on that :)"

I'm a 21 years old French guy young graduate with 15 months of experience in the sysadmin field, looking for a Junior System Administrator position in the USA (in Northern Virginia/Washington).

First of all, my objective is to live and work there, it's not only for an experience abroad. I believe my English level is good enough to practice my work. Of course it could use some improvements and I definitely intend to do so.
I should be eligible for a H1B visa since I have the equivalency of a bachelor degree.
I also have 15 months of work experience (3 months internship and 12 months of cooperative work within a school). It's not much but I had the opportunity to put my knowledge into practice and learn new things. I detailed my experience in my resume and Linkedin profile.

A junior position would be the perfect opportunity for me to continue what I started to do, which is to put my skills into practice. Also, I would keep learning new things related to the field (Linux, Windows or anything related to technology itself) as I believe that keeping in touch with the latest technology is a must.
In addition, I would like to seize the opportunity to pass some certifications such as Microsoft ones, so that I can guarantee my skills.
I'm dedicated to my work, I like solving problems and I never give up on that until I find the solution. 

Should you have some questions regarding anything, feel free to contact me.
You will find below my resume and Linkedin profile.
Thank you for taking the time to read!

I told her that we aren't having a relationship until she's back. She wanted to be exclusive through it, but I was firm in my answer. 

So my question is, what do I do with this girl? Does anyone have advice on dread to pull? I'm going to keep my eyes open for other girls and I already started fucking another orbiter I have. 

She also doesn't know anyone where she is interning and isn't legal to go to bars and drink, so I'm not worried about her getting with other guys.

I'm 28 and have MSC in Computing. Wanted to study Business &amp; Software engineering but there was no college in the country which offered that mix, so there was Computing instead. 

Worked as a software engineer during university and afterwards worked a dream job in web development working remotely and digital nomading. 

Now got a bit bored from working individually and want to become a part of a team. I LIKE these activities: analysing, learning, creating products, optimizing, drawing, meeting people. I DON'T LIKE seating all day staring at the screen, coding and not communicating with people.


**PROBLEMS:**

1) In the country where I am resident there are no jobs in the fields I am interested in and everything besides working remotely for foreign companies is paid shitty, so I would have to move to somewhere in Western Europe.

2) Don't have some amazing skills in other fields besides web development, but have basic skills in marketing, sales, design, entrepreneurship which I got from starting my own startup and side-projects. 

3) Don't want to start from ""beginning"", taking on boring and low paid internship roles etc. after being highly paid and treated as a senior in web development.


**GOAL:**

I would like to retain the lifestyle of working REMOTELY from anywhere is possible. But my main goal would be to move away from programming to a role like: business development, product management or UX design, even if it means having to stay ON-SITE.

So I am trying to choose a viable career that would suit me the best and which would have an easy way to switch so that I could already use my existing skills."
4vvrtw,2,2016-08-02,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4vvrtw/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong.

As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation.

Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my kinklist if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!

Ha. 

Since then, I've changed my strategy to:

* not expecting any real job opportunities until I finish my MA and just kind of scraping by until then.
* locating and securing at least one or two internships between now and the time I graduate with my MA.

But I also want to take any opportunity I can to ""round out"" my experience in the meantime, which thus far only includes:

* Becoming a CASA advocate on a volunteer basis. I don't intend to work directly with kids as a career, but this is still at least peripherally related.

I'm open to volunteer opportunity ideas and whatever else you guys can think of. I don't expect people to go hunting for openings for me, obviously. I just feel like I'm not looking at a wide-enough picture of what could be relevant/helpful experience.

 I'm currently located north of Seattle for a year, then I'll be in San Diego for a year and a half, then Pennsylvania for two - in case the suggestions are location-specific.

4vw16g,10,2016-08-02,Looking for advice about switching majors (ChemE -&gt; CompE),aychtooessohfore,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4vw16g/looking_for_advice_about_switching_majors_cheme/,"Hey guys,


I'm a chemE major going into my junior year. I've made the decision to switch to compE after taking off a year to work at various companies. I really enjoy the work I've been doing (software and embedded software) and would love to do it as a career. I've used C, C++, and JavaScript extensively.


Because I'm switching in, only 58 of my credits count from my first 2 years (I had already taken a few intro programming courses). I already have all the calculus, physics, chemistry and all my genEds done as well. I need 70 more credits to graduate. 


I'm an out-of-state student at a state school, but I'm very fortunate to have a full academic scholarship, so it doesn't cost me anything. My scholarship will only cover the next 4 semesters, though. Because of this, I'm hoping to finish my degree in 4 more semesters. The cost of each additional semester would be about ~20k which is money I really don't have (parents have very little money and a ton of debt, so I don't even know if I could get enough loans). 


To do it in 4 semesters, I will be doing about 17-18 credits per semester. These will be basically all engineering, CS, and math courses. Do you think this is doable? Here is my 4 semester plan:


Semester 1: 

 * Circuits I (includes lab)
 * Digital logic circuits
 * Discrete Math
 * OOP in C++
 * Statistics


Total: 18 hours


Semester 2:

 * Circuits II (includes lab)
 * Digital Logic Lab
 * Computer Organization
 * Algorithms
 * Software Engineering w/ C++
 * Linear Algebra


Total: 19 hours


Semester 3:

 * Intro to Electronics
 * Signals and Systems
 * Compilers
 * Embedded Systems
 * Elective
 * Elective



Total: 18 hours


Semester 4:

 * Capstone Project
 * Operating Systems
 * Computer Architecture
 * Elective
 * Elective


Total: 15 hours


The electives at my school range from very easy to moderately hard. 


What do you guys think? Is this doable? Any advice? As a reference, I had a 4.0 in Chemical Engineering and I usually took 17-19 hours per semester, although usually 1-2 of the classes were genEds. I don't have any real work commitments or research work and I have a return internship offer for next summer that I'll probably take, so I don't have to worry about any of that. 


Thanks for your help guys. My current plan is to try it this semester and see how I feel by the drop date (~6 weeks in)



Sorry for the long post. Thanks a ton if you bothered to read it all! 


TL;DR: ChemE to CompE switch. Junior Year. 4 Semesters of scholarship left. Need to take 18 hours/semester. Doable?"
4vw9ot,0,2016-08-02,My loneliness has progressed to a feeling of complete emptiness,HeismanBurgh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4vw9ot/my_loneliness_has_progressed_to_a_feeling_of/,"Sorry for the pity party, but I'm a little inebriated and need to vent. I've been well acquainted with loneliness my entire life, mainly due to being an awkward, timid person that isn't very good at meeting people. Thankfully, I've had a few closer friends in the past that have kept me sane; I'm a bit of an introvert anyway so loneliness hasn't bothered me as much in the past. 


The last few years have been different, however. I'm a year away from graduating college and am still a virgin, the farthest I've gone being a brief make-out session years ago. My group of friends is very small, and will most likely be reduced to nothing once we all graduate and go our separate ways. I haven't received a single non work-related text or message the entire summer. Right now I'm in an internship program and living with two other co-workers, both nice, friendly people. Unfortunately, I'm in a separate department from them and am therefore on my own most of the day. We all get along fairly well, though they noticeably communicate better with each other. To be honest, I'm a little jealous of their friendship because it seems they don't like me as much. Sometimes it feels like I annoy them. It makes me feel isolated in a way, though I'm sure that's not their intention whatsoever.


Recently, it feels like I'm just an empty shell of myself that barely manages to put on a happy facade. I see coworkers and even strangers on the street joking, laughing, and enjoying the company of friends that I wish I had. My roommates will casually talk about past relationships and hookups like nothing, not knowing how desperate I am for a girl to even acknowledge me as a friend, let alone a partner. Hell, I barely know any of my classmates, and I'm going to be a senior! I feel trapped in a bubble, with everyone around me laughing at an inside joke I'm too stupid to comprehend. 


The worst part is, this is all my fault. I'm not the type to place blame for my problems on the world, even though I'd like to. My own awkwardness and pathetically low self-esteem have held me back from most chances at friendships and relationships. My personality, awkward and at times obnoxious, isn't very likable. But dammit does it suck to know that practically no-one would care if I just disappeared tomorrow, something I've began to fantasize about more and more. I wish I had just one shoulder to cry on, or one person that would truly care about how my day went. Sorry for being so selfish, but I just feel so sad and lonely. "

I like the type of work my major will set me up to do, but I don't really see myself doing it long term. I can do it well and would be proud of my work, but I don't have any passion for it. 

And this lack of enthusiasm for my work has made me put tons of energy into my social life, which sounds amazing, but sometimes I just feel so tired. It's almost like my life is spinning so rapidly that I'm forgetting who I used to be. I always had an inner drive pushing me to work toward the future, but now I'm almost starting to feel like a hedonist and am afraid of where this could take me. 

How do you find direction, or motivation, when you have no idea where you should go? How do you reign in your life so you don't accidentally throw out everything you've worked so hard for?

This update has been a long time coming, and when you read it you'll understand why. Suffice to say, I'm out of a job, but I don't really care. It could have been much worse. I tried to summarize what happened over the past couple days, so please bear with me as it's rather choppy.

Day 1  
Brian was still out sick. I called and he said he’s fine, he just came down with the flu. When I mentioned my vague concerns about contamination from the zooplankton he laughed me off. Todd and I are fine.

Heather and her team sent a short email with footage attached. They took more samples and are keeping them in water. They’re wrapping up and heading back with Jake and will personally bring the samples back to keep as many of the zooplankton alive as possible. 

The DNA samples Todd ran have come back a jumbled mess. He muttered about contamination and rerunning them. I poached one of the printouts from him, and got a look at the results. It was quite the mess of bits and pieces, but I recognized a couple family names as partial matches, things like 2%, or 4%, nothing major. *Perixplexis, Smacigastes, Vibrio*. Yeah, there was definitely contamination here, although from where I didn’t know. 

I left him to fuss over the petri dishes and watched the new footage. It seemed pretty similar to the test footage at first glance. Meters upon meters of darkness once Jake leaves the photic zone, and then nothing but the tiny flashes of bioluminescent fish and plankton. I checked the timestamp, and I was almost halfway through at this point with no sightings of identifiable life. When we hit the 5000m mark a shelf jutted up. Notes indicated that Heather’s team had spotted to explore a small ledge before continuing downwards. It was here that I spotted what I thought was the first sign of life. The ROV’s lights had caught something large. I rolled forwards in the computer chair and kept the video playing. A massive shape came into view of the camera, and I squinted at it. It couldn’t be a rock formation, it was too fleshy. 

The head came into view, and then the sharp teeth, and a plethora of white, puckered scars that bit into the taut skin. It was a sperm whale. For a split second my mind raced. Had we captured footage of one hunting a giant squid? That would be the kind of breakthrough we needed. And then just as suddenly, I froze. Jake’s angle had shifted, and one the baseball-sized eyes loomed into view. It was unmoving, eerily still in the way it had rolled back into the whale’s head. It was only then that I noticed the lifeless gape of its mouth, and raw scrapes where the rocky bottom had torn away at the whale’s underbelly. I was unnerved to say the least, but I cut the video and added it to the identified animals folder. Whales don’t make it 4000 meters down untouched. They bloat and decompose, oftentimes popping spectacularly and showing feasting seabirds with entrails and loose, rotting skin. The whale corpse just felt profoundly wrong. The rest of the video is almost worse. 

The farther down we descend, the smaller the dead become. Anglerfish became tripod fish which became every type of eel imaginable, conger eels twisted and contorted upon themselves, snipe eels half buried under the marine snow. Not a single one of them showing any signs of decomposition. I dutifully categorized each one, and then watched as the ROV returned to the pallid sperm whale.  Its mouth hangs slightly open and a small, white crab stumbles out, its walk almost drunken. It falls from the gaping mouth, and when it lands on the muck it doesn’t move. After a minute a large eel descends upon it, and then darts away with the pale creature in its mouth. At this point I decide I’ve had enough for the day, and shut off the video.

Day 2  
I came in find to find Gabi had sent an email instructing us to attempt to culture the zooplankton. We were capable of reproducing the pressure at which animals are exposed to at the bottom of the ocean. Todd set it to 5000m, roughly the depth at which the sample was taken, I whipped up seawater mixture and we added about ten of the copepods from where we’d been keeping them. At this point, we still had no idea what we eat. Phytoplankton, the usual food of phytoplankton, are off the table because at 5000m there’s not the tiniest trickle of sunlight. Phytoplankton are primary producers, and as such, require sunlight. After a few minutes of spitballing we decided to go with fish food intended for fry, and a dead goldfish in both tanks, even though we didn’t expect the non-pressurized plankton to last much longer. Not exactly scientific, but we didn’t have a lot to go on here.   
  
---
  
Day 3  
Brian is still out. I called again, but he didn’t respond. Todd sent him a text, and said he’ll drop by tomorrow if he doesn’t respond, but that he’s probably just sleeping. I went to Gabi’s office so that we could tell her about the DNA, and the footage, but the door was locked. I can see her in there, though, in front of her computer. She’s probably typing up a report, and didn’t want to be bothered, so I left. Todd kept getting the same results with the DNA, so he sent a sample off to a friend who works at a large university. I told Todd about the undecomposed animals. He shivered, and asked to watch the video himself. When it was over, he was speechless. He couldn’t think of anything like it, and didn’t know what would cause it. I couldn’t help but think of our samples back in the lab. 

We checked on the zooplankton. The pressurized tank was cloudy, and Todd swears. He disengaged the mechanism, and we leaned in to see the almost clear bodies of our organism floating on the surface. Our unintentional control group was fine. We thought we had lost them as well, but when Todd knocked on the tank they burst up in a swarm from the fish. There are no visible signs of damage to the body of the fish, and the fry flakes remain uneaten. As the plankton are transparent, it’s clear that they have eaten something, although what it is we don’t know. We’ve begun to call them *Ostiosecara* for now. Todd joked that Gabi will probably want to name the species. I smacked him. In all reality, naming rights belong to Heather, or at least Brian, if he would ever show up for work.  
  
---
  

Day 4

Todd’s going over to check on Brian when work gets out. I started writing this up on my lunch break, and I’m just now getting around to finishing it. I was a little worried about getting caught, but Gabi hadn’t been down here in two days, so she probably had better stuff to do than snoop around my laptop. 

We still didn’t know why the *Ostiosecara* don’t survive when we recreate deep ocean pressures. Todd’s theory is that they’re originally a shallow water species, and their eggs were somehow trapped in sediment. I knew they were examples of *Anostraca* cysts lasting for years, but what Todd was implying simply could not be possible. There’s no way a species could either survive long enough to become trapped in sediment and reach the bottom, or fall that far without being eaten.

It became clear they’re eating the goldfish, but it still shows no sign of decomposition.
Our little plankton still gave me the creeps, although I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why. As suggested in the comments earlier, it was so small that even if it were carnivorous and despite its aggressive activity, there’s no way it would be a threat to humans, or even larger animals. Even bearing the similarity of its mouthparts to *Isistius*, such a bite would be no more than a nuisance. The ecological ramifications of its release into waters would be disturbing to say the least, but it is not in itself dangerous. In fact, to my knowledge the only danger zooplankton pose is as their role in carrying disease. 

That was when it hit me. Disease vectors. They had a similar method of feeding to the cookie cutter shark, and carried what can only be a dangerous bacterium that benefited from their parasitic lifestyle. They bite a host, and expose their prey to the bacterium, a bacterium so vicious that it outcompetes all others. The undecomposed corpses began to make sense in that moment, even though I didn’t want them to. I looked up to call Todd over, and saw Gabi’s door swing open. Two men in suits were escorting her out. I thought she might have been working with them, that this might have been her doing, but when she looked back at me, looked at the samples of *Ostiosecara*, I knew she wasn’t. There was nothing in her eyes but fear.
  
Working silently next to Todd, we threw all of our samples into the pressurized tank. Heather would be arriving with more, but at this point, it was all we could do. I told him about my theory as we worked, wearing lab coats, goggles, and elbow length gloves. He nodded as I talked, and when I finished, the first word out of his mouth was “Brian.”
When we showed up at his apartment the door was unlocked. I want to tell you that the smell of death hung heavy over us. I want to say that his body was pale and bloated, lose with the arrival and departure of rigor mortis. It would be a lie. Brian sat in his computer chair facing away from the door, and Todd stepped inside, a relieved grin spreading his face, and slapped him on the shoulder. “What’s up, Brian? How come you haven’t been returning-”

His expression collapsed into one of horror as the body sagged forward. I knew by the way he had flinched that Brian was cold. That he had been dead for at least a day. 
We stood out in the hallway and called the police. We couldn't bear to be inside. Seeing him like this was somehow worse, taunting in its unnaturality.   
  
---
  
I was let go from my internship early with a promise of a stellar recommendation, and the unsaid threat beneath it that my career depended on my sealed lips. Todd transferred to a nearby university with a hefty severance package. We never got those DNA results.

Last summer, my best friend got an internship at a new start-up and has really changed. He has started to become arrogant, somehow figuring out a way to often assert the fact that he 'is better than me', regardless of context and it has driven me to the point where I am genuinely scared to ask him questions when I am trying to learn new things in computers, as he just seems to get irritated and says that I need 'to learn something without him'. In the event that I do or find something that I find cool to do with computers and programming, he seems to refuse to share my enthusiasm and blatently replies with 'I really don't care'. This is contrary to what I say to him, regardless of whether or not whatever he is showing me is boring. I am always willing to share a friends enthusiasm regardless of what it is; as long as it makes them happy. Furthermore, he does not seem to understand that fact that I suffer from some learning disabilities, and I honestly try my hardest to learn, but it is difficult due to the aforementioned.

How do I assert this?

tl;dr:
best friend is becoming an asshole, constantly mocking me for what i am trying to learn - send help"

What’s the hiring demand like this year?,redditor_sunshine,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4vwtk5/interesting_in_working_in_the_san_francisco_bay/,"Hello! I’m a graduate accounting student studying in Georgia but interested in starting my full-time job at a big 4 firm in the San Francisco bay area. I want to live in San Francisco but San Jose is acceptable. The big 4 firms based in Atlanta recruit at my school. I plan to graduate in May, 2017. I’m interested in auditing and prefer commercial/tech to financial services. A combination of both is cool too.

My GPA is about 3.9, and I have had an internship at a public accounting firm in Atlanta. I’m an international student from Asia, and before I came to the U.S., I had some big 4 full-time work experience in the industries including car manufacturing, bio-technology, and computer hardware. 

So, not sure if it’s too early to ask, but I was wondering what is the hiring demand like in the bay area this year? Since I’m far from there, I want to make sure there is at least some demand so that I won’t risk my options. Hope that makes sense. My alternative choice is NYC but SF is still my top choice.

Also, since I haven’t known many people there, it would be great if you could share some insider information, such as the firm culture and leadership style. I sincerely want to make some connections :) Thank you very much!

PS. I have tried to provide as much background information as I can, but please feel free to let me know if you need more info. Thanks!

I am in a sort of junior/senior year at a decent state university. I am majoring in Mathematics with a CS emphasis. I should have all of my CS minor requirements met by the end of the semester along with an extra CS class of Object Oriented Program and Design. I am also doing free code camp in my spare time but am not very far in to it. 

My big concern is not only feeling like I am nowhere near qualified enough to do anything, and seem to forget most of how I have done every project I have done, but my GPA is pretty bad. It is a 2.8, which to be fair is a transfer GPA, as in only my upper level courses are on it, and I am a math major so a 3.0 is pretty good, but I don't think companies look at that. 

I am not really concerned with where I work, or even getting great money, I just want to get a job. I am 37 and not getting any younger. I would like to be able to pay off school and afford a car or something haha. Aside from what I am doing how can I get myself in the market? What are good places to look for internships? Basically what it boils down to is I am terrified that I am going to end up with 50k in debt and no job despite having a decent degree because I have no practical real world coding skills. "

I am currently working at a Big Four company in LA as a Security Consultant. I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona as a CIS major.
This school itself as a CIS degree has a great reputation in Cyber Security and a lot of grads become very marketable after graduating through internships, CCDC, and clubs.

I am happy about what I did so far in my career, as I know that Cyber Security isn't an easy field to break into, and I managed to get in without going through the years of being at a help desk or technician.

So at this point, I'm wondering how I can advance my career and (not to sound greedy or cocky) maximize the money I can earn. I am making a decent living as a single male, but where do I go from here? Should I work on getting my Masters in CIS so that more opportunities open up, or get my CISSP?

Any knowledge would be very helpful :). Thank you!"
4vx4r8,1,2016-08-03,[Discussion] How do you know you're ready to handle a two year old?,BIOdire,Horses,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horses/comments/4vx4r8/discussion_how_do_you_know_youre_ready_to_handle/,"I started riding when I was six or so, ""backyard English"" I'd call it now, and rode in a few jumping clinics when I was young. When I was sixteen I started training to be a competitive nonpro rider for reining/cowhorse, and really my eventual goal is to intern under a pro and really bring myself into the next level of riding.

I trained a pro four year old filly for an absentee owner that came up lame (a genetic condition the vet thought, that was not showing symptoms until a large accident we had). I rode and owned a nonpro cowhorse for about a year, but he and I had a personality conflict issue that I was unable to smooth out--to this day I cannot really put my finger on what it was, but we did not seem to like each other--tolerated, yes, but not like. I sold him to an owner who absolutely adores him, and rides him daily, even started roping with him! :)

When I can I ride at cow horse clinics under pros and some nonpros. It's difficult to do without your own horse, as a pre-requisite for most clinics is owning your own horse.

I have a chance now to look at a TR Dual Rey filly, or a Von Starlight filly. One is started by a pro, the other started by a nonpro (price reflects this, but they're both equal in training). I've never ridden a two year old before, I'm confident in my seat and in my knowledge--I know I'm never done learning and I'm excited to push my boundaries... but how do I know I'm ready?

I asked my coach what level of rider I was. My scale is shown [here](http://www.lrgaf.org/guide/ability.htm). I asked her if I was novice, she said I was *at the very least* novice, and suggested I was closer to intermediate.

My question is, how do you know when you're ready to handle a 2 year old? If they have a good mind and have been started gently and with trust, will it even matter much if I have never ridden a 2 year old before? It's obviously going to be a different experience, but I don't want to leap into something too wild.

My coach said it really depends on the horse--if they're nuts (mentally unsound I believe she means), don't get on is her philosophy."

I'm American, Claire was born in northern China.

Before we met, I had already accepted a summer internship, and after we started dating, I was very open about the fact that I was going to be away for a nontrivial amount of time (~3 months). We were about 2 months in at that point, and things were going really well. She told me she doesn't really believe in long distance relationships, but she really likes me and wants to make it work. We're clearly not past the honeymoon stage yet, but this girl is smart as hell, beautiful, fun and outgoing, great sex, and we agree on a lot of things. So I really want to make it work too.

Our relationship is a saw-tooth graph after I leave. It deteriorates. She came to visit for a week about 1.5 months in, things are great. Then it deteriorates again. And here we are now, I have a week left and things aren't going so well.

We're both busy, there's no escaping that. Maybe my schedule is less flexible as I have a 9-5 type-deal, but we probably put in pretty similar workday hours.

I always try to make time to say good morning and good night, unless she has told me she won't have time. That's okay. We're busy. Even though we're busy, I try to send texts pretty frequently letting her know that I'm thinking of her and asking her how she's doing, and telling her things about friends, coworkers, etc. She also updates me with things going on in her lab, things about her friends, etc.

I really like talking to Claire. She's cool. I don't think I'm drowning her in too much attention -- we initiate contact about equally often, and I'm happy to crunch away at work for a long, uninterrupted stretch if we both appear to be ""in the zone"" during the day.

But she's not happy with some ways I handle the communication. And I get that. LDR is hard. But I feel like I try to come to solutions, and it usually ends up blowing up in my face.

Examples:

- One night, I'm out with some friends. I had mentioned this to her earlier. Her time zone is 2 hours ahead -- when it's her bedtime, I step aside to say goodnight. Turns out she had an unpleasant conversation with her advisor, so I listened. After a while, one of my friends calls me (probably wondering where I am). I tell Claire I'm getting a call from one of my friends and am probably keeping them waiting -- I apologize and ask if we can continue the discussion later. Bad move. She hangs up, doesn't want to talk to me after that. Later, says she needed me, and I wasn't there for her. I apologized and explained I didn't realize how serious the situation was, but I always want to be there for her -- if she explicitly tells me she really needs me at that time, I will make sure to drop whatever I am doing and give her 100%. She says she shouldn't have to tell me this. I don't know how to respond at this point, so I don't say anything.

- Earlier today, one of the execs at my internship asked me to drop out of my PhD and join the company. Or at least extend my internship. I said not a chance -- I need to start back up at school at the normal date in the fall, finish my degree. I told Claire about this, and she said not to extend, because she wants me to come back since I don't do a good job of keeping in touch. I don't know how to reply to this, because I feel like I try pretty hard to keep an open channel.

- One day, I randomly send Claire a text -- ""let's do a photo-shoot when I get back. I think it would be fun."" Then I go to the gym. When I get back I see she replied: ""haha, sounds good. what made you think of that?"" After I reply, she asks politely that if I text her, please don't disappear for hours until we finish the conversation. (There were precisely 40 minutes between when she texted and I replied after getting back from the gym, we have timestamps.) If I don't have time to finish a full conversation, I shouldn't text at all. I tell her I'll try to be better about this, but that night when we talk on the phone she's pretty upset. Gives me a cold-shoulder goodnight. 

So here are my questions:

1. Based on the previous, does it seem like I'm smothering her, or does it seem like I'm giving not enough attention? Based on statistics of call logs and chat logs I feel like I'm smothering her, but based on her attitudes about my communication I feel like I don't give enough attention.

2. Does it seem like I'm cherry-picking scenarios to misrepresent the situation? Or in the scenarios I'm presenting, do I seem like a shitty BF?

3. This LDR is using a lot of my energy -- not because of too much or too little communication, but I'm just so unused to anything I say or do just being almost completely ineffective. Any advice on how to handle things more effectively?

4. Should I be getting angry here? Usually if I try to explain how I feel, in calm terms, it's not received well. I really don't think anger, cold shoulder, withholding affection etc. are the right ways to deal with things, but I feel like I'm often at the receiving ends of these tactics.

5. I've asked all the previous under the assumption that it's worth it to keep putting in the effort, and that things will improve when we're both in the same place again. But some of the ways we deal with issues are starting to seem totally incompatible. Other than the differences in how we handle issues, she's a total catch. She's even started to teach me Mandarin Chinese, which I think is just so cool. Are the issues I outlined deal-breakers, or is it something that seems workable?

---   
**tl;dr**: Seems like I can't do the right thing in LDR no matter what. I feel like I'm putting in a lot of effort, but it's not good enough and it's wearing away at me. There's just one more week of this though -- tough it out and have a talk in person about these feelings, or start preparing to abandon ship, or maybe some advice on other options?"

 - Can't find a PhD, because PhDs are given to people whom universities are already acquainted with, being sure of their performance, and my alma mater doesn't hire ( due to beaurocracy).  
 - Can't find a matching job, becasue the industry is kind of stuck, nothing is happening and people with ~5 years experience receive entry level jobs.  
 - Can't find a job in defense, becasue my country doesn't have military nuclear tech, and I can't obtain serurity clearance for any other state.  
 - Can't find a job in other industry, becasue while I do have transferable skills, they prefere people with the background.  
 - Can't find a job below my education, becasue if someone is to hire a nuclear engineer to check if a fuse panel is well connected, they better take a younger guy, who doesn't ask too much.

Before I begin, I just want to say that it's both relieving and disappointing that so many Asians have experienced the same degree of what I've long denied was abuse, narcissism, and distrust from our parents (in my case, my mother, specifically). I suppose my upbringing, being raised by a single/divorcee mom from ages 9-18, allowed me to get away with some things, but this was cancelled out a bit by my mom's desire to prove to my father that she could raise me fine without him. (Also, I apologize for the  length of this post, as this is my first post ever on reddit and I've been known to ramble!)

I don't know if I'm really *looking* for advice, as I've recently started seeing a therapist and that's been a huge help, but I'd definitely appreciate and wouldn't shy away from any input or support, as I might have to take a leap of faith soon, depending on how my situation pans out. I'm also pretty open in revealing my past, so feel free to ask away. (Oh, and if you happen to be in a similar situation and just need support, just know I'm also open to contact, even if someone just wants to vent.) Onto the situation at hand...

In a lot of ways, before the most recent argument I had with my mother, I actually thought our relationship was getting better -- after beginning therapy, though, I began feeling that maybe a lot of my acceptance of her so-called ""advice"" (read: control) over the past 5 years or so had more to do with my fear of losing her. The recent incident that happened that pushed me to seek professional help was an argument with my mother regarding employment and internships that occurred the week of my 34th birthday. 

I'm a graduate student in IT security and have several friends who either are at management level or at least work in the same industry. My mother has one close friend who works in IT as a manager. Basically, the argument occurred because she felt that I should look for entry level employment (I'm about halfway through my program with about a year left). Since my undergraduate degree was in Accounting, having no prior work experience, I explained to her that the advice given to me from my friends who worked in the industry was to look for an internship over employment because putting my education on my resume as ""skills"" at this point in my program, if chosen for *any* job, would likely be for a company that simply needs IT personnel to handle menial tasks and would likely have little to nothing to do with what I was studying. She countered, stating that her friend, the IT manager, mentioned to her that I could start looking for work (for which I didn't say out loud, but I call bs, as this was the same person who told me **in person** that I maybe should take some undergraduate courses to strengthen areas where I felt I was lacking). I provided an alternative of seeking an IT help desk position at my grad school, since at least I felt I might be able to network a bit more, which she half-ass accepted, but then continued to state that her friend's advice should be a part of my job pursuit. I decided to stand my ground and I explained to her that I always felt undermined by her because even when I was provided what I felt was more credible advice -- both in relevance *and* quantity -- she still felt the need to assert that her friend's advice should hold equally or more weight than advice from my own friends. When I expressed that I felt she had consistently downplayed the relevance of my friends, even as adults, she countered again saying that she ""never said anything bad"" about them and ""always said your friend Tom (my closest friend who works as a IT security manager) was a good friend."" When I told her that believing those things about Tom yet not allowing me to take his advice over her friends actually *was* downplaying the relevance his advice, we began the cyclical argument that we've had multiple times over the years about her not trusting my judgement. Ultimately, recognizing the pattern, I decided to leave her place, assuming it'd blow over, especially given my birthday was coming up soon. Well, it didn't. She called me the Monday following my birthday weekend, after I had performed on the same lineup with one of my greatest idols (I've been a DJ for over 16 years, another thing I've had to defend against her), and immediately told me I need to start looking for that job. We basically repeated the same argument from the week before, but this time ending with me being so upset that I couldn't do anything but hang up on her before I lost it.

Instead of the incident driving me to apply for work at grad school and prepare my resume for internships sooner, it completely demotivated me. And I think this time I really finally had it because I even felt the need to quit smoking weed for the time being to assure myself that I had my head straight and I wasn't just making a bigger deal out of this than it was because I smoke daily. I assumed, like the last really bad argument we had, that she'd at least reach out, even if she couldn't apologize, but she didn't contact me until today (nearly 3 weeks later) and that even occurred with some conniving attempt to trick me with a text message only saying ""check your email"" when she never sent one. I didn't reply, as my therapist even said outright that I shouldn't have contact with my mother *at all* yet, but it's not surprising that a few hours later she texted ""call mom tomorrow."" I probably won't reach out, but unfortunately, like many I've noticed in this subreddit, I'm financially supported by my parents, as well.

Since my mom claims her and my stepdad want to support my education (really, I'm sure it's his money more than hers, considering she took early retirement in her 40's and is in her early 60's now), I have a feeling any suggestion I make for her to leave me be and continue that support is farfetched unless my stepdad decides to go around her (unlikely, as he's been fairly standoffish when it comes to what he considers ""mother-son"" issues). The fucked up part is that quitting my day job was their stipulation for supporting me through grad school (convinced that I'd need more time to ""focus"" since I was willing to take a double courseload). So, while my therapist recommends no contact, I have tuition and bills to pay, since I live alone in the condo my mother and I previously resided in together, prior to her marriage to my stepdad. I'm assuming my mom will call tomorrow, so I suppose all I can do (save for any better advice anyone might be able to give me) is make her realize how depressed I've been. She knows I've been previously diagnosed with depression, so I would hope and assume that the situation might make her step back a bit. 

My silver lining for a long time was my mom meeting my stepdad. He cares a lot for her and is well-off and maybe until a few years ago would try to talk my mom down a lot when we got into arguments. He has been alone much of his life, since his parents passed when he was young and they were dirt poor, but I respect him a lot because he fended for himself and moved to the US for college -- I feel this really influenced the outcome of my extremely successful stepbrother and stepsister (like Fortune 500 c-suite successful, who are about 10 or so years older than me), as I'm sure his parenting style was a bit more adapted to Western life. However, since he's hit his 70's, he's becoming frustrated with his own forgetfulness (another thing that irritates my mom) and often stays out of anything he considers a ""mother-son"" matter. I love the guy, but I feel helpless for him and how he has to deal with my mom, as well. 

I don't know if I love my mother the same way she loves me or if she'll ever make me feel like she does, but I will always love her and I don't believe she's always been a horrible parent. However, it seems clear now, looking back, that many of the times she decided to be more lenient on me are instead being used by her now as support for how good of a parent she was or, at least, how hard she tried to be a ""good parent."" I'm not interested in looking to the past for anything other than for greater understand of who I am now, so I really am hoping something breaks, even if it means I might have to survive on my own for a bit. I'm fearful of the possibility I may have to, but I think it's very telling that I'm at a turning point because I'm currently in a situation where I don't feel I stand to lose much except maybe some material possessions by doing so."

I'm 28 and have MSC in Computing. Wanted to study Business &amp; Software engineering but there was no college in the country which offered that mix, so there was Computing instead. 

Worked as a software engineer during university and afterwards worked a dream job in web development working remotely and digital nomading. 

Now got a bit bored from working individually and want to become a part of a team. I LIKE these activities: analysing, learning, creating products, optimizing, drawing, meeting people. I DON'T LIKE seating all day staring at the screen, coding and not communicating with people.


**PROBLEMS:**

1) In the country where I am resident there are no jobs in the fields I am interested in and everything besides working remotely for foreign companies is paid shitty, so I would have to move to somewhere in Western Europe.

2) Don't have some amazing skills in other fields besides web development, but have basic skills in marketing, sales, design, entrepreneurship which I got from starting my own startup and side-projects. 

3) Don't want to start from ""beginning"", taking on boring and low paid internship roles etc. after being highly paid and treated as a senior in web development.


**GOAL:**

I would like to retain the lifestyle of working REMOTELY from anywhere is possible. But my main goal would be to move away from programming to a role like: business development, product management or UX design, even if it means having to stay ON-SITE.

So I am trying to choose a viable career that would suit me the best and which would have an easy way to switch so that I could already use my existing skills."

At the end of my sophomore year of college, I was dismissed for academic reasons. I failed out. I'm a failure. Now I have to deal with the results of that. I was admitted back to the same college a year later, and even thought my grades have improved, they still aren't good. And now I'm faced with that same problem again. I'm taking 3 summer classes as it's the only way I can graduate at the end of this year, and I'm taking exactly the number I need to do so, even with a full senior year. However, I've been slacking off lately. A lot of the work builds off previous work, and I haven't done the previous work, so I can't do the current work. My grades are slipping, and one of my profs has said that if I don't pick it up, I'll fail, which means I'll be here another quarter.

This is all not new information, I've known about myself and my bullshit for forever. The only difference is that yesterday afternoon I got an email from Google. My college is quite well known for producing amazing engineers, and this particular Google employee was one who helped seek talent at my college. The downside is, I have somewhere around a 2.6 gpa currently, and this Google rep asked for my resume and transcript. I know for a fact that I am not qualified for Google. There's just no chance. They've shown up for recruitments and stuff on campus, and I'd frequently not even go to them because I know there's no chance. But now, I have an email from an employee, specifically addressed to me. I had resigned myself to the fact that I would not work at Google. Resigned probably isn't even the correct word, that implies that I was upset or something by that fact, when I wasn't, because the thought hadn't even crossed my mind that I might. But now, I have this opportunity literally with my (user)name on it. This isn't something I can just ignore, but at the same time, I know I'm going to be crushed. I'm sitting here with this false hope, wondering what kind of scenarios would lead to me landing a job with them. I just don't know. I don't know if I'll graduate, I don't know if I'll get a job without a summer internship, I don't know if I'll get a job with Google, I don't know if I'll get a job period. Now, I'm a huge fan of the phrase ""It could be worse"", but I've had to pull a series of all nighters recently to try and get my project and my labs and my homework and everything sort of caught up, and my mind is going to bad places. Just this overall feeling of hopelessness, like nothing really matters. I just want everything to end. Not in an ""I wanna die"" kind of way, but I want everything that's currently stressing me out to go away. And I know they will in due time, but that doesn't help me now. My mind just won't shut up about how I'm not good enough, have never been good enough, and will never be good enough, for literally anything. Anyways, I'm gonna drink myself into a coma and hopefully shut said mind up for a little while so I can hopefully fall asleep. I've gotta be up in a few hours so I can go back to work, which means I can't have my brain keeping me awake by telling me how useless I am. Sorry for the wall of text, I hope you reading this is having and will continue to have a good day :D"
4vy4ho,0,2016-08-03,"Me [20M] and fellow intern [20F] have been hitting it off, but she has a boyfriend.",NotBecauseItIsEasy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vy4ho/me_20m_and_fellow_intern_20f_have_been_hitting_it/,"I met this girl a couple weeks ago who is also an intern and we've been hanging out almost everyday after work. She always tells me I'm fun and also, after the first time we hung out she texted me afterwards and told me she thinks I'm really attractive.


I asked her if she had a boyfriend and she kept trying to dodge the question. Eventually, she told me she does have a boyfriend and that she's at a turning point in that relationship and she has to decide if she wants to continue with it or not. I figured, ""alright, I can still hang out with her, but don't do anything more than that.""


I really want to kiss her so I asked her yesterday about things with her boyfriend so I could find out if I had the green light or not. She said she sat down with him over the weekend and spoke. She didn't give me many details but she told me they both ended up crying (not sure what that is supposed to mean) and that they haven't officially ended it. She told me that they've been together for almost 2 years and that it's her first relationship. So I can understand that it's hard for her to decide if she wants to breakup with him.


At this point, I'm pretty sure they're going to eventually be done for, but I don't know how long it will take for them to break up. Today, after work, I'm taking her to a museum and to a restaurant she told me that she really wanted to go to. Our internship ends Aug 19th so I don't have a lot of time to work with, but I have told her I still want to hang out after our internships end. She said she'd like to as well.


All signs point to her liking me a lot and wanting to be with me. But I think she is too afraid to end her relationship with her boyfriend (when I asked her about him, she complained about him a lot). At this point I figure I'll continue to hang out with her until our internships end and after that.. who knows?


Does anyone see any problems with what I am doing? (Mind you, I haven't felt this way about a girl in a while and I would like to continue seeing her). I'm open to any and all suggestions.


UPDATE: Thanks to /u/hip2clip, /u/NoahtheRed, /u/Equipmunk, and /u/Dmne14 I came to my senses and sent her this text:

 ""Okay so you're going to hate this text.

I've done some thinking and I am wondering if we can postpone our plans tonight. I'm not doing this because I'm mad or anything, but I'm doing this because you're going through a lot with your boyfriend right now and I know that it's hard for you to figure out everything that's going on between him and yourself. I definitely want to hang out in the future because I REALLY enjoy being around you. However, I feel like I'm becoming someone who you're keeping on the back burner and that doesn't make me feel so good :(

I also want to do this out of respect for him because, well, he's your boyfriend and he doesn't deserve another guy taking his girlfriend out to dinner. Proverbs 6:32-34 says ""The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He who would destroy himself does it. Wounds and disgrace he will find, And his reproach will not be blotted out. For jealousy enrages a man, And he will not spare in the day of vengeance."" I will not become a guy who disrespects a girl's boyfriend and I also don't want to get in the way of what is going on between you two. I really want you to figure out what you're going to do with your boyfriend. Whether you decide to stay with him or not, I'll accept it. Everything happens for a reason and the big man above has a plan for us all.

You're extremelly enjoyable to be around, and like I said, I wish that we can hang out when all of this is figured out. It hurts me to say, but until you make a decision with your boyfriend, I don't think we should be hanging out.""

I'll let you know how it turns out.

I apply anyway but it really just has me wondering whether there's a larger demand for experienced devs (even with just 1-3 years) vs the amount of new/entry devs available with more than likely 0 years of experience minus a possible internship. A search for entry level jobs usually yields a much smaller pool of listings which echos the whole ""nobody wants juniors/entry devs"" mentality that I see a lot of people on here say companies have. Overall I guess my question is is the terminology changing a bit or was I just off with my mindset that junior and entry were at times interchangeable? Are you entry with 0 years and junior with 1-3 years ?"

I'm working on creating a part list for a cluster node.  I would like to build 3 or them, for the cheapest price possible per node.  each should use an ssd for boot, and I will add a raid card in eventually to drop a couple 2tb hgst ebay drives into each node for storage.   I need only pcie slots on the mobo, no pci.  I need at least one x16 size pcie slot.   2 x16 slots and an x1 slot would be the best, for a raid card, a gpu via riser in the x1 slot or a dual port nic, and possibly an infiniband card inn the last slot.     AMD is preferred, do to price, lower wattage is also preferred since they will be on a lot.

I'm is the US, so ordering parts is not an issue, and I am not against using used parts from reliable sellers.    The case is also not an issue; there's a bargain store near me that sells returned and open box cases for cheap and I plan on finding them there.

The purpose of the nodes is to play around with some clustering technologies to learn, since I'm starting to consider the idea of getting my masters to focus on distributed systems, I'm also trying to get more exposure to a pseudo HPC environment since I will be applying for an internship at my college's HPC cluster later this year; I'm currently a CS undergrad.   I'm also not against using older server hardware if it lowers the price.  

I'm looking more for the cheapest cost per node for the most power per node, without worrying too much about the power of any individual node, since they will always be being used in a cluster.

I've built other PCs in the past and messed around with server hardware, so this isn't my first time building, so I'm shooting more for lower cost than I am for ease of build or simpleness."
4vyou7,9,2016-08-03,My [22M] girlfriend [21F] of 9 months is going travelling for two weeks with a guy I've never met. Do I have any reason to worry about infidelity?,fightmilk94,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vyou7/my_22m_girlfriend_21f_of_9_months_is_going/,"Hey /r/relationships. Let me preface this with saying that I'm a pretty anxious person so I have no idea whether the things that I'm feeling are justified and I don't want to project my insecurities on my girlfriend without valid reason to do so. I'd love some outside perspective.

I've been with my girlfriend for 9 months and we have a fantastic relationship. A few months ago she found out she got a place on an internship abroad for 4 weeks in the summer, I was incredibly happy for her and fully supportive of her going. She's travelled in the past, and this is a continent she's never been to before, so she planned on travelling some of it for 2 weeks after she'd finished the internship. Before the internship she had been in contact with a guy that she would actually be working with and they planned to travel together after this - I was always aware of the fact that she was going to be doing this and thought nothing of it...I was actually happy that she wasn't going to be doing it alone because the continent she's going to isn't the safest.

Fast forward to now. She's completed her internship and we've been in regular contact over the four weeks. We've been fully supportive of each other, opened up a lot about our feelings for each other, and made a lot of time for each other in the sex department (i.e. regular Skype calls, dirty talk, talking about how great it's going to be when we're back together). I feel like the distance has made us closer than we've ever been and made us realise how much we actually mean to each other.

My anxiety began on Monday just before she set off to travel. We were messaging all day pretty much, but I haven't been able to get this out of my head. She messaged me saying:

&gt; It means a lot to me that you've been so supportive of me being here and put the trust in me to let me travel with a guy you've never met haha, don't think a lot of people would do that and I appreciate it 😊 you know you're the most important thing in my life so it's very reassuring knowing you're going to be cool with me being a bit distant the next couple weeks - but I'll do my absolute best to be as active as we have been this last month

This honestly had not even crossed my mind beforehand, but since she brought it up I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I replied:

&gt; Yeah well what's the difference between you travelling with a guy or a girl? Hadn't even crossed my mind. I trust you so surely I have nothing to worry about. I've always thought that if (not saying you ever would) anything did happen you wouldn't be the right person for me anyway so it'd probably be a good thing, if you know what I mean?

She then replied:

&gt; and I know…that’s how id look at it too, like if this was reversed and you traveling - but a lot of people wouldn’t. Everyone here has asked me if you’re okay with me travelling with him, and it’s really nice being able to say without any doubt that you are 😊 but yeah I know what you mean, but I am right for you and nothing’s going to happen, but I know you know that.

The last message started to make me worry a little. Like, the fact that people were asking her if I'm cool with her travelling with a guy I've never met. Would this be a thing that people are normally concerned about? Like, should I have a problem with her doing this? 

I trust her completely because we love each other, have a great sex life, and an overall fantastic relationship. But reading that has started to make my anxious mind worry about things that I've never worried about before so I'm a little stressed at the moment. 

I could use some advice/perspective from someone who's not as anxious as I am and maybe has some experience in the area of partners travelling away. Do I have any reason to be worried?

I've gotten tons of compliments on it at work, but I was careful to do it once I'd gotten a good feel for the place. It's a space startup, so I really just fit right in with it.

I'm almost done my internship now, and have nine months of school after this before I graduate. I'd planned to grow the undercut out back to my regular pixie before job interviews... but now I'm in love with it! It's a big confidence booster and I like how it looks kind of badass-engineer-y.

So, I need some honest advice. Do you guys think an undercut would be an impediment for a woman interviewing for SDE positions in Seattle? I don't see myself interviewing anywhere super corporate, but I don't want to limit myself too badly over something frivolous, either.

I'm wrapping up an internship at Analog Devices, and it's got me feeling pretty neutral on the industry. Everyone in my team is just on Cadence all day (besides a couple Verilog guys). Friends who work at other companies confirm it's the same elsewhere for design folks. At school, I just spend all my research time in front of Cadence. I know I'm spoiled with all the new pretty GUI's available in other tools, but Cadence really is just a chore to use and look at. For people who are A/AMS designers, is that all I should expect to be doing in my future? Additionally, if my first job was in something slightly higher up the chain (board design instead of IC design), would it be possible to go back to IC design or would it be difficult to transition back?

Been seeing lots of pessimistic posts here and /r/ece, so I just wanted to get a quick reality check. If an AMS design gig's future is just 40hrs Cadence + bonus close to tape-out, that doesn't sound too fun to me.

The school that I am attending does not have a finance or accounting program so I can't add one of those degrees to my current one. I realize that I will most likely need to achieve another degree. The real question is should I pursue another undergrad degree or go for a masters? And with the education background that I already have, would it make more sense to go for accounting or for finance? Below is a rough description of my educational background.

International student here at the UW (go huskies). Majoring in EE and this upcoming year I will be doing my (apparently) last year, so I will be taking thethe embedded systems class.

I keep hearing people say (or I read it) that ""if you do embedded systems, you will for sure get a job"". However I see my classmates in embedded systems NOT get internships in the summer, or I see others getting a job as a software engineer after they read ""cracking the coding interview"", that is, they end up doing what someone with a CS degree did, not too related to embedded.

I see most of CS majors getting jobs or internships, but I can't say the same about my EE embedded classmates.

My question/post may be vague, as I am wondering various things. How true is it that it is very easy to get a job in EMBEDDED? (assuming I am able to graduate this upcoming year)

Also, the UW EE program is supposed to be prestigious, but I personally think it is not that great. There is only one class in embedded called ""intro to embedded systems"" EE 474, and then there is the ""senior capstone"" class in embedded EE 475. I feel like there should be more classes for something you want to specialize in??

Here is the website of that EE 474 class, could you guys take a quick look at the labs and just let me know if you guys feel the labs are very well preparing me to get a job?

https://class.ee.washington.edu/474/ecker/

Do you have any general advice so that I can get a job after I graduate? My situation is somehow pressing, if I don't get a sponsorship from a company after I graduate, that means I will have to leave the country and go back home, which ideally, I wouldn't want to.

any advice/thought is welcome"

I have to come up with  ~30k by August 19th to pay tuition fees for the fall semester.

For the past two years my EFC has been 0, which has gotten me about ~$20k in aid, and I've made up the rest with outside scholarships and part time work. The problem is that this year, my EFC has suddenly shot up to 25891(?????), because my dad net a minuscule raise, so I've lost Pell Grant and Cal Grant A. Additionally, since one of the outside scholarships is tied to EFC, I've lost that as well. It gets even worse since I was extremely stupid and assumed that my EFC would be 0, signed an agreement for an expensive apartment, and didn't check the FAFSA website so all the appeals periods are over.

Now, I think I have two options: I can get a private loan, or I can take a year off to work an 6 month internship with Bosch which would get me I think around ~$15k before taxes, and then just work for the other 6 months. If I do take a year off, I'm not sure how I can back out of the apartment lease since I've already signed it and paid the deposit.

Here are my questions:
Should I do the internship &amp; part time work or take a loan and continue college?
If I take the loan, is it possible to get a private loan without a cosigner because money is a sensitive topic?
If I take a year off to work, will they raise my EFC, resulting in even less aid when I return?
How do I lower my EFC so that I can get some aid for next year?

Thanks in advance for all your help!

4vzzy5,29,2016-08-03,How to get into mining (US),NV_Geo,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/4vzzy5/how_to_get_into_mining_us/,"**Overview**

*Edit: It might also be somewhat important to add due to the nature of some geology students.  You get drug tested in mining.  The pre-employment drug test is a hair test, at least in every instance I'm aware of.  I was also randomly drug tested (UA) 3-5 times a year.  If you're still smoking weed, knock it off or you definitely won't get hired.*


In the United States, the majority of mining that takes place will be metal mining as well as aggregate mines.  Many of the aggregate mines are operated by small mom and pop companies though there are some large companies that also mine these deposits (CEMEX, CalPortland).  Coal is also obviously mined, but as far as I know, few geologists work in coal mines.  Generally speaking, coal deposits aren’t very structurally complex and coal is pretty obvious to identify so a lot of that work is done by mining engineers.  It’s not too difficult to model flat, stratiform deposits.  I believe there is a coal geologist in this sub so perhaps they could shine a little light on that industry.
___

**What kind of work can I do?**


Work as a mining geologist can be separated into two types: production/ore control and exploration. To work in mining all you need is a BS, though an MS would be beneficial when prices drop and they need to lay people off.  Also when the markets are down, having an MS is helpful since they can be more picky.  Production/ore control will be more boots on the ground geology.  You will go into the pit or go underground and do mapping, collect drilling samples for assay and possibly refining ore models.  Exploration geologists who work at the mine site will do near mine exploration and help design drill programs, manage drill rigs, and do geologic interpretations.  During the drilling season, you may spend 90% of your day outside.  During the off season, you will be in your office all day.  You usually work 10 hour days and work some sort of X days on, Y days off.  These range from 4/3, 5/2, 8/6, 10/4, 14/7, 21/10, etc.  Typically, the more isolated the mine is, the better your schedule will be.  If you want to work for Rio Tinto in Salt Lake City, you’ll probably work M-F.  The Pogo Mine in Alaska is a man camp and have a 4 weeks on 2 weeks off schedule, last I checked.

The other type of work you could do is working with a small exploration outfit.  These companies are usually funded by some larger mining company or VC and the work is highly specialized.  You pretty much need at least an MS with an economic geology focus to get this work.  I know one guy who got in with one of these companies with a BS but he was laid off pretty much the second prices fell and now does work as a programmer.  They are highly competitive and pretty rare.  You need to know someone.  Another important thing to consider is that when prices do drop, exploration is the first to go.  Production/ore control is a little bit more stable.
___

**What should I study?**

You definitely should take some economic geology classes if your university offers them.  Ideally, working with your university’s economic geology professor would produce the best results as they are likely tied into the industry.  If that is not available to you, take all the petrology, mineralogy, and structure classes you can.  Geochem and geophysics (ideally subsurface or EM) are also good classes to take, but these are methods that are used in exploration and aren’t necessarily used as much on the mine site, proper.  If you have to pick one, take geochem.  If you are lucky enough to go to a school with a mining engineering department, take some mining engineering classes.  If you are able, try to learn some of the 3D modeling software that is used in mining (MineSight, Vulcan, Datamine, Surpac).  It would also be good to know AutoCAD and ArcGIS.  If you’re dead set on learning some programming, SQL would be good since there is a good chance you will be working with a lot of databases.  Python would be another good one to learn since you can write scripts for MineSight using python as well as general data manipulation.  I don’t know too many people who actively program but it’s a valuable skill set nonetheless.
To supplement this, I would read a couple economic geology papers.  Most of the biggest mines in the US are porphyry Cu +/- Mo, Au, Ag, and Carlin-type gold deposits.  Dick Sillitoe has a few papers on porphyries that are very comprehensive.  Greg Arehart and John Muntean do a lot of work on Carlin-type deposits.  Check them out.

When I went to career fairs in the height of the mining boom, some companies (Freeport) wouldn’t even look at your resume unless you had a &gt;=3.5.  Make sure you keep your grades up.
___

**Grad Schools for Economic Geology:**

I would say the best two would be the University of Arizona and the Colorado School of Mines.  The University of Nevada-Reno is also a good school with close ties to a lot of the gold mines in Nevada.  There is also Missouri S&amp;T and the South Dakota School of Mines.  Most of these schools are out west, since that is where most of the mining is taking place.  Arizona and CSM are super competitive even in the best years.  UNR is a little more relaxed but with how many people are going into grad school because of the industry, spots may be competitive.  /u/milker12 has a good post about grad school which is worth checking out if you’re interested.
_________
 
**Where should I look for jobs?**

I got my job through working with my economic geology professor.  Networking is best.  Unfortunately, mining doesn’t have an AAPG equivalent meeting for students to go to.  You could try going to the Geological Society of Nevada annual meetings in Reno, but there is absolutely no guarantee especially with the current market.  SME is a pretty popular mining related group which would also be a good opportunity to network although their membership is focused more on mining engineering.  SEG (economic geologists, not exploration geophysicists) could also be another group to look into.  Their meetings are usually in some place ridiculous like Peru.  I’ve never been, so I can’t speak to what it’s like.  Canada has PDAC once a year, which I guess is close to AAPG for mining but I’ve heard it’s pretty scarce as of late.  Also, unless you’re able to work in Canada it may not be helpful to go.  Failing all that, your best bet to get into mining would be to get an internship after your sophomore year at one of the big mining outfits in the US.  These include:

[ASARCO](http://www.asarco.com/job-opportunities/) (copper. Tucson.)

[Freeport McMoran](https://www.freeport-mcmoran.jobs/category/geo-sciences-jobs/487/6199/1) (copper and moly. Arizona and Colorado, respectively. The moly mine in Colorado is very close to shutting down.)

[Barrick](http://www.barrick.com/careers/) (Carlin-type gold. Nevada)

[Newmont](http://www.newmont.com/careers/) (Carlin-type gold. Nevada.)

[Rio Tinto](http://www.riotinto.com/careers/available-jobs-3141.aspx) (Bingham Canyon. Utah.)

[Rosemont Copper](http://rosemontcopper.iapplicants.com/) (Tucson) would be another to look out for but they have been in permitting hell for 10+ years.

Since ASARCO and Rosemont are in Tucson, you'll be competing with Arizona grads who are top notch and local.  These may be tough to get.

There are a few mining companies that operate in Alaska that may be worth looking into but these positions may be super competitive or only available to people living in Alaska.  When metals pick back up, positions may be easier to come by.  These are almost all gold mines.  Companies I would look into would be: Sumitomo, Kinross (they also have a property in Nevada), Couer (they have a property in Idaho), and Teck.  Alternatively, you could do a google search “mines in [state]” and try to find out who operates them.
For general mining jobs I also periodically check careermine.

**Is mining dangerous?**

Yeah it is. But so is driving to class every day or getting out of the shower or hiking.  There is inherent risk involved with everything that you do.  Last year in metals/nonmetals, there were [15 fatalities](https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports).  Safety is a huge aspect of mining and it’s something that is drilled into your head every single day.  I never once felt unsafe in any situation while working, and if at any point I did, I was encouraged to stop work.  Most large mines share this same philosophy.  (My mom freaked out when I told her I was going to work in mining.  Since she grew up in the coal boom of Pennsylvania she thought I was going to die.  I just wanted to add this bit in case anyone else felt the same way.)

Recently, she has been spiraling out of control a bit. Luckily with lots of intervening from her parents, she graduated high school a couple months ago. H is just barely 18 so she still lives at home, is trying to hold down a part time job, and has no drivers license (doesn't care and failed the test). She has been disappearing for a couple days at a time, coming home plastered (still underage,) has taken up smoking cigarettes and weed (she is not legal for either in her state,) misses all sorts of commitments, etc. 

She also has major anger issues. My aunt and uncle are pretty mellow people and are terrified of her because she flies off the handle out of nowhere, yelling and swearing at them. She lashes out, says terrible things about both of her parents and her brother, then storms out of the house and refuses to answer the phone. 

H has very low self esteem and constantly talks badly about herself. She mentioned to my mother while my parents were visiting last month that she ""never wants to have any kids because she doesn't want to pass any of herself down to anyone."" Her parents have had such a hard time dealing with her craziness and taking sides / trying to help her different ways that they separated for about 6 months. She knows she's the reason and blames herself for their marital struggles. 

She also has the good ol' family anxiety that I have as well. We have talked about it before many times, but it's obvious that while I have managed to find healthy ways to manage mine, she is seriously struggling with hers. Maybe I can help her learn some coping skills? 

Short story long, she is coming to stay with us for the time being (at least for the rest of August.) I spoke with my aunt about it before even talking to H to see if she thought it was a good idea and if it would help their family. My aunt seemed so relieved that I offered and says she really thinks it would help to get H away from her shitty friends and away from their town for a while. My husband is completely supportive, my parents and grandparents live nearby as well and have offered to help out if I get overwhelmed, and we are in a good place financially to have another mouth to feed, etc. 

Flights are scheduled and the guest room is all prepped for her. The question now is, how do we best help her? H and I are very close, she has always looked up to me and loves hanging out with me (I have taken her on camping trips, to music festivals, etc with no problems - I think she stays on her best behavior because she thinks I'm ""cool"" and wants me to continue to bring her along.) 

I work part time in a really casual environment, doing cool things in the community development field. I plan to bring her with me to work in the downtown area my office is in and she can help me out like an intern as well as explore downtown. Not sure if she'll want to do local museums, concerts, and other stuff in the afternoons and evenings but I'll definitely offer lots of ideas for clean fun while she's here. 

I don't want to parent her, as I'm only 4 years older than her and that has never been my role in her life at all. But I also don't want to enable her or not make a difference. My husband is totally on board and willing to help however he can. We have already agreed to hide our alcohol and not drink while she's here, but what else is smart for helping a troubled teen straighten out without making them hate and rebel against us too? 

---   
**tl;dr**: My ""rebel"" cousin is making her parents miserable and making shitty choices at home, so she's coming to live with me and my husband for at least a month. How do we make a positive impact, make her comfortable, help her straighten out, etc without making everything worse? "
4w073u,6,2016-08-03,"I [22 M] broke up with my girlfriend [25 F] for the third time, but I feel so guilty because of complicated circumstances.",SaulMcgee,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4w073u/i_22_m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_25_f_for_the/,"So I [22 M] broke up with my girlfriend [25 F] again but having feelings of guilt. Now I know what you're thinking, probably seems obvious not to stay together right? Well let me lay some details on you. Throwaway account because of personal details.


We met two years ago at MTV when I was an intern. We clicked pretty well and we started going out casually for some weeks before she informed me she had a medical condition. This condition, which is not well understood by the medical community is TMAU, or Fish Odor Syndrome. Basically she can't eat most food because it causes her to smell, but only some of the population is genetically disposed to smelling it. It's easier to say all the things she can possible eat, than to name all the things she can't. Carriers of this syndrome are often bullied and subject to depression, anxiety, and paranoia simply because of how other people treat them when they realize they exude a smell. The condition is so bad that some people who suffer from it consider death a better alternative than living a life of constant ridicule.


I'm not one of the people who can smell it, unless she goes very hard against her diet. I used to have depression myself but quit antidepressants and have been doing much better since. Because of this I have a sympathetic place in my heart for anyone struggling emotionally and mentally. I felt such pity for her that I wanted to protect her and care for her. I want her to feel better and if possible, work on treating her condition so that she can eat normally again. However with the rarity of the disease and the possible multiple causes of it, it's pretty much an impossibility for it to be cured with present medical knowledge. Knowing this, I still entered into a relationship with her.

We dated for a long time, long distance through skype because I'm still going through college in Boston and she was working at MTV in NYC. I made a lucky break in LA and I'm now working in the animation industry. During this past year we broke up twice. The first was because I was having a mental stress breakdown skateboarding to work everyday in LA summer (I didn't have a car or AC at my apartment) + being threatened with eviction for illegally subletting + trying to plan her move out to LA. She came back to me after the first breakup but with such a different energy, I thought that she was making huge progress with her mental health. In addition I was in a much better place with my living situation and work, so I figured I'd give her a second chance. The second time we broke up was because she was taking so long to move out to LA that I didn't know if she was seriously committed. I was consistently offering her financial help to make the move faster but she was refusing it. I doubled back on that decision though because I acted out in an irrational way that I knew was my depression breaking through. Finally I got her out to LA this past July and she's been living with me since.


Understandably there were ups and downs from such a huge jump in the relationship but I feel like it was for the best to find out if the relationship would work. Now, I don't know if it can. The issue is, the health condition and the mental quirks she has are becoming irritating to accommodate. I consider myself very patient now (I wasn't when I was depressed) but whenever I bring up any issues I have with her behavior, be it her short attention span, or quick judgement of people as threats, lying frequently to avoid consequences, and her sometimes cold responses, she doesn't want to hear how I feel. A lot of these things reminded me of my old depressed self and so I feel like I could help change her perspective on them, but she's so adamant in being the way she is. She'll tell me that she has trouble making friends, and she partly blames her condition and even herself and it just makes me want to help her. Even though it's sometimes painful, I think to myself, if I won't be there for her, who will be? I think this is where the feelings of guilt come from. 


On top of all this mental stuff, I feel like she's one of the few people I haven't scared off despite all my weird past mistakes. She dealt with the fact that I used to be a drug dealer, and I tried to get her involved so she could make extra money. That went badly and now packages that are mailed to her have holes in them (presumably because a government agency is checking to see what's inside.) I feel responsible for this fact. She's also complacent with the fact that when I was depressed I used to attack and strangle people in angry outbreaks. Now I try to be as pacifist and cool as I can be because I hated what I was becoming. I bring up these facts to anyone I get close with because they're things I don't like about myself and I need to remind myself about them so I don't fall back into those bad patterns. I'm scared I won't find someone who will understand that like her.


---   
**tl;dr**: I feel like I'm guilting myself into being with this girl because of my own past history. I feel a need to be a better person and I feel like being with her helps me achieve that, but at the same time I feel awful when I don't see her own mental/financial/health situation improve and it makes me want to breakup.


I guess I'm just looking for some opinions on the situation. Currently, this breakup seems to be heading towards permanence but I'm still living with her until she can move out."

This post is going to be a bit long, but any help at all would be very much appreciated!

I'm absolutely stuck with picking a college major. I think too many subjects seem interesting and I just can't make up my mind and settle on something. Every time I try and craft an academic plan for me (which usually consists of double or triple majors and minors), I end up going over the unit limit and then realizing that having such a heavy course load would probably make me unhappy, damage my GPA, and take away my free time (which would harm my chance of doing clubs and internships as well). I don't even like school very much. I was always the kind of student who would watch the clock to see when I could leave class, and I really don't like the emphasis on test taking in college (though I do really appreciate how the structure of a class forces you to learn things). A lot of what I know now is stuff I learned outside of school on my own time (example: I like medicine, so I know a bunch of random medical facts and things about diseases). During my first year in college, I feel like I signed up for a lot of classes that sounded really cool and interesting *on paper*, but turned out to be somewhere between 'meh' and unpleasant when it actually came down to attending lectures, taking quizzes, studying for exams, etc. 

I was wondering if anyone here could point me towards some possible majors or careers. I'm open to graduate school, but I would prefer to major in something that can be lucrative at the bachelors level, if I decide that four years of college is too much. 

The things that I'm most interested in and/or already have some exposure to are: 

- Writing (best subject in school) 
- Psychology (especially in regards to emotions, interpersonal relationships, and mental health issues) 
- Persuasive writing, arguing, and making a case for things 
- Medicine (not hard science like chemistry and physics, but pathology, symptomatology, the study of autoimmune diseases, nutrition, environmental impacts on the human body, hormones, etc.) 
- Planning and organizing projects (I really like thinking about the ""big picture"") 
- Collecting human data (did a project in school that had to do with collecting surveys, visualizing the data, and then making assumptions about that data and it was pretty fun)
- Analyzing individuals, situations, and population trends (so sociology I guess) 
- Finding out why things are the way they currently are
- Thinking about the future  

Things that I'm still fairly interested in or find interesting in theory but don't have much experience with are: 

- History 
- Issues of sustainability 
- Budgeting 
- Marketing 
- Politics 
- Video game design (my favorite aspects are the storytelling and the world building aspect - the architecture, landscape, scenery, mood, style, etc. - but I don't have any hands on experience with this so I can't say for sure whether I'd actually like making games or if I just like playing them) 

I feel like I have too many interests and I feel tempted to somehow squeeze them all into a set of majors/minors (because if a skill-set or knowledge about a certain subject can't somehow be shown on a piece of paper, it doesn't ""count"" and will never seriously be considered as anything other than a very limited side-interest). It's gotten to the point where I hate looking at the list of majors my school offers, because too many of them look interesting and I feel discouraged just thinking about picking one and then missing out on the others. I think I'd be most happy just taking a bunch of random classes, but I know that a major like this doesn't exist (and even if it did, it would probably be very unemployable). This isn't even mentioning the fact that being a more humanities-based person, I'm obviously very anxious about the job climate for humanities majors, and therefore feel the need to major in (or just pick up skills outside of school) that tip towards STEM and would help me with finding a well paying job. I've really been spooked by this whole mantra that unless you major in computer science or engineering, you're going to have to fight and scratch and claw for a decent job, and even then it probably won't be in something directly related to your major. 

I'm sorry if my post was super broad. Just wondering if anyone has anything to throw out. Any help would be so amazing. When I think about future careers, I tend to focus less on the career itself and more on ""what kinds of skills/intellectual muscles do I want to utilize on a daily basis?"" I thought I'd just get a broad education that mixes interest with employability, and then cast my net out and see if anyone would hire me, regardless of what the position ends up being. 

Degrees that I've looked at are: STS (science and technology studies), professional writing, managerial economics, economics, sociology, psychology, cognitive science, sustainable agriculture, and design. "
4w07n6,6,2016-08-03,Use money toward paying college or paying off student loans,dave_dz,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4w07n6/use_money_toward_paying_college_or_paying_off/,"Hey guys - quick question that I am trying to wrap my head around (I posted this in /r/StudentLoans but only got 1 response there so I figured I'd try asking here).

I'm going into my Junior year now and I have a few loans from my first 2 years. I had an internship this summer, so I am able to do one of two things:

a) Use my money to pay off some of the previous loans, BUT get a new loan to pay for this year

or

b) Use my money to pay for this school year, BUT sit on the older loans until a future date

Here's what my plan is so far:

Take the subsidized loans being offered, and then pay the remainder with my money to cover this year. Then, use whatever I have left of my money to pay off my older loans.

All of my loans are not due for repayment until after I graduate, so this is all early. I have a mix of unsubsidized/subsidized loans from the past, so I'd pay off the unsubsidized loans first if that was the plan. The ones being offered are subsidized (3.76%) and the older ones are 4.29% unsubsidized/subsidized and 4.66% unsubsidized/subsidized (2 of each).

Any advice is appreciated!

4w0a5k,261,2016-08-03,I vet interns! AMA about how to stand out as an engineering student and get hired,propionate,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4w0a5k/i_vet_interns_ama_about_how_to_stand_out_as_an/,"I seek out and recommend top STEM candidates for multiple internship programs. I've sorted through hundreds of potential hires - some terrible, some fantastic, and everything in between. Since application season is almost upon us, I figured I could provide some advice :)

---

I'll answer any questions I can about resumes, application materials, what it means to ""stand out"" as an applicant, what companies value or don't, how to prepare for interviews, etc... 

I generally work in aerospace (emphasis on space), so can answer more specific questions for that industry if anyone has them.

Disclaimer: My answers come only from my experience witnessing the types of students that are most frequently hired (and succeed in their roles). I do not speak on behalf of the companies for which I headhunt. In addition, every company has their own standards - I will try to keep my answers as general possible, provided that the questions allow it.

---

Edit: I'll be in and out tonight, and will try to answer questions as quickly as possible. Feel free to PM me your resume if you want some outside eyes on it! Also, if you're well-qualified and looking for work in aerospace, leave me a message saying so."
4w0lmq,2,2016-08-03,"Is this ""paid internship"" legit?",sushiandtacos,Scams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/4w0lmq/is_this_paid_internship_legit/,"Hey, so I didn't know where to post this but I've been trying to find my first job and there's this startup company that posted on a website about an internship for college students where I would be working as a virtual financial advisor for high school and college students. This would be a paid internship. On the ad, they had a Google Docs form for me to complete. It was a fairly easy form and it didn't take that long. After a day or two, I get contacted in a group of 4 saying that I got through to the next step and in order to be ""certified"" (They have their own special cerification for being a financial advisor. If you're ""certified"", you can begin your internship), I have to do an unpaid trial period. I have to do work for them before I could get certified and start officially working as a paid intern. Before the trial period, they were asking to do a training on Hangouts with a group a people. Since I couldn't do the training on the day specified, I rescheduled for that next week. I was excited, but part of me had a bad feeling about it. They asked me to, before the training, sign a confidentiality agreement active for the next 5 years (so I cannot give any details about what kind of work I did and how the service actually operates). So I do the training and it was a group Hangouts call. The person leading it looked like they were doing it from some sort of an empty cafe or other public place. It did not look like an office building (the website claims they have their own office located in Manhattan. From what I can tell, they're leasing the space). The internet constantly kept cutting out on the trainer and they kept getting kicked out of the session. So we learn how to work the system. All I will say is that it involves a lot of C&amp;P'ing and a chat-like environment. During the training, the trainer quickly brushes over the fact that after I'm hired on, I need to provide them (in a Password-Secured PDF File) my Bank Acct #, Routing #, type of bank account (Checking/Savings), and name of bank. The trainer brushed over it so fast that nobody could screencap the image or take notes on it. They didn't specify why they needed this information.

So, I spoke with my family. We agreed that after I do the trial period, I can see first IF I get ""hired"" before I take action. So, I do the trial period and I found myself not doing so well. I also discovered that I struggle with working in fast-paced environments. At the end of the trial period, I figured that if I got ""Certified"" and hired on, I'd definitely be suspicious.

They told me they were going to get back to me late *if I was selected as an intern*, so I waited. They didn't get back to me in the timeframe specified so I figured that they probably weren't interested in hiring me and moved on.

Cut to a few days ago and I got an e-mail (in a group, of course. I have never been e-mailed by them alone unless I had a specific question) from them saying that I was ""certified"" and am now an intern. I had a horrible feeling about it as I continued reading the letter. Enclosed was a certificate talking about how I completed my training and how now I'm working as an intern for this company. They suggested I attach that to my resume.

They once again asked for my bank account information (this time, I have it in writing so if I have to report this, I will) but added the e-mail address and the mailing address associated with that bank account, as well as an address where to send the welcome package. Again, they provided no reason why they need this but kept re-iterating that this is a paid internship. They never specify how they would pay me.

The thing about this is that they provide the services for free to their clients. They also offer free food to the clients and they pay all of the interns. On the website, they claim to get this money from selling classes to schools, but I've only seen one group announce that they've partnered with these people. I've done countless google searches on these people and everything online is all controlled by them. There's nothing negative about this company at all, which is why I'm not so sure. There are only 1-10 actual employees working at this company, if their Linkedin Profile is accurate. Everyone else are all interns. I don't know if I should go for this opportunity at all. Is this normal? Is asking for my bank acct #, routing #, name of bank, e-mail associated with bank, mailing address associated w/ bank, and type of bank acct and having me send it in a PDF file to them normal? Is any of what I'm talking about normal? I've been looking for my first job too, so that doesn't help. There's nothing online about it being a scam but my gut feeling is saying ""this is super fishy"". I didn't have any interviews or anything like that. I wasn't even asked about my resume, which IDK if that's normal. Is there anyone who could help me figure out if this opportunity is fishy? I don't want to reject something I'll later regret rejecting but at the same time, something seems off."

I am 17, in an accelerated school with 2 full years of colleges towards my Bachelors in Computer Science. I intend to graduate with my Bachelors by the time I'm 19, and most likely continue to get my Masters since I am ""young."" 
I do stutter, and I intend to get a job in a Software developer/engineering once I am finished with my education. I have never applied for any jobs, or internships as of yet, but I plan to apply for an internship next summer. Besides the dreaded interview process haha, how is being a software engineer who stutters? Does it affect your daily workflow? Do colleges, co-workers, clients care? 

Thank you so much for any information.

EDIT: I want to thank everyone here. I wake up the next morning to see so many comments regarding my question. I didn't expect this many replies, and I am really grateful. The general consensus is that software engineers and other co-workers don't really care, and that is excellent to hear. I guess as adults, they are able to see past this. I just was curious to see how it would affect my career, but now I know that my stuttering shouldn't be a problem. Thanks!"

**I don't want to humiliate guys because of their small penis. I'd rather humiliate a guy who has a big penis and treats girls like dirt because of it.**

----------------------------------

[Kaya](http://i.imgur.com/8PRPVhd.jpg) grew up in the small town of Oakdale, Minnesota. When Kaya went away to school in Texas, she liked to tell all her new friends about how the Oakdale was originally settled by vikings, and that's why most of it's inhabitants were tall and broad and blond. Obviously, Kaya wasn't descended from the same vikings, as she was a tiny redhead. However, that didn't stop her from feeling an immense amount of pride for her hometown.

Speaking of immense amounts of pride, though, Kaya had a rough time adjusting to Texas. Most of the students at her school were locals, and they liked to remind her that ""Everything is bigger in Texas."" In fact, the Sigma Nu fraternity loved to remind girls of the saying, and almost every party they threw used that as their theme. Typical frat boys, right?

Kaya tried to stay away from the greek scene and focus on her studies. She was hoping to land a summer internship as a research assistant for Mrs. Woods, her biology professor. Kaya went to every office hour, asked insightful questions during class, and aced every assignment. So she wasn't too surprised when Mrs. Woods approached her at the beginning of Winter Quarter and offered her the position. She was, however, shocked when she heard Mrs. Woods' stipulation: Kaya would only get the internship if she would agree to date the professor's son for the rest of the school year.

[Chris Woods](http://i.imgur.com/gkWHHI2.jpg) was, in his mother's eyes, a disappointment. He was a senior at the university and he would have failed out at least three times by now if his mother hadn't called in some favors from Chris' professors. But now, with graduation six months away, Chris was threatening to throw it all away again. He was president of Sigma Nu, and the fraternity had been getting progressively worse over the last few years. There had been incidents with hazing, serving alcohol to underage girls, and several unsubstantiated claims of sexual assault. Mrs. Woods decided that the only way to keep Chris from getting kicked out of school once and for all was to set him up with a sweet, quiet, small-town girl who might be able to exert a good influence on him.

What she didn't know about Chris, though, was that the fraternity wasn't a bad influence on him -- he was a bad influence on it. Chris had been the star quarterback in high school and somehow retained all of that ""jock swagger"" despite not playing any sports at university. That arrogance was multiplied 10x by his good looks and dazzling smile, and multiplied 100x by the blessing he had hanging between his legs. Chris, as his fraternity brothers liked to phrase it, could swing dick. His cock, 8.5 inches long, was at least an inch longer than anybody else in the school. Unsurprisingly, he was obsessed with sex, and had no problem finding willing participants since most girls had heard the rumors and the rest were able to catch an eyeful of his bulging shorts whenever Sigma Nu threw a party.

And even though Mrs. Woods was mostly right about Kaya being a sweet, innocent, small-town girl, she had missed one key piece of information. Kaya had only slept with two boys in high school. The first was Eric, her boyfriend sophomore and junior year, who had gone off to Hollywood after graduation to pursue an acting career. The second was Ryan, her rebound after breaking up with Eric. Ryan also went off to Hollywood after graduation. Oh, and she almost forgot about Michael, but that doesn't count because it was on prom night. Actually, Kaya thought she'd seen something on facebook about Michael moving to Hollywood too.

You see, nobody knew Oakdale's secret. Not Mrs. Woods, not Kaya, not even most of Oakdale's residents. But it turns out that about 60% of male performers in the porn industry came from a small county in Minnesota that was centered around, you guessed it, Oakdale. In addition to making the people of Oakdale rather large, it seems the viking genes had also made the men of Oakdale ... well ... rather large. Average penis size in Oakdale was nearly 9 inches, and in Kaya's limited experience, was closer to 10. So when she agreed to Mrs. Woods' offer, she had no idea what a disappointment she was in for. And more importantly, neither did Chris.

---------------------

The age-old tale of comeuppance, an overconfident jerk getting taken down a notch. I feel like whenever I post about size, I get requests from guys who want me to humiliate them and their small penis. But that doesn't sound like fun. I'd rather humiliate a guy who has a big penis and treats girls like dirt because of it. If he thinks that he's valuable just by virtue of having a big dick, I'd be happy to prove him wrong. I also think it would be more fun if Kaya's humiliation wasn't malicious, just naive. Of course, I'm also open to suggestions from you guys based on what you're into!

He has been with me since he was 7 weeks old, but has lived with my parents the past year while I was doing an internship in California, where as part of the living arrangement I was not allowed to bring him with me. 

I returned from CA about 1.5 weeks ago, and he was aloof for the first couple of days, which is fairly normal for him. However, he started running from me and my parents, and spent most of the day under the bed (previously he was very active, playful, and social). We took him to the vet, where he was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection and given an antibiotic to take for 7 days (currently day 5 of 7). He seems to be physically feeling better, but his odd behavior has still continued. He runs away when any of us enter the room, hides under the bed for hours at a time, doesn't play with his toys or with the other cats, doesnt ask for pets or cuddles anymore (he used to be quite the lap kitty), only eats a couple of times a day when he emerges from the bed.  I am getting concerned about this behavior, especially since he will be moving to Philadelphia with me in about 1.5 weeks. Should we see the vet again, or see a feline behavioral specialist? I'm not sure what to do, but it is very upsetting for me."

***Now for my Prefrences***

Originally I had thought that I wanted to attend a mid-size school, but after looking at some LAC in my area (Willamette, Linfield, Pacific, and reed) and doing some research I think I would be happiest at a LAC. I love that I would have the opportunity to get to know my professors really well. I think it would be nice to have a close relationship with the faculty and be able to approach them for research opportunities. I am a little hesitant about how small some of them may be. As a student at a high school of around 2100 students, some schools that are &gt;1,500 I am worried about how small the campus may feel. Can anyone give insight in that?

I am interested in going to a college with a strong campus feel. I want to know I am in a campus, and not just a place that just feels like it is a part of the city (If you know Portland OR I despise the look of Portland State for this reason). I am fine with being in a city as long as there is a distinct campus feel. Having said that, I feel cautious about being someplace far from a city. Having lived 30 minutes from Portland I love having that easy access without being in the heart of it all, so that seems ideal for me. Being far from a city isn't a complete deal-breaker for me if there is still plenty going on around the campus and nearby town.

I also want to avoid any type of commuter vibe a college may have. Right now I think I want to stay on campus throughout all of my undergrad. This ties back into my desire for a strong campus feel. I am a liberal person, but not insanely liberal. A college does not have to liberal as long as it is not conservative, so middle ground places are just fine and I think I would be fine in a more left wing school as well. I am not that artsy but I do not mind artsy people.

I have never partied, drank, or tried drugs. So I don't want to be at a campus where a lot of leisure time relies on such activities. But I do think I want to try it in college so I do want it to exist on campus, just not be insanely prevalent.

I want to be either a psychology major or a Neuroscience major who is on a pre-med track. I know not every college has a neuroscience major and I think I would be perfectly content and happy with a psych major but I do view having a neuroscience major as a plus. Also, I have been studying Japanese for 5 years and I would like to continue that as well. But I do understand that Japanese programs are not nearly as common on the east coast so this is definitely not a deal breaker. I do want to study abroad sometime, preferably in Japan.

Because I want to go to pre-med, research and volunteer opportunities are a must. For this reason, I was originally looking into larger universities. But into my research with LAC it seems as if the approachability of professors for research opportunities and LOR make for a good environment for a pre-med

I come from a very poor background. My family has consistently been below the poverty line. I was even homeless for a period of my freshman year of high school. I don't want to go to an overly preppy-snooty college that has a really strong upper-class presence. I am afraid that my inability to pay for activities, concerts, events and just eating out may ostracize me. Similarly, I would like to have a lot of opportunities to have fun on campus without being a burden on my thin wallet.

Financial aid is an absolute must. I have $0 saved for college. My EFC is 0 so any school that meets full need I can attend. Schools that give really nice Merit Aid I can attend. I think my father will be denied Parent-Plus and I doubt I would be able to co-sign anything with him because of his bad credit. So I can take out $9,500 a year max if the school is not full need. I can do $1,500-$4,000 a year in work study and $4,000 a year in the summer before college if that is a requirement. When I run the Net price calculator for most top LAC it is affordable.

I really want to go out of state. I like Portland, but it is already my city, I want to experience someone else's city/town/state. I have been looking really closely at California. I am very interested in the Claremont colleges like Pomona, Claremont McKenna and Pitzer for reaches. I also think a school like Occidental may be a good match school. I am by no means tied down to California though. I really love what I have heard and researched about schools like Bowdoin, Amherst or Carleton, but I am afraid those schools are too much of a reach.

If you could help me pick schools that you think would be a good fit that would be amazing, Thank you!

4w20wn,3,2016-08-03,I'm really scared and depressed,EuphoricXO,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4w20wn/im_really_scared_and_depressed/,"I wish someone was here to listen. I don't know who else to turn to, or if you have some insight for me but I feel really depressed. I have this feeling of sadness in my chest and doom and it's not going away.

I am 25 years old and I live with my Mom and step dad (she's financially stable to I choose to stay with her for education). But I feel more comfortable with my Dad for anything. All my childhood wasn't great because of divorced parents I went through a lot of emotional stress and verbal abuse.

Right now, basically my Mom's second marriage is most likely going to fail and she's already talking to some dude from what I can tell and plans to bail in 2-3 years.

She's also forcing me to and questioning my love life. I am from India, but I'm Amerianized, but she keeps asking me about getting married and if she should look for someone and I said ""No"". I would honestly be happy living by myself, I don't need someone just to have someone and if the girl is right then sure.

I said no, and she gives me this lecture like I'm a disappointment and failure and that everyone in our family is settled down and married and I'm the only one left. That's not where my values lie, I don't care if everyone is married and I feel like she's sort of pressuring me to do so and to escape I need to be on my own.

I got a lecture today that, I need to get my shit together. I have been trying. After high school, I went and go my Associates and took a year break because of family issues at home. And she's telling me all this things about, what are you planning to do? 

Asks me why I don't go out, look, I don't have a lot of friends, I have 2-3 good friends and that's about it. I have trouble making new friends because I feel nervous when talking to people and it also hinders my chance to make networks or make a good impression. I am not rude, I'm just quiet I guess.

So, last summer I worked at a grocery store until February, but I left because Finals and work were too much. This summer, I'm home and she's telling me she's tired of seeing me home, honestly she encouraged me to quit the job.

So now I'm back in College getting my Bachelors and I am scared to death of what I'm going to do when I graduate in the summer of 2017. How am I going to live, move out, build my own life? I don't want to be here, I want to feel free.

I'm really afraid I will not get a job or internships or how will I when I have little to no experience in my field? I am studying Marketing/PR and Advertising. Or any job for that matter. I'm not a big dude either.

Thanks for listening guys, I appreciate this Reddit. I'm so scared of being homeless.

I gave up on applying to any of the big name companies and instead apply to lesser known/unknown companies, even if the job description is of no interest to me (ie. not being picky at all).
This past year as a Junior, I must have sent out almost 70/80+ applications and I only had two companies contact me about a possible interview. I had my resume looked over several times and personalize my cover letters. I leave out my GPA as well. 

I saw a post on this sub about ""how attractive"" cs 225 is to employers, yet despite having take that class a long time ago, in addition to a whole range of more advanced classes, I seem to have a ~2/80 -&gt; 2.5% chance of a given company ever contacting me after applying. Is this the same for all you other CS/ECEs out there? Is sending ~80 applications and getting 2 interviews normal?

A little background info, My SO has been living in Japan for a year but she just left and is on holiday before returning back to UK. She came to Singapore last Wednesday for a week and I got a week off my internship to spend time with her.

Like they all say, it really never gets easier. It was so hard to let her through that departure gate and even after that, watch her disappear into the crowd knowing that it will be 4 months before we can be together again. On the bright side we have a date in mind when we say ' See you in 4 months ' but it hurts still. The sadness comes in waves and I know keeping busy helps to deal with the sadness but I don't want to go back to being used to her not being here with me. I wish that was the norm instead of having to ease back into the norm when she leaves.

Thanks for reading to the end and I hope all those in a LDR together in person now to treasure every second. Also those who have countdowns before they can be in person again to countdown with me ! I have 4 months to go before I see mine "
4w2h8s,1,2016-08-03,Do I tell my company about my plan to leave?,The-Great-Bambi,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4w2h8s/do_i_tell_my_company_about_my_plan_to_leave/,"To tell or not to tell. I have an annual review, my first one. I also plan to leave in about a year. 

Background: I wanted to pursue a PhD in chemical engineering during college. During my last summer in college, I found a startup in the industry and worked as an intern until I graduated. After graduation, I was offered full-time employment, and over the past year, I've seen the company become increasingly prominent in the industry. Although the company is in the same field, I am not doing work I intended to do. In other words, I am doing more client-facing work than research. All in all, the job has been great.

During my upcoming annual review, I will be offered a raise/bonus and be given a chance to tell my CEO what role I want to be in. However, I am planning to leave for school to pursue my PhD and would start next fall (2017). (I am still in the admissions process). Should I tell my CEO? I know that it's in a year and that my plans may not work out, so I should keep it on the down low for now. However, the job has been very good to me. The work, although not exactly what I dreamed of doing, has been rewarding as it was related to my passion. Also, the people have been amazing to me. As a recent graduate, everyone has given me guidance and has been flexible with me. 

Other than the fact that the people have been great, I may have to go to interviews in the coming weeks. In that case, I will have to come clean and tell them my plans. (Don't know how that'll turn out as well). If I don't reveal my plans now, it may come off as shady. So, should I tell or not? 

I feel like I should tell them because of my positive experience and that I will have to tell soon anyways if I am granted interviews. However, I may be naive here. I also need to consider the fact that if I don't get interviews and gain admittance, it's pointless anyways.

On another note, any tips for my annual review?

Thanks!"

I had a really shitty childhood. My father was really unstable and overly involved; he was so mentally abusive there were times he expected to track my bowel movements. He never left me alone for more than an hour. He was an emotional roller coaster and I never knew where I stood. He explicitly belittled me, telling me my dreams would never come true and everyone would leave me. My mother liked to bitch about how he treated her, but ignored/belittled what he did to me. 

I have terrible self esteem, I'm paranoid, bitter, and as my father always told me, ugly ... I'm getting fat. 

I've lost all of my friends over the years (guess he's right.) I don't know how to have relationships. I'm in a romantic one but it is pretty toxic at times. 

I have been in therapy and it worked to an extent. No insurance right now, and tbh, it just helped me realize how thoroughly fucked up I am ... 

Ironically i am in school to become a therapist, thought I could do something good but through internships it's clear I am not good enough. 

I am so alone and I can't keep trying

I feel so suicidal. I won't but it is such a struggle

I'm ugly, fat, and useless ... I am totally worthless, if I could I would lay in bed and never leave"
4w2l6g,3,2016-08-03,How can I [22F] deal with the jealousy I feel with my boyfriend [23M]?,begginfor-some-megan,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/4w2l6g/how_can_i_22f_deal_with_the_jealousy_i_feel_with/,"I hope this is the right place to post this, and if not I'll post somewhere else. I just need advice from people in a LDR. I was going to use a throwaway for this, but I don't want to wait more than a day, so oh well. 

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend [23M] does fun things with his friends all the time, but not with me [22F] despite me trying to plan fun things for us to do. This causes me to become jealous (and feel a little ignored tbh), how do I deal with the jealousy?

This isn't jealousy about him cheating, at all. It's sort of a different situation. But first, some background on us.

We've been together for the last 4 years (and some odd months) and most of it has been semi-long distance. Normally we've been able to see each other about every other weekend, more often in the summer and around the holidays. There were a few issues about being apart before (mainly communication) and we've been able to work through them just fine. There's one issue that I can't seem to get under control though, and that's my jealousy.

A few days ago I moved to a different state. Now we're a 5-6 hour drive apart and will probably only see each other about once a month or so. I moved for an internship, and I will be very busy these next few months. Currently, I am not very busy so I have a lot of time to myself. I also don't know anyone in this new place so feeling lonely is inevitable. I know I will make friends with my fellow interns, but it's only been a few days so I don't know anyone that well yet. 

Now on to the issue: One of my boyfriend's friends is getting married soon and his bachelor party is Friday night and Saturday night. While FaceTiming with my boyfriend tonight he mentioned that he might not be able to talk much both those days. I told him that was fine (because it is, I don't expect him to keep in constant contact with me), but then he started telling me what they're going to be doing both those nights. One of the activities they have planned is something that I have wanted to try for MONTHS, and I've brought it up to my boyfriend a few times before. Each time he always says ""yeah it could be fun"" or ""we should try it sometime"" but that's as far as those conversations go. 

After he told me about what he was doing this weekend I told him he should let me know how that particular activity is because I want to try it out sometime. He said he would, but that was pretty much it. He continued to talk more about the bachelor party and that's when I started to feel jealous. Most of the time when he's with his friends they'll go out and do something fun, but when it's just me and him all we do is sit around and watch netflix. There are occasional date nights, but he usually gets worried about the cost of something so it kind of ruins the night. I offer to pay for dates too, but he won't let me since I'm not working very much right now. So I tried joking about how I don't have much of a social life right now (because I'm new to this area) and all he said was ""I'm not going to stop doing things just because you're not around."" I responded by telling him that I didn't expect him to stop doing things (but we never do much together anyway.)

My question is, how do you deal with this kind of jealousy? Normally I just keep quiet about it, but it's really bumming me out. I'm not looking forward to a weekend just studying by myself and then hearing all about his fun-filled weekend with friends (which is likely what will happen.)

Also, a quick side note, a few days ago I saw an event on Facebook that's taking place in my hometown in a few weeks. I brought it up to him, saying it'd be fun to make the trip home to attend, and he immediately said ""I should see if [friend's name] is going to that, and maybe I'll go with him."" Which is not why I brought it up AT ALL. So, I'm still a little bit upset about that, but I haven't brought it up because I might not be able to make it back home that weekend anyway. "

I graduate with my degree in CS in 3 semesters. I like that my job is mentally stimulating. I like my team. I would also consider myself a decent programmer and often help my classmates. So why am I contemplating a career change?

On my spare time I volunteer at the animal shelter, go to adoption events, etc. Also, I have a slight interest in science, but I am going to take more science courses next semester to test my interest or dedication to science. Do you see where this is going? I have been obsessing over being a veterinarian. No I don't fantasize about being a doctor or anything. I am in it for the animals, giving back and a physical job. A lot of veterinarians have told me that loving animals is not a good reason, an ignorant response and that the classes are hard and vet school is hard. I find science courses easy compared to my computer science courses and I use to be a tutor in math and programming. I also have a 3.9 GPA. I am not by any means bragging, but it can get annoying to always hear people say how hard it is all the time. And sometimes i wonder if every STEM major thinks their major is the hardest. Anyways, as a volunteer i don't like driving long distances, picking up poop, staying late, etc. but i like to do it for the animals. I know a love for animals isn't enough, but i think when there's something you care deeply about behind what you are doing makes a big difference.

I've read that veterinarians are not in demand, plus I would have to take an additional 4 years of school granted i get in. I would also get a starting salary of about 50k probably. As a developer who would graduate next year, I would make more with no more school. But i can't seem to move past being a veterinarian. It would be a physical, mentally stimulating job, that would allow me to give back and learn about and work with animals and their owners.

I've decided i want to find a position as a veterinary assistant or technician to make a better decision. That would mean leaving my nice paying, competitive co-op. Should i leave my co-op to see if this is for me? Am i being crazy? The obsession has really died down and I am at a more rational state, but it just wont pass.

4w2ove,2,2016-08-04,I'm Entering Year Number ∞ in college. Brief Life Story.,darthredraven,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/4w2ove/im_entering_year_number_in_college_brief_life/,"I started out at 17 dropping out of high school. I earned terrible grades, I failed the 9th grade. So much was going on at home at the time between being physically, mentally and emotionally abused by my adoptive parents I simply did not give a damn about my academics. I'm not a genius, but I'm fairly smart, bipolar helps with flashes of brilliance. It also hinders and cripples progress at times as well. Anyways, by the time I dropped out, I have around a .9 GPA (yeah that awful). My parents ended up kicking me out of the house at 18 and I took all $150 and took a Greyhound to Texas (*thank you manic episode, I appreciate it*). Had no real plan, no place to stay, ended up homeless for six months while I got on my feet. It was around that time I took my GED, passed it without even studying. In hs I payed attention, I just never did my work, I never did find it interesting. I would doodle and have this idea/delusion in my head I would go on to work for Cartoon Network and my super lame cartoon/comic I drew for 3 years would make it big -_- (fyi it didn't).

A year or so later, I decided that I wanted to try out college, not the greatest mindset to have, but being 19 almost 20, I was ready for a new adventure, a departure for being *that homeless kid*. I wanted to be as normal as I could be for being my age. I started out at community college. Low and behold I like it, it's a challenge that I enjoy and keeps my focus. So why haven't I graduated? I can only handle small chunks. Some semesters I can handle 12-15 hours, some I can only handle 6 credit hours. It's taken so freaking long to get to where I am now, mostly unmedicated. I can handle more when I am medicated though. It's just expensive, whole other story though.

I transferred to a four year school from my community college with a 3.5 GPA, I was extremely proud of myself. I'm due to graduate in fall 2018 or spring 2019 with a degree in computer science, and I've worked my ass off to get here. Sometimes I feel like a failure because I shouldn't still be here in college approaching 30 years of age, and other times I think I'm doing pretty damn well. I'm excited to finished, but at the same time that self doubt creeps in. What happens next? I'm so used to the academic life that I've become used to it. Going through internships, job interviews and securing a real job scares the hell out of me. Can I handle to workload? Will I be good enough? Will I crash at the wrong time (as if there's a right time to crash)? Can I handle the stress of being a software dev until I decide to retire?

Is life this scary to anyone else?"

I've been pursuing STEM for five years. It will take me two more to finish. I want to finish, more than anything. But I'm so tired. Is it worth it? Part of posting this is to get it off my chest. The other part is that I need help. Today was a low, low day. I included some questions at the end but would appreciate additional advice, encouragement. Sorry for all the text. This is the first time I've talked about this.

BACKGROUND (relevant details but you can probably skip this)
K-5th: I was homeschooled until middle school. Not sure if this contributed. But I was never in traditional settings where someone would notice symptoms. Homework took forever and I couldn't keep still in chairs, lines, etc. I was a high achiever and loved math. Excelled in academic competitions with other students, homeschooled and traditional.

Middle school: I went to a private Christian school. Homework started taking noticeably longer. Our academic standard was much higher than the public standards. I excelled in math, was highly competitive, etc. I was a very stressed out kid though. I was a perfectionist and would cry when I got stuck on a test. Homework definitely took me longer than the other kids. I thought I was working harder for better grades. I didn't start most projects until the deadline. I struggled to fit in. But I graduated top of my class and very involved in extracurriculars. I've since read about girls tending to overachieve in response to ADHD. This is a time when I also started seeing a therapist for anxiety, mostly over obsessive irrational fears. I was dealing with migraines and insomnia too.

I applied to get into a highly competitive college prep HS. I was told I was wait listed. I found out later that I had been accepted and offered a scholarship. My parents thought it best to let the opportunity pass as they had been worried about some of the bullying I endured at the private school due to racial and socioeconomic differences.

High-school: I started at a public high school. I had too much anxiety to go school by the second week. I could hardly complete weeks of school. Days were interrupted with panic attacks and hours spent in the nurse's office begging my mom to pick me up. About a month in and faced with the option of dropping out as a freshman, my mom took my to a psychiatrist. I later found out that I was diagnosed with agoraphobia, general anxiety, and depression. With meds, I started school again. They wanted me to start math where kids my age were: Algebra. I stopped caring about my homework because I knew it all, and nearly failed the course. But I managed a B by the end of the year. I took one AP English class and pushed as far as I was allowed with Math and science and really excelled in my math classes. I still worked twice as hard as my peers for what felt like the same grades. Didn't join honor society as I thought I wasn't good enough, but I left high school with a 3.8. 


COLLEGE PT 1
I went to an engineering school with nearly full scholarships. It was becoming harder to keep up with my peers and I was extraordinarily ashamed of my skill level and how hard I had to work, but I made honor roll. The second semester, I was raped by an upper classman in my dept. I had already taken on too much that semester (thanks compulsive overcompensation) and everything started to fall apart. I failed and dropped some courses classes and lost my scholarships.

I took a math and humanities class in my home town to try to get my scholarships back and aced both of them. (My scholarship appeal was denied because the admin didn't believe I had been raped since I just went to the nurse and didn't file a police report). Then my grandmother and a close friend killed themselves.

I believed hard work and persistence were all I needed. When I started taking classes at my school again, I couldn't do simple things anymore. I enjoyed math my entire life but I couldn't study and couldn't bring myself to do the work. I picked up a job in IT, but my class attendance dropped. I would spend hours staring at a screen, too anxious to attempt my homework. I would stay up late, convincing myself I was getting work done and then end up combatting the anxiety by indulging in my distractions. In retrospect, I was dealing with some PTSD symptoms as well as a lot of denial. After two more years, on and off academic probation, I left.

Then there was getting diagnosed. I had no concrete plan aside from fixing myself. I took on three jobs and found a therapist. I suggested that ADHD might be a culprit. I was open to meds but mostly wanted solutions I could put into practice. Because I was not diagnosed as a child and did well in grade school, she refused to believe it. I hadn't failed enough for her to think it was more than anxiety. My theory was that I had used anxiety as a way to manage it as the ADHD symptoms worsened with anxiety treatments. Hers was that I was trying to score ""meth"" (her words). She forwarded me to an in house psychiatrist who put me on a trial of wellbutrin. It worked briefly, but the next appointment I could get with her was six months out. The therapist continued to disregard my symptoms and emphasized how serious an ADHD diagnosis was but would tossed around suggestions that I was bipolar or borderline (no other mental health professional has ever suggested these to me before or since (She also suggested I just try to being friendly on the bus after being constantly harassed and nearly attacked (I don't see her anymore)))


COLLEGE PT 2
I enrolled in business at a nearby university and looked into getting diagnosed there. It was $300 for an evaluation. I kicked ass anyways and because I was bored or a masochist, went back to STEM full time while working 30 hours/week. Things got harder again. I dropped a class, worked less, got accommodations for test anxiety, kept a good GPA, and had a great internship the following summer. The internship served as a confidence builder and a nice break from school.

This last year I was constantly readjusting my schedule and dropped some classes. After a lot of searching, I found a psychiatrist and was prescribed a series of trial drugs. I can't explain how validating it was to have someone believe me. The trial runs and the end of a two and a half year relationship made for a rocky semester, but I made it out with a good GPA and got another offer to continue my internship. 


SUMMER 2016
In order to progress any further in my track, I opted to take a math class at a college close to my internship. I got permission and was told I could make up hours if needed. I had housing plans lined up since last year. A month before my internship, they fell through. I found a listing and was given a date to move in, after my start date. I'm fortunate enough to have family I could stay with and commute. Then they kept pushing back the move in date, sometimes at the last minute. I was couch surfing and camping and essentially living out of my car for the first month. I started school and was surprised to find that there was an online component. Someone broke my laptop last semester and my spare was on it's last leg. Some nights the homework didn't get in because I was sleeping in my car (something I should have explained to the professor but I still see it as an excuse). My plan B housing fell through entirely. Housing was picked clean and I couldn't afford any of the options. I moved back in with family and took on a daily two hour commute. Which is a huge amount of time to lose with a full time job and a summer class. The internet was unreliable but it was better than nothing.

The busy work on the online portion bored me and frustrated me. If a problem took me an hour to do and I got it wrong, I'd have to do it all over again. My sleep suffered. My school performance was on and off. I failed two of the tests and aced the middle one. I limited my homework time at work to lunch breaks, but it weighed on me and my job performance suffered. I submitted most of my homework late and left the final certain I failed. But I got a B! 

But then there's my internship. Now that class is over, I focus better. But I hardly accomplished anything because I was so afraid to ask questions. A stupid question is better than spending two days doing something stupid, but it's something I struggled with immensely. The project leader seems frustrated with me and won't look me in the eye anymore. I requested a different project initially as I was given the option as the one I ended up being put on was uninteresting and unrelated to my area of interest. It happens. Life's not fair. Usually our end dates are flexible but I pushed to stay an extra week to get more done and was told that they couldn't afford to keep me. Compared to the other interns, no one seems invested in my project or my progress. This could very well be because I didn't ask enough questions.


MY ANGST
Bottom line, my self esteem is wrecked most of the time. My highs make me forget how bad I feel running on no sleep and entrenched in anxiety over the fear of failing a class. As someone who was in an abusive relationship, sometimes school feels like a similar cycle.. After five years, I feel like it's too late to give up. But I'm tired of this. I feel like a fraud and a failure. I'm so bitter at my lost scholarships. I'm frustrated that no one helped me for so long. I'm tired of this pattern of crash and burn and rebirth. I'm jealous of my peers who thought I was overreacting when I mentioned I had nowhere to live. I'm so angry at my situation but I feel like I'm not taking personal responsibility for it. I should be taking better care of myself but I don't know where to let up. My closest friend is my coworker because work and class and homework is all I have time for. I want to cry and I want someone to tell me it will be okay and I can get through it. This is all I've wanted. Walking away the first time was devastating and I don't know if I can do it again. I'd like to think I could get a masters and/or make it in the professional world, but I've become so unsteady since college.

This semester, I will have to take out private and unsubsidized loans. I'm terrified I won't graduate and won't pay it off but I feel like I'm burning out and killing myself by working and taking 18 credit hours. My mom wants me to quit. I can't imagine what I would do after this. I have no money saved up anymore. But I also have a tendency to grind my heels in and I don't know when to quit.


MY QUESTIONS 
Is it worth it to take out the loans? 
Is it worth it to keep heading down this path? What should I change if I do? 
How do I get over that fear of asking questions?
How do I stop feeling devastated over every grade? 
How do I seperate my self esteem from all this? 
If I have to let go of this dream, what's next?
Has anyone experienced a worsening of symptoms after trauma?
I've been told ""fake it til you become it"" so many times. But what if that doesn't apply to me?
How do I juggle more than one thing at a time? (I keep planners obsessively but can't follow through)
Is it possible I'm just plain dumb?
Should I tell my current mentor the real reasons why I'm struggling?
Did I somehow turn on hard mode or is everyone else in the same boat?"

This is my first time on this subreddit. I know there might have been similar situations to mine in the past, but I would like to write down my story and get some specific feedback.

I'm [25/m] lovesick for [25/f]. I got recently got hired to do an internship in Maui for the next year. I will be working at a church doing young adult ministry. Which is all well in good if I hadn't fallen head over heels for my friend recently. Now I can't stop thinking about her.

I have known her for two years. She is one of my best friend's ex girlfriends now two relationships removed. I moved back in with my parents after living in a different state about a year ago. It was during that year that she was dating my friend so I don't know much about there relationship, only that he told me that he never had feelings for her, and was tired of trying to manufacture them. This last year we were in a Bible study together, and I really enjoyed her company. She of course if ridiculously attractive so that doesn't hurt either, but I never thought I would have a chance with her because she is out of my league.

About a month ago I pull into church and park next to her. I am listening the new Jon Bellion album and even though my windows are up you can hear pretty much everything through my car doors. She asked me what I was listening too, and than later when I was at work she starts blowing up my phone, and we text for a couple hours about the album. The next couple weeks we hang out with some mutual friends a lot but we always seem to end up sitting next to each other and talking for the majority of the time. A couple of times she had people over to her parents house, and when other people leave we hang out for a little while longer and talk about books and stuff. Her parents own a yoga studio and she teaches yoga there a couple times a month she started inviting me so I would go.

She took a trip to Thailand recently and while she was gone is when I was hired by the church in Maui. Ministry is my career path and this is a real opportunity for me. I have a BA in Bible/Pastoral Ministry and have had internships in churches before but my current job is working for Costco, and I really want to get going down my career path again. When She got back from Thailand I could tell she was happy for me, she also said that she had a work trip in October that took her to Maui for two weeks. She works in the hospitality business and plans events for companies. We made plans to do the road to Hana together when she comes (and hopefully for me some other stuff).

I have never been good with girls. I have never dated anyone, I've only asked out three girls in my life which all said no The cherry on top is that I have never even kissed a girl before. Now don't get me wrong I'm not undesirable or anything I am tall, muscular, and have a pleasant temperament. I have been asked out by a few girls at different times, but nothing ever came of it. I'm telling you all this because this for me is pretty overwhelming for me. It has been two years since I had any sort of romantic feeling for another person and this hit me like a ton of bricks

I think she might like me, but I am not even completely sure of that. To me she really just seems so out of my league. She had a better job than me. She is hot as hell, crazy cool, and super smart. She will do stuff like give me a bear hug even when I say that I'm too sweaty to touch after yoga, or text me thank you texts even when she doesn't have too, but she could just be really nice. She is really nice to everyone.

I would really like to tell her how I feel. I am thinking about writing her an email after her visit to maui. I would write a letter, but she is moving to a ""different"" different state for two months after her trip to Maui to help he sister who had a OCD who is having a baby, and I wouldn't know where to send it. I don't think I have the courage to tell her my feelings face to face considering that it seems like even if she did like me we have to cards stacked against us. I think that sending her a email would give her a little bit of time to think and respond. 

I would like to move back to where I live now after my internship in Maui, but I also need to follow my career path wherever that takes me, but I would be so down for a LDR if she was.

I dunno guys I am just totally lovesick, tell me what you think?"
4w36kz,0,2016-08-04,What should I look for when searching for an internship? Also where should I look?,link270,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4w36kz/what_should_i_look_for_when_searching_for_an/,"I am going to be a junior at my university this year and I would really like to look into getting an internship or something for Summer 2017. I just got married last year and I figure it would be good to get this type of thing going before kids appear in he equation, especially if i need to relocate. I know it's pretty early to be talking about next summer, but I figure he earlier I start looking the less opportunities I will miss. 

In your experience, what should I be looking for in a CS internship? What types of benefits or pay, or jobs, etc. 

What types of companies should I be looking into? Would it make a huge difference to try to get into a larger more well known company rather than a smaller one that isn't known? I live in Utah, and I know there is a pretty big tech area growing in Utah valley. Would it make much of a difference to try to stay in Utah or go somewhere else?

Also, where should I be looking? Are there any good websites I should be utilizing, or any other methods you have found useful?

Thanks for the insights!"
4w3crq,434,2016-08-04,"[NSFW]You want Professional Development? Here, have some.",MexicanSpaceProgram,MaliciousCompliance,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/4w3crq/nsfwyou_want_professional_development_here_have/,"Part of my awful job includes a KPI for ""mentoring"" graduates from our horrible graduate program.  Let's call it ""Aurora"".  The company prides itself on the fact that these Aurora graduate kids come from the top 1% of students at the top 1% of schools.  Correspondingly, they're the most arrogant little wankers you've ever met in your life, and they think they know everything, even though half of them still live with their parents and have to ask permission to bring a girl home.  Fucking idiots.

*Side note: the only good thing nowadays with the price of oil in the shitter is that the company fucked them all off and suspended the program. Huzzah!*

These kids are different from ~~work experience drones~~ interns in that they've finished college, and I actually have to teach them stuff.  If you use them to get coffee and photocopy shit, they'll complain to the Aurora Coordinator that you've given them useless busywork, and then you're in deep shit.  They also get a say in your performance appraisal.

So, in my team, I get four Aurora kids - three blokes and a girl.  The girl is fantastic - happy to help out, and a fucking Wizard at our horrible document Sharepoint thing.  I would call her the Grand Wizard of documents but some other group stole the name ""Grand Wizard"" so I can't really use it.  She goes to work straight away, and I ended up ~~keeping her to feed and walk~~ getting her out of the shitty Aurora program and assigned to my group permanently.  Shit, I could tell a million stories just about her and our crappy management.

Of the three blokes, one is alright - I rate him as just high enough above mediocre that someone else can take him off my hands.  Number two is an annoying floof that I put up with for all of fifteen seconds (I took them to the pub for an intro thing and he ordered a fucking *mojito*, which irked my sense of a.) people ordering stupid cocktails; and b.) arsewipes ordering expensive shit on other people's tabs).  Just to be clear, I've no issue with gay people - anyone can marry or fuck who they want to marry or fuck - but that camp acting-like-a-schoolgirl bullshit is annoying as hell, not to mention they'd probably throw you overboard the minute you went offshore and called the Toolpusher ""darling"".  Maybe that works in the navy, but not so much in oil and gas.

The other, Tony, is useless as an arsehole on an elbow.  Tits-on-a-fucking-bull useless.  Nobody wants to take him because he's a twat, and I can't shitcan him since he's an Aurora kid and their contracts are one year minimum.

He's also a pest.  ""Wah-wah, boo fucking hoo, I want more *professional development*"".  Fuck.  I've already cut the dickhead papers to go APPEA, AOG and DrillSafe conferences, and he still wants more.  I can't be bothered and I don't have the budget.  I've already explained to him that he's had more time at industry events than most *employees*.

I also offered to take him offshore, but he refused because ~~he's a scared little girl~~ ""it's not relevant"".  Fucking dickhead, you've got a Bachelor's in Petroleum Engineering.  You can't get more ""relevant"" than being on a drilling rig on an exploration well.  But, I can't force him if he doesn't want to go.

Now, getting back on topic.  One of the miserable things about being a ""manager"" is that I have a billion Stupid Fucking Meetings to go to, half of which are ""optional invites"", but you look like a very conspicuous shithead if you don't turn up.  Ops Meetings, QSMs, CQMs, Town Halls, Project Reviews, DWOPs, SCR Meetings, Business Partner Meets, Service Partner Meetings, you get the point.  Complete waste of my fucking time (well, most of them are).

This brings us back to goddamned fucking Tony.  Fucking Tony.  He's an Aurora graduate, so he's protected (by *powerful friends*, Herr Schindler), and I can't use any of my usual weapons such as PMPs on him.  I also can't give him an Ebay A++++ Highly Recommended review to foist him off on someone else because his last appraisal was awful and it would look suspicious, if not completely transparent.  I also need to keep him marginally happy or I'll get a bad review from the intolerable little pissant.

Now I have the miserable little shit in a performance appraisal, and we get to Professional Development.  Out of the blue, I also get a really evil idea to make his life miserable and my life better, because why not?

""So, Tony"" says I. ""I see you've listed APPEA, AOG and DrillSafe "".

""Yeah"", he replies.  ""Those were good, but I'm not really sure how relevant they are to my degree"".

*A little birdy also told me that at APPEA - which costs ~$4,000 to attend - he didn't go to any of the technical papers or discussions, he just hung around the booths flirting with the Little Blonde Things and collecting a garbage bag full of USBs, pens and stress balls.  Useless cunt.*

""True"" says I.  ""It's a lot of technical theory stuff.  How would you like something more practical?""

""I don't want to go offshore!"" he says.  ""I already told you, it's not *relevant* to what I studied!"".

""No, not what I had in mind.  How would you like to be my *personal representative* at some important discussions - looks good on your resume, and you'd see how things are done in actual operations"".

""Sure!"" says he.  ""Sounds good!"".

Fucking idiot.

He signs the review form, I sign the review form.  I email the whole lot off to ~~Satan's Vagina~~ HR.  Now, he's mine.  

First cab off the rank - a half day D&amp;C Town Hall.  Four hours long.  I call Tony into my office.

""There's a chance for you to attend this thing - but it's damned important.  Y'think you can handle it?""

""Oh yeah"" he says.  ""Not a problem"".

Alright.  I forward the invite to him and send my own apologies:

&gt;Please accept Tony's attendance in my stead.  He will be there for his agreed professional development.

Tony is sent with instructions to take notes on *everything* as it is ""critical"".  To his ~~lack of~~ credit, he does 10 pages of handwritten notes, thanking me for letting him attend this ""high level"" function.  I tell him no problem and that he's done well, before throwing the notes in the bin the moment he leaves.

Round Two - Contractor Quality Meeting.  Full day.  I hate these things and treat them with a level of contempt usually reserved for Canadian pop stars.  Tony is enthusiastic.  Good.

Poor kid looks like a wreck at 5.15 when he comes back to my office with another sheaf of handwritten notes.  But, he's happy.  Got to meet a bunch of people from Halliburton and DOF.  Unfortunately for him, he also has a day of his actual work to do as well.

""But-but-"" he starts. ""How am I supposed to get all that done when I've lost two days to meetings?"".

""Well, Tony"" says I.  ""You've got to strike a balance.  It's all well and good to go to conferences and workshops, but at the end of the day the work still needs to get done.  Claire came in last Saturday to finish up her assigned tasks - sometimes you just have to do these things.""

Of course, I didn't mention that Claire came in on Saturday because I gave her two days off during the week to move house, and I her give her a shitload of leeway because she's a lifesaver.

""Did you still want to go to that Risk and Reliability Workshop on Monday-Tuesday?"" I ask.

""Definitely!  It sounds really interesting!""  *no, it isn't - not if you've ever been to one*

""Alright"" says I.  ""I'll forward on the invite.  Just keep in mind what I said about work balance"".

Anyway, the idiot managed to keep this up for about two or three months.  At that point, he was showing up to work looking like one of the zombies from The Walking Dead, though frankly I would rate the zombies as easier to work with because of their superior communications skills compared to Tony.  He bitches and moans that he's being ""overworked"", but nobody cares because he keeps putting his hand up to anything and everything.  He also refuses to give or receive help from others because he's too busy being (as he so humbly put it) a ""high achiever"".

After a while, he cosies up to the Aurora Coordinator and gets approved for a few months of ""stress leave"".  Fortunately, that brings us through to the end of his year and I can *finally* fuck him off.  He comes back from ""stress leave"" to sort out his appraisal and do all the usual housekeeping bullshit.

His final appraisal (copied and pasted) read:

&gt;Tony has shown great enthusiasm for taking on new tasks and tackling challenges, and has embraced multiple opportunities over the past year to broaden his professional skills and experience.  He shows a can-do attitude whenever the possibility of acquiring new skills arises.

&gt;Unfortunately, he has a tendency to take such opportunities at the expense of tasks which are assigned.  This has resulted in many of his normal duties having to be reallocated or carried out by other team members, and while his performance results in learning and development are outstanding, he has missed several important work-related KPIs.

&gt;Therefore, I recommend that Tony should be considered for another year in the Aurora program.  This should not be considered a reprimand, but an opportunity for him to develop the core professional skills of time management and working in a team to complete tasks.  As Tony shows limited interest in field work, his future career may benefit from being placed in office-based positions, such as Business Development or Human Resources.

I got my first interview lined up for Monday, but I don't know what to wear. I have my wife and kids names tattooed on my outer arm so I'm guessing I should go with long sleeves even though it'll be nearly 100 degrees out.

This includes database stuff such as SQL (which I have zero experience with) it's been about a week and I'm starting to feel good about the basic parts and ideas of SQL.

Now to the way over my head part... There are other interns here who are working on extremely awesome projects. Stuff that I wouldn't dream of being able to do.. At least at this time of my life. These guys know so much. Today only I heard them talk about how they are incorporating Unix, SQL, PHP, Java, Python, Apex, Apache Tomcat in their different projects.

How do I become like them? I felt so discouraged! All I know is Java (which I haven't used in about a month), data structures (a bit rusty on some of them), and minimal SQL. 

I'm 20 years old. One of these interns is in high-school and his project is awesome. The other 2 are doing their masters and their project is awesome x10. 

I'm scrambling to learn many things right now just to catch up and I feel so overwhelmed."

I really enjoy programming, and I definitely enjoy learning new things. On top of that I pick things up relatively quickly. 

My problem starts with the fact that I don't have much project experience besides the assignments I received from my classes (mostly due to time constraints). My current portfolio is made up of console applications (C++, C#, Java), some simple games made with Unity3D (C#) and a few personal projects that I started and never finished (for learning purposes). My Database integration experience is lacking, and I'm not entirely sure where to start on that front. 

I live with my parents, and they've pretty much financed my entire college career, so luckily I don't have much school debt. Ive been working part time construction for about four years to help pay for school as well as to have some pocket money. I was offered to work construction full time while I search for programming work, which is what I'm doing now.

I have had two internships while in school, one of which is completely unrelated to anything comp sci. The other was at a startup advertising agency as a web developer intern. I really enjoyed the environment, but one of the biggest problems was that I had no oversight and they gave me nothing to do. Literally nothing. What made it worse was that I basically knew nothing about web dev going in. The person that gave me the opportunity said that the company usually hires their interns (sales and marketing) after graduation, but that they've never had a web developer intern before. I assumed this meant I'd basically be trained for a position. I stayed there for around 10 months expecting some form of training or some kind of project. I got to know some of my co-workers pretty well and they kept hinting at a position (no fault on them that I didn't receive an offer, though. They were just being optimistic.) In hindsight, I should have left when I first realized there wasn't going to be much for me to do. I ended up teaching myself some web fundamentals (JavaScript, html, CSS, Bootstrap, wordpress, etc) and playing around with NodeJS and some JavaScript frameworks. No actual projects came of these things but I ended up teaching myself a good amount while I was there. There wasn't any structure to what I was learning, and I definitely didnt learn enough. Asking for things to do yielded no results as well (before anyone asks), as they would just say ""just learn as much as you can."" If I had the opportunity to go back, I would just look for something else. 

Although my resume/portfolio wouldn't technically be lacking, I don't feel prepared enough to call myself a software engineer. I don't know if I'm just being too critical, but I don't think I know enough to have someone pay me for this type of work. If someone can nudge me in the right direction, help improve my development confidence, or just explain to my what I should be doing to improve my knowledge, I would greatly appreciate it. 

In case anyone asks, I haven't applied to anything yet. I know some of you might suggest that I put myself out there anyway, but I wanted to have something substantial to show before I throw myself into the wild, or at least ask some experts what they think of my current situation.

Thanks for reading!

4w5atk,79,2016-08-04,My [25f] husband [25m] is soliciting sex on Craigslist. Again.,vskc123456,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4w5atk/my_25f_husband_25m_is_soliciting_sex_on/,"I met my husband in college, we dated for 3 years, got married 2 years ago, and now have a 4mo. 

I have a lot of trust issues (something I'm working on) and he knows this. I've had nothing but bad relationships with guys who lie and cheat. My husband was extremely understanding (he was cheated on in his last relationship too). 

When we first started dating I was looking at pictures on his phone (with him, not snooping) and there was a fb pic of a random girl in a bikini. I didn't know her, but he was friends with her. I asked about it, lightheartedly, and he kinda brushed it off. I didn't think too much of it really. 
Around the same time he had me reply to a text from someone for him. I backed out of the message after it was sent and there was one from a number not saved. I asked and again, he brushed it off. Eventually (months later) he admitted that it was his ex. She was asking if someone was still selling weed and said they should catch up. He agreed with no intention to follow through. She didn't live in the same area as us, and wasn't a threat to me. We are extremely different people and I'm really not worried about my husband going back.  


Fast forward to being married, he spent the summer in an internship several hours away. We both made the trek back and forth several times - which is when I got pregnant. 

In the fall when he was back for school I just had a suspicion that something had happened. He was talking to someone or something. So, I snooped. Wrong, yes. But what I found was beyond my wildest dreams. He had been soliciting sex from men on Craigslist. We are in a monogamous straight relationship. With no discussion of ever having any other sexual orientation. He was sending and receiving pictures/texts/emails with some guy. Looking at dates/times (because once you find that you investigate the shit out of it) I was there when he did this. He got out of bed with me to go send photos to another person. 


I have a very high sex drive and have ever since I started having sex. He would turn me down occasionally because (prior to this) I would be happy with sex multiple times a day. Being turned down bruised the ego, but I was okay. And I never turned him down. Until this. He literally left the bed where I was (where we had recently had sex) to go send dick pics to some dude. 


Once I found all that I could I approached him. I woke him up and asked wtf... I was sobbing and felt sick to my stomach. He was so apologetic and swore it never went any further than pictures. It would never happen again. I cried and honestly considered leaving - I was around 3 months pregnant. But I believed him. So, I stayed. 


Baby was born, he graduated, we moved to his hometown. And I started to get suspicious and snooped again. And found that he was once again on Craigslist soliciting sex from men while he was on a business trip. I asked about it last night and he played dumb at first. Then was so sorry and 'doesn't know what's wrong with him' and went on and on about how it will never happen again. He just needs one more chance. 

I feel so repulsed and nauseous. I packed bags last night while he was out (before he knew I knew). But now I don't know if I should actually go. I would drive to my parents house and stay with them for a while. But I don't want to tell them what's happening. I'm so embarrassed. Any insecurities I have had with my postpartum body are now amplified. And I don't know how I can trust him. How can I raise my child with someone who is so untrustworthy and dishonest? Cheating (and I consider this cheating) is not okay - how do I teach my child right from wrong if this is going to be our life? I just really don't know where to turn... 


tl;dr: my husband has solicited gay (not that it changes the severity) sex on Craigslist at least twice and I don't know that I can stick it out again "

My last lease ended and my new one doesn't start for a month or so, so we decided to live together in his house over the summer (his other roommates are gone and have approved me subleasing).
I guess my issue is that I feel a bit smothered by my boyfriend. Yes, we both work, but as soon as we get off work we go to the gym together, make dinner together, watch Netflix together. He's gotten very clingy and he doesn't pick up after himself so I spend a lot of time cleaning up after him. I still feel alien in this house, it is not my house, it's his house and I can't seem to feel comfortable in it.

My question is this: do you all think that it would get better if we lived together in a different circumstance? Like maybe if we moved out and got an apartment together that was OURS and not just his apartment that he's letting me stay in? Is there usually a period of awkwardness and uncomfortableness that comes with moving in with any SO?

My boss and bosses above him all agreed that I would be promoted with this round of promotions but when they took it to HR to put in they turned it back saying I needed to work there for another year first.  They said that the new title needs 3 years field experience, I have 2 years there and two summer internships so 2 years and 8 months?  Now I have to wait another year for my stupid 10% raise and I'll probably leave over it tbh.

I'm also a little annoyed because my boss said ""we're not sure what will happen, I'll send them the info about your internships and let you know"" and then I find out I didn't get the promotion when they released the list of people who did, instead of finding out from him.

I'm already working on getting another job, currently have a promising lead that would be a better title and a 30-40% raise.

Same thing happened to my boyfriend earlier in the year, he wanted a raise and promotion boss said yes and that he was hired a level too low in the first place but HR said 'we have to wait a little longer'.  So he left and got a 50% raise when they could have probably kept him for 10% or 20%.  They even offered to go above his 50% raise offer once he got it but it was too late.

Why do big corporate companies cut off their nose despite their face?  They can't see how competitive our industry is and retain talent?  Meanwhile small companies will move in fast and snap up their talent.

What are my options?,CrystalDream_,PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/4w5pr6/help_what_are_my_options/,"Some context: So I have another year left of school. I will have a double in Math and Physics if everything goes well. I do want to go to grad school eventually, just not yet. I want to try working for a bit first. I don't think I'm good enough, or sure enough to commit to grad school yet. 

My college background is pretty bad tbh. I had some major depression/anxiety issues midway through and had to drop a year and retake it. Before that I didn't really care about school so I didn't do that amazing. Now I am doing pretty well, but still not good enough imo. The problem is they wouldn't let me take one of my semesters off my transcript, so now I have one with withdrawals and one with F's. This severely impacts my GPA and I think it weeds me out from a lot of opportunities like internships and certain jobs.

I am by no means lazy or stupid. I'm pretty sure I've worked harder than most to get around my problems. I am completely over everything, and I have more confidence now, but I don't know where to go from here. I think working for a bit will help even things out and provide valuable experience. I have research experience that I'm still building, and I've been involved in one paper already (astrophysics). 

Most of the jobs I have seen are looking for several years of experience for entry level positions. They seem geared toward specific engineering/CS fields. I think a good start is to learn more programming, but idk what else. Tutoring? I would like something that would let me go to grad school if  I choose later on.

First up I'm really only interested in females, definitely not looking for more than friendship with males. 

Okay, now for the real stuff! I'm finishing up my summer internship and somewhat looming forward to my last semester of college! I took the non traditional path to college and worked for about 10 years before deciding I knew what I wanted to do. I will graduate in December with my B.S. of Computer science. More personal stuff about me, I am fairly geeky in that I like video games, anime, and k-drama. I'm also pretty crafty and have tried lots of random crafts throughout my years. I enjoy hiking and camping and am attempting to get more fit!



I'm not sure what else to say, but I'm an open book so feel free to ask me anything. I'm mostly looking for someone to chat and bond as friend with but if your female maybe something more could develop or not really I'm up for anything no pressure. :)



Feel free to pm me!"

First time poster here.

I am starting as an intern at one of the MBB and I have to choose a practice area of my interest.

I have some ideas of what I MAY like (Financial Institutions and Consumer). But that's just a feeling because I didn't have the opportunity to talk to people from all of the other areas and see how their work looks like.

If any of you could just give me some ideas of how your work looks like, the challenges, the good/bad sides and also the perspective (growing, stagnated, ect) of your practice area, it would be really helpful for me.

I have no real experience in programming other than the ones i took at school and some self taught lessons but i have no portfolio to show off or any codes. And i'm most definitely going to fail any technical interviews since everything i learned was so linear. 

but learning on the job seems like the best way to get real coding practice so how would i go on writing a cover letter about this? 
maybe some examples of similar situation would be helpful

also my major is mechanical and minor in CS.

Hello,

I'm currently going into my Sophomore year at a university planning to get a B.S. in IT with a concentration in networking (which is what I am interested in. Is it a bad idea for my degree to be so specific?) I have been doing an IT internship for the county that I live in for the last few months and it will be ending sometime in September. I also secured a help desk type job (although I think it is a bit lower than help desk? Mainly troubleshooting VERY basic things that aren't actually broken over phone, checking out equipment, etc.) that I will be working while going to school. I'm hoping to stay here for a year or two, hopefully able to apply within to a more advanced position, but I have no clue if it is possible. I am also currently studying for my CompTIA A+ certification, then I plan to get the rest of the trio afterwards. I'm not sure where I plan to go afterwards, but I am open to suggestions from more experienced people. I am very interested in networking and sysadmin type roles. Thanks!"

GPA obviously matters big time for grad school, further schooling, etc. Likewise, it matters for industry jobs as well, but up to a certain point. 

So, I'm wondering if there exists a sort of GPA threshold after which your GPA doesn't *really* matter. Example: After, say, a 3.5 or 3.7 (or whatever), if you don't get a job, it wasn't because of your GPA. Of course, a 4.0 is ""better"" than a 3.8, but is there a point after which it comes down **solely** **to** **your** **experience**? 

A couple of notes: I'm talking about internships and entry level jobs after graduation. ALSO, I'm thinking specifically of business-related jobs, but other industries and sectors are fine as well. 

And please, I'd appreciate if CS students could avoid coming in and talking about how they got jobs with 1.8's. Thank you  :) 


Motivation: I ask this question because I'm considering working part time to amass experience, but don't want to do it to the detriment of my GPA *too* much. "

I've been learning a lot about testing my my internship -- mocha, chai, jasmine, karma, etc. and I'm enjoying it.

During summer, I work as a part-time L3 Sysadmin/Intern at a medium sized ISP company. I basically get assigned tasks or tickets to do that currently nobody has time for. 

It was a quieter day than usual and nobody at L3 had any tickets or assignments for me, so they sent me to L2 to see if they need any help. On the way to L2, I noticed that the L1 interns were doing something with full boxes of Portugal routers that the company bought for extremely cheap. I overheard one of them complaining that they can't get the thing working, so I decided to take a little peek at what they were doing, seeing as I had nothing to do anyway. After asking them what they were supposed to do, they told me that they are supposed to flash new english firmware and upload new configs to them, but they couldn't get past the login screen for a hour now. I took over one of the work laptops and saw a Mikrotik's RouterOS web login. It wasn't accepting the default username and password, so I opened Winbox and tried to connect to the router via a MAC address, thinking that the web interface might be just buggy. While looking at the MAC address, I realized that they're the cheap portugal routers the company bought. 

Then it hit me like a brick.

I immediately checked if the laptop is not connected to the company wifi, and of course, it was. The interns were trying to log into the company's wifi router. 
But wait, there's more!
After disconnecting from the wifi, I was getting no connection to the router. I checked the router if everything is plugged in correctly, and of course, they managed to plug in the patch cable to the WAN slot instead of the 4 LANs, while also forgetting to flip the switch to turn on the router. After waiting for a few minutes, I was still getting no connection. Turns out that they took a patch cable from the recycling bin that was on the ground instead of grabbing one that worked from the plastic boxes on top of the cupboards. After showing them how to flash the routers properly and how to upload the configs, I went to the L1 supervisor that told them what happened. They laughed and since I had nothing to do, I got assigned to watch over the inters so that they don't blow up anything for the rest of the day. 

At the end of the day, we ended up with a full box of reflashed and properly configured routers and around 30 routers that refused to flash (they hard-rebooted when uploading new firmware through either TFTP or web interface) that ended up in a box for RMA.

Last night, after laying out my plan and consulting others for insight for the past couple of days, I decided that:

1. I won't *officially* drop yet, but just go to school part-time online. Having an ""I'm a student"" equipped is a huge advantage when applying to internships.
2. My quick source of income will be interning for the time being while I build my portfolio.

So I've been searching and planning. I found a web development group in my city and called them. I was being honest and told them: 

*""I'm a computer science student working on building a portfolio online. I don't have enough professional experience, so my question is do I absolutely need to have one to be considered for a position as an intern?""*

To which he responded:

**""Nice question...We care about past work and their importance, and a portfolio communicates that. We don't require a portfolio, and most companies don't. With that said, a great portfolio example is ------.""**

*Wait....what the fuck?* That's probably most people's reaction when they hear that, so they'll ask again like, ""So do you want or portfolio or not?""

Usually I tend to over-analyze and complicate things, but most of the time, my intuition (or gut-feeling?) saves me from this. Depending on the problem in front of me, I either run with the solution from my intuition or make sense of it before deciding, ""Yup, this is the best one."" 

The guy I talked to basically told me, ""Even if you throw something together, it's an advantage over having nothing.""

Why ""just throw something together""? Because the portfolio he guided me to was clean and simple. 

This is one of a few sacred advices I've received in the past 48 hours."

I have a job offer for part time at a call center where I work nights. I want to take the job because I have a fair amount of debt and my internship is only paying me roughly 15 dollars an hour whereas call center would pay me 18. I would be working 40 hours at internship and 25 at call center. 

If i could work OT at internship I would but they dont allow more than 40 hours.

At the same time, i dont want my learning to be affected. I would only have maybe 8-10 hours a week outside of work to continue to learn about programming.

I'm finishing up a Data Management internship at a non-profit where I've used Salesforce, Tableau, and Excel. My skills are in their beginning stages, and I'm looking for a place to further develop them. I've had multiple roles in the non-profit sector, ranging from an Operations Internship in DC, to fundraising for public TV. I've also had a one-year campus leadership experience where I had some pretty rad accomplishments.

Please note I lack a degree, and me finishing it (probably online with PennState or ASU) is contingent upon finding full-time work. But for what I lack in a degree, I make up for with a passion to learn and grow :) I have a preference to continue to work in the NGO sector, but am open towards a transition into the for-profit world, especially Sales (which I seem to have a knack for). I'm mostly looking for Business Development/Analysis, Development, Sales, Account Management, or Database Administration. And I come cheap!

Internships are also welcome. I can send you my resume when requested.

4w78iq,1,2016-08-04,Is this question appropriate,StephCurryBrah,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4w78iq/is_this_question_appropriate/,"**TLDR; -interviewed with investment firm -got interview feedback, did well, kept in contact with interviewer -want to email him and ask him what I can do to give myself a better chance at being employed with their firm in the future. It is where I want to work, hands down. Perfect job for me and encompasses both investing and engineering. -is this appropriate**


I interviewed with an investment firm a couple months back and made it to the final round of interviews. Unfortunately, they could only hire 1/5 individuals and I didn't get the position. This was the second time I applied to the company. First time I didn't make it past the screening interview. Messed up. Second time, made it to the final round.

I talked to one of the interviewers at the company and he informed me that everyone at the company loved me. My energy, enthusiasm, perceived dedication and work ethic. He said I had a good resume and cover letter and not to get down on myself. I lost out to someone with 3+ years of experience.

I've kept in contact with him over the last couple of months. Exchanged an email here and there just expressing what I'm doing to better myself, and how much I still think I'd be a great fit for the firm.

My question: can I outright ask him what he thinks I should do to give myself a better shot in the future if they have an opening? I know that staying in contact with him shows some drive and just outright determination that a lot of other candidates might not have shown. I'm hoping this can hep make up for my lack of work experience in the industry. I know it's best to be pro-active and figure it out on my own but I'm at my wits end.

Graduated 2015. Took a break to travel for a bit but been looking for a job for around 12 months. In that time I've passed the CFA level 1 exam and got a lean six sigma certification to boost my engineering prowess. I'm trying here but it's not enough. I've tried applying for unpaid internships as well but there aren't a ton of them out there in the field and if you are out of province it's really hard to get them.

Can I ask this question or is it inappropriate?

Edit: He told me to stay in tough after the rejection and he said he would be happy to help out by giving me advice or anything. If I sent him a well crafted email asking this question, would that be inappropriate? At this point, I have nothing to lose but I don't want to come across as a pest or someone who doesn't know when to get the hint. "
4w7h2m,51,2016-08-04,"Thank you, r/depression",blznbongos10,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4w7h2m/thank_you_rdepression/,"Over two years ago, I wrote a post about my husband wanting to divorce me because he was unsatisfied with my recovery process. At the time, I was scared and heart-broken. I submitted a post here and many of you were supportive and helpful. I took your comments to heart and worked steadily on my recovery. I went to outpatient and I found a new therapist to address my PTSD. I encountered many setbacks like a move, hostile neighbors, and reconnecting with my abusive family, but I continued working toward my recovery. I returned to college, volunteered at several organizations, and set up internship opportunities. Shortly after, My husband decided to resume contact with a troublesome ex, which I stumbled upon by accident. This time, I was okay. I decided to research and file for a legal separation. I had to give  up my summer internships and take on a job, but I adapted well. Two years ago, I thought about killing myself and tried to, when my soon-to-be ex-husband told me he wanted a divorce. Now I successfully juggled summer school, volunteering, and a new job while planning to separate myself from a person who I was once dependent upon. I never thought I was this strong, but coping with depression and PTSD gave me the strength and insight to move forward in my life. 

So thank you for the encouragement and thank you for the posts about recovery and small successes. I hope others suffering from depression or mental illness will find the strength to fight, regardless of the obstacles. Depression was once my constant and future, but now I see it as a illness I can successfully counter and live with. "
4w7i33,30,2016-08-04,Don't Eat the Alien Acid,ThankYouDude,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4w7i33/dont_eat_the_alien_acid/,"I don’t know where to put this. I was downvoted/laughed out of r/LSD trying to warn others but I am also a frequenter of this subreddit so I think it may gain more traction here. I don’t know how to make sense of any of this. I’m going to try and do my best. 


I just moved to Washington DC earlier this summer for a pretty cushy paid internship with a NGO and I had been really looking forward to it. I manage the social media accounts and that’s about it. It’s actually kind of hard to believe I get paid for this. 


Anyway, I consider myself to be a psychonaut. For those who don’t know what that means, it’s someone who explores their mind and the world around them in altered states of consciousness. I am particularly fond of LSD. Because I moved to a new area, I was on the prowl for a new hookup. I hadn’t really reached out to anyone at work for obvious reasons, and I was having a tough time making friends. I went for a drink after work one evening to a bar on M Street. I sat down at the bar a seat away from this couple who were in their mid 20s. Handsome. Dressed a little more bohemian than the typical DC resident. Being that I was alone, I was eavesdropping on their conversation. Much to my surprise, they were talking about LSD. Speaking of micrograms and a step-uncle who synthesized it himself. I decided that this would be my best chance of scoring so I slid over to the closest barstool and they both stopped talking and looked at me.


“Hey guys, I know eavesdropping is rude but it sounded to me like y’all were talking about acid.”


The boyfriend eyed me suspiciously as one might expect


“Um… yea maybe.”


“Well… I uh know that you don’t know me, but I just moved here and I have been searching all over with no luck. I don’t know what your situation is but I would be super appreciative if I could buy some from you.”


He said nothing. His girlfriend was grabbing his arm. I could feel the awkward tension between us, fervently bouncing in the space between our barstools.  


With a nervous chuckle I said “Look, I know this is weird. I should’ve probably started by introducing myself. I’m u/ThankYouDude. I’ve just really been looking for a hookup and I’m pretty desperate at this point.”


“Well, nice to meet you u/ThankYouDude. I’m River and this is Sunshine.”


Although my face didn’t change, on the inside I rolled my eyes. You can never buy LSD from a normal fucking person, can you? 


Well nice to meet y’all. So whatta ya say? I’ve got $40 on me. Do you have any?”


“Yea man I can do 4 for $40.”


A wave of relief washed over me. Finally. 


“They’re gel tabs so they’re pretty strong.”


“That’s fine by me. How do you wanna do this?”


River motioned to the bathroom over his shoulder “In there.”


I followed him there and we exchanged goods and walked out. Quick and easy. I said thank you and tipped the bartender and I left. As I walked down the street I did a little two step dance and smiled. That was much easier than I thought it would be. I got back to my apartment and I was eager to try it. I had never done gel tabs before. As I walked up the stairs of my complex I took them out of my pocket and unfolded the tin foil. They were very small translucent grey tabs, and they had sparking silver flecks in them. Interesting. This looked like some high grade shit. I arrived at my place and quickly entered and sat on my couch in the living room. 


I should preface this by saying that I have tripped at least 20+ times so I was very comfortable with taking two of the gel tabs. I dropped them underneath my tongue, started a timer on my phone, and got up to go put a record on. I chose my new Tame Impala vinyl and then plopped down on the couch again. A few minutes went by. Then a few more. Then the record scratched as it reached the end of side A. I stood up to go flip it and I instantly felt light as a cloud. 


“Strange” I muttered to myself as I checked the timer on my phone. Only 12 minutes had passed and the onset of the drug had already begun. 


I flipped the record and turned to go sit down again. I froze. My couch. It... it wasn’t my couch. I mean yes it was my couch but I seemed to be experiencing some kind of IKEA dysphoria. I looked around the room and the feeling began to intensify. It felt like a slow methodical wave was making its way around the room, making everything I owned unfamiliar and strange.


“This is some crazy shit.” I thought to myself and sat on the couch once again. I looked up and… my TV. It was different. Not like the other things. It had physically changed. It appeared to be about 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide. If you’re thinking about a door, you’re spot on. It looked like a goddamn door. This is when things started getting really weird. I had never felt this way. I was beginning to think something was wrong. I went to the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face. I looked in the mirror. I was wearing a fucking spacesuit. I looked down and it was just my slacks and a button down and loosened tie. Back to the mirror, a fucking spacesuit. Swear to God. This is when the visuals began kicking in.


 I went out on my deck to smoke a cig and relax so I could take control of this trip. I lit one and took a nice long drag and exhaled. I brought it up to my lips to take another puff, and it was done. It was smoked right down to the butt. 


What in the fuck… I couldn’t believe my eyes. I dropped the butt and grabbed for my phone in my pocket. I checked the timer. 45 Minutes. I was stunned. I had just gone to the bathroom and then out for a cigarette. How could I have possibly been 45 minutes into this already? I felt like I was starting to lose my grip on reality. I moved my hand to find my pocket to put my phone back but there was no pocket. I looked down and saw white. I was in a white jumpsuit. A fucking spacesuit. 


“This is not happening…” I muttered under my breath. I opened the door and went back inside. I immediately felt a pull to my new door sized television. I stood in front of it and I swear I could feel myself quite literally being pulled into it. What happened next abandons all logic and reason. I was sucked into my TV before I even knew I was in it. There was no up down right or left. I was practically blinded by neon geometric patterns and nondescript shapes. Imagine that scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Yea. That trippy. My vision started to fade and then I must have passed out, although I don’t remember it. 


I woke up on my couch. I was naked. My phone sat unlocked on the coffee table in front of me. I sat up, and realized I was very sober. My timer read 50 minutes. My mouth hung open. How was any of this possible? It was the strangest thing that had ever happened to me. Then I tried to stand up. I was stuck to the floor. I looked at my feet and screamed. I had no feet. My ankles stopped at the stained wood. I started to cry. I don’t know what this was but it was not acid. I heard footsteps in my room and the hair stood up on the back of my neck. Out walked a black guy in full surgeon’s scrubs. He kind of looked like Gus from Breaking Bad. 


“H-hey man what the fuck is going on here. Who the fuck are you and why are you in my apartment”


He said nothing. He pulled out a syringe with a needle about as long as a middle finger and started drawing liquid from a bottle. I will never forget it. The liquid was viscous and black. It was sloshing around violently. He sat right next to me and pulled out an alcohol swab. He wiped a spot on my arm and then tucked it in his pocket. 


I was on the verge of tears again. “Please tell me what the fuck is going on. Please…”


He grabbed my arm and my lizard brain took over. I started flailing wildly. Then I felt a shock spread through me and I couldn’t move my arms. I looked down… and my hands… my fucking hands. “Oh Jesus Fucking Christ.” My hands were apart of the couch now. I couldn’t get away. He stuck the needle deep in my arm and I started to scream. I could hear a high pitched scream matching mine. I looked down. It was the black shit in the syringe. It was like it was mimicking me. He started pushing it into my body and it was cold. Freezing cold. I couldn’t do anything but sob. He pulled the needle out and that’s when I blacked out again.


 I woke up on my couch with my clothes on from the previous night. The sun was shining through my window. Everything was normal again. I just sat there and took deep breaths. Everything that happened had seemed so nightmarish and disturbing that I figured I just took the tabs and fell asleep somehow and had an acid-fueled nightmare. Then I looked at my arm there was a shiny silver Band-Aid where he had stuck the needle. My heart dropped into my stomach. I pulled the Band-Aid off and there was a small hole in my arm. I ran my fingers over it and the skin was stiff, as if there was a small ball just underneath the surface. I squeezed it. Black goo oozed out. I couldn’t control myself and I vomited all over the couch and the floor. I flushed the two leftover tabs. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any friends. I can’t tell my parents about this. They will think I’ve lost it. So I’m telling Reddit. I’m warning Reddit. Please for the love of God, don’t take the gel tabs with silver flecks floating in it. Don’t eat the alien acid.

Welcome To the Candy Crew Guild's Educating Ed's Special Championship Race. We will be racing live on youtube with none other than Ed Lewis. It will take place on Thursday August 11th at 7pm BST, I know that it is out of the norm of our usual races but it is the nature of this special event. If you are racing please come as early as possible to help get everyone into the instance, a few of us will be there an hour early to help you all get situated. We will be conducting a race with SRVs of our normal rules and showing what a great group we are and how we find enjoyment in playing Elite Dangerous In our unique way.

The race will be held on Yavas 1 A -74.4947 / - 24.3474 
http://i.imgur.com/G0gWnTw.jpg

It's a short course in a anti-clockwise layout and will consist of two laps, you are allowed the usual repairs and refuels but limited to only one SRV. 
We want to do 2 or possibly 3 qualifying rounds (depending on time and how many people sign up) and take the top 5 from each for a Final race to declare the winner of this event.
To do this will require only those competitors who are racing at the time to be instanced to help reduced game crashes. and we will need all competitors 
to be prompt and listen to Race Control due to time constraints of this live event. 





 
This is our Discord Server (https://discord.gg/0nY4AnbzadaZQKu3) It will be where we do all of our race comms and other details concerning this event. We will also be using a private group for instancing reasons, hopefully it helps out a lot so when you sign up don't forget to join the Raijiin group in game. We ask that only those participating take part in voice comms though during the event, but all are welcome to join our group. We try to schedule activities as often as possible. (we all have busy schedules IRL ;) )



So sign up, and let's have some great fun racers! :D

I guess a list of questions could go like this:

1. What school year are you entering?
2. Company type? (startup, Big 4, Finance, Consulting, etc.)
3. What was your position at your internship?
4. full-time/return offer given?
5. how was the experience?

I'll start:

1. About to enter my senior year, this was my 3rd internship.
2. Mid-sized startup
3. position - iOS engineer
4. No
5. Overall this was my first summer doing actual software engineering and I had a blast. "

I've been applying to software dev positions but I haven't received any calls back.  I'm not sure if this is because of my lack of a CS related degree or if it's something else.  

A second degree would take me about 2.5 years.  Should I think about getting a second degree in CS or is there another path into CS? "
4w7xu0,2,2016-08-04,reverting back all the progress...,huskyvillage,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/4w7xu0/reverting_back_all_the_progress/,"After 38 days of NC and a while of feeling great, now I wish the breadcrumbs were back...Crazy I know... 

I was with my ex officially for 2 and a half years. We were so in love, and completely inseparable. We met in high school, and endured traumatic experiences together that brought us closer than any relationship I had ever had with anyone. She was diagnosed with an auto immune disease, my sister was diagnosed with MS, my father and I's relationship ended for a period of time, she was sexually assaulted in the very very early stages of our relationship at a party, she lost friends, I stayed home after graduation to attend a local college which I hated... Anyway, we knew one another inside and out and were absolutely one another's best friends. Long before her graduation, I told her that if she chose to go far, we would probably need a break as I knew I would be going way for college as well at the same time as her though I was going to attend my state's university and she had no plans of doing this, this was after the one year I stayed home.  I pushed her to go far because she had some very negative experiences in our hometown, and virtually had no real friends in her senior year. I knew that going away would be great for her and I did not want to hold her back, but at the time I didn't realize it would be our downfall. She went to a school in the south, very far from home because we live in the north east. We communicated daily, and were just as affectionate as before, but without the pressures of a long distance relationship. We agreed that we could hook up with other people if we wanted to but just not discuss it but she insisted she did not want to. I thought I would want to but the thought of sleeping with someone else scared me, so I did not and told her this. We were each other's first. Let me reiterate that although she didn't fight it too much, she did not want to break up initially but later agreed. She is 19, I am 21. 

 Fast forward to two months later after we had seen each other twice briefly, I wanted to be fully in a relationship again and I didn't care if we were long distance I really wanted to make it work but she was hesitant. Over the next few months she grew colder, and no longer wanted to be intimate when we saw one another over Christmas, and this caused us to grow apart, fight, etc. We fought about the state of our ""limbo relationship,"" at times she wanted more attention, at other times I did. In January she told me only wanted to be friends and I went NC but she quickly came back saying she missed me and knew that she needed to be on her own but that she couldn't lose me. I fell into this trap and let her lead me on for the next few months. Again, as more time passed we seemed more and more distant with some short lived bursts of things getting better, sometimes things seemed really to be looking up, and she would tell me she was telling her friends that she thought we were gonna get back together soon. 

After too many times dissappointed, I backed off after seeing her during Easter, I didn't even kiss her goodbye after sleeping over. I told myself that it was done. But I was lying to myself. In April I met another girl who was really in to me. We started hooking up exclusively and I started paying less and less attention to my ex, yet still hoping we would somehow rekindle our love over the summer when we could actually be together every day. Come to find out, she was also seeing another guy. I broke her trust by logging on her facebook, as we knew each other's passwords (but I changed mine) and seeing a conversation between them. When I confronted her she was livid, yet insisted they were just friends but said we needed space and didn't want to talk for the last 2 weeks of school. She said we weren't going to be getting back together over the summer something she continuously said in the past whenever I asked where her heart was at. She said the reason was because she had been with me since 16, and needed time to be alone. I gave her the space and she contacted me twice during that period, once a text saying ""Hope you're sleeping well, we will talk about everything once I'm home"" with a heart. I didn't answer. This gave me hope. I then found out through a friend that the guy she was seeing was a senior, and graduating and was from a different state than us, lives in the south as well closer to her school but not the same state. This gave me hope that their relationship would be very short lived.

When we came home she finally told me she just wanted to be best friends again and didn't think we could be romantic this summer because she had developed feelings for the other guy, this was after I basically insisted for her to be honest. I begged and pleaded for about a week but nothing worked--no surprise there. Then, I agreed to being just friends. Lol. The thing is, she gave me so many mixed signals. She would get weirdly jealous when I saw my girl from school, and would ask if we hung out at my house or where and said she was surprised to know I kept seeing her even when I was telling my ex I wanted her back. She once said it was a surprise to her to know this girl and I were exclusive at school and that the whole situation confused her. Once even said that if I was with the new girl to let her know ahead of time so she wouldn't contact me to look stupid. I told her this was contradictory behavior if she only wanted to be friends. I communicated to her over and over that the new girl was a fling, but that if my ex wanted to work on something with me I would be willing to. She rejected it. Her guy was in the area for a few days visiting his brother, and they stayed together for that time. I saw a picture of them online which crushed me, but what shocked me is that the day after she contacted me wanting to talk. I didn't answer. She contacted me a second time apologizing for that, and I still didn't answer. A few days later she contacted me again asking, ""Why are you doing this?"" We had a phone conversation where she begged and sobbed for me not to leave her and that she needed my friendship. I told her I couldn't be her best friend right now because it was hurting me too much. I got word from mutual friends that she asked a friend of mine if they had met my girl at a concert we went to and if there were any photos of us since we are no longer friends on social media. Another mutual friend showed her photos and she said something like ""wow looks like he's doing fine."" It pained me to hear her say she hated me for abandoning her, and that I knew how hard it was for her to be home when the only good thing about home was me. I saw her 3 times. The first was May 13th, it ended terribly. The second, on my 21st birthday. She begged me to come over and that her mom made me a cake so I came. I had invited friends to go to a bar, and she obviously wanted to come. I did not want to have her come but had no heart to say no. As she was getting ready, I saw her phone light up with a text from the guy. I got upset and left, and she did not come to my birthday. My 21st was my worst birthday I can remember... The last time I saw her was May 30th, she begged me to come over, so I went. Out of nowhere, she started crying and when I asked why she said she didn't know. We got ice cream, and for a split second everything felt ok. Then she asked me to leave and was super cold about it saying she needed to nap and was tired. I left. And driving home, I told myself that was the last time I would see her. I communicated this to her when she texted me apologizing for being rude, and she freaked out saying it hurt her so much knowing I wasn't happy to be around her and she didn't know what to do, and thought this was not the end but the beginning of us being ok. 

Through the later part of June, mostly all contact was initiated by her. She would find any excuse to randomly text me. Breadcrumbs galore. Once it was ""Did you go to that concert tonight?"" Another time, ""How is your sister doing?"" and another ""Hey did you ever get a therapist?"" I got overwhelmed by her constantly being around just because she needed her security blanket which was me. She had said she needed me in her life and was going through a hard time with her family and her illness symptoms had come back and that now that I wasn't in her life anymore she didn't know who could help her. Eventually I told her that I needed the space from her and told her to contact me if she changed her mind about us romantically but that other than that I wished her and her new guy the best. 

 That was the last time we spoke, and I have to say I am kinda shocked she hasn't reached out, but maybe she is shocked herself that I haven't. Her mom contacted me for something (I had an extremely close relationship with her family, they even had my graduation photo on their fridge) about two weeks into no contact. But nothing from the ex. It's been over a month and I started feeling really great and thinking about her less and less. I went to Atlanta with a few buddies for a weekend, visited my father in Florida, went to my university for a week, and just kept really busy and still hanging out with my girl from school who is an awesome person who I am loving to get to know, and being fun and loose with. Let me be clear that I have been honest with the new girl, she doesn't know details about how recent this all is, but I've told her my breakup is fairly recent and that I need time and can't give her anything more than what we have now which is fun hanging out, nothing more serious than that. I heard from mutual friends that my ex went back to her school early, her move in was in late August but she left late July to work and live at a friend's apartment. When we were on speaking terms, she told me this was something she was considering as she was so miserable at home. Then I found out through a friend that she left but first went down to Miami where her guy from school is from, to spend a few days with him. This set me back all the progress I had been doing. Now she is back on my mind and I keep torturing myself over this. A mutual friend I ran into the other day told me that this was very hard on my ex, not just on me. And that my ex had told her the other day before leaving that she came very close to contacting me one night when she was sad and sick because I always know what to say and could always make her feel better but that she stopped herself. Another friend told me they met for coffee recently and my ex was asking her about me and how I was doing and said that she really wanted her best friend back but that I didn't want to speak. My ex told this friend that she really likes the guy but doesn't know if she wants a long distance relationship since she will be back at school soon. This all is so overwhelming to me and I just need to get it off my chest...Still no words exchange, but I cheated myself. I went on her instagram, to check her followers and saw that the guy's mom now follows her. To make matters worse I logged into her email, and found a note she wrote from earlier this month complaining about how the new guy doesn't pay her enough attention and barely texts her sometimes a full day or she'll text and he wouldn't respond, and when he calls he says he is busy playing video games so can't talk and even said he will visit her school but doesn't know if he will see her. This was before she went down to visit him so I am trying not to read into it too much. Also, there were flight receipts for another trip back to Miami in 2 weeks, I'm pretty sure his birthday is around that time from when I did serious stalking back in May. See!!! Just saying these things makes me realize how far I came only to go back... I am convinced she just likes the idea of him and we honestly look pretty similar all of our friends bring this up so I believe it's a rebound and although she likes him, she's trying to fill the void of our relationship in my head. Since she is such a broken person, and has low self esteem, she needs someone to validate her. I say this because I know her really well. In March she was telling me we were gonna sleep together over break, in April she met him, and by late April was telling friends she wanted a long distance relationship with him... I am not sure if this is a rebound or not, but it definitely is startling.   

 We were so in love, I was her first boyfriend, first everything and now that she is completely over me and only wants me around as a backup or for her emotional security it crushes me. It's like I don't even recognize her anymore. If she's asking about me and thought about contacting me is that a sign that NC is working in the sense that she realizes I am no longer available for her? I was starting to feel a lot better about all of this. I keep thinking about her telling me how if it's meant to come back in the future it will, or how back in the spring when things were different but still not great she would say she felt in her heart it would be perfect again in grad school... I don't want to hold on. I don't even know when we will see one another again or speak to each other. I don't know why it's taking so long for this hurt to go away. We hadn't even had sex since September of last year, almost a full year... The emotional attachment though for me, is still so alive. I have been working on bettering myself I started working out every day and got a personal trainer, landed a great paid internship, am reading and writing everyday something I loved to do but hadn't done in years. I feel like I am changing as a person, I have better self control. I want her to see all of this progress and maybe she'll be reattracted but I am terrified she will fall in love with the new guy and forget me altogether, or has already. I keep thinking if she thinks that I will contact her and that is why she hasn't contacted me. I considered breaking NC, but didn't and promised a friend that I will make it to 60 days. I move in to college in 2 weeks and I couldn't be more excited, I know that once I am there and fully distracted it will be a lot easier to cope. Sorry for the long rant... Was feeling it today and needed to just let it all out.. "

My issue is, I can't figure out how to create said lists where, if you accidentally choose a second answer, or the wrong second answer, it's possible to erase that second answer. Right now when I select a second (or third, or fourth, etc.) answer, I'm not able to delete it to go back to just having the single answer.  

So...

if the drop-down list options are ""a, b, c, and d,"" and I first choose ""a,"" I currently have it set up so that I can then click back on the list, and choose another option so that I now have ""a, b"" in the cell (or a, d or a, c, etc). I can't delete ""b"" then, though, so I'm stuck with ""a, b"" in that cell. 

If I'm going to sell this to my coworkers as something they can use as a data tracking tool, it's got to be very user-friendly. Is there any way to get this to happen in a way that wouldn't require multiple steps and would just be as simple as deleting that second answer?

4w8jtq,3,2016-08-04,Getting a job is like winning the high jump,Prime_1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4w8jtq/getting_a_job_is_like_winning_the_high_jump/,"Lately there have been several threads asking questions or complaining about interviews, and with the Olympics starting maybe now is a good time to bring up this analogy.  Personally I think it is useful to try and get a sense of how the interview process works and why you see certain things happen.

In many ways interviewing is like entering a high jump competition.  Like the real sport the bar moves based on what the competitors are able to do.  However unlike the sport applicants never really know at what level that bar currently is at, and it can in fact move both up and down before the final job offer is made.  

The bar is first placed at some level determined by the company (the job requirements).  These requirements may or may not make sense for the job, but that doesn't really matter so much as it is only the starting position.  If all the applicants fall below the bar it will be lowered to a new level (always possible that a company will not lower it and will instead cancel the search, but that is rare so lets ignore that case for now).  If some applicants are above the bar it will be raised to that new level. 

The first key point is that when applying for a job you are ultimately compared against your competitors, not against the initial position of the bar.  This is why new hires can potentially get a junior job asking for 3 years experience, and also why someone with 5 years experience might get turned down for a job also asking for 3 years.  The second point is that there is no point getting bent out of shape if the requirements don't seem to make sense (e.g. 10+ years using Swift) because in the end you will be compared to other people who also don't have that, so it doesn't really affect much.

Next, just like the sport those who fall below the current level of the bar do not advance (i.e. don't get called for an interview) and those who are above get an invite.  One could argue that with resume parsing software doing keyword searches candidates that could potentially set the bar really high might get filtured prematurely.  While this is indeed true I would counter that by saying if you are just blindly submitting your resume that way then you aren't setting the bar very high at this stage.  There is a reason that people say networking and internships are important, and this is one reason why.  Those who can get around filters and get their resume into the hands of the right people are setting the bar higher.

In any event, once applicants begin to be interviewed the bar moves to a new level based on their performances. ""Performance"" here means what abilities and assets they can *show*, not just what they actually have.  Like a real high jumper it isn't how high they have jumped in the past, it is how high you show you can jump at that moment that matters.  As time goes on each applicant is compared to the performances of the other competitors who have set the bar at a given level.  If they exceed the bar it moves up to a new height, and if they are unable to reach the current level of the bar they are eliminated.

Obviously the bar continues to move (or not) as each applicant is interviewed.  Because of this it is possible to do well in an interview and even raise the bar to a new level, but still miss out on the job if someone else comes in and raises the bar even higher.  So simply giving correct answers is not enough.  You have to do better overall than all the other competitors so they can't get over the bar.  You can also see that someone can get a job offer even if they didn't interview particularly well as long as they set the bar the highest.

Like the real high jump all you can do is train as best you can so that you can perform well in the competition.  So when you read on this sub that a CS degree, internships, good resume, personality, and experience are important you can view it as what can you do to raise the bar so others can't exceed it.  You try and add all these things to give you the best chance of winning.  Some people will get jobs without a degree and others have trouble even with one.  In the end it comes down to who else is competing for that specific job at that specific time, and what the final level of the bar is, not what it was at the beginning.

Unfortunately you will likely never know at what level the bar is really at.  This can lead to a lot of frustration because you might think you did well throughout the process but still didn't get the job.  But in the end just understand that the bar ended up being higher that you were able to meet this time.  If you are consistently failing at some stage then that is an indication that you don't have something you need to push the bar where it needs to be.

On the bright side it can mean you did very well and set the bar high, so don't jump to the conclusion that you are terrible just because you didn't happen to get the job.  Another positive thing to remember is that every competition is very different, with different competitors who will set the bar at different levels.  This means that just because you didn't exceed the top level in the past does not mean you won't in the future.

Anyway, I hope that made sense.  Based on your own experiences do you think the above analogy is a good one?  "

I'm a 23 year old male. I just graduated college and was unable to find any internships or entry level jobs during that time. I got turned down or didn't get a response from every one I applied to. As a consequence I'm working in food service and paying my bills and working full time for the first time. I feel I've wasted my life making poor choices and haven't lived up to my potential. 

For the entirety of my life I've had some problems socializing, to the point now where I wonder if I have some undiagnosed form of autism or other mental disorder. I've always had close friends which are the most important thing to me. But I've also always had extreme difficulty attracting and interacting with the opposite sex. My success rate is close to zero, outside of a miracle three years ago where I was approached by a girl who turned out to be extremely compatible with me. I left her behind to move to a new city and get my academic life together. The month I was with her and experienced love was the happiest time of my life. 

Since then I've talked to many women in this new city and never have any chemistry with them. I feel I'm not viewed as a sexual or romantic person. I've basically been alone my entire adult life outside of about a month and it is destroying me. I'm unable to approach women out of the blue because I've never been successful at it. I haven't found anyone through my friend group. I'm out of college which is the time to meet partners. I've tried online dating numerous times and have almost never been able to sustain a conversation and never get dates. I don't think I'm an ugly person and feel my problem is my personality and confidence, which I can't create after losing at so many things in my life. 

All of this has completely evaporated my self worth. I feel like garbage constantly. I feel undesirable and invisible to everyone outside of my closest friends and family. Nobody gives me the time of day. I never get anything that I want. 

If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this. I don't know who to talk to and I don't know what I'm asking for, if anything. I just feel like shit and directionless and I don't know what to do about it. "

&amp;nbsp;

Warning: wall of text below, but I had to get this off my chest.

&amp;nbsp;

So I'm here to tell the tale of the first character death that happend in my game (me being the DM). Yesterday was session 10 of a game I started at work with some colleagues and interns, all new players and me as a first time DM (haven't played before as well). The group consists of 7 players total. Trying to keep my sanity, I used a starter adventure found online and continued from there. The players used the pre-made characters with the idea of possibly swapping them out later or starting anew. As everyone got attached to their characters, nobody swapped. 

Everything went quite well, despite this being my first foray into tabletop RPG. The only thing I hadn't seemed to achieve was a sense of danger as a group of 7 breezed through all my encounters and made it to lvl 4 without an issue. So I manned up, filled a town with lycanthropes and mystery, and threw my players in the middle of it all. Silly things happened before the plot was found, then a dwarf benefactor was kidnapped, anthills were poked and the party wound up in a tavern discussing their plan to overthrow the lycanthrope group keeping the whole city hostage.  

Cue next morning with the guards knocking on the door of the tavern. After waiting for a while the players decide to open the door themselves while looking for the innkeeper. They find him in his personal quarters, murdered. The guards suspect the players (as they were the only ones in the building), but one rogue stays hidden. He tries to escape via the back door but witnesses a dark figure knocking one of the guards unconscious. He shouts for help. Roll initiative.

The dark figure turns out to be a half-orc acquaintance trying to help the party out. Guards are on alert and don't want the players to move, players freak out, not trying to hurt the guards, half the party rushes off towards the shouting. In the meanwhile the shadowy figure stealthily avoids the chaos, takes down another guard, alerting the rest of the players of his presence (an orc-hating elf that hasn't met the half orc shoots at him and misses). Seconds later all guards are unconscious and the half-orc urges the party to leave before things go sour. Everyone follows him outside except one rogue who is set on stealing a guard uniform. I tell him it will take about three minutes to take the armour off, two minutes with help. So he convinces the other rogue to stay behind as well. They are warned in, and out character, that speed is of importance here.

This is the point things go sour. I had planned four were-rats surveying the building, letting the guards do their dirty work. After some time they enter the building, curse the (knocked-out) guards for their incompetence and proceed to search the building. The rogues hear them coming and hide themselves in a room. When footsteps approach the door I ask them to roll initiative. Rogue one (halfling) hides. Rogue two (Human), carrying the guard uniform, makes a mad triple dash into the corridor, exposing himself to the enemy, and heading for the side exit. Three of the four were-rats give chase. One stays behind, stealthily. 

The halfling rogue doesn't hear anyone, so he walks into the corridor. face to face with a scrawny dude with a pencil-moustache, carrying a loaded hand-crossbow. ""He ran off that way!"", he bluffs, and points towards the exit. Confused the were-rat transforms and attacks. It turns out to be an epic matched duel. The halfling, dual wielding two +1 weapons (lucky for him seeing the damage immunities) goes bloodied. The were-rat goes bloodied. The were-rat misses a lot due to the halfling's DEX being pretty high. The halfling rolls pretty low for damage, but has high modifiers.

Turn five or six, I roll to bite. Hit. 2d4+2 damage. Roll a 2. How many hit points do you have left? 4. MFW. Let him roll the save for the lycanthropy curse before going down, DC 11 CON. 8. He feels a weird sensation spread through his body, then everything turns black. Fails three death saves in a row with all players around the table holding their breath. I am thrown off my game.

Other players wait for rogues at rendez-vous, only human shows up. Wait some more. Get exposition from Half-Orc about the current situation. Finally start looking for their companion. Hear from a local about a not-quite-human-sized bag being dragged off by a scrawny looking fellow. Assume the halfling is kidnapped.

At this point the session ended. I talked to the player of the halfling rogue and gave him the choice: being kept alive as a captive in the dungeon where the kidnapped dwarf is being held or rolling a new character. Of course he chooses option 1 (The players will enter that dungeon first thing next session). I gave him this choice because he went out in a stupid fashion. Plus he was doing/planning some awesome stuff the other characters weren't aware of. (involving stealing a blue dress from a girl)

Now I feel like a wuss for keeping this character alive (of course I will play the lycanthrope card in the future and cause more trouble for the party). Tell me, r/DnD, what do you think of this? 

Additionally, for all DM's, How did you feel about killing your first character?

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr: Character got killed because fellow rogue ran off and left him alone, I felt bad and gave the character a 'get out of jail free card'**

My older sister is 28. She is all I have. We live in South India.

Our parents died when I was 9 in a car crash. My sister was 20 at the time. She fought very hard to retain the family assets (some relatives tried to cheat us off some stuff) and she was already doing an articleship (internship in a Charted Accountancy course) and we were, fortunately, financially well off. Then came the hard part of raising me. I was quite horrible to her, not understanding how much she sacrificed to raise me. When I was 14, I ran away from home once because I failed Hindi in a class test. Sis searched for me everywhere, found me and then a heated discussion happened where I said some mean things to her. (I really was a stupid fool back then).

But as time passed, I understood how much she has done for me and loves me. I know this sounds bad, but she is more like a mom than a sister. And I really will give up anything for my sister.

Everything was going great, and then this guy comes out of nowhere. He is a good guy, good job etc, and he begins calling my sister a lot. It didn't bother me much because I never thought they would get together, my sister never had the time or interest for a boyfriend, her life had always been around me. This went around for almost a year and a half.

I wrote my CPT exam a couple of months back (step one to becoming an accountant) and after that is when  my sister told me that they were in an official relationship. I was so shocked that I couldn't say anything. But I later said I am happy for them etc.

I'm happy that my sister is happy, but I can't help feel jealous? Angry? I don't know. I don't want him to take my sister away from me. I have met the guy and he is a nice person, even drove me to classes a bunch of times when my sister wasn't available. He sometimes watches football with me and we like debating and stuff. Overall, he is a good guy. I guess what I am trying to say is that I do not have a problem with their relationship per se, but I have a fear of it's impact on my relationship with my sister.

Yesterday night he asked me how I would feel if he married my sister and if he could bring up the topic of marriage in a couple of months.

Honestly, it made me sick to my stomach and I made the retarded move of asking him where would I go, then. He kinda laughed (not a humiliating way) and told me that ofcourse I would live with them till I am older.

Okay that's one problem solved, but what about later? Will my sister grow apart from me? What happens when the kids come?

I do not want my sister to miss out on life because of me, I am going to tell him to go ahead and ask her to marry him, but I really need to tell her that I am afraid, but how do I do this without making her feel guilty or something?

(Also is this normal?)

More info:
Apart from this, I do have a lot of friends, I'm very close to a few, and they all have told me that they got my back no matter what happens. I know that, but I can't live without my sister and nothing can replace that relationship. I do not have a girlfriend, I've never thought about it and have no interest.

TL;DR Orphaned kids, my sister raised me, was practically my mom, now a (great) guy wants to marry her. I know she is happy but im scared if I will lose her.

Tried posting to relationships, but idk why it wouldnt go."

BOSTON – A for-profit school with locations in Norwood and Wilmington has been sued for engaging in unfair and harassing sales tactics and misleading students about the quality of its Computer Network Systems program, and the success of the program’s graduates in finding jobs, Attorney General Maura Healey announced today.

The complaint, filed Thursday against ITT Educational Services, Inc. in Norfolk Superior Court, alleges that from 2010 through at least May 2013, ITT aggressively enrolled students in the Computer Network Systems program based on misleading information.

“These students were exploited and pressured to enroll with the promise of great careers and high salaries, but were instead left unable to repay their loans and support their families,” AG Healey said. “Our office has a history of going after predatory for-profit schools and will not stand for students in Massachusetts being treated simply as a source of income. We will continue to investigate and act against these deceptive practices and work hard to get the relief these students deserve.”

ITT’s two campuses in Massachusetts offer a variety of technology-related associate degree and bachelor degree programs. The Computer Network Systems program is the largest program at each campus, with enrollments exceeding 100 students per campus annually.

ITT’s admissions representatives allegedly told prospective students that anywhere from 80 percent to 100 percent of graduates obtained jobs in or related to their field of study. Real placement rates were actually 50 percent or less at each campus. ITT did not disclose that its placement rates included graduates with jobs outside their field of study and graduates with internships or short-term, unsustainable jobs who never received permanent, sustainable employment – including any job that somehow involved the use of a computer. ITT claimed that jobs simply selling computers at big box stores counted as placements, and even counted a graduate as placed who provided customer service for an airline checking travelers into their flights.

ITT’s recruitment strategy included soliciting prospective students in Massachusetts through advertisements, its website, direct phone calls and in-person communications. Former admissions representatives were allegedly expected to call up to 100 prospective students per day and were publicly shamed or fired if they failed to meet their quotas. Students were allegedly persuaded to visit a campus as soon as possible, where they were encouraged to apply, take an admissions exam, and complete a financial aid pre-appointment that same day. Admissions representatives pressured prospective students to enroll regardless of whether they were likely to succeed in the program.

ITT also advertised and promoted hands-on training and personalized attention through its program, but students said their experience involved the use of outdated technology, absent teachers, or being told to “Google” the answers to questions.

According to the complaint, federal loans accounted for most of the students’ debt, but ITT also extended short-term loans to students. When student borrowers were unable to repay, ITT steered them to expensive, private loans that they were unable to afford. The loans had high interest rates and high default rates.

The AG’s complaint seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief and restitution, including the return of tuition and fees to eligible students targeted by ITT’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices to enroll in the Computer Network Systems program.

The case against ITT is the most recent in a series of actions that AG Healey has taken against predatory for-profit schools. The AG’s Office is currently in litigation with for-profit schools Corinthian Colleges and American Career Institute for alleged unfair and deceptive practices. The AG’s Office reached settlements worth more than $6 million with four additional for-profit schools in Massachusetts – Kaplan Career Institute, Lincoln Tech, Sullivan &amp; Cogliano and Salter College. In February, the AG’s Office sued an unlicensed for-profit nursing school operating in the Boston area for misrepresenting its training program and targeting students from the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

In November, AG Healey announced action against student debt relief companies and the launch of a Student Loan Assistance Unit to assist borrowers who are having trouble paying their student loans. Students looking for more information or assistance should visit the AG’s Student Lending Assistance page or call the Student Loan Assistance Unit Hotline at 1-888-830-6277.

This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Lydia French, Division Chief Glenn Kaplan, Legal Analysts Diana Hooley, David Lim, John-Michael Partesotti, and Jenna Snow, and Division staff member Michael Beaulieu, all of the Attorney General’s Insurance and Financial Services Division, as well as Investigator Kristen Salera.

4wax4i,5,2016-08-05,How to approach my boss?,throwaway1720161994,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4wax4i/how_to_approach_my_boss/,"To start, I'll give you some background.

Currently, I'm a junior in college going for a CS degree. I took all of 2015 off to do some internships, and came back to school January of this year. Around August of last year, when I was in the middle of a 6 month internship, I got hired for a web development job at a small web solutions company to start in December. My boss offered me a signing bonus to start while I was completing my 6-month internship, but I declined. Ever since December, I have been working part-time while I'm in school, and full-time when I'm not at this small company. Last spring break, I had the opportunity to visit one of the top employers in my area for a day. I originally wasn't going to apply until next year (when I would be graduating), but then I decided if I wanted to better my chances of getting hired there full-time out of college, I should participate in their co-op program, so I applied for a co-op earlier this summer. I went through their interview process and got/accepted an offer. I have several months until I actually start.

Now, since my current boss was willing to have me work part-time remotely while working full-time at another place, I wanted to ask if they would be willing to do that while I'm doing this co-op. I have co-workers who telecommute 100% of the time, and I can work from home whenever I want to. To be honest, there's no real reason for me to even come into the office.

So, I would just like some advice on how to approach my boss on this issue. I would like to do it ASAP to be fair to my current company and give them ample time to find a replacement if they don't agree to this.

Thanks in advance for your help."

I'm interning for a start up right now (have about  two weeks left) and I'm having some questions about the work load they have for the interns. 

Since starting a few months ago,  I have designed the entire site architecture (a first for me) and created all of the company databases.  Another intern has handled ALL of the front end (we do work well together to make sure our front and back ends mesh) I've also moved everything to AWS because our previous host kept having issues.  

Now,  they want a proprietary algorithm that will allow them to search and match profiles, which will essentially be the lifeblood of the site.  Is this normal?  I've had a previous internship that kept me busy with scripts to help efficiency (AWS lambdas, etc) but that all seemed straightforward, this new one seems like exploitation a bit. I don't mind doing work,  but something about this feels odd. Is it just me? 

Thank you."

Undergrad GPA: 3.3
Shadowing Hours: 60
Publications: 2 (not first author of course)
2 summers of volunteer research at dental school
Internship at analytical company for a year

I'm gonna take a DAT but I'm realistically shooting for 20/21

There is also another problem. I recently got a misdemeanor for possession because my friends and I were driving back from Colorado and had like 2 eddibles and got caught in kansas but I'm doing the diversion program so it should only show ""dismissed with prejudice"" on my background check.

I'm really hoping that my masters degree with good graduate GPA from a fairly good school and a good DAT score is enough to cover the low undergraduate GPA and misdemeanor.

I'm a rising sophmore (kind of... It's my fourth year of uni but I was in Economics for three years) and since subscribing to this subreddit I've been giving a bit more thought to how to get to where I want to be in a career sense.

**Where Do I Want to Be**

I suppose it is still too early to really have my mind settled on the exact kind of work I want to do going forward but I know that I want to be on the cutting edge. I don't want to be some code monkey working on *gasp* payment solutions... Currently my bent is toward Machine Learning (because it alligns with my mission of making computers do cool things) and so far my exploration of the subject (I'm taking Andrew Ng's course on Coursera) has stimulated my interest even further. 

Still, regardless of the field I end up in, I want to go places. I want to make interesting things. I'll read of some of the ai projects companies like MS and Google are pursuing and I think... ""I want that"".

***Where am I***

As mentioned, I'm a ""rising sophmore"" (kinda). I've only been programming for a year (I began around july 2015) but I've only seriously pursued programming and CS in general since the beginning of this calendar year (which is when I actually made the jump from Econ to Comp Sci). 

Since making the jump though I've been keen to supplement class learning with my own stuff. I've been hammering away at a networked Black Jack game, progressing (slowly) through K+R C and have recently started to do that there machine learning course.

As for my school (if it's relevent), It's a fairly reputable school in Canada, Queen's to be exact, but it's known more for its other programmes with Computing being a sort of a black sheep. I don't know how much this will hurt me once I graduate and I worry because I have friends in the programme who seemed to be rather good and they struggled to find jobs this year.

...

So where does this leave us?

I suppose I want general advice but I also have a couple of questions if people are willing to give answers:

1) Would most companies look at a second year Comp-Sci student for a summer internship? (I only really have one summer because I'm doing the whole programme in about three years (counting this past school year)
a) If so, what can I do to maximise my chances of landing this type of internship?

2) Will it be more beneficial for me to contribute in smaller ways to established open source projects, or is it best if I continue mostly doing what I have been which is overseeing my own projects throughout the development cycle. 
a) Obviously, both is good but time is limited so if I had to pick one which should it be?

3) How can one get to know their profs better. Heck, even if it does nothing for me in a career sense, some of them seem cool people who do cool things... but I'm a bit awkward? Is there anything one can do except going to their office hours ALL THE TIME?

4) More generally, what should I be doing to ensure that I have every chance to meet my lofty ambitions... I'm not looking for some magic pill, some cheat code that gets one in the door at Microsoft. No, I know that the majority of it is working HARD in ones classes and then supplementing that with work on side projects and other sorts of learning. Still, it seems like it is best to work in an intelligent manner toward my goals and I think where I may need help is not in the actual work but more how to communicate my skill to those around me.

Thanks, and DFTBA."

BOSTON – A for-profit school with locations in Norwood and Wilmington has been sued for engaging in unfair and harassing sales tactics and misleading students about the quality of its Computer Network Systems program, and the success of the program’s graduates in finding jobs, Attorney General Maura Healey announced today.

The complaint, filed Thursday against ITT Educational Services, Inc. in Norfolk Superior Court, alleges that from 2010 through at least May 2013, ITT aggressively enrolled students in the Computer Network Systems program based on misleading information.

“These students were exploited and pressured to enroll with the promise of great careers and high salaries, but were instead left unable to repay their loans and support their families,” AG Healey said. “Our office has a history of going after predatory for-profit schools and will not stand for students in Massachusetts being treated simply as a source of income. We will continue to investigate and act against these deceptive practices and work hard to get the relief these students deserve.”

ITT’s two campuses in Massachusetts offer a variety of technology-related associate degree and bachelor degree programs. The Computer Network Systems program is the largest program at each campus, with enrollments exceeding 100 students per campus annually.

ITT’s admissions representatives allegedly told prospective students that anywhere from 80 percent to 100 percent of graduates obtained jobs in or related to their field of study. Real placement rates were actually 50 percent or less at each campus. ITT did not disclose that its placement rates included graduates with jobs outside their field of study and graduates with internships or short-term, unsustainable jobs who never received permanent, sustainable employment – including any job that somehow involved the use of a computer. ITT claimed that jobs simply selling computers at big box stores counted as placements, and even counted a graduate as placed who provided customer service for an airline checking travelers into their flights.

ITT’s recruitment strategy included soliciting prospective students in Massachusetts through advertisements, its website, direct phone calls and in-person communications. Former admissions representatives were allegedly expected to call up to 100 prospective students per day and were publicly shamed or fired if they failed to meet their quotas. Students were allegedly persuaded to visit a campus as soon as possible, where they were encouraged to apply, take an admissions exam, and complete a financial aid pre-appointment that same day. Admissions representatives pressured prospective students to enroll regardless of whether they were likely to succeed in the program.

ITT also advertised and promoted hands-on training and personalized attention through its program, but students said their experience involved the use of outdated technology, absent teachers, or being told to “Google” the answers to questions.

According to the complaint, federal loans accounted for most of the students’ debt, but ITT also extended short-term loans to students. When student borrowers were unable to repay, ITT steered them to expensive, private loans that they were unable to afford. The loans had high interest rates and high default rates.

The AG’s complaint seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief and restitution, including the return of tuition and fees to eligible students targeted by ITT’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices to enroll in the Computer Network Systems program.

The case against ITT is the most recent in a series of actions that AG Healey has taken against predatory for-profit schools. The AG’s Office is currently in litigation with for-profit schools Corinthian Colleges and American Career Institute for alleged unfair and deceptive practices. The AG’s Office reached settlements worth more than $6 million with four additional for-profit schools in Massachusetts – Kaplan Career Institute, Lincoln Tech, Sullivan &amp; Cogliano and Salter College. In February, the AG’s Office sued an unlicensed for-profit nursing school operating in the Boston area for misrepresenting its training program and targeting students from the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

In November, AG Healey announced action against student debt relief companies and the launch of a Student Loan Assistance Unit to assist borrowers who are having trouble paying their student loans. Students looking for more information or assistance should visit the AG’s Student Lending Assistance page or call the Student Loan Assistance Unit Hotline at 1-888-830-6277.

This matter is being handled by Assistant Attorney General Lydia French, Division Chief Glenn Kaplan, Legal Analysts Diana Hooley, David Lim, John-Michael Partesotti, and Jenna Snow, and Division staff member Michael Beaulieu, all of the Attorney General’s Insurance and Financial Services Division, as well as Investigator Kristen Salera.

4wbn09,6,2016-08-05,"I review video of deep ocean expeditions, and it's starting to scare me",SecretaryJean,shittynosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/shittynosleep/comments/4wbn09/i_review_video_of_deep_ocean_expeditions_and_its/,"I have to warn you, I have a tendency to ramble, like one time I was trying to tell my friend all about how [SPOILERS] Taco Bell's breakfast menu is actually a plague to the world, because it's so good yet so cheap, and before you know it you're going like every day instead of making your own breakfast, and then before you know it you're poor and then you get as fat as President William Howard Taft, so don't come crying to ME when you get stuck in a bathtub with your AM Crunchwrap, Jerry, so I apologize, [/SPOILERS] but this is VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION so please try to stick with me here.

I'm an intern for various scientific agencies, like NASA and NOAA. They don't know that I'm an intern, but I spend a lot of time watching their videos on YouTube and such, and then I tweet at them and leave comments to point out all the things they're doing wrong. For example, one time, a submarine's oxygen tank looked too small, so I told them so, and there were SO many comments telling me how I saved the day, and that it was such a smart observation, and thank God I commented, so I'm pretty sure you're looking at the next big scientific mind! Haha.

Anyways, a few days ago, I stumbled upon what would turn out to be the most terrifying experience of my life. I was at the local flea market and I found what appeared to be a blank DVD with ""SAD OCEAN BOAT"" scrawled on the front in blue Sharpie. Nothing else. I was intrigued. Ocean! Boats! It was only $1, so obviously I purchased it.

I got home and put the DVD into my Xbox. I had to clean the disk about 5 times for it to play (foreshadowing), but it finally started.

Now, there's something you have to understand about the deep ocean. There is a lot of water, because it is the DEEP ocean, as opposed to the beach-ocean, where you can stand in the waves and still see the gulls and the sun and life as we know it. The DEEP ocean is very dark, and you can't see anything, because the light just can't reach that far. Also, there's not any food. Taco Bell hasn't started building its Mariana Trench location yet. I'm telling you this so you know how much I know about the ocean.

The video opened. It was weird from the beginning, because it went from pitch blackness, right into showing a ""submarine"" or some other type of OEV (Ocean Exploration Vehicle(TM)) descending into the deep. So strange. I assumed it would be video from the INSIDE of the OEV. *What on earth is filming from the OUTSIDE?*, I thought, THOROUGHLY unsettled. After a few moments, the DVD cut to footage of men inside of the OEV - at least, I'm assuming it's the same ship.

On screen, the video cut to what is either the moon or the ocean floor. Maybe the moon, because, as I said, the DEEP ocean is **dark** so I'm not sure how they'd see. ""Come left a little,"" a man commanded off-screen. ""She's right in front of us, 18 meters. Fifteen. Thirteen."" He paused. ""You should see it."" A Russian man, also offscreen, grunted that he didn't see anything.

Suddenly, the camera zoomed in on something large, pale, and unsettling. It was HUGE. Covered in barnacles, seaweed, rust, and sea (or moon) creatures, it loomed on the screen like  the Ghost of Christmas Past. ""It still gets me every time,"" a third man commented. Sadly? Angrily? I couldn't tell. More mumbling in Russian followed. This is where I started to suspect the worst. What good could come from a joint Russian-American mission?

And then the third man continued, ""It still gets me every time...to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above.""

The money is better than I was expecting for my area and experience (none). The only thing is that the job is a few hours away from where I (my parents) live and in an area I've never really been before. 

So I don't know if it's just the reality of the task in front of me now (moving, buying a car, etc) or what, but since getting off the phone I have this...depressed feeling?  Maybe it's just coming off the adrenaline high? Or maybe it's the thought that, if they are paying me this much starting off, what exactly are they expecting? 

I can't help but feel like they must think I'm really good or something, but I'm not. At all. And that's not *just* imposter syndrome - I've never built any personal projects or had any internships. My grades were good but I often felt like my professors ""let me through"" some tougher classes, like algorithms.

Bah, anyways, enough whining. I guess I was just wondering if it is normal to not be jumping for joy after receiving an offer? I would expect to be happy, but instead I'm sitting here wallowing in self-doubt and feeling kinda sick. Everyone I know is offering congrats and I feel like a moron for not feeling as great as they all do."

I've looked at MEAN (and used it and liked it) but, most of those seem to want extra experience (I could be wrong about that). I've also looked at RoR but I'm not sure if is a great choice given the growth of single page applications (I know this isn't an entire stack). "

I’m about to enter my final year of Uni and I currently work as a software marketing intern (this is an ongoing position until I graduate). My manager has been pleased with my work and presented me with a unique opportunity to work with a different group of my choosing within the company. She will essentially put me in contact with people from a different group that she may or may not know to work on a project (temporary or long term) and vouch for me. I'm seriously interested in ES because my job before this dealt with sales and I absolutely loved it. The goal of this to potentially bridge some gaps between marketing and sales, but more for me to gain relevant experience to help me when I start applying to full time jobs. My manager is the absolute best!


So far I think that working with inside sales or an account executive might be beneficial but I have no clue at this point. My question for you is as a software marketing intern who would like to eventually get into ES when I graduate what groups I can potentially work with to gain valuable experience to steer me in the right direction. My company is so big that chances are we have a team for any role you can think of.

Thank you in advance!

4wc51r,1,2016-08-05,Please help me. I need some support and some clear advice. 7 Day Break/Combined Pill Mistake.,CHARETH_GLUTESTORY,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/4wc51r/please_help_me_i_need_some_support_and_some_clear/,"About 3 months ago, I was given a new combined pill by my doctor in England as my previous one was giving me mood swings. I moved to Sweden for an internship. The new pill gave me random bouts of breakthrough bleeding, which was extremely frustrating and unpredictable. 

So, on Wednesday 27th, when my final pill of the pack came around, I decided it would be the last until I went to the doctors in England.

Now this is where the problem is. Because I knew that the woman is protected during the seven day break from the pill, I assumed that I wouldn't be fertile for a few days after I finished my pack. I didn't realise the protection was dependent on me starting a new pack following the break. I had sex at least three times over two days (28/29th) with my boyfriend, who was visiting. He went back to England on the 31st. I did not start a new pack of pills when the seventh day arrived. 

It's now been over a week since that day passed, and the risk of it all has honestly only struck me now. I was having breakfast this morning, when the thought struck me. I've been discreetly researching my situation all day at work, on the verge of tears. I cannot believe I have made such a huge mistake. I cannot believe I have been so monumentally uninformed.

I don't know what to do. I have friends who have given me relatively weak quasi-scientific advice. I feel alone. My boyfriend is so supportive, but our communication is limited to FaceTime and Whatsapp and his default response seems to be that I should talk to his mum or my mum. I don't want to do that unless I discover I am in fact pregnant.

If I'm pregnant, I won't be able to find out for a couple of weeks; if I'm NOT pregnant, I won't be able to find out for a couple of weeks. I know I should use this logic to just get on with my life, but I honestly feel paralysed. I feel like I can't look forward to anything. I am constantly on the verge of tears. 

I need help, please."

My job duties thus far have consisted mostly of maintaining vendor relationships and generating good will by augmenting the vendor's business development function. This consists mainly of me going to a different vendor every day of the week and making calls and trying to set meetings with their BDR teams. My boss has been sending me to vendors with tighter value propositions (since I've just started), so generally I'm only pitching one product.

Recently, I've been tasked to do some internal business development in our drive for net new business. Marketing has sent out a flyer to Directors of IT, CTOs, Managers of IT, Managers of Infrastructure, Sr Network Managers with most of our line card.

This is where I need your help, /r/sales. I'm supposed to call through the list of those that received the flyers, and try to get a meeting. I've been getting call paralysis because I've rationalized the following:

1. I doubt most of these contacts are even getting the flyer.
2. Marketing put damn near half of the whole line card on there. The value prop is so wide, how do I even know what to pitch, or open with?

My boss told me to call them, ask if they got our mailer or not, and then ask for a meeting. Sounds simple enough, but I don't know where to start.

This is an example of a call I made recently-
&gt;""Hey this is sales_samsara from company, have you received our flyer?""

&gt;""No.""

&gt;""Well we're a professional services group that specializes in NFV/SDN, we've worked on such and such projects, would you like to meet with us?

&gt;""No.""


We really have worked on some cool projects, but I doubt people are going to be brimming with joy to rearchitect their whole networking environment. I'm having a hard time knowing what to say or how to qualify them because the pitch is so broad. How do you sell network design around an open framework? How do I come up with better qualifying questions to get pain paints? Or focus the value prop? Thanks!"

I will be entering first year college in two weeks (community college), all will be distance learning so I have obtained a full time job as well.  My job doesn't pay too well, but will be an immense help for experience to get a job after my first two years and internship afterward.  My job consists of me driving... a lot as I deliver, setup, and tech for events and such (computers, A/V equipment, networking, etc).  I do not currently have a car and am using my mother's but putting the amount of miles on her car isn't going to work.  I get reimbursed $0.40/mile (Below the IRS rate, but I got them to go up from $0.35)

I get a salary of $2,000/month before taxes.  Close to $1500 (maybe a few dollars more) after taxes/deductions.  

My current bills are minimal.  

I have one credit card with a balance I used to pay for school (my community college is one of those that doesn't participate in federal loans and I wanted to save from using private loans until 4 year) for the amount of $2,000 now.  Card has 0% interest for 12 (more) months. I've been putting close to $400/month toward this card but could reduce it to $100/month.  

I have phone bill of $50/month that can't be reduced (I was dumb and got an $800 phone on EIP).

Misc recurring bills of $22/month 

I was thinking no more than $400/month maximum for car payment/insurance.  It would put me at about 25% of monthly income, ideally I would like to stay around $300.  Is this a healthy amount?  And am I in a good place to buy this car to keep this job or would just tossing the job out be the best idea?  

Note: The job is pretty stable, I've been here 90 days now (rode with someone while being trained) and the company has been in business for 25+ years but is a small business with a total of 3 full time employees. "

**General Comments and Questions:**

1) I've tried to show that while I don't have any traditional ""hooks"", my passion lies in computer science and tech, as well as bringing that knowledge to others through teaching, workshops, etc., and that's really what I'm trying to highlight to admissions.

2) I dropped Varsity Fencing after freshman year to focus on other interests in CS/tech as well as Boy Scouts. Is it still worth including in my application? If so, where/how can I explain that I had valid reasons for dropping it?

3) How much is the 730 on SAT Critical Reading really going to hurt me?

4) Any other tips?"

I'm a grad student at a school in the Fenway area, so the closer to that, or to the green line, the better. I'll be doing classwork and an internship, so I will most likely be keeping to myself but I'm not opposed to some friendly hanging out. 

I'm a nonsmoker, no pets, quiet but friendly, happy to share in household responsibilities. As long as I have a bedroom to myself, I have no preference as to number of bedrooms/roommates. I'd prefer at least one other female roommate in a shared house/apt. My parents will be helping me out with rent, so while this is a little embarrassing, I'm certainly no credit risk.

I'm happy to tell you more about myself and to see if I'd be a good fit if you have a place available! Please feel free to contact me here."

It was not that easy. I ended up spending more money that I thougth in the beginning, so in the end I was not only far from everyone I love and learning that would be way harder than I thought as also I couldn't put my PC together and distract myself gaming, or have some multiplayer with friends, these were dark days.

It took time, weeks looing at the boxes with my parts and unable to use it, after I started working and my paycheck arrived I could finally be back. I still miss everyone but having my PC back made me feel a lot better.

Oh of course, pictures, [the build in all it's glory again](http://imgur.com/a/84yHa), the gamepad I originally bought for some android gaming (n64/DS/SNES emulating) until I could get the parts (yeah, they only had that one, I hope it doesn't break without any reason, RT already have an annoying noise).

At least I upgraded the power supply, originally it was a CX430.

Now next month I get the headset/headphone, since the one I had [broke in the most wtf way possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4rwbw6/first_a_dead_row_in_a_keyboard_then_an_annoying/), any sugestions about that? are all headsets really terrible? I know, getting headphone + mic would be better, but it doesn't sound that simple and unexpensive

I learned a few things:

&gt;Consider getting an notebook when travelling

&gt;Bring way more money than you think it will be necessary when travelling

&gt;Serval also works on PC (via USB)"

4wda3k,1,2016-08-05,"College, parents, life. Need some advice",PCbacca,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4wda3k/college_parents_life_need_some_advice/,"To begin with, I'm just going to start with a general summary of what kind of person I am and who you're dealing with
I'm a 21 year old 3rd year college student about to be a senior who should probably a sophomore/fresh 3rd year in regards to how far I am in my course curriculum, which is biochemistry. My parents pay for my school, my housing, food, everything. I don't have a job right now because my dad wants me to focus on school , and then eventually have me go to pharmacy school. Sounds good right? Parents paying for my whole school? A lot of students would love that. But the thing is, I have a strained relationship with my dad to say the least.
My father is a good guy. He’s worked hard for this life in his own small business and he's got a wife, and 2 kids, me and my older sister, who's actually starting pharmacy school at a good program. But in highschool, I wasn't a straight A student. I was just an A/B student. I got into a decent university that's actually one of the cheapest schools for a good education in the state. The thing is, my dad is a good guy, but he's quite rude and mean in some ways. Like he was always on my sister's back while she was a senior in highschool. She was pretty unhappy in that time because of the pressure of getting into the school he wanted her to get into.

Back to me though, in my first 2 years of college, I struggled with calculus classes, and ended retaking one of them. As I continued on with my college career, I ended up getting C's or B's in my chemistry courses and haven't done any internships or research (which is seriously recommended in the biochemistry study, almost a necessity to go to grad school or getting a job) since my dad wanted me to focus exclusively on school and not be concerned with money or anything else. However I'm not happy with my grades and neither is he. We've had bad fights/arguments over the past few years, and it's come to a point where I'm tired of it. I never want to call him because I know I'll have to tell him that I'm failing him and wasting his money because I'm not doing as well as I want in school. A lot of people will say, ""study/work harder for it if you really want it"", and you guys are right. But I’m constantly stressing about how I’m behind in my courses/ how my dad is going to react/ I’m wasting money / what will my peers and professors and family think of me? It’s gotten to the point where I’m uncertain of my path and I’m just afraid to go on further, waste more money and time because of my low performance in school.
I have to retake O-chem again because I want to increase my grade for that class, which means more money down the drain. I told my dad this and he obviously didn’t react to well to it. We had the big fight, I told him that I wasn’t sure about pharmacy school, yeah it’s good money but I’m already not doing that well in undergrad so how is pharmacy school going to be any better. My dad’s a reasonable guy, but he wasn’t having any of it. He actually told me drop out of my current school and go to city college/ community college to retake some classes and get my GPA up. Turns out that you can’t do that with my university, you just have to retake classes at that university. So I end up going to a summer class where again I’m not doing the best in.

I just had a talk with my dad today, and I told him I want to stop school for a bit. I don’t even know what I should do anymore school/career wise, but the stress of my dad reminding me that he’s paying for my school, not being sure if I’m going to do well in my field or even graduate, and struggling in my studies in general is really getting to me. I’m not giving up, I’m trying to study, I go to class, meet with my professor and classmates about homework/lab questions, but anytime I talk to my dad I get extremely down on myself and have a hard time studying with that on my mind. I just feel so directionless and lost.

I’m thinking about going financially independent from my parents. Yeah a lot of you will say that it’s a bad idea/ can’t get financial aid under age of 24/ no job/ haven’t completed school. But this has been going on for over 3 years. I’ve reasoned with my dad and we just don’t see eye to eye. We’ve talked multiple times, and he just says I don’t listen to him, if I listened to him, everything would be better. Well I want this to be the last time I don’t listen to him. I don’t want to have to listen him anymore and disappoint him even more, or waste more money from him. I feel like I owe my father a debt that I can never repay, which is probably what I should feel like to my university to be frank. I feel like a lot of people will say, “communicate with your parents” or “your sister made to pharmacy school, you can too” or “suck it up, that’s life”. I’ve tried. I’m sorry to my parents and to all the people that I know, but I’m mentally too stressed out to continue on like this. 

Now I have to get back to studying to finish my class, and then start looking for a job/ plan out my future. Any advice/input would be much appreciated. 

Sorry for the wall of text.

4wdec5,27,2016-08-05,A tale of getting a job,TagProKoala,TagProIRL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TagProIRL/comments/4wdec5/a_tale_of_getting_a_job/,"As some of you know, I've been jobless in a small town for over 10 months now. I've been applying to jobs and even driving to company locations to try and talk with employers but only to receive automated rejection emails and my phone calls and messages being ignored.

 About a month ago I applied to a job in my field and I felt confident that I would be a good candidate for the position. The job required 2 years of SolidWorks experience while I had over 4.5 years of experience and this job was an entry level position and I had 1.5 years of experience working in the industry as an intern. The very next day I received an automatic rejection email saying that I had been rejected from the job and they were ""continuing the search for other candidates"". After being rejected countless times with zero explanation I was frustrated. I sent back a polite email asking if there was anything concerning about my application. HR sent an email back saying that I was ""overqualified"" for the position and they would be concerned that I would not stay with the company for a long time before taking a new job somewhere else. This would have made sense if we were in a much larger city (i.e. over the size of 400,000) but the fact is there aren't any jobs in the area. I was desperate and almost at the point of considering working a minimum wage job (I mean no shade on minimum wage jobs I've worked 5 of them before). I replied back to that email describing my desire to work this job, my commitment to the city, and my own personal experience working in the industry. I felt that no matter what happened I felt that I had given myself the best chance possible at explaining my situation. A couple of days later I got a call requesting a phone interview and I happily accepted. Just today I accepted the position and received the title of ""Mechanical Designer II"" instead of the original position I applied for ""Mechanical Designer I"" because they thought I had enough experience. I can't tell you how happy I am to receive this :')

**A few bits of wisdom I can share from this experience:**

1. It's okay to question why you got rejected from a job because it can help you in a couple of ways. You can either learn how to make yourself a better applicant or learn what you might be missing or you can make HR recognize you instead of just being another resume to toss because it didn't fit in with their current standards.

2. While you're jobless, having a support system is great. It really meant a lot to me to get words of encouragement from my family and especially all of my friends here. I appreciate anyone here who's ever told me that they knew I would get a job. It really kept me going and I didn't get despondent over rejection emails. 

3. Focus on your hobbies and do what makes you happy in the meantime. To me that means working on my creative projects and 3D printing and making 3D models. I still went to yoga class and tried to keep myself active. 

Good luck to any of those still searching, we're rooting for you!"

So let me introduce myself with this story of hope and despair. 

Oh, where to start...

My journey begins in the start of summer break, back in the middle of May. Free from my burden as a college student, I looked forward to the summer internship that would fill a dull, hot as hell summer. My five year old laptop, which I had relied on to get Plat in LoL and MGE in CS:GO, had begun to rebel, or maybe I just hadn't noticed before.

I planned on building my first computer this summer, one that would fulfill my instinctive needs and finally apply my knowledge from all those Calculus classes (Kappa). I feasted upon the knowledge from the ancient subreddits (/r/buildapc, /r/buildmeapc, and /r/pcmasterrace), planning for every possibility - murder, extortion, and/or kidnapping of my future beloved build.

Over the span of two months, I plotted on the greatest affordable build with money left over in my Paypal. Yet, as the internship ate away at my time, my strength weakened. My passion, once golden and bright as the mane of a lion, had begun to luster. Perhaps it was the heat. Perhaps it was fate.

And here we are, as time nears for me be to return to college. I still lack the important components of the RAM, HDD/SSD, and display. With my funds dried up from the deathly tuition fee (how the hell did it increase by $2000) that is of American college, I give up.

I know that it's the journey and not the end that is truly important. Yet, I feel a pang of weakness whenever I remember that I've abandoned and ultimately failed this build.

I was really good at software development and had my eyes ultimately set on a software developer job come graduation.

Unfortunately I do not have internship experience, which makes my situation even worse because I have zero industry experience. 

Fortunately I do have good grades and several personal and group projects, including an extensive software system (comprising three major software components: a web app, mobile app, and server app) which actually garnered significant attention from industry representatives during a demonstration fair.

Ever since graduation I fell into what my psychiatrist calls a ""major depressive episode"" which left me at the lowest point of my life. It has continued for an entire year now. At this point, I am extremely fearful that my aspired career will never come to fruition due to my circumstances. It's been difficult because I have not been up to doing the work I used to enjoy, it used to be my hobby, but it gave me some of the best joy when I was 'normal' and I want that back. I hope to begin to rekindle that.

I understand that at the very least I must begin to build a *recent* portfolio of projects. Also, I have Cracking the Coding Interview to help with interview preparation.

So what do you think would be the best way for someone in my position to begin to prepare and pursue a career in software development?"

I love the exchange of power that happens during sex, especially in a dom/sub setting. Together I'd like to set a scene where I dominate you and peel you back layer by layer as you submit to my will.

I want to craft a passionate story together where our characters get to explore their kinks, as we explore ours. Let's write scenes that leave us craving the next little orange letter.

Let's work together to negotiate the scene, but my ideas are:

- I'm your boss. Perhaps you are an intern, or a new employee. here's been tension building up and one night we are both alone in the office working after hours and I make my move.

- You are my good friend's wife. I'm married too. The four of us double date sometimes. Maybe our kids even play together. There's always been a tension between you and I. Something happens and we find ourselves together without our spouses and the tension is worse than ever.

- You are my submissive little slut and I've got work friends over for dinner. I order you to only wear your collar, a thong, and that bra that's a size too small. Things heat up as the guests arrive and I push you further and further past your limits.

I'm open to other scenes, but hopefully that gives you a feel for what I'm interested in. Can't wait to start writing together."
4wduyc,0,2016-08-05,What really happened with the Burning Flames Viewfinder.,TehVenomWithin,tf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4wduyc/what_really_happened_with_the_burning_flames/,"This is in reference to the witch hunt started about me, which can be found here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4w8zu0/an_open_letter_to_the_trading_community_steamrep/

If you're going to blindly downvote without reading any of the content in this thread, bugger off please. No, I'm not the UnknownVenom.

http://steamcommunity.com/id/justtsuna is the person I'm accused of sharking. I will make myself very clear. I did not tell him on who or who to not add, but merely told him to avoid adding PRIVATE and LOW LEVELED accounts, as he got lots of adds from phishing bots. Long story short, my phone authenticator got disabled. However Cunt trusted me enough and told me that I could have the viewfinder for nothing, while he had to wait 15 days for his items. Now yes, I admit I paid low for his items. It is worth noting however that I could have easily canceled this trade offer at any time with my items and easily could have gotten away with it. I'm no scammer, I'm forced into trading via premium because of how these communities are run. Now, to the value of the viewfinder. The burning flames viewfinder was priced two years ago at 3450, and for some reason everyone is assuming this is what the one I bought is worth. That is completely incorrect. almost all of you have no knowledge on high tier trading nor how it is done. The burning flames 
viewfinder was priced in a SEVERELY different time frame. A few points regarding sharking and the viewfinder in general. 

1. Two years ago, trading wasn't dead. Now with the introduction of the mobile authenticator, 30% of people have 15 day delays. This slows down steam trading extremely. 

2. Automatic private inventories for users on Steam. This means that unless a person MANUALLY changes their settings on their steam, they will not be bothered by traders. Lots of good items have been lost due to this, and it's slowed down trading tremendously. (this is regarding trading as a whole, not me or other sharks in general.)

3. Two years ago, we had a MUCH larger community in trading. Everyone's cashed out, and all the high tier traders are no longer interested in buying god tier items. The only high tier traders left are people that trade for profit, not for looks. None of the top traders play this game for the gameplay, it's solely about money.

4. Bud to key conversion. The viewfinder was sold when we still used buds, and when buds and keys were converted, inflation on multiple hats happened. This is what happened to the viewfinder. I do NOT VALUE the viewfinder at backpack.tfs price, and neither should you. I'm the OWNER of the item, and I'm telling YOU, it's no where near that much. Now, onto some concrete evidence as i'm aware no one would take my word for this. http://backpack.tf/effects . You notice that sunbeams average at 216, where burning lies around 330. Tell me, when the SUNBEAMS VIEWFINDER sold for and is PRICED at 1250 only a FEW MONTHS AGO, why are we valuing the burning at 3x this price? That's fucking absurd. I personally value this View at 2500, but I have no offers to back up my value, hence my next point

5. The other burning flames viewfinder has NEVER been offered over 2,000 in ITEMS. And keep this in mind as well, he is a CLEAN trader, no bans anywhere.. Tell me, if the burning flames viewfinder was really worth 3450, why isn't the cleaner one getting any offers? My other points explain this in depth.  http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/28118320 is the trade to prove this. 

6. Now lets discuss what I PAID. The burning flames tipped lid, 1200, sunbeams slopoke, 200, and the collectors casemaker. The value on this little guy is tricky. People will assume it's 110 because that's what Harry paid, HOWEVER, Harry ALSO took advantage of this users ignorance and paid 110 when that's what he pays for SINGLE CLASS ITEMS. I previously declined an offer from him for 500 PURE, and 650 in items from Raven. If Harry denies this, he's a blatant liar. Raven can confirm this if he'd like. To summarize, 650+1200+200= a grand total of 2050. Not so bad now looking at it huh? And EVEN IF YOU VALUE THE VIEW AT 3450, 2050 IS NOT A SHARK PRICE. 

7. What happened with the burning tipped lid? Why do you own it now? The unboxer specified before we traded for his viewfinder that he disliked burning flames, and after the trade was completed asked me if there was an alternative hat I could give him. He looked through my inventory and found my purple energy woodsman, which he then asked me to trade it for his tipped lid. I told him the woodsman wasn't nearly as valuable, and to compensate (to him apparently), he asked me for 65 in australiums to be added ontop of the woodsman. I was happy to oblige. I'm not a retard. I don't turn down free profit. 

 http://prntscr.com/c271qr I'm in the middle of brokering that knife, and hazmat. I'm also brokering a terrowatt casemaker. The reason I bring this up is because people constantly refer to me as hitler, and some kind of scammer. I've never manipulated anyone to do anything I've asked of them. They either do it out of free will or will do something I ask them because they're friends of mine, that's what friends are for. 

Due to the HUGE shit storm that's been brought up by some punk who thinks he's a god because he unboxed a KE, I've had to private my inventory and profile and continue my business elsewhere. I'm disappointed in him and the community for contributing to a witch hunt, not to mention he didn't edit his original post when I proved him false on many different subjects. You may not believe me, but that's fine. I was honest in this post, and whatever Business Sloth is trying to stir is seriously fucked up. he said it himself, he has no evidence, yet he continues to prosecute me. He's believed because he got lucky and unboxed a hat. So if you people like listening to a blatant liar, go for it. his motives behind doing this? To gain respect from the easily deceived TF2 reddit. I suppose I maybe insulted him once, and he felt triggered enough to start a lot of unnecessary drama toward me, and my brethren.  Not to mention he pretended to be my friend for an entire week, and then attempts to throw me under the bus for a bit of respect. Not someone who I'd personally trust, but that's just me. 

Want to find someone to be mad at? Be mad at harry. Paid 110 when he offered me 500 pure, when I had been offered up to 700 in items http://prntscr.com/c27eax http://prntscr.com/c27f71 Then this egotistical cunt tries to report me on Steamrep and get as much attention as he could by posting on the original thread. We were close friends for the longest time, till he block removed me as soon as he got what he wanted. Not someone I'd call a friend either.  A shark am I harry? I'd suggest you look in the mirror rather than try to dick ride the band wagon. You tell the viewfinder kid the hats worth 66 because thats what backpack.tf says, then offer 110 after offering me 500+? You admit to me that you'd rather buy it from the kid because ""he's easier to manipulate down to a price I'd pay instantly""? you're worse than most of the scum I know. 

Expect another thread shortly about sharking in general. 

Any questions? Ask below. Be polite, and so will I. All I ask. 









**(OTHER COMMENTS I'VE MADE THAT PEOPLE MAY BE UNAWARE OF)**

No ones going to take your words seriously too. An intelligent traders anyway. The view was priced at 3500 when it was 1:1, and when it was the only all class misc in the game. Now that there are other alternatives, and that it's no longer 1:1, its worth significantly less. I mean fucks sake, beams sold for 1300 recently.

I paid a bf lid+ beams poke+ collectors case. 1200+180+whatever you value the case at(it's at least several hundred, Harry just got it for dirt). I want this reddit post edited as its nothing more than a witch hunt against me, with the main point being I paid a few hundred for the view when I clearly didn't.

I'm going to get blindly downvoted, but I don't give a fuck. You people can choose what you want to believe.

To the point of sharking making the community a worse place, yeah no. Fuck off. Sharking is hard work, it's done by professionals who are quite frankly more intelligent than your average trader. We label profit traders and good traders as sharks. The only person or people rather impacted by sharking are you fuckboys who are too jealous over the amount we make. You think you're special? you're just another lucky punk. Luck is something we've never had. We are intelligent individuals who work just as hard for our profit as anyone else, and to deny that is hearsay.

If you really cared about me or didn't want to start hate or flame wars you wouldn't mention my name at all you twit. You're the real shark here, pretending to be someones friend and making a thread like this. I'm not the most honest person when it comes to trading, but to backstab someone like this is just as bad as what you accuse me of doing.

Prove I told him not to trust anyone else. I paid far more than 1000. 1200 (BF TIP LID) 500 (collectors casemaker in which got sharked by Harryg for 110), and 180 (sunbeams slopoke). If he no longer owns these items, it was because he traded them for lesser valued items with other users, and that is not my responsibility.

The only hat I've ever been rightfully accused of sharking was the woodsman in which I returned with extra. All other items I own were earned legitimately. You're referring to purple, aka Woifis girlfriend. No need to try and play the guessing game. Yes, I added the burning team captain unboxer. yes, I discussed buying it. Did I do anything you're accusing me of? no. do you have any proof? no.

Me and Rick are old friends and old partners in trading, and will be until this game ultimately reaches its end. That's irrelevant.

I didn't tell him to not add anyone. You got denied because unlike me and purple, you don't have a steam level of 100. People actually care about that shit.

I no longer have backpack.tf, toughsox took overall control of that and told Brad himself he wanted me, and several of my brethren to be robbed of their premium rights, something that wasn't even implemented prior, and hasn't ever been in motion until now. So you got your wish you twat, congrats.

You don't have to worry about me anymore. I'll hopefully be gone in a couple of months, and the next generation will step in.

No it's not lol. It really isn't. You may not know this because all you are is some lucky punk, but a trade has nothing to do with value. It's what both parties agree on. If you want to ban sharking, you have to ban profit trading. It's the same thing.

Trade: exchange (something) for something else, typically as a commercial transaction.

All you're doing with this post is trying to start hatred on people who know how to actually trade. It's the unboxers responsibility on what he or she wants to do with their items, and they shouldn't be force fed by you like children on what they should or should not do. White knights are the real cancer of the community, I'd torch you myself if I could. Value is subjective, you can't put a price on unpriced item or cry wolf on every person I add or trade with, how do you know I didn't add someone just to play a game with them? You don't.

Steamrep has and never will ban for sharking. They ban for users being UNTRUSTWORTHY, in which a TRADE AGREEMENT was breached or broken. Sharking would NOT exist without backpack.tf. It DIDN'T exist before backpack.tf The community and trading era itself was much better before we had these cancerous sites telling us what we couldn't trade for, and dropping our hats value when some idiot wants to quick sell his.

Backpack.tf will never close premium. They don't care about the community, they care about money. They are the epitome of profit whores. The only reason the rule was overturned was because Toughsox himself cried wolf to polar. You had your fucking chance for me to change when I was promised I'd get unbanned when I returned my woodsman. Well guess what, you made me wait over a year just to lie to me and tell me ""lol no"". Backpack.tf hasn't even fixed my ban reason, because they have no fucking evidence. If you had even the slightest of a brain you'd be able to see that my ban is falsified.

Do you know how stupid it is to accuse someone of being ignorant of trading when there are SO many advantages given to them by steam directly. 1. automatic private inventories. This means that unless you WANT to trade your items, no one is aware that you'll have said item. 2. one WEEK wait before unboxes are tradeable. A week is PLENTY of time to learn knowledge about your item, and to learn how to trade. 3. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SMART PHONE. if you're too retarded enough to get sharked and yet meet all these criteria, it is your own responsibility. you people like to pretend it isn't. You're not the buyer, you're not the owner of the item, all you are is a pathetic low life white knight. You have NO right in telling someone what she or he can't do.

Wanna know what's funny? I've brokered and middle manned over $10,000 in items even AFTER my ban. I have had several opportunities to run with items while banned (two pans, burning tipped lid and burning crown), with countless of money trades and middle manned trades being done. I'm in the process of brokering 300 keys in items by a good mate of mine. If I was untrustworthy as you accuse me of being, I'd have run with all these items a long time ago. I've never lied intentionally, and I've always paid over what other sharks have had. I don't believe in screwing someone over, but rather teaching them through personal experience. There are four ways to learn something. Personal experience, witnessing, personal opinion, and being taught. You've fallen victim to the later two. Being taught by backpack.tf and outpost that I'm some big bad wolf and that I'm here to fuck over your life. You're pathetic. You have no concrete evidence of me doing what you've accused me of, and nor have you any personal experience of the way I conduct business with other people.

I've already hired interns who do my trading now due to how much of a fuss you've all been making. If you're interested you can freely add me.

In regards to Harry's comment, that was all bullshit. I never had that burning ke guy added, and Rick knows I had nothing to do with it as does polar. Otherwise I'd have been banned for that long ago. Tis but a tale I tell you and others to have mutual respect amongst ourselves. Ive never participated in any trade revolving around any scam.

I think the movie zootopia summarizes it well enough.

""If the worlds only gonna see a fox as shifty, and untrustworthy, there's no point in trying to be anything else."" Replace fox with my name or any other accused shark and there you go.

4weqah,2745,2016-08-06,TIFU by pulling the covers off my wife,wolfbayte,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4weqah/tifu_by_pulling_the_covers_off_my_wife/,"It was January 2008. I remember like it was yesterday. And before you get too excited, this is not a sexy post. It's also rather long, so If you don't want to read the entire story, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

We had a big day of football ahead of us, because all our rowdy friends were coming over.  A bunch of us from work had been hosting round robins throughout the season. Now it was our turn: the NFC and AFC Playoffs.  Playoffs? Are you kidding me? Don't talk about playoffs! Playoffs? I just hope we can win a game.

Because of the big games, we had to prepare a feast of feasts.  Because the next day was MLK day, we could stay up later than usual. We didn't just plan on watching football; we were going to turn that mother out.

We did not want to get up Sunday morning.  But we had to. I remained in bed looking at my wife waiting for her to get up first. She stared back waiting for me to get up first. I saw through the window that my neighbor was removing a tree. He had purchased an RV on Saturday and needed to remove a fruit tree to use the RV parking. With all the commotion, I knew it was time to get up, but we didn't want to leave the warmth of the down comforter to face and clean the frigid abode beyond the wall.  The only way to get either of us to budge was if the comforter budgedfirst.  I pulled a little off her, she turned to me.  I pulled a little more and she gave me the stink eye. I pulled the rest and let it slide off the bed onto the floor.  ""Fine,"" she said, as she reluctantly reached for her slippers.

We cooked, cleaned, and put beer on ice, then got ourselves showered and put on our game faces.  The games, food, and beer were a hit and the couchgate spilled over into the hot tub.  I didn't mind, because many of her friends were hot.

All good things, they say, come to an end, and so did the party. We were ready for bed.  The down comforter was still on the floor. So the wife grabbed a corner and pulled it up onto the bed. Once the blanket was all on the bed, she noticed a used dryer sheet stuck to it with a leaf on it. We may not make the bed in the morning, but we sure in Hell don't sleep with trash on it.

Wife pulled the leaf off the dryer sheet and immediately felt a sharp stinging sensation. She flung the leaf away, towards my side of the bed mind you, as she screamed. I rushed in and saw her panicking, jumping around, looking around, and waiving her hand. She tried to explain what happened and I figured she picked up a sticker from a sticker bush or something. I told her to get a bag of ice for her owie and I'd look for the sticker so I didn't step on it.

I walked around and didn't see anything. I leaned down and stuck my head under my bed found myself staring directly into the eye of my own mortality just inches from my nose. I froze but didn't take my eyes off it. I wasn't going to be up all night trying to hunt down should I escape. ""Get the vacuum!"" I yelled. ""What is it?"" she asked. ""Just get the vacuum."" ""What is it?"" ""Vacuum please!"" ""What is it?"" ""Please, get the vacuum and I'll show you?"" ""Oh my god, what is it?"" ""Fuck, get the fucking vacuum now?""  She runs out and drags out the vacuum from the nearby coat closet. ""Plug it in!"" She plugs it in. I'm still staring at the nightmare fuel as she hands me the nozzle. I nod, and she turns it on. I suck it up. ""Got it, turn it off!""  She's white with fear, writhing in pain, and holding ice on her right thumb. ""It's getting numb,"" she warned. ""Your finger?"" She grimaces, ""No my whole hand."" ""Shit!"" ""What is it?,"" she asked again? ""Get the tweezers and I'll show you."" I also have one of those little plastic bug carriers we have for the kids.  I opened the vacuum canister and she stepped back in fear. I grabbed the culprit with the tweezers and dropped it in the carrier.   I snapped the lid shut and fired up the laptop. ""A scorpion?"" she asked. ""Yes.""  A scorpion.

It was an inch-long bark scorpion. She called her friend, whose husband was a bug guy. He said their venom is not harmful to healthy adults.  The internet said otherwise. Also, they hide by folding themselves to look like leaves.  Also, my wife is night blind and needs glasses.  By now her arm was numb up to her elbow. The ice wasn't slowing the toxins. The blood vessels in the thumb carried the toxin up her arm. She was in shock, she was hyperventilating, and she thought she was going to die. She didn't believe me she would be fine. There was no choice. I had to take her to the ER. I brought our new friend along just in case.

I was shocked at the short wait at the hospital. The doctor said that the toxin in her wasn't life threatening, but he would give her some steroids for the pain and swelling. By now it was halfway towards her shoulder.  The doctor left the room to get something.

He returned with an entourage of doctors, nurses, interns, and I think the janitor, to look at the scorpion. ""Is that a prescription pad in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?"" Nope, it was a black light. He closed the door, turned off the light and shined the purple light on my wife's would-be assassin. It glowed green like that Wacky Wallwaker I got in my Lucky Charms two decades earlier. The doctor was as giddy as a kid in a pet shop. ""I'd heard of this, but never seen one in person,"" he snickered.  I hadn't realized he'd been waiting his whole life for my wife to get stung by a scorpion so her husband could bring it in for him to see it.  Glad I could help him cross that one off his bucket list.

After show and tell was over, we left the hospital, filled the Rx, and went home. And no the scorpion didn't go home with us. Instead, I let him go on the hospital sidewalk where he was poisoned by his enemies.  Wife went right to bed and I explained to the kids what happened. Fuckers laughed, but kids will be kids, I guess.

She spent the next day in bed as I vacuumed the entire house and called a bug guy. Bug guy came and checked around the house and yard. He told me I didn't have a scorpion problem, because I had no bugs for the scorpions to eat.  It was just a fluke. I had him spray the house anyway and put granules in the back yard to repel ants and scorpions. He suggested the scorpion came from the neighbor's yard when its home was literally uprooted. I guess one man's RV is another man's ER visit.

Wife missed a week of work. Each day her numbness subsided a little bit.  Whole thing, with lost wages, ER ,Rx, and Bug guy cost me over a grand.  All because I pulled the blanket off of her and onto the floor that morning.

We never leave the blanket on the floor anymore. To this day she is deathly afraid of dryer sheets, which makes for some interesting pranks if I'm ready to sleep on the couch. 

TL;DL Pulled the blanket off my wife and onto the floor to get my wife out of bed one morning. A scorpion crawled on it, stung my wife that night, and she missed a week of work with a numb arm.

4wf1jo,58,2016-08-06,Regarding the Intern: An Industry Insider's Opinion on Leaks,dreadbeasts,SULeaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/SULeaks/comments/4wf1jo/regarding_the_intern_an_industry_insiders_opinion/,"Bit about me first: I'm a professional animator in Vancouver. I've worked on Rick and Morty, and now I work at the same studio that makes MLP. So I'm saying this as both a thirsty SU fan who jumps on promo leaks as soon as they show up, and as someone who works in the industry. I want to say this because of the reactions I saw earlier - the indignance and impatience about a free, pirated episode earlier today and I am done a concern about fan entitlement.

Basically, cool it with your thirst. Exploiting a server is one thing - it's not... great, and frankly I'd be mad if a show I worked on leaked in that way. More disappointed, since we work hard on stuff and we relish the reactions of fans. But I get it. Waiting is hard and when the info is there the soul is weak. I'm here thirsting with you, aren't I?

BUT. 

Do not be the person who encourages insiders to leak. Do not be so damn desperate for any snippet of info you can get that you create a culture in which interns are tempted to ruin their careers all for a bit of e-fame. Don't clamor for leaks offered by people who are deliberately violating their legally binding contracts. Crewniverse works hard on what they do, and encouraging people to throw that in their faces is wrong. I, and many others in my field, would go to great lengths to be offered such an opportunity and it pisses us off SO MUCH to learn that some dope not even out of school who isn't even a fan wants to throw it all away for some e-fame. Kid's career is likely destroyed before it even starts - this is the sort of thing that gets you blacklisted. I sure as hell wouldn't hire them. People talk, I've seen it happen over much more trivial things.

So cool it, guys. The server promos will come in due time. The streams will come in due time. Don't let selfish insiders wreck themselves and the fandom because you couldn't wait an extra day or so. "

The title pretty much sums up my concerns. Some info about me:
  
* I finished my BA in Math/CS and Economics in January
  
* Graduated from a state school that has a reputation for the performing/fine arts and small CS/Econ departments (I didn't know what I wanted going into college :/ )
  
* 3.0 GPA: I wasn't the best student, but I was asked to be a teacher's assistant for a few semesters in CS1 and a lower level Econ course
* I have good recommendations from professors, my thesis advisor, and my previous employer
  
* No internship
  
* I was fortunate to find part time work during school, which enabled me to graduate without debt and have some money saved. This may have hurt more than helped though because it's allowed me to live semi-stagnantly with my parents
  
* In the past couple months I've found ambition and applied to a few dozen of help-desk/desktop support positions in the NYC Metropolitan area. After some bumps in the road, I interviewed well for a few of them
  
  
I didn't expect to get a job instantly after actually beginning my search, but its been a couple months and I thought I'd have one by now. I think I need to reevaluate a few things. In the process of writing and thinking more about this, I may have discovered the answers to my original questions (mainly the first one), but I would greatly appreciate the community's input.
  
  
First, I've been applying almost exclusively to help-desk/desktop support positions in the process of my job search. I think this may have been greatly affecting my success because I haven't really considered other kinds of positions.

  

Second, I've been under the assumption that my long-term career goal is a Linux sys-admin position because I enjoy using Linux, learning its inner-workings, and shell scripting. My reasoning seems kind of silly and unrealistic now that I've read more about that kind of position. One of my long term goals is to learn more about *nix systems, but I probably shouldn't base my career goal off it. Are there decent paying jobs that entail working mostly with *nix systems? If so, what search terms should I be using?

Finally, how badly has my mediocre educational background (as described above) hurt my search, and how will it affect me as I begin applying for other types of positions?

  
  
EDIT: sorry, one more question. What kind of careers are available that would utilize both of my majors (Math/Comp Sci and Econ)?"
4wfdsk,10,2016-08-06,Purposeless and Feeling Out of Place in Life,confused_student_1,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/4wfdsk/purposeless_and_feeling_out_of_place_in_life/,"I will start by stating my age: 23. I am student in Computer Science and finish my degree next summer. In addition, I work at a bank as an intern. I am paid lots of money and would be paid even more after my degree. I know that my situation is not bad at all and lots of people would want to swap places. Yet, I do not feel fulfilled because I kind of lost track of why I went for Computer Science. I find it very interesting but during this work experience I am just not feeling the software developer life. I find myself among seasoned engineers who are incredibly good at what they do. They talk on topics of technology and I feel out of place because I feel completely inadequate. I do not have internal curiosity and passion to learn more and people can definitely feel that I am not a passionate technologist. I equate myself to one of those people my professor mentioned who are just not suited to become great software engineers. The issue is that I am completely disinterested to other IT career paths. Programming is actually most interesting to me from all others(cybersecurity, networking, testing etc.) and I am just not that good at it.

I had other interests in school: life sciences and medical research but wanted to try out IT. Reason: interesting, 4 years at school instead of around 10 for med school or medical research scientist. I was afraid of investing so much time and realizing that it might not be for me.

I also watched this video excerpt recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jECU3FrtaHc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=26m55s and it got me thinking that this is the path in the future where I am not doing work I can be good at naturally and hence, help the world the most. I read posts on main sub on career and pursuing money is wise in the long term but it seems very shortsighted because software is meritocracy and people are rewarded for their technology skills. Pay for mediocre engineers is quite poor, especially in Europe, and I will never get to excellence stage if I don't live and breathe the subject. I see so many people, including my relatives, who drag their ass to work to collect huge paycheck. They become good at work over time but the time flies by: that is what happens when every day is the same. And then you find yourself 40 years old with regrets of not risking it while younger.

I'd risk it. I'd finish university because quiting at last year is stupid but go for whatever it seems to move my heart. I was also diagnosed with mild depression by a doctor that I think stems from being not satisfied with where I am right now.

My question is: how do people find what they are good at? I don't think that not being passionate about something is good for you in the long run or am I naive youngster and complain about things a lot people would love to swap places with?"

The community at /r/JesusChristReddit seem to enjoy challenging themselves to find the post that will make the most people exclaim ""JESUS CHRIST REDDIT!"" but over the past 3 months no-one has managed to topple the top post on the subreddit in which /u/Chops221 tells reddit [what part of his childhood he missed most](https://www.reddit.com/r/jesuschristreddit/comments/4e7utx/which_part_of_your_childhood_do_you_miss/).





As you can see reddit never fails to surprise us and give us a laugh or two that we feel guilty about so check out the weird and wonderful community that is /r/JesusChristReddit

&gt;##1. Can you guys tell us a bit about yourselves?



&gt;&gt;**secopree:** Without revealing too much, I'm 16 years old, and joined reddit almost two years ago to participate in discussions on /r/bindingofissac when The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth came out, after the developer linked it on his blog. So I guess it's Edmund McMillen's fault I'm here.




&gt;&gt;**Euchre:** I'm just this guy, ya know? But a bit more seriously, I'm much older than your average redditor, but I've been into technology since I was very young. I started my internet social experience with ICQ, Yahoo IM and chat, and it grew from there. After joining reddit mostly to vote on stories for TWiT's Tech News Today, I was sent a link to /r/Justrolledintotheshop, and was hooked. My exploration of reddit grew from there, and I saw it as the last bastion of what the internet really was when it began - your persona, not your name.



&gt;&gt;**dublzz:** I'm 20 and in college right now. I've been on Reddit for 4 years, and more recently have begun moderating and designing CSS in communities around Reddit.

---

&gt;##2. What inspired you to create /r/jesuschristreddit?



&gt;&gt;**secopree:** Well, /u/Euchre said in this thread that there should be a sub called /r/jesuschristreddit, so I decided, why the fuck not?



&gt;&gt;**Euchre:** Well, I didn't really create it, but I like to think I incited it. It all started [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3b8brt/what_question_have_you_always_wanted_to_ask_but/csk7xvx?context=3), when I posted the link, which inspired secopree to actually create it. Whenever I ran across suitable content, I'd submit it, and eventually we got a burst of subs, and secopree invited me to help mod.



&gt;&gt;**dublzz:** I only joined recently after coming across the subreddit mentioned in a popular post. I saw the potential in the subreddit and that it was lacking any major CSS. Since then I've made small tweaks to the look and function of the subreddit as well as adding a bot that screenshots posts in the comments.

---




&gt;##3. What post made you guys say ""Jesus Christ Reddit"" most?



&gt;&gt;**secopree:** Not really a post, but the first time I looked at /r/The_Donald. (Fun fact: I am banned from there.)




&gt;&gt;**Euchre:** I can't really say any single one has made me be more incredulous than another, especially because when I think its gone as far as anyone can, someone else takes it further. I look forward to the next time I'll hate myself for laughing at something.



&gt;&gt;**dublzz:** There was this one /r/The_Donald post... that should be enough to get the idea.



---



&gt;##4. Did you prefer the old snoo or the new one more?





&gt;&gt;**secopree:** I threw the old snoo together in about five minutes in GIMP, and I thought it looked ugly. Then /u/KilledFox came along with the one you see now (most of it, anyway) and I changed it in a heartbeat.




&gt;&gt;**Euchre:** The old one was pretty basic, and it conveyed outright shock more than the more current iterations. The new one's smirk better represents the sense of gallows humor we're going for here. Oh, and technically this is our third unique Snoo, as I edited the 'new' one so the font matched correctly. The real artwork is /u/KilledFox 's handywork, though.


&gt;&gt;**dublzz:** I quite like the new snoo.

---





&gt;##5. Is there a particular subreddit you see that makes it to your sub more than others?





&gt;&gt;**secopree:** /r/AskReddit gets the most, and this is due to this sub being more popular among users there (after all, that's where this sub started), as well as it setting up the perfect environment for those comments to spawn.




&gt;&gt;**Euchre:** /r/AskReddit is by far the most prodigious source of postings. The wide open nature of disucssions there, often ripe with sharp wits, lends itself to creating those deeply twisted and macabre jokes.


&gt;&gt;**dublzz:** AskReddit and WritingPrompts. Those subreddits are all about the comments.

---




&gt;#6. Anything else you want to say to all of reddit?


&gt;&gt;**secopree:** Subs like these prove that reddit can be a place that isn't taken too seriously. Dark humor helps us deal with real issues by breaking the wall between negative and positive ideas. So if you made it onto this sub, I'm happy for you.





&gt;&gt;**Euchre:** Don't stop being reddit. We love the twisted, sick, perverse humor you bring us, and its the kind of disarming tool that allows society to relax and deal with some really dark, insidious things.


&gt;&gt;**dublzz:** shh bby is ok

Lots of good things about the house and my parents.  HOWEVER, my Nmom is using her ""concern"" for me as a guise to monitor my diet, my sleep, my thoughts. She raised me from age 8 to be on diets (was normal 8 yr old girl - normal weight but not skinny till college when I gained weight cause I was trained by her to think that was my destiny) - she's monitored everything I've eaten since I was 8, it's quite.....suffocating to say the least. I suffer from long bouts of depression but fortunately got through this last bout feeling very motivated and strong and emotionally healed and functioning mentally better than I have in nearly 20 yrs. 

My NMom is GREAT in an emergency - totally keeps her cool, does the exact right thing. Totally trust her in those moments. So when it turned out I had to have an emergency gallbladder removal she was fantastic. HOWEVER, now it's been a few days and I'm slowly recovering (still in pain, lots of digestive issues, major organ gone from my system), she is slipping back into her old habit of micromanaging me and especially my eating/exercise habits. I've been going on 30 min walks daily in the 90 degree humid heat, played with their wonderful dogs, doing smallchores that don't require lifting, etc. I've also had NO appetite and having trouble figuring out what my body can handle. I'm currently having a small bowl of raisin bran with skim milk (can't have many fats due to gallbladder going bye bye), an apple, pear or peach at some other point during the day, crackers when I'm feeling peckish, and a tuna fish sandwich or something similar around dinner. That's it. Just drinking water, and that's all my body can tolerate for the past week. That's a pretty low-calorie day, I want to eat more but it's tough to do that when your tummy hurts all the time, so I've just listened to my body. My mom, however, is trying to get me to eat LESS. she's asking what I eat, ok with most of it (how can you argue with a piece of fruit only for lunch?!) but if I eat, for example, the WHOLE sandwich at dinner or use 2 pieces of bread instead of just one, god forbid, she looks at me pointedly or suggests I not eat so much, because ""I just had surgery"". 

That's one example of many related to food/exercise/sleep she's been making - aka if I don't read her mind and do EXACTLY what she thinks I should do, I'm out of line and she feels she needs to speak up. Infuriating, but pretty much the norm since childhood.

She also says shitty things &amp; then gaslights me: for example, years ago when we saw the movie  ""The Devil Wears Prada"" together, which ironically features a narcissistic power boss criticizing her assistant about her weight all the time, my mom (oblivious to the irony) leaned over to me and said ""you could be just as beautiful as her (Hathaway) if only you'd...just..."" Then she sighed but I could finish her sentence cause she trained me to understand what she meant when she wasn't allowed to say it out loud: ""lose the weight"". 

Cut to last night when we're eating dinner (and again, I'm barely eating cause of my surgery pain) and they talk about how I should see the movie ""The Intern"". That its sooooo funny and I'd like it! Really! I said: no I won't. ""It's funny!"" They say ""I won't like it"" I say. Then my mom says ""oh you just don't want to watch it cause you're jealous of Anne Hathaway"". I have her an ""are you crazy?"" look and just changed the subject. 

This morning, after my mom woke me up at 8:30 to lecture me on not sleeping too much and about getting exercise and getting my shit together (again, I just had abdominal surgery), we got into it a bit and my dad got involved. Eventually we got her to STFU and listen to me where I told her what I needed, what I wanted, how I was listening to MY body, that my body was not HER body, and though she had good suggestions it never worked to corner me and cram them down my throat like she's ALWAYS done, and if she asked my dad or brother about other methods to support me she may learn a thing or two. I then told her to cut the shit with the digs and shitty comments - I used the ""jealous of Anne Hathaway"" comment as an example - and she was like ""what? That was nothing! I didn't mean anything by that. What are you talking about?"" And I just stared her down and said, calmly but firmly, ""you know what that comment meant and I know what you meant by it so cut the shit, mom"". And she dropped it.   Minor victory / vent I wanted to share with y'all. Happy Saturday, everybody! 

Love + Light + Strength:)"

I have no idea how this ERP works so I was hoping someone could shed some light on some of the questions I have!


1) Can a list of active users be generated directly from the system or does it have to be queried from the specific tables like JDE?


2) How is user role security set up in GP and is it possible to generate a list of users and their current roles?


From what they've provided me so far, the table they query doesn't seem to be a table found on https://www.gptablereference.com/, but instead a table directly from that database (from sys.database_role_membes).


Hopefully someone can give me some insight as to how this works and if it sounds like my client is providing me with the correct information. THANKS!!"
4wgd3m,5,2016-08-06,UK - Looking for some advice on whether to graduate or not,actuarialadvice1,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/4wgd3m/uk_looking_for_some_advice_on_whether_to_graduate/,"Hi there, I'm just looking for some advice on my current situation. 

A little background:

As it stands I am enrolled onto MSci (4 year degree) in mathematics, and have finished my 3rd year. As for grades, I can leave right now with a relatively high first (80-85%) from a top 5 university. I have no actuarial exemptions, but may be able to be exempt from CT1 and CT3. As for work experience, right now I'm doing a summer internship at a insurance firm, and I'm around half way into it. 

I've decided that I'd like to work right now, and I'm considering to leave my degree program with a BSc instead of completing my 4th year. Obviously, if I leave now right after my internship I will be unemployed - and I'm particularly worried about having nothing to do until next year except for apply to grad schemes for 2017. I've spoken to my current employer about this, and they told me that they would hire me right away if they could, but they have to speak to HR to see how it could be done - so nothing is certain right now. I've started taking a look at jobs right now and obviously there aren't many who will take someone on with no experience. 

So it comes down to two things:

- Do the 4th year MSci (not looking forward to it at all) and apply for graduate programs as usual and hopefully get one

- Leave with a BSc, see what my employer can do for me (possibility of starting straight away), and if nothing can happen on that front then apply for literally any finance related jobs as well as grad schemes for 2017. I have programming experience aswell, so I'm thinking maybe applying to a data programming type roles also?

Obviously option 2 is very risky, but I really am not looking forward to doing another year at university, and after working for 6 weeks I already just want to start right away. Could someone shed any advice on this, I know it's a very personal choice but any thoughts if leaving without anything lined up is a stupid idea, or if you reckon it's still possible to get something decent for a year until graduate schemes start.

Thank you so much"
4wgdra,1,2016-08-06,Me [19/F] with my mom [50s/F] advice for rest of summer living together,beckywiththefinehair,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wgdra/me_19f_with_my_mom_50sf_advice_for_rest_of_summer/,"I'll get right to the point, I am struggling living with my mother this summer. For the past year I have been living with a roommate in a dorm, but this summer I came back to my hometown to live with my mother as I do not yet have the funds to move out on my own.


My biggest problem at the moment is that I have no privacy. I have never had ""privacy"" living under her roof, but now that I am an adult I would like to have a private life. Recently I went to the health dept about some feminine issues I was having and I told her about the apt and when she asked what it was about I said that it was personal and I didn't want to talk about it. She hounded me for a few days about it and when I still told her it was personal she went through my room to find the sheet that they gave me detailing the problem and some home remedies I could try. Not only did she find it, she placed it in a completely different spot than I had it so that I knew she knew (?). I recently got eloped and my husband and we have decided not to tell anyone until we have a formal ceremony in a year, after I receive my degree. He lives about 6 hrs away currently and I just got back from about a month of visiting with him (it went very well, I had a fun time and was very happy being on the beach in the sunshine with my wonderful husband). The day I got back she went through my things and found the marriage certificate (which I would have told her about in due time), but has not brought it up since she found it by snooping (it was in an envelope in a bag in a bag, so she could not have come across it naturally). A few days ago she got a call meant for me from the school I go to. They needed a few forms filled out IN MY NAME, so she went ahead and did it for me. This was totally out of line in my opinion, as they are forms for me that she signed IN MY NAME, that she really did not even understand. Well, in doing that she added $6,000 to my student loans without me even being there to ok the process. When I brought it up later, I did it non-accusatory, but said ""next time, please let me know before you do something like that and do not sign anything in my name ever again."" She flew off the handle and started yelling how the guy on the phone was pressuring her and she had no choice. I told her that next time just say you are not [my name] and that you don't have a say on the matter. It's kind of small potatoes (I mean $6000 is a substantial amount that I would have rather not had on my head, but what's done is done), but I felt really intruded on.


The next thing is ""our"" car. technically, it is my car. Two years ago I bought it from her for $2000. She used that money on her boyfriend's jail bonds instead of putting it towards another car for herself. So we still share one car, which she uses most of the time. I have let her have the car for the last few years, but now when I go back to school in a few weeks I will need it (I have a job at a waffle house and an internship at an elementary school that I need to have reliable transportation for). As the date approaches, it looks like she does not have the intention of buying another car and is going to want to keep this one. I literally cannot let her have the car. How do I go about this? I don't want to leave her high and dry, since she also needs a car, but I literally cannot go without one anymore. Driving together is a large tension as well. She does not like the way I drive MY car and will backseat drive until I cannot take it and just pull over for her to drive. This seems insignificant, but it is just a constant nagging when I am trying to concentrate on driving, making me more nervous than if there was just silence. I am not a bad driver, have never been in an accident, go speed limits, obey traffic rules.


She is a very negative person and loves to gossip. In fact, when I first got back from my trip she did not ask what I did, but wanted to know what happened with my husband's mother who does plenty to gossip about. The atmosphere in the house is honestly very depressing and makes me depressed frequently (I do not have major problems with my depression outside of the house). Part is also the place I live, which is a very small town (pop. 3000) and there is really nothing to do. I have a job cleaning houses, have a few hobbies like painting and art, and have a couple of friends also home for the summer, but all and all it is just me by myself trying to keep myself entertained. Staying here is making my mental health decline rapidly.


The last thing is that my mom is very paranoid. She always has been, and ever since I was a child I would hear horror stories of the world and lived in a lot of fear that if I walked on the street alone or took a step out of line I would be kidnapped/murdered. This in itself is a whole issue that I have carried with me into adulthood, fighting against fear everyday, afraid sometimes to even leave the home. The most recent example is a few days before I left for my trip she came to me in hysterics saying she had a bad feeling that something would happen to me on the bus that I was taking. I had to assure her that nothing would happen, but she insisted I cancel my whole vacation (with no refund on the bus tickets) because of her ""feeling."" Of course, I did not, but this was a huge ordeal on my mind right before I left.


I am not a delinquent. For god's sake I graduated college at 17 with a 4.0, am working on getting a graduate degree in a year, rarely do drugs, drink, or party, have a steady job and an internship. I do not understand why I need to be snooped on or why I need to be infantilized. I am really at my wits end and my mental health is suffering greatly from being n this type of environment. I need some advice on how to talk to her (or not and just leave it), how do I help myself in this situation, should I cut ties when I leave (I am thinking about it), what do I do about the car?


**tl;dr:** Mother snoops through my things, is constantly paranoid, and is causing tension in our relationship. What advice do you have to help me in this situation to stay sane?"
4wgfdy,1,2016-08-06,"[M4F] Physical Therapy, or Working Out Some Kinks",Throwaway313Play,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4wgfdy/m4f_physical_therapy_or_working_out_some_kinks/,"I'm not the usual client at the clinic; most of the patients are some combination of old, crippled, or hopelessly obese. Sometimes all of the above. But I'm in my late twenties, attractive and athletically built. Everyone notices me when I hobble in, even walking with a limp I cut a striking figure at six-foot-two, with close cut brown hair, a light tan and sparking green eyes. And, most important to our story, a totally-fucked-up right knee. A backyard rugby match got a bit rowdy and I ended up with a torn ACL. Fantastic.

So now I'm spending two evenings a week at the clinic, doing frustratingly simple exercises in an effort to slowly rehabilitate myself. My girlfriend isn't thrilled that she's on her own for dinner those nights, but what can I do? It's not like I can just walk it off. So I'm kind of stuck with this, at least for the time being.

But I've missed the obvious question in all of this. Who are you? Are you a high school intern, hoping for some valuable experience during the summer break? Perhaps you're my therapist, who finds herself tempted to push the boundaries of acceptable treatment? Or maybe you're a fellow patient, some MILF-esque hottie who twisted her arm at tennis and hasn't gotten to play with balls for some time.

You'll have to tell me. I'm just sitting here in the waiting room, my nose in my phone, not contemplating the fact that I'm about to get a hell of a lot more out of my $30.00 copay than I ever imagined.

If you're intrigued, describe your character and send me an opening post! As always, I'm most interested in the teasing, temptation, and build-up; those looking to dive right into the dirty need not apply. Open to suggestions or alterations you'd enjoy, most non-extreme kinks, and any of my older prompts.
Hope to hear from you! ;)"
4wgnh0,47,2016-08-06,Finding housing in NYC- for interns,herebecats,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/4wgnh0/finding_housing_in_nyc_for_interns/,"So some people have asked how to go about finding housing in NYC. I've done a term there and learned a lot so I figured I'd share what I know.

First of all let it be known that finding housing in NYC is a mission and a half.
So if you want to avoid all the hassle and be sure you won't get scammed call up 92Y (Uni residence housing) and pay $1900/mo. 
Its a pretty decent place to live in terms of location and perks (even if its a little expensive).

Now if you really want to put in the effort of finding a place below are the expected min price for each part of NY. If you see a listing outside of these ranges chances are its a scam or a bait and switch (broker will say ""oh this one is taken but I have these 10 other properties you might be interested in"").

- Manhattan (below 100th st) -&gt; $1500/mo if you REALLY look but $1700 if you're in a rush
- Brooklyn  (close to the east river) -&gt; $1200 if you REALLY look but $1400 if you're in a rush
- Queens -&gt; $900 *but its really far from everything

In terms of safety vs geography if you REALLY want to stay in Manhattan (highly recommended for the first time since you will be within 30 mins of all the action and your commute will be short) just stay below 100th st and you will be fine (TBH all of Manhattan is fine if you aren't that picky). 
For Brooklyn the rule of thumb is to stay close to the river and near Manhattan. Absolutely avoid the south eastern half of Brooklyn.
As for Queens its all pretty safe.

Now on to the actual finding of housing. Before we get into details there are a few things you need to absolutely understand about NY housing. 

- The housing market is constantly on fire. An apartment can get snapped up within minutes of the posting going up (usually within hours or days though).

- You should make it clear to landlords that you will be on a paid internship and it will pay well enough for you to comfortably pay rent (most landlords aren't aware that interns can make as much as you will likely be making in NY and will try to charge you 4 months worth of rent deposit).

- You will likely need to give a 1 - 2 months worth of rent deposit (try to avoid giving 2 months).

- Brokers are everywhere (Brokers are people who hook up tennants with landlords often at exhorbitant prices).

- Landlords/ brokers will ask you for an application fee. They use this to run a credit check/ to make sure you are for real. An application fee over $50 is stretching it. Over $100 is an absolute ripoff (avoid them).

- If you want an apartment you will need to hand over the application fee + the deposit. Only then will the landlord take the apartment off the market. ABSOLUTELY do not hand the landlord cash for the deposit. Always use a bank check (not a cashiers check but an normal check).

- There are scammers everywhere. BE CAUTIOUS.

Alright now that you have some context here is the absolute optimal way to find affordable housing in NY.

Notes:

1. Do NOT commit to anything (and do not transfer any money to ANYONE) without having seen the property and spoken with the landlord
2. Avoid brokers unless their fee will be paid by the owner of the property
3. Deal directly with the landlord and try to go for landlord listings (ie. listings without a broker in the middle)
4. Use StreetEasy and Facebook groups to find landlords. AVOID craigstlist and padmapper. They're filled with scams and they're a waste of time (too many listings on a poorly made website).
5. Get receipts for ALL funds you transfer to ANYONE (this is essential).
6. The more roommates you have the better/cheaper (join up with other interns going to NYC from UW)

* Step 1: Book an AirBnb for a week starting a week before your start date (preferably starting on a Monday).
* Step 2: Fly out to NYC a week before your internship start date and stay at the AirBnb.
* Step 3: Start making appointments to see places a few days before flying out and continue to do so until you find your place.
* Step 4: Sign the lease and move in.

You should be able to find a place within a few days.

Some final things to note. 
In terms of subway stations downtown (south) Manhattan is packet with them. Midtown Manhattan doesn't have as many but still you're never more than a 5-10 min walk from a station. Upper East side and Upper West side subway stations are more sparse. 
Brooklyn has a alot less stations the frequency of which steadily decreases as you move east. Queens has even few stations.

The cheapest areas in Manhattan are Chinatown and Lower east side. 

Thats about all I have for now. I'll probably add more lated.

4wgslc,5,2016-08-06,"[PI] Dropout, Meltdown, Lovestruck - 4yrs - 4490",Atricity,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4wgslc/pi_dropout_meltdown_lovestruck_4yrs_4490/,"I couldn’t take it any longer. For three months I’d been lying to everyone I know about going to college. I had chosen a study that didn’t interest me at all as I found out after a couple of months. Probably already knew before I started it, but I only admitted it to myself now. I sat in the train, finally realizing I had to tell someone. 

I rang the doorbell. Tony got his own apartment in the city. He had a kind of breakthrough with a company providing bigger companies help with social media called SoCo. He wasn’t the next Mark Zuckerberg, but he had a good income and didn’t even have to go to college. Some people just have  good ideas like that. I always remember how he was drunk as hell and looked out of his eyes like he just saw the light. ‘Social media is the future’ is the only thing he said before leaving. Before I knew it, he had started up a small site and got his first response only a couple days later. I just wish I had had an idea like that. 

Tony opened the door and lit up. ‘Mike, I haven’t see you in a while! Come on in man.’ I stepped in and looked around. I had been here only once before, when it wasn’t exactly decorated. It looked pretty impressive now. ‘What do you think of the new interior? I got a friend to help me decorate the place, figured it was good for when reporters might come around.’ I was impressed, and a little jealous, that he got all his shit together. He had been my best friend ever since kindergarten, but he was never a guy who got shit done at school. On the other hand, he had a lot of charisma and was liked by pretty much everyone. He was a good guy to everyone, whatever social group you belonged to. I was lucky to be best friends with him, it got me invited to a lot of parties. Despite all the attention from other people, he always found time to hang out with me. He was pretty much like a brother to me. The charisma he had surely helped get his company where it was now. He deserved this more than anyone I knew.
After talking about how things were going at his work, he stopped for a second and asked: ‘Enough about me though, what prompted you to visit me out of the blue like that? It sounded kind of serious over the phone.’ It was difficult for me not to tell him it was nothing and that I just wanted to see him again, because I really didn’t want to disappoint him. He was so successful, it was difficult to admit that I was such a failure. I knew I couldn’t walk away from it though. ‘I had to tell you first, because I don’t think I could get it off my chest with someone else.’ He got a worried look. ‘What’s wrong man?’

I told him about how I just wanted to quit. Why I felt that way, how I didn’t make any new friends at college, how I was basically isolated except for the interaction I had with my roommate once in a while, which wasn’t much more than a good morning or him telling me he’d have his girlfriend over that night. How I failed every midterm and was probably getting kicked out if I didn’t get my shit together fast. He just sat there and listened, trying to console me when it got too difficult for me to continue talking. It felt awful and great at the same time. It felt good to let go of all this anger and sadness inside of me. ‘- and now I have to go back home and tell my parents how I failed everything and how I have no plan whatsoever for my life.’ He stood up. ‘I’m going to get my PlayStation and we’ll play some FIFA like in the good old days. I need a while to let it all sink in, but I’ll help you get through this. We’re best friends after all.’ I got a smile. It probably was the first time I had genuinely smiled in weeks. ‘Sounds like a plan to me.’

It seemed like we just sat there playing games for hours. It felt like the good old days in high school, without many concerns about what the future would be like. No need to worry about school, finances, what you were going to do next. I wanted that back more than anything, but life goes on. After reminiscing about high school for an hour or so, Tony finally got back to the topic at hand. ‘Alright Mike, this is what you’re going to do. You’re going to stay with me for a while to figure out what’s happening next year and what you’re going to tell your parents. Meanwhile, there’s probably some work you could do at my company in return for staying here plus a little extra money to help you out.’ I hugged him. This is what I needed. A little time to think and get my shit together. ‘Thanks Tony, I owe you.’ Tony smiled. ‘It’s the least I can do for you after all the great times we had back in the day.’



I had been working for Tony for three weeks now. The work I had to do was pretty boring and frankly quite shitty. At least other people in the office didn’t know how I got the job. When anyone asked me, I just said I was taking a gap year and was just really interested in this company because of how new it was. Tony said it might be a better story than dropping out of college and getting a job from your best friend as a favor, which is probably true. I sometimes wondered if he wanted to hide the fact I was his friend though.

Most of the days I got home to an empty apartment. Tony worked a lot afterhours and had business school 3 evenings a week. He needed to learn some more about the corporate world if he wanted his business to grow. While he was still gone, I just played video games. Tony had a shit ton of them, although I doubted if any of them had been touched in the past couple of months. Work made me numb. The hours were long and dreadful and all I wanted to do once I got home was to just relax. I didn’t get how Tony really did it.

When Tony did get home before 8 pm, he was still on the phone half the time to manage all the people who took over the social media in the evening. I once asked him if he shouldn’t take a break, but he just said I didn’t understand how difficult it was to run the business. That hurt quite a bit to hear. He apologized later, but it still stuck with me.



I got home after another day of extra crappy work. I was basically an errand-boy all day. Tony even sent me out to get donuts for the entire company because they reached a milestone of some sort. I didn’t really care anymore, most pricks at work just saw me like some kind of slave that they could boss around if they needed something. I got out the leftovers of takeout yesterday and put it in the microwave. Tony got home and walked into the kitchen. ‘Hey Mike, didn’t see you leave. Amazing, how we have finally reached the 100 client milestone, right?’ He didn’t even know how pissed I was about him bossing me around like his personal assistant today. I just smiled and congratulated him. ‘I was actually planning on going out to eat somewhere with some of the guys, but I see you’ve already made something. I’ll see you tonight then, alright?’ I had to control my anger. It wasn’t like I already ate some of the old leftovers. I guess it was just a convenient way of not having to take me out with the better people in the company. ‘Yeah, see you tonight. Have fun mate.’



‘Hey Mike, can you get-‘ I couldn’t take it any longer. This arrogant dude had been asking for the most bizarre little things all morning long, this was probably the 10th time he had asked for me in the past hour. For weeks, he had just been giving me crap. ‘Go get it yourself, douche.’ I walked past his office before he could really react. I just heard a ‘What the fuck’ from the distance.

I walked out of the office and to the nearest Starbucks to get a coffee for myself, instead of getting some for the pricks I’m supposed to call coworkers, even though they were more like managers, all above me. ‘The usual Mike?’ Cassie asked. She was the barista here. We sort of got to know each other over the last couple of weeks, as far as some small talk and a little flirting could be considered getting to know each other. ‘Nah, I quit my job. I’ll just get something for myself today.’ Cassie laughed. ‘I wish I had the luxury to quit.’ I thought about it. ‘I don’t think I have that luxury, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.’ I ordered my coffee and went to sit. My phone started ringing. Tony. So he did actually still now I existed, at least when it is his problem that I’m not there.

I took out my laptop and started researching some of the colleges I might be interested in for next year. To be honest, I wasn’t interested in the in the slightest. I hated that life needed you to take on responsibilities you didn’t even want. You just wanted to travel around and explore. You needed gear for that though, and for that you needed money, and for that you need a job. I didn’t want to be homeless, but I didn’t want to work either. For now I still had my bedroom in Tony’s apartment. He called me for the third time. I picked up. ‘What happened Mike? Where the hell did you go?’ He didn’t sound worried. He just sounded angry. Figures really, of course I had done something stupid, it wasn’t one of his real friends, his coworkers, who had done something stupid. It had to have been me. ‘See you tonight Tony, if you don’t have a meeting like always.’ I hung up before he could react. The phone rang again but I just turned off the sound and let it go. I put on a movie I had downloaded and just sat there in the Starbucks, avoiding the confrontation waiting for me tonight. 

I didn’t realize how long I’d been sitting there, but Cassie got to my table. ‘You’ve been sitting here quite a while now. Don’t have anywhere to go?’ She was in her normal clothes. Her shift probably had ended, it was 6PM. ‘I’m somewhat avoiding going home.’ She sat down. ‘Want to grab something to eat and tell me what you’re trying to avoid?’ I laughed. ‘Are you asking me out on a date?’ She stood up and gestured me to get up. ‘I’ve been flirting with you for the past couple of weeks and you’re not doing it, so I guess I have to.’ She tried to come over as confident, but she was as red as a tomato. ‘You’re right, I should have asked to go out with you weeks ago. Better late than never though, am I right?’

We went to a little Chinese place and I talked about the situation with Tony and how I was trying to figure things out with college. She talked about how she also dropped out of college and was now working as a barista to earn enough money to live here and take some time to think about what she wanted to do. Her parents were very disappointed in her and she just didn’t want to go home and depend on them after letting them down. We were more alike than I had thought. After paying the bill, she insisted on splitting, we got up and walked around for a bit. My phone was ringing again. ‘Do you mind? I need to figure this out.’ She nodded and I picked up. ‘Listen Tony-‘ Before I could get a word in, Tony started yelling into the phone. ‘Listen Mike, this shit is just too much. You’re a mess. I got you this job to figure things out, but all you’ve been doing is depressing everyone with your negative attitude and playing videogames on the fucking PlayStation till 2 AM in the morning. Then you quit and this afternoon on the phone you just act like it’s all fucking my fault that you’re in a shitty situation when the only thing I’ve done is trying to help you. Please don’t come here anymore. In fact, lose my number. Good luck getting your own shit together.’ He hung up without giving me a chance to say anything. It hurt. It hurt a lot. Cassie looked at me with a worried face. ‘What did he say?’

After the initial shock and Cassie trying to cheer me up, we sat down on the sidewalk. She grabbed my hand and stared into the distance. We didn’t say anything for about five minutes. She broke the silence. ‘This might be a bit early, but because of the situation I think you might appreciate it. If you want you can sleep on my couch tonight, that’s okay. I don’t want you to be out here on the streets all night. Don’t get any funny ideas of sneaking into my bed or anything though.’ A tear rolled down my cheek. ‘You’ve only known me for one day and you’re offering me to stay with you, I can’t accept that offer.’ She sighed. ‘I want you to. I really like you. I don’t want you to get beaten up by homeless people or anything. Besides, I’ve known you for weeks, our coffee servings were the most intimate I’ve ever had.’ I couldn’t help but let a chuckle escape. Even after a shitty situation like this, she was able to make a joke and cheer me up. I kissed her. ‘Thanks Cassie. You’re the most wonderful girl I’ve ever met.’
Her apartment was pretty small. She had a bathroom and a room which basically was a kitchen, living room and bedroom in one. She got an extra blanket for me on the couch and went into the bathroom to change. I brushed my teeth using the kitchen sink and got on the couch. ‘Goodnight Mike. Sleep tight.’ She put a kind of screen between her bed and the couch for privacy. 

I couldn’t sleep. Not because the couch wasn’t comfortable, but the words Tony said kept going through my head. We had been friends since we were little kids, and now it was all ruined. All because I fucked up. I needed to figure out what to do with my life. He was right. I hadn’t really done anything besides playing video games after hours, when I should have looked ahead. I didn’t take my job seriously and probably wouldn’t have been so bored if I had put more effort in. It was time for me to face responsibilities and get my life together. Short term happiness was something I had valued too much. I looked at the screen between me and Cassie. It was a crazy thought after one date, but if I wanted to stay together with her, I couldn’t be a freeloading roommate/boyfriend to her. I had to get my own place and get a job or go back to college. 

I spent the entire night thinking about what I would do. I realized traveling around was just a stupid idea I got in my head to escape reality. I still had to tell my parents about what was going on, I still had to take care of actually resigning from college. Since I couldn’t sleep, I figured I’d do the resignation at 4 AM, considering it could easily be done online. A lot easier than resigning from a gym. Cassie woke up to go to the toilet. When she got off it, she saw me working on my laptop. ‘Why aren’t you sleeping?’ ‘Couldn’t. I have to get my life together, might as well do it now.’ She sat next to me on the couch. ‘Let me help you. Don’t really need a lot of sleep anyway.’ I spent the next hour searching for jobs in the city together with Cassie. She pointed out which ones I shouldn’t bother with. It was just for the next couple of months, before the new semesters started. At 5:30 AM, after bookmarking several job offers and typing up a resume, we called it quits. A few more hours of sleep before she had to get up for work.
‘Mike, you up?’ Cassie was standing in front of me. She didn’t have any makeup on, but she still looked beautiful. ‘I made some eggs, if you want some.’ I nodded. I was tired as hell. It was only 7:30, I had gotten less than 2 hours of sleep. I decided to wake up anyway, considering I loved eggs. Mainly eggs made by Cassie, but that was beside the point. ‘Thanks, I’ll sit so you can join me. Besides, it’s much easier to eat eggs that way.’ She made us both a plate with some bread and scrambled eggs and a glass of orange juice. She sat beside me. ‘You look like you slept like shit. Hope you didn’t spend hours staring at me while I was sleeping.’ A girl who has a little dark kind of humor, she really had everything. ‘Don’t worry, I actually spent most of my time how I could fix my relationship with a guy.’ She laughed and orange juice almost got out of her nose. ‘So first you kiss me so I let you in my home and then you start telling me you’re gay? At least I know it’s safe to have you here now.’ ‘Maybe I’m just bisexual, you’d better watch out with guys who trick you into letting them stay over for the night.’ 

We joked around a little more. Sleep deprivation was a good way to keep the mood light. We finished our food and she stopped laughing. ‘I really like joking around, but we need to talk business now. I don’t mind it for maybe a few more days, but I normally don’t want to start a relationship by living together. And what about your friend?’ I told her what I had done last night and early in the morning and about my plan to get a job and find an apartment. I still had enough money to get into a hotel till I found one, but she insisted on me staying at her place as long as I did the cooking, since she always had to work till 6 PM. 

I had a job interview at a local Greek restaurant which I felt fairly positive about. It might not pay the most, but you were allowed to keep the tips you got. I went to two more job interviews after that, but none were really as good as the first one. The last one was at a grocery store. The manager wanted to hire me immediately, but the hours would be fairly irregular and the pay wasn’t much more than the Greek restaurant. I wanted to wait for that first. I got some groceries and went back to Cassie’s place to start preparing the food. 

It was 4:30 PM and I had already prepped all the food. I took two tests on the internet that are supposed to tell you what job is good for you. I wish I had done those before I ever chose what to study a couple of months ago. They might not be 100% accurate, but they did give me a good idea what I should be looking for. I looked up some colleges that offered courses I was interested in. I felt so guilty. I spent one day actually trying to get my shit together and to be honest, it was all the time I needed for a basic plan.

My phone rang. My dad I still hadn’t told my parents. ‘Hey dad, I wanted to call you.’ ‘Well good. Tony called. We know about you dropping out son. Why didn’t you tell us?’ The disappointment in his voice was a cruel reminder of what I had done the past couple of weeks. Neglecting everyone I cared about. I told my dad how sorry I was, how stupid I had been and how I spent the day trying to make everything better. He sounded relieved after I told him about the job applications I had done and the time I spent on figuring out what to do next year. ‘So you’ll stay in the city for the next couple of months?’ ‘Yes dad, I need to figure things out here. I kind of met someone too, but it’s nothing serious yet. I just want to see where that goes. Besides that, I have something I need to fix here.’ My dad let out a sigh. ‘Tony was really angry Mike. I have to say, I can’t blame him. I really hope you can still fix it, you two should be friends. And also, keep at it. Don’t give up on your future son, even if things don’t work out. Both with Tony and that girl you mentioned.’ ‘I will dad.’

Cassie got home from work. ‘That smells good. Maybe I can keep you around for a little longer.’ I put the food on the table and sat down. ‘Maybe it just smells nice, but tastes like shit.’ She sat down too ‘Way too make me excited about food, talking about shit.’ We started eating and she talked about her day. ‘Listen, I also served Tony today.’ I looked up from my plate. ‘How did you know it was him? Have you been stalking me?’ She laughed. ‘You wish. No, he had the regular order you used to get and it was the first time I’d seen him, so I asked him if he worked for SoCo. He said he owned it, so I put two and two together.’ I didn’t feel very hungry anymore. He was so busy already, and now he was doing my job. ‘Did you say anything to him?’ ‘No, I figured it wouldn’t be the best idea to tell him I’m his old friend’s new girlfriend the day after he said he never wanted to see said friend again.’ I couldn’t help but smile. ‘Girlfriend, huh?’ She got some food of her plate and launched it at me with her fork. ‘Stop gloating doofus, or I might tell him tomorrow I’m your ex-girlfriend.’

After dinner and washing the dishes, I got a call from the Greek restaurant. I was hired and had to start next Monday, which gave me the weekend to meet up with Tony to set things straight. Cassie finished cleaning up in the kitchen, sat next to me and laid her head on my shoulder. ‘What are you going to do?’ I sighed. ‘I don’t know yet. I think I’m going to wait another night for him to cool off. Tomorrow is Sunday, he has the day off. Maybe if he isn’t totally in work mode, he has some time to cool off and will be able to at least not hate my guts.’ She set up straight. ‘As long as you apologize really well and show him what you’ve done, he’ll forgive you. You’ve been best friends since you were young and stood the test of time for this long. There’s no way that will just disappear.’ I looked at her. ‘This must be the weirdest start of a relationship you’ve ever experienced.’ She raised her shoulders. ‘Weird in a good way. Maybe you’d even like to come to the pub with me and my friends tonight, to meet them. We’ll tell them we’ve known each other for a couple of weeks though, don’t need people being judgmental.’ It felt like we had known each other for that long. I hugged her and kissed her.



Last night was great with Cassie’s friends. There was one other couple in her group of friends, two single girls and one single guy. They had all been very friendly. It was time to confront another friend though. It was 3 PM, Sunday afternoon. Cassie had offered to go with me, but I figured it is better to figure this out with just the two of us. I knocked on the door. Tony opened it. He looked like absolute shit, worse than the worst hangover we had experienced together. ‘Fuck off,’ he yelled. I could still smell the alcohol in his breath. ‘Tony, please let me talk for a second.’ I expected him to lose his shit. It first looked like he was about to burst. And he did burst. He burst into tears. I went in for a hug. We stood there, hugging, for probably half a minute. ‘I’m sorry man.’ I was kind perplexed. ‘There’s no need to be sorry. I’m the one who should be apologizing.’ He gestured me inside. A couple of half empty bottles of strong alcoholic drinks stood on the table. A PlayStation controller laid broken in front of a broken TV. ‘Your dad called me back. About how you got your shit together and how you wanted nothing more than to repair our friendship. I fucked it up.’ He looked so broken. ‘When you came to me for help, I thought I did everything I could to help you. But I didn’t. I was too focused on my stupid business and I didn’t feel like hiring a stupid intern, so I gave you the shittiest job. When I was at home, I was only thinking about the company. I never once offered you any help.’ I didn’t know what to say. I had no idea Tony felt like this. ‘I’m at least as much at fault here. I never once spoke up about hating the job. Even if you didn’t help me, I should have taken responsibility for my own life and own future. You shouldn’t blame yourself man.’ He looked at me, tears still in his eyes. He extended his hand. ‘I’m sorry about what I said yesterday. Friends?’ I shook his hand. ‘No. Not friends. Best friends.’

*Hope you like it. I wanted to do much more with the prompt, and maybe eventually I will, but I like the version that came out of it. There's more to explore with what Cassie is going to do and how this encounter with his best friend is going to effect Tony and the way he runs the company, not to forget Mike's relationship with his parents, but I'd need more words. When I started 4444 words seemed like a lot, but once you're on a roll it's not enough.*

I did an online HackerRank challenge for a somewhat big company, which I expected it to be extremely hard and filtering because they take very little interns and I'm almost certain that hundreds of people applied. I honestly expected to have a better performance, but I couldn't even get past three of nine challenges without cheating.

It's kind of abstract and funny in a sad way. I expected to be really angry because I have been practicing for months now, getting ready for this challenge. Read Cracking the Coding Interview, read CLRS, did several challenges on CodeWars, HackerRank and LeetCode and even then I got utterly destroyed.

All it really does is make me wonder where I'm standing. I thought I was going to be capable enough, but seemingly I might not be. That's fine, I guess. There's no other way around. I'll just keep practicing and getting better, if my mood gets lighter than what it currently is.

Thank you all for the space to vent and for the continuos support towards every doubt we might have. I hope my experience is useful in some way, maybe for aspirants and people to see that failure and disappointment is real, but that it's not as big of a deal as it looks. Just keep being you. I know I'll try.

Best of luck to all of you in your careers!

I've started to look for jobs now and I'm thinking l would like to find a more generalists software development job. The idea of working on hugely different projects in different languages sounds exciting to me. However, it seems like most new grad jobs are either front end, back end, Java dev, C++ dev, etc. 

For reference, I have been using mainly C++ through my schooling and internships. On my github I have done some exercises, like the ones listed in 7 languages in 7 weeks, using languages I am unfamiliar with. 


How would I go about finding jobs aligned with my interests? Is being a generalists not all its cracked up to be?

I started college off by going for a biology major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln but decided that my interests were more on the math and engineering side.  I took a very simple programming class in my senior year of high school and my interest for coding started then.  With this new found knowledge that my interests were in math and that there was a large amount of jobs in computer science and SE (I didn't actually know that before going to UNL) I decided to switch schools and enroll myself in the computer science department at my current school.

I like working with computers a lot and not knowing how each piece of it works bugs me to death so I am also planning on spending an extra year to major in EE.  I have taken two computer science classes so far and I have loved them to death, I love being able to make small programs and I love showing them to my family(even though they usually don't take too much interest in them).  My dream job is to work for a big company such as IBM or Google but I am also kind of worried about a few things.

1) I have really enjoyed my first few EE classes but I am wondering if those are just wasting my time where I could be focusing on software.

2) I was wondering what are the next steps for me.  I am going to a small university that a lot of big companies probably don't know about so I am trying to find out how to set myself apart from other people from bigger universities, especially things I can do right now.

3) Lastly I was just wondering if there are some good internships I can look into that would help or if I don't have enough experience in CS yet what I class I would have to go through to learn them.

I would like to point out that my college has only a software engineering minor(and they only just added that) and I was wondering if that puts me at a disadvantage or not."
4whewk,2,2016-08-06,Pretence,theOmnipotentKiller,theOmnipotentJournal,https://www.reddit.com/r/theOmnipotentJournal/comments/4whewk/pretence/,"Pretence in talk. Pretence in walk. Pretence in action. Pernicious pretence.

I am going 100% frank in this post. (Something I should ideally do in every post, but you are who you believe you are)

I am slowly coming to realise that my life is quite atypical. I lead an enriched life; having met a plethora of personalities, bred in a multiple environments. This has pushed me to always look deeper into things. A bad side-effect to this practice is that I often overthink small matters. While my problem of overthinking is gradually dying out, another problem has sprung up and it is taking up my attention. If you haven't already read the title, it is: pretence.

One of my main objectives in coming to IITB is to focus entirely on self-improvement. Under self-improvement, one of my main themes has been improving my diction. As my father says, the most important piece of garment is your language. That line echoes in my head everyday. It echoes in my mind when my fingers swiftly type out the words of this passage. ""Use a better word!"" ""Go for a different sentence structure"" ""Rethink"" ""Reword"" ""Assemble coherently""- Every single time that I write something these statements rampage my mind. 

Language is important. However, if you don't have anything of substance to say then you are wasting your own time. Trump and other similar politicians are the epitome of this statement. Now, this is where all threads are spun together. 

Often I overthink what I need to say in an attempt to seem like I have something of substance to say. Succinctly stated, I use my words as a whetstone to sharpen my language. Words are the most powerful possession for any person; not a tool to be abused. Here I would like to emphasise an essay written by George Orwell, [Politics and the English Language](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm). In this essay, George Orwell explains how politicians choose to abuse the English language in an attempt to dazzle people. The fluff around their words overpowers the original message, often rendering it meaningless. Again, a prime example is Trump.

Pretence comes in here for me. I want to do a lot of things. The things that I want to do are generally overly ambitious. In conversation, whenever the subject of what I want to do comes up (or whenever I push it in) I put on this air of pretence which makes me feel unpleasant. This is one of my shortcomings. Anyone can talk big. I can talk big with substance because of all the self-help material I have read and the real life badasses I know. Acting on it is obviously an entirely different matter. The perpetual problem of bridging the gap between action and words has plagued me for the most of this year. 

When one of your closest friends is going out there scoring highly lucrative internships, meeting awesome people and working on fascinating problems, you will feel a pressure to 'do something with your life', in the crudest words. Those words capture the feeling I have. In IIT Bombay (India in general), the students are surrounded by a bubble which doesn't consist of people like my close friend. My friend lives in a completely different world where his achievements are somewhat common place. In every domain of life there are higher dimensions left to be unlocked. Common people are blissfully ignorant of these worlds.

Returning from the digression, how pretence plays into my life in the following way- when male college students get together they invariably talk about women. Admittedly, I did so as well. Not only because convention dictated this, but also because I wanted to. I am personally fascinated by the concept of a different gender and the concept of love. So most certainly I want to join in on this collective craze about women. This is where the trap lies really. Social problems and women are a captivating topic of conversation, but they push out the conversations that actually matter. Due to this realisation, I frequently try to introduce 'bigger' topics of conversation. This has led to me being merited with the title ""Guru-ji""; loosely translated in English to ""Professor"";more aptly translated in Japanese to ""Sensei"". Pretence comes in when I consciously try to push out the subject of woman from conversation.

If the flow of conversation is along the lines of who to ask out for Salsa Night (an event which is a cause of great headache), I follow along for a bit before I inevitably get bored of the subject of women. Consequently I start speaking about, ""What do you want to do in college?""

I don't know if that sounds pretentious to others but it does to me. However, that is something I really care about. The problem is that status quo in IITB makes me believe that this is not the case for me. It is an amateur version of an identity crisis. That prolific friend regularly reminds of my ambitions, but when I state my ambitions to the students here, I come off as pretentious (in my opinion at least). Frankly, that might even true. I have not done much ever since I have entered IITB to move towards realising my goals. Maybe that is because I was adjusting to the environment, or maybe because I was trying to my foothold in the community, but I think I have found solid ground. 

This is the part which makes me cringe. In my post, [SISIWDBDANIHMFI](https://www.reddit.com/r/theOmnipotentJournal/comments/4genq8/sisiwdbdanihmfi/), Shit I Said I Would Do But Didn't And Now I Hate Myself For It, (could have better worded as Hypocrisy), I clarify how much I repulsed by my own hypocrisy. Since I am already on a streak of honesty, let me be honest about one last thing: I show off. 

Yuck. I show off. Disgusting. I show off. Stop. I show off. Don't. I show off. Scandalous. I show off. I hate you. I show off. Please stop. I show off. No, don't.

I detest myself for this. Pretence and showing off. It cripples my emotional state. I am saddened that this person is me. Show off is a low standard that I thought I would never stoop to. In an attempt, to make myself known or, perhaps, to make myself heard, I flaunt my achievements like a maniac. I have to stop this. Whenever I say, ""I went to the International Olympiad"", I feel like vomiting my guts out. Sorry for the graphic imagery, but that is what I feel. 

I speculate that I received this trait from my mother, but this is something I can't blame others for. My personality is in my hand. In a similar way of eliminating hook words from my speech, I think the first step with obliterating this toxic trait would be to acknowledge every time that I do this, then stop. My character should be sufficient to convince someone to converse with me. If I need to do more, then it was never meant to be.

Now, however, I have found the people who are willing to listen and I love talking with. College is going to be the most exciting time of my life because I am going to make it as such. I have had enough of lying in wait for fortune to come. Even the clubs of IIT Bombay cannot ensure my excellence, in the end it comes down to me. They can help facilitate the superhuman dedication required to accomplish something significant, but I need to push myself. My close friend did it on his own. Granted that his circumstances were particularly exceptional, there are still people in his community who made their way there of their own will. Over the last months I kept repeating to myself that determination is not the special formula for success; it is self discipline. Now I realise that it is an equal mix of both. Determination is required to push yourself off that initial resistance. Last week when I was working on my freelance assignment I constantly pushed forth trying to complete my story. Whenever I faced external distraction I trumped them because of my zealous pursuit for my first pay-check. In the end I decided to give up because I didn't want to compromise on my academics. Now, however, I feel that it might have been a foolish decision. No matter. My first semester will be about finding my balance with academics, exploring my institute and others in my institute. As for pretence, I vow to fight it. I must fight. Showing off make my insides scream. Moreover, I have lost a few habits which previously made me feel great: learning Japanese and Gymming. I will now focus on reinstating them in my life.

Finally in conclusion what I must accomplish for now is:

1. Pay attention to my pretence and eliminate it

2. Push myself towards my goals more seriously

3. Reacquire my old habits

So until next time! (Whoever reads anymore)"

So I'm a first time poster and a longish time lurker. Been enjoying tfts for a year or two now. The best part of my internet day. Hope you enjoy my first tale.

I'm working at a computer. We do support, installations, homecalls and sell stuff. We're is a tight-nit group of very diverse personalities. The cast of this tale:

&gt; $HPI - honest, polite and not the brightest intern

&gt; $ASG - Awesome Sales Guy and kind of the boss.

&gt; $DNA - Yours truly

First off, we practice, or try to practice, OCD in everything we do. OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder and often mean that you check things more than once to be absolute sure. We don't all manage this every time to say the least. $ASG introduced this because he was tired of all the big and small errors we found after the customers arrived to collect their computers.

It was a pretty regular day, when $HPI comes over, looking pale and asks me if I'll join him in the other room. I'm his immediate boss and supervisor, so I'm the guy he would ask for most things.

&gt; $HPI: $DNA, please, please, don't be mad at me.

&gt; $DNA: *What the heck is going on here.*

&gt; $HPI: I messed up real bad.

&gt; $DNA: Care to show me? *How bad can it be?*

&gt; $HPI: I am so sorry. I can pay for it. Or you can take it from my salary.

&gt; $DNA: *OK, that bad.*

$HPI works at an interns salary, meaning it would be little left this month if he fucked up bad enough.

&gt; $DNA: No worries. Just show me and we'll figure something out.

He show me the laptop he's working on and tells me he was changing the HDD to an SSD. There are a lot of different screws and somehow the they got mixed up. He turns it over and voila.

&gt; $HPI: I managed to drill the longest screw through the computer. It's poking out on the top bezel.

On the palm rest of the laptop I see a screw poking out. I could not help to laugh. It's just too good. A little resistance? No problem. Use more force! My mind is screaming in all caps: **You drilled a hole in a brand new laptop!**.

&gt; $DNA: That's just... I'm... Heh. What. How. *What do I say to this?* No worries. Go talk to $ASG and let him figure it out.

$ASG is also the main hardware guy.

&gt; $HPI: Could you, please, PLEASE, join me when I talk to him? I'm honestly afraid of his reaction!

$ASG is unfortunately known for getting angry when people f+#k up. So we walk over together and do a little show and tell. To my surprise $ASG laughs as well when he realizes what has happened.

We ended up not taking the poor interns money, but he lost his power drill privileges. Yes, seriously. It's one of those power drills made for electronics and laptops, not the 24V **$Milkywayky*.

The laptop had the regular sticker on it with all the specs, and after assembling the laptop with all the screws in the right places, $ASG moved the sticker to cover the whole. To be fair, the hole was small and there was no real damage. You might be thinking we sold it to some unknowing bloke, but we're not that kind of shop. We really aren't. $ASG had a friend who bought it at a reasonable price, after we told him about the mishap.

**TL;DR:** Check, check and triplecheck.

4whihg,2,2016-08-06,Something is sticking out of my gum on the tongue side of #32. What is it? Pics included,shaynedwyer,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/4whihg/something_is_sticking_out_of_my_gum_on_the_tongue/,"Hello r/dentistry.

Three or four weeks ago I started feeling pain behind #32 on the top of the gum. It almost felt like another tooth was trying to rupture through the gum - I noticed the pain while brushing my teeth. A few days go by and the pain does not go away and now its on the gum line on the tongue side too, so I assume some sort of popcorn kernel is stuck in my gum because I had just eaten some popcorn a day or two before I started noticing the pain.

I had some of those gum brand soft bristle food remover things handy and tried to get what I thought was a kernel out. I really agitated my gums and I couldn't find anything. By the end of it the gum was real loose and I could easily get the little tools in there. Went around the tongue side and the back side and while sensitive, nothing was coming out. Because I agitated the gum and dug around it was a tad bit painful even when not touching it.

When poking around with my finger however now I had direct pain when touching the tongue side gum below the molar on the part where you can feel the tooth kind of sticking out a bit. It feels like a semi circle, and I have this sticking out feeling on both the left and right side in the same spot. However now below 32 where the sticking out is, instead of it being rounded like the other one it feels sharp and pointed. like something us under there. Looking in the mirror I saw a white dot on he tongue side below 32 but it was very tiny and I didn't think anything of it.

So on a Friday I scheduled a dentist appointment to get it checked out and see if they can figure out what's going on with my gum. Between college and moving across the country, internships and jobs and all that I hadn't been to the dentist in probably 4 years. I don't particularly care for the dentist so I just never made it there.

Monday comes and I go to the appointment with a new dentist in a new area so they don't know my history or my mouth etc. I was seen in an ""emergency visit"" so there wasn't full cleaning done etc. They took an x-ray of #32 that just shows the cheek side and didn't see anything. The dentist poked around the gum and went all the way around in-between the gum and the tooth and didn't find anything. I told him about the sharp pain feeling object below the gum when I was telling my story and he didn't say anything specific about it. By Monday at the appointment the pain had subsided most of the way anyways so the doctor said I probably got whatever it was out, didn't notice it, and now I'm just feeling the tenderness and soreness as a residual effect. 

That's all fine and dandy so I schedule a time to come back in two weeks for a full cleaning and x-rays and all. 

Fast forward two weeks and now we get to the current situation. Over that time the pain and soreness did go away but now I felt kind of a soreness further down below my tongue where the soft flimsy tissue meets the rigid gum line. There is some stinging and overall just soreness. Just today I stuck my finger back there and felt the soreness under my tongue, but then also felt that sharp spot and upon touching it was painful. As I rubbed it back and forth with my finger, the sharp spot on the gum line felt rough. With my fingernail I dug at the Sharp spot and felt the gum tear away. Now I can definitely feel something that is hard and rough. As I rub it with the tip of my finger nail I can hear in my ear like im digging at something. Whatever it is that is rough is not painful but the area on the gum immediately around it and the soft tissue below the tongue is painful for sure. And the jaw is painful when I dig at it too.

I thought I had all four wisdom teeth removed when I was a teenager, but after just counting them in my mouth it appears I only had my top two removed?


I tried my best to take pictures of it that I've attached below. It's the white bump below 32. Any idea what this could be?

4whiuf,0,2016-08-06,Pain. Living through hell. Life never turned topsy-turvy this fast.,murakami_irwin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4whiuf/pain_living_through_hell_life_never_turned/,"Before I unload all of this mental baggage, let me introduce myself:

I'm the son of two diplomats, and because of the nature of my parents' work, I've moved around quite a bit. Born in France, I lived in 6 countries before I turned 14, when my parents decided to move back to Australia so that I could get a good high school education, uninterrupted.

Because of this frequent practice of moving around, I grew up pretty introverted. I never blended in with the kids in the schools that I attended. I was branded a loner, and used to be bullied a lot. I was physically assaulted by kids in my high school, and never really had any real friends. Plus, my parents were extremely controlling. Each and every decision of my life was calculated and taken by them. I was supposed to listen to whatever they said. Also, my father indulged in a lot of domestic violence. He used to beat my mom, to the point at times she used to bleed profusely. And if I said anything, I would be beaten up as well. I used to cry a lot whenever alone, and because of having to deal with all of this, I became a really introverted individual and was naturally scared of people. Especially women. I have never had a girlfriend, and I feel really scared of them seeing the way in which my dad treated my mom. I never spoke to girls all through high school. I still get intimidated by people.

Given my circumstances, I was completely by myself, because of which books became my best friend. All I used to read other than study was read, because of which I became a pretty well-read and academic sort of person. My ""friends"" used to beat me up, make me do their homework, call me names and treat me like absolute shit.

When the time to go to college came about, I decided to come to the United States, where I presently reside, for college thanks to a generous scholarship. 

I came into this country last fall by myself like a petrified animal. The very fact that I was going to be finding myself in the middle of thousands of students in a couple days before move-in scared the soul inside me.  Move-in came, and there was a sea of freshmen and their parents. I got so anxious to the point I used to press elevator buttons hysterically in order to avoid having to share it with anyone or just walk 10 flights of stairs to avoid talking to people. I didn't want to be approached.

But as time progressed, I found myself in the middle of group projects and stuff, because of which I decided to make a few friends, but miserably failed since I couldn't find anyone of my type. 

Winter approached, and one of my Aussie neighbors who goes to a school in a neighboring state called me up to join him for Christmas. I saw this as an opportunity to force myself to branch out, and went to his place. I sucked hard, but I tried. When I came back to campus, I decided to branch out and befriended a bunch of people from my classes from spring semester. They weren't the best of people, as it turns out. Let's say A was the person I knew the most, in this new found group of friends.

Like I said before, I had this phobia of sorts of women. But I don't know how, before Spring break, I met this beautiful Japanese girl (let's name her Y). This extremely beautiful Japanese girl, the first one to ever make my head turn. I couldn't forget her, and through the next few weeks, I couldn't help myself but fall in love with her. 
But this new-found ability to fall in love with a girl didn't really give me any new-found courage. I would see her everyday, but still I couldn't gather the balls to go talk to her. I was ridiculously scared of approaching her. One day, I accompanied A to his girlfriend's dorm, where I saw Y. A caught me intently staring at Y, and forced it out of me. I told him I found Y really really cute, but I don't think I'd approach her. That evening, I facebook-stalked like a maniac, and found Y's name. I got so madly attracted to her to the point that A caught me doodling her name on my composition book during our piano class. He extracted it off me; that I fell in love. This dude, just went to his girl (Q from now on), who straight up went to Y and told her ""there's this guy living in X hall who likes you very much. He's extremely smart and nice, but horribly shy. I think you guys should talk."" I got scared that I couldn't muster the balls to walk past her for the next few days. 

But something positive that happened from this was how Q got me so many leads about Y. I came to know she was of my exact type (She was extremely academically oriented to the point she took the maximum number of credits possible every term), and in a quick turn of events, we began talking, and dating. We went out, and we gelled so well. She liked me. I loved her from the bottom of my heart. We used to have long intellectual conversations. Y, being an introverted individual as I was, wanted our relationship to stay under the grabs. I kept her word. Didn't even tell A or Q. At this turning point, Q and I got into a terrible argument which dragged on for a month. But now I had Y, so I didn't really give a shit.

Y came into my life at the right point in time. I came to know that my parents were fighting a bitter divorce lawsuit in the time that I was out of Australia. This rendered me completely broken. I was destroyed. True, they had a terrible relationship, but they did love each other. And both of loved me so madly. And the prospect of the entire family disintegrating literally had me crying myself to sleep every night. Financial support from my parents vanished, and I had to take up two on campus jobs to fend for myself. After Y came into my life, she became a support system of sorts. I never told her of what was happening back home since I didn't want her to listen to all of my problems in such an early stage of a budding relationship. Talking to her used to make me feel better, and sort of gave me a purpose of living life.

But as bad luck might have it, my roommate (let's name him K) saw Y and I going out and out of jealousy and insecurity, spread it. He told A and Q.  saw this as a perfect opportunity to fuck me over, and spread it all over her dorm to the point everyone began asking Y ""You've a boyfriend finally?"", ""Oh, you're finally seeing someone?"", ""Hey, you're making friends!?"", ""What kind of guys do you like?"" and lots of such questions that made her uncomfortable. Y never knew of the spat between Q and I, and Q kept asking her about me. Y started getting ridiculously weirded out, and started becoming increasingly quiet. She felt so uncomfortable.

Without my knowledge, Q and A approached Y's closest friend (R) and told them I needed help. R came into the picture, and with too many cooks, shit blew up.

Y decided to end everything, on a day I was supposed to take her out for Chinese after our study session at the library. She didn't even tell me anything. Just blocked me on everything: iMessage, Messenger, WhatsApp, even fucking Snapchat. I found this when waiting for her. This broke me. I tried establishing contact, no avail. I write a very emotional letter.
I finally get her give me 10 minutes, but it turned out to be our last conversation. She told me that me telling everyone of our growing relationship and being too revealing about my personal life (I didn't even) got her crazy uncomfortable, and she thought I wasn't a man of my words and put on this mask just to get her. She said she no longer felt comfortable around me (Remember, this is the kid who used to play with my arm all day and literally told me she liked my personality and me being around her all the time).
That last, parting conversation, which I saw as an opportunity to talk things out became something that killed the person in me with effect. That phase: the sudden dumping fucked me up so bad: I fucked up on quizzes bad, my parents decided to split, I got rejected for 4 credit cards, I nearly got killed twice and got mugged once. I started seeing her more often on campus, and her ignoring me used to lacerate me. She just blocked me on everything. I couldn't even go talk to her. 

Then, a week before finals, I came to know that my roommate K, A and Q: people whom I trusted betrayed me and backstabbed me. I don't even know what the fuck R went and spoke to her, either. I knew a few of her friends, but didn't want to go through the ""people knowing it"" crap once again.

I somehow managed to survive finals. It was horrible. The last two months of the semester were living hell. I got depressed. Called counseling helplines multiple times. I kept seeing her on campus and the sight killed me because here was this girl who liked me, who I loved. Guess what, she doesn't even acknowledge my existence now. I wanted to just talk to her for a few minutes, get her know that this was a horrible misunderstanding which would have solved everything. But till the day freshman year ended, I couldn't approach her. R turned hostile.

I decided to come back to Australia, rejecting two internship offers, citing the need for stabilizing myself mentally and taking some time off for myself. But after coming back, seeing my family disintegrate, get summoned to court for this divorce lawsuit, and the very thought of Y 24x7 has literally rendered me a mentally paralyzed man. At one point this break, I got so fucking depressed to the point that I called the suicide prevention helpline. I even decided to backpack in Africa and teach kids there to take all of this shit, especially the thought of her, off my head. I failed. Africa was the worst trip of my life. I kept thinking about her all day and night. I have been crying everyday, I have lost my appetite. I have gone off all forms of social media to the point I don't exist online anymore. If I go on social media, I'm surely going to look her up through some way or the other and get more depressed.

In a few weeks, we're going to be living in the same building and I'm going to be seeing her more often. Hell from the last two months of the last semester is going to repeat itself, this time over an entire year. I can see myself completely fucking myself up: destroying my grades, my personality, myself, everything. But I don't want to live this disgusting life again. Neither do I want to commit suicide at the age of 19. I can't let my parents, who have been going through a lot themselves to suffer, faced with the loss of their only son who they dote on. I will be letting down so many people, but given the way in which my soul's been murdered in cold blood completely because of others' actions, I do see me killing myself at a point in time soon.

Y, I just want to talk to you one last time. I love you so much. I still love you. I keep seeing your photographs, and there's this visible sense of pain stemming from the fact that I cannot. Y, I have subjected you to so much pain. But I didn't mess things up. People have. They were the wrong people to choose, but please Y, it wasn't me.

I love you so much. Please give me one more chance. Did you forget all those good times we had together? Have I been so vile a person that you just decided to forget me for good?

I could email you, but I don't want to do that and get blocked from that either.

Sincerely,
M_I"
4whruq,2,2016-08-06,ADHD and work,personposting,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4whruq/adhd_and_work/,"I just graduated college in May and am working full-time at a center for kids with autism. In college I was pretty lazy (or so it seemed - I wasn't diagnosed until very recently). I had very little interest in most of my classes and spent most of my free time getting high with my friends. At the time, the ideal life for me was working a job that allowed me to get by and continuing to prioritize friends and leisure time. I wanted to live in a cool place and ""live my life,"" as I often said. 

My job started out as an internship that I wasn't even crazy about. I had a loose plan to move to New York and do a service program there, but due to a number of factors I realized I wasn't ready to move far away yet. So I started working where I'd been interning because the alternative was possibly being jobless. 

At first it was really hard working in a high-stress environment. I was constantly making mistakes and forgetting little but super important things. I always felt like my coworkers were annoyed with me because they had to compensate for my errors. For a time I was really worried I was going to get fired because I felt like I wasn't ""on it"" enough to be a good therapist. 

When I started having suspicions about my deficits being pathological (I always have, but this was the first time it really concerned and impacted me), I decided to put more effort than my coworkers into my daily duties. I started making to-do lists for all of my sessions (I typically have 3-5 in a day) and another one that reminded me of what I needed to do before leaving at the end of the day. Even though it was a lot of extra hassle, these lists helped me stay on task and greatly reduced my (maybe irrational) anxiety about being fired. 

I've since been diagnosed and prescribed Strattera, which helps a bit but I may want to switch to something else eventually. I first noticed its effects all last week--I felt super clear-headed and a little more at ease socially. I was feeling really optimistic about it but then this week I sort of felt it drop off; I was forgetting things again and being really reserved. I've been a little sick and on my period so, I don't know, I guess those things could've affected the meds/my disposition. I'm just going to wait it out. 

OK, I haven't even touched on the reason I'm posting this. Since I started working my physical and mental energy is expended on very little aside from my job. Even though it's really difficult sometimes it's also probably the most rewarding thing I've done in my life thus far. The stressful nature of it keeps things interesting, and no two days look alike. Even though I spend 40 hours a week there, I still wake up every day excited to go and I keep myself up at night going over everything that happened that day. I've come to sort of dislike weekends because I find myself under stimulated even if I'm doing something fun or leisurely. Socializing also feels a bit like pulling teeth. That sounds horrible, right? I'm just so used to having and reaching little goals throughout the day and a day without any accomplishments feels wasted. It's like I've forgotten how to relax. Whereas in college all I wanted to do was hang out with my friends, now the idea of relaxation freaks me out and socializing feels like work. 

One facet of my job is being observed a few times a week working with clients, and while I've always experienced performance anxiety and tend to worry about forgetting something important during the observation, I love getting feedback. I've found I actually do really well during them and I love reading positive comments that highlight things I didn't even realize I was doing. Good grades have always been rewarding but they often felt undeserved because I procrastinated and didn't think the work I was turning in was good. I always preferred feedback on papers because I put more effort into my writing than other assignments and tests. Positive feedback feels like a drug. On particularly good observations I'll look over the evaluation 2 or 3 times just because of the utter joy it brings me. 

So, pretty much, my job takes up most of my life but I've chosen for it to be that way. Nothing else feels as stimulating and really I just want to put my energy into becoming a better therapist and also finding ways to improve my field and the lives of my clients. I'm worried that this intense involvement in my job will eventually lead to burnout. I feel like this is the way I approach things that are super rewarding--I have trouble balancing them with other areas of my life. It's as though I'm only able to zero in on one thing at a time and everything else feels really dull. Anyone else find this to be true? 

TL;DR: I love my job too much because it's stimulating and I have trouble enjoying other things because they are boring

I want to build a NAS as well as a compute pc. By compute pc, I mean something I can run intensive tasks on (remotely through ssh or vm). I study aerospace engineering &amp; also a part time programmer (currently google intern) so I run a lot of simulations. Which is why I want to build something which isnt my main workstation that I can throw intensive tasks at it as well as being a storage server. 

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**
~700 £.

4wi4zf,1,2016-08-06,"Confused about what I should be doing in my life, need some perspective.",spetnamu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4wi4zf/confused_about_what_i_should_be_doing_in_my_life/,"I am doing a masters in CS in Rutgers and I am currently doing an Internship at Bank of America. I am working on a Scala project. This is the first proper software job that I am ever did in my life, so I ended up doing some really stupid stuff(I learnt that people don't talk about writing clean code and great designs just to be snobbish, most people actually care about this stuff and how you make your software matters just as much as what your software does and yadda yadda yadda..). I greatly annoyed, irritated and frustrated my mentor. He was yelling at me the whole time, it was embarrassing, demeaning and what not. His colleague is the person I am suppose to be working under and both the reviews he gave me were positive, dunno why. But I am not sure if I will get a full time offer from them. My mentor's another colleague and my mentor though want to conduct an interview for my intern team(there are 4 of us). The hr person tells me that it's for our own practice, but I am getting the feeling that the interview will decide whether or not I will get a return full time offer. Now because I have very little time to prepare, I am extremely confident that I will f*ck up the interview. So I don't see myself getting a return offer from the bank.

Now I could try to get a full time offer somewhere, but I feel like I can learn more as an intern then as a full time employee with responsibilities. People explain stuff to interns so well and so patiently. They just assume that I am an idiot. At first I found that very insulting, but lately I made peace with the fact that I am an idiot. There are shit ton of things I need to know and I already learnt so many during this internship, I bet I can learn even more if I do another internship. I could try to learn this stuff in my free time but as a master student and a TA I barely get any time. If I do get some free time I usually am in the mood to watch some movies/TV shows and relax or go to sleep. Internship would be a very nice convenient way of taking time out of my life, without effecting my visa status to learn stuff that are relevant to the industry. Also I am not sure if I can land a full time job as a masters student with very limited experience and shitty GPA who would need a H1B sponsorship in the future. I am not even sure I will get interview calls.

Now because of my visa status I cannot just arbitrarily postpone my graduation date. So I originally thought I will do a second masters in Stats. It would help me understand machine learning better. It will help me get better at maths and problem solving! Plus I get to flaunt two masters in my resume for whatever they are worth. I wanted to do a PhD too, but it looks like it will take shit ton of time so a second masters was a way to appease myself. Plus I could endeavor to get a better GPA in second masters to make up for my shitty GPA in CS. But the problem with this option was that my stats degree would become my primary degree and I am not sure if the stats department will approve my CPT application(thing I need to do an internship as a F1 student) to do an internship in a software company. Also, I audited a couple of courses in stats department and MY GOD they are insanely mathematical. Shit ton of calculus, probability, linear algebra and what not! It's being offered by the Maths department in my college. I am not confident enough to go down that road.

Second option would be to do a thesis, start off very late so I would need to stay another semester, giving me an additional summer. With this option, I can still do a PhD in the future after I repay my master's loan. Plus there is a chance that my thesis could be published(Could someone tell me if research papers help you advance in career in any way?). Plus I get undivided attention of a professor which is just like doing another internship imo!

Initially I was very interested in AI/CV/ML/Robotics/NLP fields, but I realized they are extremely math heavy. I am auditing few linear algebra &amp; probability courses so I am feeling more comfortable with maths now. These fields however don't feel like CS at all. You just type out some random scripts in a very high level scripting language like R or something. You don't deal with threads, you don't get to write any elaborate code to do something. But people say this is the future! I am not saying that I am not at all interested in this. This is interesting in a way :) I know a professor who is working on motion detection/pose detection and stuff like that. He is using deep learning to solve some of these problems and I find his work extremely fascinating. Not sure if he will take me up as a student and will be able to spend time on me.

Alternatively I could work with some systems professor. I do find stuff like OS, compilers, databases, networks very interesting. Of them all I only found a compilers professor's work interesting. The compilers professor finished his PhD only 5 years ago I guess, so he is sufficiently experienced and yet not too experienced that he cannot spend time explaining stuff to me. But then again, I am not sure if compilers will be as hot of a topic as deep learning or some AI stuff is in the coming 10 or 20 years. 

I also find computer graphics very interesting. We only have one professor in our college who deals with this stuff and he is a pretty cool guy, fresh PhD but has a lot of interesting projects. Graphics to me is like the perfect balance of maths and programming, I get to code up a lot of stuff in C++. The professor has a lot of industrial contacts too. But I heard people say that graphics is a very volatile and under paid field. Also, he kinda expects people to put in too much effort into his courses which kinda turns me off.

So essentially if I do thesis it would just boil down to AI vs Compilers vs Graphics.

**TL;DR** I am really very confused about what I should be doing at this moment in my life. Try to get a full time offer somewhere if the bank where I am interning doesn't extend an offer to me or extend my graduation by doing a second masters and doing an extra internship to gain additional experience(which I feel I very badly need) or do a thesis to extend my graduation. Also if I do a thesis, wondering if I should do a thesis in AI fields or compilers or graphics. I need to register for class soon, so I have to make this decision this weekend.

I'm leaning towards 1440p because I likely won't be able to afford a 30"" or higher 4K monitor with everything else, which is where I've read it really shines. But you know better than me. Also, I would prefer great response time for things like Smash Bros. and Beatmania.

The school I attend is rather cheap for out of state (~20,000 a year), and I'm pursuing a double major while working a full time job that, unfortunately, does not pay as well as it should.

Last year, I developed a bad bout of depression, which is something I never really dealt with before I left, but I think being so far from home gave me the space I needed to really face some things and I did not cope well. I stopped eating, stopped going to class, laid in bed for days, couldn't go into public without having some sort of panic attack. It was awful and it ruled my life for months. 


Throughout all of this my family didn't know anything, I'm too far to come home for minor holidays so it's just phone interactions save for Christmas. As I got worse and worse, sitting on a very dangerous and worrisome stoop of suicidal thoughts, my best friend finally got me to seek therapy, and it probably saved my life. I'm still learning to cope properly and keep a healthy handle on my life, it's really hard at times, but even now that my father knows there is absolutely no understanding or sympathy.
Those few months really fucked with my grades; my GPA plummeted and now what was going to only be an extra semester (bc of my double major) is going to be an extra year, and my dad just doesn't get it.

Every fight we've had in the past four years has been about college/money and how my choice made his life hell. I paid for two years out of pocket and I took out loans he cosigned on for the other two, now three, but every time he throws my choice to go to college in my face.

For the past year and this upcoming year I will work my ass off at a job- basically an internship- that will almost guarantee me a job post grad, and my dad still doesn't get it. Going away for college has been an amazing experience for me, even with the chaotic downs, and I don't have it in me to apologize anymore. I want to mean more to my father than the money he spends on me. I want him to see that I can't apologize for doing something for me when, throughout my entire childhood, I had a mother who only did things for herself and her image, no matter the cost to her children. 

I want a bit of empathy for how hard this year was for me and how much I accomplished by pulling myself out and not giving in to my depression all the way. 

Only 20 percent of university students finish their degree in four years, and I'll receive two degrees in five years, and I don't think that's bad at all.

Of course I feel bad about my dad being responsible for my loans, how much of a financial burden I can be, and many other things, but I can't keep apologizing for an angsty decision I made when I was 17 years old and applying for college. 

I can't feel bad about it anymore, and I can't change it so why the fuck do I have to keep apologizing??"

I worked in camps instead of internships during summers because no one responded to my applications.

We hit it off and were dating within the week. We took things slow at first,  mainly because I didn't really want a concrete relationship and he did. He disliked how emotionally unavailable and distant I was, and asked me to open up more to him and let him in. So I did.

For the first four months there were a few bumps in the road, but nothing major. Looking back, they were trivial problems. In early June however, he left for a summer internship 800 miles away. It was hard at first. He had trouble adjusting to living on his own, not even being able to be around the people he knew. There were a lot of late nights. Towarda the end of June,  I found out I was pregnant. We both agreed that abortion was the right choice, but the stress and weight of the problem sent me hurtling back deeper into the depression I had just crawled out of. Meanwhile, he was spending more and more time with other interns he had met at his new workplace. He said he needed to socialize, that he needed to be around other people, that he couldn't stand being in Iowa all by himself. After I found out about the pregnancy,  he started to spend even more time with them.

I ended up dealing with most of the abortion process on my own. I found a clinic, I waited mny times just to be able to make an appointment, I figured out how to stretch most of my sparse paycheck after our original plan to have him pay for the entire surgery fell through. He makes 3 times the amount of money I do, yet could barely spare $100 towards a $485 surgery. Because I had issues with my bank, the surgery ended up getting pushed until next Saturday. The price went up, and once again I have to figure out how to make my check last.

Because all my money is going to the surgery, I was unable to sign up for university classes this semester, as it would have been impossible to pay for them. It broke my heart. I love school and learning more than anything. I stopped buying things for myself and ended up returnjng the one birthday present that I had gotten myself because the money was necessary. 

My birthday. It was mid-july, a Saturday. I had barely been looking forward to it but I always loved my birthday, it was the one day a year that was always celebrated. He spent it with his friends, giving me a one hour call, and never bothered to order my birthday presents.  A month later and he still hasn't. Just promises that he'll make it up to me when he comes back home.

Today is our 6 month anniversary. I have never been in a relationship longer than 4 months, and he knows this. He on the other hand, has had plenty of relationships last far longer than this. Again, he is spending it with his friends. Friends he has known for less than 2 months. Friends that he is constantly ending calls with me for, friends that he is constantly choosing over me. 

He is due to come home two days after my surgery. He barely talks to me about the abortion, and prefers to joke about my depression rather than help me through it. Most nights if I do get to talk to him, he falls asleep on the phone. He gets mad that I want to talk to him, saying that he needs to talk to his parents or that he wants to see his friends, that he can't spend all his time with me. 

We have fought, I have begged and bargained and tried everything short of flying up to Iowa.  I've cried myself to sleep more nights than I can count.

And still I'm a second class citizen in his life.

At what point do you say enough is enough?"

* Extended internship at UGA with proffesor

* ~350 accumulated service hours over the course of highschool



&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So there are all my stats. For other very subjective things, I think I could get pretty good rec's and I am decent essay writer (despite my AP Lang score :/). I am vying for top schools. I would prefer a medium-large school with good racial diversity (this is the main reason I'm not looking at CalTech, too little diversity and too small of a school). More towards the liberal side of ideology if possible but that isn't an absolute must. A ""liberal arts"" education is ideal, because I'd like to spend college getting to know lots of different subjects and ideas, not just focusing on one specific area. I'm planning on majoring in a science/math field at the moment, but I would like to be at a school where I can change to a humanity like PoliSci or add on a humanity double major/minor if I realize that science majors aren't to me (so basically schools that don't ONLY focus on science or engineering). 



&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In terms of location, it doesn't matter too much to me, but I would prefer a school that's not extremely far away from my family. I'd like a college with a fun student life where I can be comfortable going out and having fun one night and then studying and working hard the next. I'd like to apply early to a private school, however I am NOT interested in ED. SCEA is fine though, I just don't want to be bound to one school.



&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am definitely applying early to two state schools, UGA and GA Tech, and would be content going to either one of them. Other than that I'm not really sure. I had a list but honestly I didn't like it and I based it too much off of prestige alone, so I'm starting fresh. I've looked a lot at both Harvard and MIT, and right now I think I'm going to apply SCEA to Harvard and regular to MIT. Of course these are both extreme reaches, so I'm looking for other schools that are more in the match area or lower reaches, and even other schools that are still extreme reaches but are good fits for me. 



Thanks so much for any help, and sorry for the huge wall of text.

I grew up in a horribly abusive household. No one here is happy. Almost all the problems in our house stem down to my mom. She's a bad person who only cares about herself. Growing up was hell in my household because both my parents were visibly unhappy, but due to financial reasons they have stayed together. My mom knows she would have no money if my dad left, since she never bothered to get an education or career, but my dad also knows if he divorced her she would try to take everything and he would end up paying her alimony. This is a lose, lose situation clearly. Most of my life I have watched my dad, who is an absolutely amazing person, be beat down and berated. He's incredibly depressed and this has contributed to the problems weighing heavily on my mind.

As for me, I am the oldest child and received most of the abuse from my mom. I was verbally abused constantly as a small child, being called fat, ugly, dumb, a loser, etc., which continues on to today. My mom also beat me pretty severely. Kicked, punched, slapped, hair pulled, bitten, pinched, strangled, given black eyes, plates thrown at me....I have resentment towards my dad for not stepping in over this or holding her accountable.

As you can imagine, I've never had much confidence. I'm extremely quiet because I've developed a fear of being judged by people and am scared of social situations. The pain I have inside is immense and dealing with shitty people only makes it worse.

About a year ago I decided to take back control of my life and start working out. As a result, I lost about 60 pounds, got in the best shape of my life and started to get a lot of positive attention from people. For a very brief period of time, my social phobia and other aversions to speaking to new people started to go away a bit. I was starting to feel happy for the first time in pretty much my whole life.....but then I finished university and had to move home for financial reasons. 

This has been extremely difficult. Moving home and dealing with my abusive mom has made me depressed all over again. I also started grad school shortly after moving home and it was horrible. I entered a public relations program and the people, including the professors, were horrible. I thought 23 year olds would be more mature but it was just like high school. There was literally a secret Facebook group for ""popular"" people to talk shit about the people in the program. Faculty was aware of the group and did nothing. School, a place I once loved, was hell

Unsurprisingly..in my extremely unhappy state, I gained almost all the weight back I worked so hard to lose. I am really mad at myself for this. 

A couple months ago I started a job at a place I've always wanted to work and this has added to my stress. I am working late to finish the random projects I am assigned, filling in for coworkers who go on vacation and taking over their workload, doing work on the weekend and it is still not enough to my bosses. As an intern they blame me for basically everything, even things I'm not involved in. For instance, I was yelled at and embarrassed at a company meeting for not making a social media strategy for the next few months. The interesting part is that I have NO access to our social media, nor was I assigned to this project. Obviously a middle manager forgot to assign this project to me but didn't step up. This is what I deal with every day. Going from one personal hell to the next. 

I'm not suicidal, but I've had fantasies about dying. Last week I started thinking about if anyone would even care if I died and that's when it hit me. I need professional help and I need to take some time to get happy again. The problem is my parents both are pushing me to keep moving with my career once my internship is done and find a new job. I'm 23, have had 4 PR internships, have a B.A + M.A, so I don't think it will hurt me that much to take 4- 6 months off to focus on myself and get better but everyone is advising against this as it will create gaps in my resume....

The other problem is money. I'm $25,000 in debt so I can't afford to move out of my toxic household...obviously this is a huge problem in my situation. 

Basically, I'm stressed, sad, scared and full of anxiety. I was wondering what you all thought about this? Is it a really bad idea to take time off from working to do this? Do you think the gaps in my resume will prove to be a problem?

I attend a no-name liberal arts college. I started reading this subreddit and have seen all sorts of comments from people with a variety of experiences of CS. I have several questions about my career path. I chose to double major because I enjoy finance, but thought it was important to have a STEM background, plus I enjoy tinkering with computers. I had no prior experience with coding going into my freshman year and have gotten Bs in the two programming classes I've taken so far(I'm a sophomore in the program). I'm about to get into the serious meat of the program this fall, and yet, when people ask me what I want to be I still don't know. I have no idea where I want my career to go. I'm looking for a job that allows me to travel, and if possible, work remotely. I hate the concept of working from 9 to 5 for 40 years, so I'm definitely looking for something that has a flexible schedule. However I know I obviously can't be picky right off the bat, and I am looking for a job with a good salary. So my main question is, what kind of job(s) would I be looking for, and which companies? Aside from that, what can I do to supplement my college education(such as internships, and projects)? I'm aiming to go to graduate school after a few years in the workforce, so I'm already working as hard as I can to get the highest GPA possible. I appreciate any and all answers! (I hope I'm not breaking any rules...)"

When Doom released, I got excited. And after I got an internship, I could finally afford to build a PC for myself and get back to gaming after nearly 10-15 years of a dry streak. Hence the name The Redeemer.

I have overclocked the G3258 to 4.3GHz@1.2V. I know my choice of CPU may not sit well with many of you out there, but that's all I could afford right now, and on doing a lot of research, I believe that it should serve well for the short term. I will replace it with AMD Zen or an i5 depending on how Zen turns out.

I am including ALL the parts including cables, furniture and what not that I needed to get for my gaming setup, including the NY state taxes. I already had the keyboard, headset and thermal paste. Rest are all new except G3258 which I bought used off eBay.

I've been playing Hotline Miami and Undertale. I'm waiting for my RX 480 to arrive next week to test out other games I bought during summer sale!"
4wjkix,1,2016-08-07,Feeling down and in need of support. I know this isn't a question but I'm not sure where else to turn right now.,kooppoop,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4wjkix/feeling_down_and_in_need_of_support_i_know_this/,"So, some backstory. I'm 23, mtf, pre hrt and 1 session into laser on my face. I've always had a sort of fascination with trans people, ever since I was 12 and learned what being trans was from reading Venus Envy. Last August in a deep depression, I was tormented by the thought that I might be a woman, and that was how I finally accepted that I'm trans.

I told my then girlfriend of ~3.5 years, and she was supportive but saddened. By January, just after our 4th anniversary, we were broken up. We're still best friends, and talk frequently, but that was the first of many things I lost in my life because of this. The next was my mom. I told her a few days after I broke up with my girlfriend, and I was met by a torrent of hate that I never expected from someone who has insisted for my entire life that she loves me. Our relationship has been problematic since then, to say the least.

I still depend on my mom for a lot, particularly with financial support for school. I have 1 semester left before I graduate. I was lucky enough that I got a very well paying internship this summer, and I planned on paying my entire tuition for the fall myself and using the surplus to get on student health insurance and start hormones so I can graduate as my real self. Paying the full amount is my only option, because otherwise there would be a massive amount of drama about how I'm ""making my mom pay for my transition"" (because if I spend money on transition that would otherwise go to tuition, she would see it that way). With the same financial aid I've received for the last few years, that should be about $4.5k.

I found out on Monday that because I've done more than 8 semesters, and have reached the cap for federal aid, my tuition this semester is now actually more like $9.5k. That means that I can't start hormones until January when I graduate and get a job where the insurance covers it. I realize that I'm luckier than a lot of other women because I still have that opportunity later on, but it's still crushing to realize that I have to wait now when I planned on starting at the end of the month.

Then on Tuesday I found out that my ex is interested in a new guy. I'm happy for her, and honestly I want her to make it happen and have someone who can make her happy, but I have a lot of negative thoughts about it. First of all, I don't feel like I can date right now because I feel like my body is disgusting and I would never be able to enjoy it at the moment, so I think I feel jealous that she has that opportunity.

Second, we were together for 4 years, and her interest in somebody else has made it more real than ever to me that our relationship is over. I haven't dressed up in more than a week because I've been growing my facial hair out to check progress with laser, so the whole ""am I sure I'm really trans?"" paranoia is massive right now, and I feel a lot of regret thinking about having lost my relationship with her. I know that I'm on the way to the happiness I deserve, it just feels so far away.

I have a lot of really difficult feelings about this right now and I just don't know how to handle it. I know that I'll survive, but everything feels so hard right now. If anybody is around to talk, pm me, I could use some support. Thanks for listening."

My name is Tyler King and I am posting about a writing/digital media opportunity with The Armchair All-Americans. We are currently in the process of adding at least 3 writers to our staff. 

We are a sports journalism media outlet located all around the US. With our site getting thousands of views per week, we are starting to pick up some steam and need to expand our Big 12 department. We have worked with major athletes, coaches, and media personalities across the country. We have the ability to set you up with contacts, interviews, writing and media opportunities on campus to improve your personal writing/media portfolio as well as the ability to offer internship credit if you are in school. 

This position can be done from any location but preferably on campus and only requires about 5-10 hours of work per week. We generally ask for writers to cover beat reporting for their school. We may also need your assistance in feature/long form writing, statistics compilation, and work in audio/video composition. 

If this position interests you, or you would like some more information about ACAA, feel free to shoot me a message or contact me at: armchairbig12@gmail.com.

4wjwra,5,2016-08-07,My work life is not going well and I need someone to listen.,Eticket15,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4wjwra/my_work_life_is_not_going_well_and_i_need_someone/,"I am so frustrated with how things are going job wise. Right now, I feel like a lot of things in my life aren't going so well. But, last night was the straw that broke the camels back.

I commute 50 miles to get to work. I either have a smooth commute but can't find parking, or I find parking after being stuck in traffic for an extra hour. I love my job itself. But the commute is PAINFUL. Also, it's an entry-level position that makes minimum wage so I spend most of my paycheck on gas.

I got back in January from an internship at a VERY prestigious tourism firm. I moved from Calfornia to Florida and buses tables for almost six months. Even though I didn't like the work, I saw it to the end.

I wanted to stay on in a different role. But of course school's more important. So, I went back. 7 months, two jobs, and $110 in costuming fees ( that I shouldn't have owed, honestly) later, I finally find something that Im remotely qualified for on the website at the location near me. Wasn't what I wanted. But, I figured it would be better to settle and transfer later. 

I take the web interview, and 30 minutes of questions later. I get ****ing rejected. Are you kidding me? I passed the other two times I took it. I made so sacrifices for this company. I got recognized A LOT for good service and I got my language pin in French. Grrrrrr. Thanks for nothing.

TL;DR: Life is not so hot rn. Hate my commute. Tried to find a closer job and got rejected. Quite Sore.

I'm off for most of August so I'd be down to prepare for 2-3 hours a day, just want to get as much preparation in as possible for internship interviews. It'd be awesome if you were already familiar with data structures and algorithms as well as LeetCode/CITC style questions.

This could be done over hangouts + google docs for coding. It would be a great way to keep each other accountable and have a study session where you can not only get better at coding questions but at explaining your thought process better during an interview!

Let me know if you're interested."

4wkb7k,17,2016-08-07,[MO] Boss gives me different jobs because I'm a woman.,thunderfartt,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4wkb7k/mo_boss_gives_me_different_jobs_because_im_a_woman/,"I work at a Fortune 100 company in Missouri and I am the only woman on a team of 6 people managed by a man who is new to the role. To be clear, I am employed by a staffing agency for now but have worked at this company since January 2016 and expect to be hired on any day now. I was the newest member of my team by a month until June of this year when we got an intern. 

My boss has routinely given me jobs that are easier and/or domestic in nature. I am in a technician role and I am the second most educated on my team and have the most technical experience. I'm a good employee and have always received wonderful feedback. I have never asked for special consideration for being a woman and have no expectations of it at all. I am treated fairly by all other members of my team.  At first I was unsure if I was given these tasks because I was the new guy but after our male intern started I realized that is definitely not the case.

I'm asked to clean, vacuum, sweep, mop, gather food orders, take pictures, label things, organize, and take inventory. My team mates are not asked to do these things unless I am totally unavailable. I have been taken off projects I started or just never assigned any in favor of doing these tasks. Even in big, all hands on deck, projects I am asked to hang back and take pictures or make labels. My male team mates have noticed this behavior too and have pointed it out to me unprompted. 

To my understanding the woman who held my position before me had similar complaints and was relocated or fired after being vocal about it. I am completely capable of doing all the tasks involved in my job. There are mechanical aids to handle the heavy lifting parts of my job and the expectations are to have a lifting buddy for big stuff anyhow because it is expensive equipment. 

My boss was tasked with having one-on-one meetings with the team about 6-8 weeks ago after bullying another employee. In that meeting he told me I should never worry about that happening to me because I am a ""female"". He then went on to explain how he could never yell at a women and treats women differently, etc. etc. 

I guess where I am now is just unsure of what is happening is even illegal and if so what to do about it. This boss has some other issues and complaints about him have been swept under the rug before. Because of all of this combined I just want to put in my two weeks and move on but I also want to do the right thing and stand up for myself. 

Advice is appreciated. Thanks

4wkire,6,2016-08-07,Notes on Manufacturing Consent,sljolt,chomskybookclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/chomskybookclub/comments/4wkire/notes_on_manufacturing_consent/,"DISCUSSION: NOTES ON MANUFACTURING CONSENT

Edition: Random House, Vintage Books U.K., 1994, 9780099533115

I've just finished reading Ed Herman and Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent. This isn't an in-depth review, though it's come out longer than I expected. Really it's just some of the things I've taken away from the book and notes I've made which I thought might make good talking points.

**Chapter 1:** The quantitative data alone is staggering, I've never seen bias presented in such a black and white way. I'm fascinated by the idea of searching for the closest thing that history offers to 'controlled experiments', in Chomsky's words, by finding comparable events and looking at the amount of coverage. The propaganda model is presented on a sound factual basis, and it's difficult to argue against; I can't think of any examples off the top of my head of the propaganda model being subverted.

In fact, all of my notes in the books are various facts or further reading I've accrued from other sources which corroborate the model. For example, the first filter regarding limitation of ownership immediately brings to mind research I did on news media in the U.K. that I undertook after a short and ugly internship at my local newspaper. The overwhelming marjority of all regional papers in the U.K. are owned by four larger companies which are subsidiaries of larger media organisations. For example, my city paper is owned by Local World, which in 2014 owned 115 titles and had a total weekly circulation of over 5 million. Local World is, in turn, owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust.

http://www.mediareform.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ElephantintheroomFinalfinal.pdf

For anyone who migh think that the BBC would be exempt from such considerations as a public organisation, just remember that the government can threaten cuts, or even more underhandedly, offer increased subsidies and incentives to private media companies to 'compete' with them. The result has been a visible homogenising effect. The BBC now imitates the reporting of private media in style and tone.

The book also makes a reference to media not wanting to spoil the 'buying mood' encouraged by advertisers. David Edwards, editor of the website MediaLens which applies the propaganda model to British news, wrote a book called 'Free To Be Human' about the pervasiveness of the 'buying mood' and its psychological effects.

**Chapter 2:** One thing I continually refer to when reading the book is that people don't necessarily need to agree with or trust media in order for it to be an effective propaganda tool; all that needs to be done is to set the terms of debate. If you're responsible for the impressions that otherwise busy people form of individuals, countries, governments, etc. then you've already won by definition.

Some of the comparisons used early on in the book are brutal. The moral indignation shown regarding the murder of Jerzy Popieluszko versus the numerous examples in Latin America were difficult to read. I often had to put the book down. Murders that don't serve any ideological purpose get the barest of descriptions; where they were found, cause of death, whether there's been an arrest or trial. 

The murder of the Jean Donovan, Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel, and Maura Clarke in El Salvador, and the impersonal brevity of its coverage, is something that I think will stay with me forever from this book. Even though Popieluszko warranted paragraphis detailing his grisly murder in the mainstream media, the four U.S. church women did not. Take one of the examples that Herman and Chomsky use here from the New York Times:

&gt;Witnesses who found the grave said it was about five feet deep. One woman had been shot in the face, another in the breast. Two of the women were found wth their blood-stained unerpants around their ankles. (Dec. 5, 1980) p. 45

A savage scene of rape and murder boiled down to a mere three sentences. The only difference being that their murders did not meet the criteria of utility like Popieluszko. There are even more extreme examples in the book, but this one stands out as the first moment I had to take a break and seriously reflect on what was being presented to me.

**Chapters 3 and 4:** These are about the media's function in the legitimisation of electons and as agents of disinformation. They were fascinating, but I had no commentary to add to it, as these topics are fairly new to me. The only things that stood out to me is that, again, careful selection of reporters and experts can shape an argument before it's even communicated to an audience. 

**Chapter 5:** On the Indochina wars, this book has helped to construct an entire different view of the 'Vietnam war', something that's taken on a life of its own in popualr culture. The omissions from the usual media narrative are breathtaking: the initial breaking of the Geneva agreements, Laos and Cambodia, and offer a completely different (and far more rational) history of the region.

Again, a few things that stood out to me through their obscenity were Guenter Lewey's scholarly interpretation of events, published through the Oxford University Press: 

&gt;villages in 'open zones' were 'subjected to random bombardment by artillary and aircraft so as to drive inhabitants **to the safety of the strategic hamlets**'. p. 181

Meaning, the population were indiscriminately bombed into concentration camps. That strikes me as the most disturbing example of doublespeak allowed into academic discussion I've ever read.

A final upbeat note: Chomsky often refers in his talks to how the U.S. population has generally become far more 'civilised', particularly with regard to social issues and awareness of foreign interventions. I would like to say the same of the U.K., and the framing of the Vietnam war as a 'blundering effort to do good', even among dissenting and activist groups, reminded me of the importance of alternative voices which question the premise and motives of military operations abroad altogether. The landscape has changed in the U.K. with groups like the Stop the War Coalition and Campaign Against the Arms Trade, tiny organisations which punch well above their weight in shaping the opinions of people in a contry with 'one of the most concentrated media environments in the world'."

4wkqni,0,2016-08-07,My [22M] mother [42F] filed for a divorce and is stuck in the past,throwwwaway434,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wkqni/my_22m_mother_42f_filed_for_a_divorce_and_is/,"Hello guys,

the marriage of my parents was a very unhappy, one-sided one. My father was extremely abusive up until a handful of years ago - he has calmed down since then. My mom decided to file for divorce half a year ago, and I supported her (I hated my father as a kid, I like him now and forgave him but my mom did not, and as you can imagine, she was very unhappy). She moved out, I helped her move and buy furniture, etc.

Now, the thing is - the assets and debts were split, and my mom constantly complains about it and has breakdowns because of it. My parents own two apartments (that they dont live in), and they were split 50:50 between them. My mom thinks that this is unfair, as she argues that she was the one who made it possible to get those apartments in the first place (she earns 20% more than my dad, and spent much less money than my dad). On top of that, my dad never helped my mom with the chores and my mom had to do all the housework, and she never really got the appreciation or the help she deserved. Basically, my mom argued that we only had so much debt because my father earned so little, and because he spent so much on cigarettes or other stupid shit. But, my parents pooled their income, and therefore shared their money, their expenses, etc. I think it is a bit childish (and also impossible) to say who spent what, and who is responsible for how much money and debt they have. They made all decisions to buy or take out loans together.

There is one thing that I should mention - my parents both had a life insurance policy on their name. This was basically used as an emergency fund for them. Both of them had one each, but it was not one policy for my mom and one for my dad - it was two policies for the family, and they paid the monthly costs together. Last year, they decided to sell one of the policies to pay off some debts as that would mean lower costs overall. My mom was adamant on keeping her insurance policy, so my dad sold his. With that money, some of their shared debts were paid off, my dad did not use it on himself. My mom still has her policy, and my dad argued that he is entitled to half of the policy's value (not legally, but morally) - after all, he spent 50% of his policies money for my moms debts (if you want to break it up like that), and he paid half of the costs of my mom's policy too. I thought that this makes sense, and I agreed that my mom should take a bit more than 50% of the debts because she gets to keep her insurance.

In the end, she took a bit more than 50% of the debts. She was furious at me for months on end though. She constantly insulted me when I was with her, said that I'm favoring my dad, and complained all the time. She constantly said that ""she was the one who paid off the loans"". She'd constantly complain that my dad ""wasted her money for 20 years"", and that she wasted her youth on an asshole like him. She would start ranting about her life, my dad, and me, who ""failed her"", multiple times a day when I spent time with her. And whenever she did, she insulted everybody, including me.

I can see how she thinks that she ""did more for the relationship"", as she brought in more money and also did all of the housework, and she even spent less than my dad. But in the end, they had one shared bank account, they made all of their decisions together, and therefore I dont think that it makes sense to calculate who is accountable for which debt after the fact. I mean, my parents made their decisions based on the fact that they share their income etc - my father might have acted differently if that had not been the case. Punishing him for it now would be unfair, in my opinion.

One day she hurt me too deeply with what she said and we didnt talk for a while. We made up afterwards, and we agreed to never talk about my dad or the money side of things again. This worked very well for us - things are much smoother now and we don't fight anymore. But lately, some things happened: she got transferred to a department and her work became much harder for no additional pay, she has to commute for 3-4 hours a day just to get to her job and get back, she is extremely exhausted, and the people around her are seemingly so much better off because they all go on vacations etc while she cant afford it and lives a miserable life (in her eyes). My dad bought a nice BMW a few months ago, and he is on a vacation right now (for the second time since they split up). Her best friend and her daughter, who are so fucking poor that they literally cannot afford a fucking washing machine, just went on a two-week trip. My mom could have these things too, but she does not WANT to afford them (I wouldnt either), but she cant help but think ""why is my life so rough? why are these people afford to relax, have fun, and enjoy life while I am so miserable for so long?"". She realized that she is better off than the people around her on a rational level, but she cannot feel it on an emotional level.

She realizes that the others lead miserable lives, but she cannot perceive it that way. Also, my mom is a bit TOO frugal, she spends too little and is so incredibly risk averse that she'd rather ruin her life and spend no money except for groceries, just to have as much money as possible on her bank account.meanwhile, her job is killing her - she complains about the tiring commute every day, and I can sympathize with her. And now that all of this is coming together, she is breaking down again - she started her rants and her insults again, and I'm tired of it. If she wants that vacation so damn much then fine, she can take one - but she cannot bring herself to do so.

I should also mention that I'm a student. I just finished my undergrad, and I'm going to do one year of interhips before I start my graduate. Luckily, my internships and my university of choice are in the same city as my mom's workplace, so we could move there together - she'd instantly have 3 hours of free time every day, would feel less stress, wouldnt be so tired, and we could also live together again, which would be pretty nice. It would also be beneficial from a financial standpoint - we'd be much better off and have much more disposable income if we moved together. The other solutions (I move on my own, or commute with a car) are really not feasible. She wants the move too, but she's scared of moving. She's a very conservative person, scared of change - and moving from the suburbs to a city is a scary thought for her.

As I've said, she recently started ranting again. When she starts her rants, she sometimes likes to threaten me too - saying stuff like ""if you don't make your father give me this or that, I wont give you any money anymore"", and she started doing it again. Also, she'll want to move with me on some days and urge me to look for cheap-ish apartments (theyre expensive as hell, and hard to come by), and on other days she'll tell me that she does not want to move and that I should get a car for myself. I'm honestly fed up with her bullshit. My internships will not pay me enough to support myself in such an expensive city, so she's really playing with my future here and I'm about done with it. If she does not want to move, fine - but why the fuck did she not tell me this from the start? I couldve looked for internships in different areas - not as high-profile as the ones I got, but at least affordable for me.

I feel like my mom needs to change her life in two ways: First, she needs to change something about her job. The stressful work coupled with the taxing commute is KILLING her. Also, she needs to change her spending behavior - she prefers to ruin her life just to have more money on the bank account, and she can never be easy on herself. What should I do? Moving together with me would make so much sense - she'd have much more free time, and we'd have much more disposable income too. But I feel like she is not convinced of moving, and I can't afford to move there alone. Should I just find a job and become independent instead?

---   
tl;dr: My mom was part of an abusive relationship for decades and she recently filed for divorce. She feels exploited for all the years and wants my dad to pretty much pay for that retrospectively, and the fact that assets and debts were split 50:50 drives her mad, because she thinks its unfair, and she gives me shit for it. She has to commute for 3-4 hours a day just to get to her job and get back, and she hates it and she's depressed about life, as her weekdays are ruined. She has to spend her weekends resting, sleeping, recharging, and she's essentially living for her job right now. 

I have some internships lined up in the city that she lives in, and I will do my graduate in that city as well, so we could move together. My mom would like to move too, but she's too afraid of moving again. If we dont move to that city together, I wont be able to pay the high rents on my own and I'll have to pass on some high-profile internships and look for work instead (I'd probably get a good job if I looked).

I feel like my mom has to change how she treats herself, and she has to do something about her job so that she can enjoy life again. She's not doing either and simply ruining her life."

I'm currently in community college planning on transferring to University of Central Florida next summer for my degree in Information Technology.  While my degree is IT, I have actually been gearing up for a career in Web and iOS development instead since I've had a difficult time trying to figure out what IT career I wanted.  

I decided that it would work out alright since most careers in web or mobile development need a CS degree or something related and that my IT degree would fill in in, but now I'm having second thoughts because I really feel like I'm not making the most out of my college education in this field.

I have a vague idea of what I would like to do in in an IT career - I'd really like to head into management and am interested in computer systems analysis (I understand that this is a broad term).

I just don't know if I have enough time on me while I'm in school to land an internship and learn what I need thoroughly to establish myself in a good career."

### Why this race?
I was not planning to run this race at all until about 5 weeks ago. I found out that I have a couple weeks off from my internship, and later that day got an email about this race. Flights were cheap and I've always wanted to see Ireland, so I jumped on it. I had been planning to run Rock N Roll Vegas, but then I got this internship and won't be there. I already had the 3 race pack paid for this year, so I figured I may as well not waste that final race entry.

### Training
My training was not what it could have been, but on the whole I am happy with it. Between not running at all for the first few weeks of my internship (no time), and getting used to a new country, I was not super active before I started this training. I jumped into week 11 of the Level 2 half marathon plan that Garmin has. It was just about the right plan for me, though I do wish I had started a lot sooner.

Each week generally looked like this:

**Mon:** Rest

**Tues:** Easy 30-40 min (3-5 miles depending on what felt easy that day)

**Wed:** Intervals of varying lengths, 30-50 min (4-6 miles)

**Thurs:** Easy 30-40 min (3-5 miles depending on what felt easy that day)

**Friday:** Rest

**Sat:** Easy 30-40 min (3-5 miles depending on what felt easy that day)

**Sun:** Long run 60-120 min (6-10 miles)

In the 5 weeks my longest run was 10 miles. The first 3 long runs were about 2 hours each and progressively got longer as I got settled into running again.

The intervals also got faster going from an average 9:30 pace (including warm up, rest ints, cool down [I have the workouts programmed into my Garmin, turn it on then don't stop/pause till I'm done]) to 8:40 min/mile. And that was a struggling 9:30 to a relatively easy 8:40. Maybe not easy, but felt smooth.

That was my first 4 weeks. My final long run last Sunday was 1 hour and about 6.5 miles. 
This week I ran a threshold run on Tuesday, hiked a couple hours on Thursday, then got in a very easy 2 miles on Saturday. This culminated in a 2:05:40 half today.

### Race
The race went well overall. I am a little disappointed that I didn't crack 2 hours for the third time in a row, but given my minimal training I am satisfied. During the race I did everything I possibly could. My only regret, and this is very minor, is that I didn't stay closer to the pacers. I was Pluto to their sun, and if I had been Earth or even Mars I may have done better; but I don't really think so.

The race is a really nice course. You follow the river Liffy for a good long while, and get to run across a couple bridges. The course winds its way past some landmarks until you get into Phoenix Park. As you turn left into the park there is a hill. It's not a steep hill by any measure, but it is almost a mile and a half long. That hill is where I started crashing. The previous 8 miles were just about perfect, I was right on pace and feeling good. After that hill though I was feeling pretty beat. Right about mile 9.5 I started losing ground on the pacers. For the next half mile they were slowly getting away, and then they were gone. 

I was pushing a bit outside of my current fitness level this race. I ended up with a Strava suffer score of 432, and I spent 1:23 (66%) in Zone 4. So yeah, I need to get some more miles under my belt.

Phoenix park is a really nice place to run. If I lived here I would totally always be running there!

### Finish/Post Race
I managed to pull a last bit of energy out and pushed back up to a 8:30-9:00 pace for the last 0.2 mile. It felt good, and kept me under 2:06. My official final time is 2:05:40.

Rock N Roll post race parties are always kinda fun. It's nice to sit down on the grass and listen to a band as you catch your breath and relax a bit. I did feel a little cheated because the beer they had was [non-alcoholic](http://imgur.com/D0SBVFr). They did claim that it is a[ recovery drink though.](http://imgur.com/C5SRr30)

After the race I tried to take a pic with my medal for snapchat, but my[ face would not smile](http://imgur.com/oyeqHOM).

### What's next?
Next up is the Rock N Roll Phoenix Full Marathon. I think it'll be my last Rock N Roll race for a while, I'd like to try some of the more local races around Monterey and the Bay Area. For Phoenix I'll be starting Hal Higdon's Intermediate Marathon 2 (I think, need to double check). The beginning mileage and the overall schedule looked to be something I would stick to, so that's what I picked. Overall goal is to finish and feel good about it. I would like to be under 4:00, but I've got plenty of time to get faster. I'm 23 now, so I can realistically keep getting faster for the next 10-15 years. If I'm careful and consistent I should be able to keep running for a nice long time. :)

More immediately I'm heading down to the pub for some proper beer and some fish and chips. 

edit: I added in a breakdown of my 5 weeks of training.

4wlpb9,22,2016-08-07,a broke students' guide to the GMAT (750 Q49 V42),pretty_broke,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/4wlpb9/a_broke_students_guide_to_the_gmat_750_q49_v42/,"I scored 750 on my first GMAT this Saturday. While preparing for the exam I spent a lot of time on gmatclub.com and on here and read a lot of debriefs. What a lot of them had in common was that they had bought a lot of books, subscriptions and courses that I simply didn't have the money for. So I decided to write up my experience prepping for the GMAT on a pretty tight budget for people in similar situations.


&amp;nbsp;


            
A little background info on me first:


* 21 years old
* I have a BSc in international business and am currently working on my psychology degree.
- not a native English speaker (German is my first language. However, I spent a year in the US when I was 15 and have been tutoring English ever since, so my knowledge of grammar rules and idioms is pretty solid)



&amp;nbsp;




Lots of schools in Europe require the gmat not just for MBA but also for MSc programs in business. I asked for the original guide for Christmas which is the only time I (or someone else for me) spent money on GMAT prep material. I first went through the OG in April but was not studying seriously. A practice test I took at that point put me at 670. Seeing as I had the summer of between school and my internship starting in September, I decided to take it then.


I started studying intensely at the beginning of July, first going through the quantitative review and the verbal review guide. I kept track of mistakes I made and made sure to identify areas that I was not good in (in my case trigonometry).
I then took advantage of all the free resources that are out there and all the free trials, such as…

1. The Economist GMAT Tutor – This one is a free trial for a week (however they do have a fair use policy that cuts you off when you have done more than I think 25% of their material) https://app.gmat.economist.com/ The first couple of lessons are pretty standard introduction to GMAT and the questions but if you do it on a computer you can pick lessons from a selection of 5 which enabled me to skip some lessons that I deemed unnecessary for me (such as a huge session on estimating things) 

2. https://www.empowergmat.com/ - Empowergmat has videos on basically everything. This is absolutely great when you have identified your weak areas and want to work on those specifically. There is a 1 hour free trial per user which enables you to go through one video or so. If you have more than one email account at your disposal you can obviously use this 1 hour free trial more than once. Great thing about empowergmat is that you can actually pick from all of the videos during the 1 hour free trial.

3. The Veritas Prep Free Gmat Question Bank - https://www.veritasprep.com/gmat-question-bank/ I used this to work on my quant skills. It is great if you just want to keep practicing, gives great answer explanations and actually tells you what score range this question is in. 

4. http://gmatclub.com/ This is a great forum with lots of questions, answer explanations to them and in general lots of information. User “Bunuel” put up a lot of quant problem sets with explanations that are great. 


&amp;nbsp;




 What I found most important during studying was

* logging my errors

* identifying weak areas and studying them 

* practice, practice and practice. At some point the GMAT really just becomes a pattern recognition exercuse.


&amp;nbsp;


I did not take a lot of practice test, seeing as they made me more nervous than anything else to be honest, but I would recommend taking some to track your progress and most importantly to get used to the time. 4 hours is a really long time when you have to stay focused non stop.



&amp;nbsp;



Practice tests I took:

* Veritas Prep free practice test – 03/20/2016: 670

* Manhattan free practice test – 07/18/2016: 740


&amp;nbsp;



If you have the resources to get a tutor or take a course, I would definitely recommend it. However, if you are in the same situation as me and cannot afford it, you can definitely make it on your own!


Good luck to all of you! (:

Can you even begin to imagine how this list might grow AFTER Hillary Clinton becomes President, when it's become apparent that she literally is above the law? Food for thought. But you know what's even scarier? There are apparently millions of people out there who don't care about this list or any of the other wrongdoing by either the Clintons or the current administration as long as their own agendas get pushed. And in related news, our country has literally gone down the toilet both morally and in regards to violent crime and mass murders, because THIS is what happens when such people are enabled instead of confronted.

This ISN'T about politics or party preferences; I'm not crazy about Donald Trump but he does not have a long list of known associates that have ended up dead in suspicious circumstances. Nor has he been caught LYING TO CONGRESS. Our country is being betrayed right to our faces and neither the government nor the legal system can be trusted to serve justice or protect the American people any longer. We are set on a course toward the dissolution of our nation and the true freedoms which so many have fought and died to protect. But if we take it lying down or just continue to be Facebook Warriors who make empty, toothless protests from the safety of our homes instead of taking to the streets and defending what is right and precious, we deserve such an end.

And if you would vote for this woman, you are the ENEMY of the United States of America.

Sort of feeling impostor syndrome. But I have a high GPA, scholarships, and an internship at the big 4 so I must be doing something right.  
  
What I want to do is make a list of the stuff I should know how to do, and practice it. I don't feel like I have deep knowledge in any particular area, more like the basics in a lot of topics, and I think I will be expected to know more than I do. For example, I can only do the basics in Git: status, add, remove, commit, branch, pull, push. I don't know how to merge, rebase, or any of the other fancy stuff. In C++ I have forgotten all the intermediate stuff from my courses and would have to read up on them if I had to use them or answer a question about them. I don't have too much experience with any particular IDE, so I don't know the shortcuts and my workflow isn't as streamlined as it could be. At my internship the code I'm writing isn't too challenging (in language features) so I feel that in that regard I am not advancing. I am however challenged in other areas like working in a team, designing software architecture, dealing with customer requirements, etc.
  
I see myself as a jack of all trades (too many) and I want to make sure I have deep enough knowledge in important things to satisfy interviewers and myself. Can someone point me to a list of subjects and specific subtopics that I should review and become great at, as a third year student? I want to be able to dive into something quickly without wasting time relearning things I should already know. I want to have a good workflow and spend more time writing and designing.

4wlwqo,1,2016-08-07,Balanced CPU / GPU build around GTX 1070 SC?,lostinheadguy,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/4wlwqo/balanced_cpu_gpu_build_around_gtx_1070_sc/,"Hey everyone!

I'm newish to building a PC, but I've been learning. I posted a build help a while ago, but circumstances have changed slightly, so I'm looking at different parts now.

The original plan was to build a balanced PC that can do both high-resolution rendering of stills using 3DS Max, V-Ray, etc and real-time environment simulations using Unreal Engine. Lately, I've been on internship with an arch firm that uses Lumion, which I like very much despite its flaws, and I want to be able to continue using it.

I also now have a little bit of a higher budget for the PC, now around but not necessarily lower than $1400 US (it was $1200 before, overtime FTW).

Again, I'm a 3D visualization artist targeted toward themed entertainment and architectural visualization. I'm looking for balanced CPU / GPU performance (without any overclocking after the fact), reliability and future-proofing.

Here's what I have on PCPartPicker.

I have already purchased the GPU, it's the EVGA GTX 1070 SC variant, so that's set. I wish I could have waited longer for the price to go down more but, again, circumstances have changed and I need to get running with this PC in several weeks. That variant was recommended to me by supervisor and co-worker, who use EVGA cards in their built machines as well.

In regards to the processor, I'd like to stick with the base i7 6700 (instead of the K). If I were only gaming I'd go with a less expensive i5 but I'd really like eight threads to use when rendering with CPU renders such as V-Ray. The 6700 seems like it will be the best balance of price and performance for me.

I'd like to know what other stuff can be added / removed / changed in this new build. I have an install of Windows to use and the necessary peripherals. I also know that the 6700 comes with a cooler, I've added a second processor fan but it may be overkill.

Any help is appreciated! Thanks everyone!"
4wly4c,6,2016-08-07,Need INTJ input for a work dilemma,asomrof,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/4wly4c/need_intj_input_for_a_work_dilemma/,"I am an INFP in a dilemma where my likely-INTJ superior is faulting me for a mistake a co-worker made (though I do think I share responsibility in), and I am not sure how to approach it without her thinking I'm throwing the co-worker under the bus. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a med student (INFP), my likely-INTJ ""superior"" is the attending, and ""co-worker"" is actually a resident so she's actually higher status than me though most of our work is independent. My gut feeling tells me she's an ESFJ.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, resident and I share a patient who I've had more interactions with (she has more patients to cover). When we discharge a patient we have to ""reconcile"" the medication list to make sure the patient gets discharged on the right meds. Even though from my experience most doctors finish the discharge documentations and med reconciliation on the day of pt's discharge just prior to their departure (or even a few hours after patient leaves hospital), the resident wanted them done the day before. So on the afternoon prior, work was more hectic than usual since we were discharging multiple patients the next day, she asked me if I can do the med reconciliation and discharge note which I said of course. Just then the attending came to grab me to go see a patient together, and I was caught in various things. So perhaps 30min-1hr later after she repeatedly reminded me and rushed me (!@#@&amp;^!@...), I found out she already did it without letting me know. Well I felt very bad because I know she has more work than me, but I dont understand why she couldnt take care of other things first and trust that I would take care of it. I did tell her dont worry I got this. Either way, she then continued rushing me on the discharge note. When I finally finished it that evening, I let out a big sigh of relief and went to sleep. Here's my mistake---I should've double checked all her work. I should'nt have just assumed since she's much more capable than me there's no point for me double checking. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next morning, the attending rushed into our workroom and asked why the patient had been discharged without her seeing the patient, to which the resident apologized that she was the one who signed off on the discharge already. Later that day I received email from my attending saying she was in disbelief when she saw that ""I"" had ordered for patient to be restarted on this highly addictive controlled substance. I cried when I saw the email, not just because I felt mistakened but more out of frustration from working with that controlling demanding nagging ESFJ resident. But afterall, I do share the responsibility for such mistake. I started writing a reply--I do think it's necessary for me to explain since based the way the INTJ attending sounded in the email, she was really questioning my ability (and this is the specialty I want to go into so I need to make a good impression)---- but after an hour of struggle I couldn't figure out how to address this without making it sound like I'm just throwing the resident under the bus. At the same time, I really want to tell her how this resident (intern) has been very controlling making working together very distressing. I know the resident is actually a reasonably nice person, just very very demanding and controlling, those 2 features aside there are other signs that remind me of my ESFJ mom. That's why I'm being extra careful around her, because I know often times ESFJ can have gazillion judgement against you and yet still greet you like you're their best friend. I'm quite certain she's not someone I can easily rationally talk things out with so I want to make sure that during the rest of our work together (3 more weeks) I don't get on the wrong side of her.  

**Question for INTJs** if you were my superior, would you think of me as being irresponsible and trying to blame it on someone else? would you think I'm throwing the resident under the bus and therefore not a good team player? What are your advice on approaching this subject with my attending? 

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr-- INTJ attending (superior) faults me (INFP med student) for a mistake the ESFJ resident made, but I realize I'm also partially responsible for since I should've double checked the resident's work. But I feel that things would not have been this way if the resident wasn't so pushy and trying to rush through everything. It's only been a week on this rotation and I already feel so distressed by this particular resident because how controlling she is on daily basis. I want to explain to the INTJ superior, but without sounding like I'm throwing the resident under the bus (since I still have to work 3 more weeks with her). How can I do this?

I have crippling social anxiety, and my resume is kind of empty - I was pretty new to CS when I entered in Fall 2015, so I didn't have projects/work experience. This prevented me from going to the career fairs in my freshman year, because I was too afraid of embarrassing myself (distinctly unimpressive resume). So I ended up without an internship for this past summer.

My only plus points are my GPA (3.98), and the fact that I will probably become a CA for a 200 level CS course in the upcoming semester.

I have tried to learn App dev/web dev before, the kind of stuff that seems to get my peers jobs, but I never make it to the end of any tutorial. I get stuck at parts and feel demotivated about finishing it, or start feeling like I'm simply not capable of it. 

On the other hand, I enjoy courses which involve more of theory and algorithms. I've looked at the research park job board but every job I see either needs a skill set I don't possess or isn't willing to hire international students. 

How bad is it to not have had an internship in my first summer?
What can I do to ensure I have one in my second one?

4wm4q9,0,2016-08-07,Looking to calm anxiety about my curriculum,HopefulPhDApplicant,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4wm4q9/looking_to_calm_anxiety_about_my_curriculum/,"I’ve been meaning to post this for a while but never got around to actually writing it up. It’s a bit lengthy because I have a lot to say and need some advice from people who might actually know a thing or two. In an effort to not make this a wall of text, I’m trying to cut it down as much as possible. Here goes:

I’m looking to change majors while entering my senior year. I’m at McGill university in “Physiology and Physics” but want to do more applied math classes. The school might allow me to make my own program but **I’m wondering if admissions from other schools care if I’m the only person to have graduated from my degree, despite having taken relevant courses**. I’m looking to create an “Joint Math and Physics” program that is non-honors, which doesn’t currently exist. I might only have one more elective to take so this will allow me to take some much needed compsci classes.

I’ve attached the courses that I’ve already taken in here: http://imgur.com/a/Cw4vG. As you can see, I don’t have much formal mathematics training (i.e. Analysis, Algebra) yet but I’m good with my applied courses. This brings me to question two: **I’m just wondering if it’s a huge problem to focus on taking grad courses that are more based on “continuous” mathematics (let’s say, numerical analysis, numerical PDEs, Optimization, Advanced Prob, etc) if I want to go into economics/finance or possibly computer science or even engineering for grad school or should I also try getting some discrete math courses in there**. I haven no idea what I want to go into and I believe taking these grad courses will help me realize whether or not certain fields are right for me or not (also maybe trying to get an internship next summer). The MachineLearning courses only require a solid understanding of probability, which I learned over the summer by going through the textbook. It’s currently the only field of compsci that I know that really interests me so I wouldn’t bother looking at anything else but that might change in a year’s time. Anyway, this is the curriculum I'm looking to have following the courses I've already taken http://imgur.com/a/DAfO6

Finally, **I’m wondering if school’s care that I took over 3 years to graduate (even though I’ve been taking more than a full course-load every semester)**. I have no idea if schools care. If they don’t care then I don’t care.

Some more info about me that might weigh in on whether or not I’m mildly competitive for top grad schools: cGPA is 3.87, mathGPA is 3.95 and phyiscsGPA is 3.875 (physiology is where things went a little sour). I have a summer of biomedical engineering research where I’m not super cozy with the prof and, currently, I’m some doing dynamical research in the physiology department (which is less math and more just matlab) but I plan on continuing during the year until I can get something meaningful from it. I’m also doing a bootstrapping-statistics project in the fall in the economics department (unfortunately no publications thus-far). LORs *should* be okay for the most part but there’s really nothing more I can do apart from getting even closer to profs from here-on out.

**Tl;dr 1) do schools care about me being the only person to graduate from my degree 2) which classes should I focus on for grad school? 3) does the length of the degree matter?**

I have severe anxiety issues so if I sound overly worried for no reason, that might explain why. Please PM/comment me if you have any input to provide in some capacity. I also apologize again if it’s a little incoherent. I would have liked to write more but was afraid that it would just get totally ignored (even though it already might).

Here's some more info about my background in case you've made it this far: http://imgur.com/a/yZs96"
4wm4tu,2,2016-08-07,Need advice on deciding between two jobs,haente,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/4wm4tu/need_advice_on_deciding_between_two_jobs/,"Hello! I'm currently a senior majoring in computer science. This year will be my last year so I'm trying to get as much experience in IT or web development as possible. 

Right now I'm working on campus as a ""Communication Systems Assistant."" I basically just set up phones for new employees. I've been here for almost a year and the issue I'm having with it is that it doesn't really pertain to my major. I think it will be much more difficult to find a decent job with no experience. The benefits include: **flexible hours (up to 25hr/week), decent pay ($11.25),  on campus, *and they let me do my homework when there's nothing else for me to do.*** That's a big one for me as this next semester's going to be pretty difficult (taking 5 upper-level classes).

I interviewed for an IT Support internship this past week and received a call saying they'd like to offer me a position. The cons include: **further away (current job is 2 miles away, this job would be 12-20 miles away), more commute time, more time doing homework at home, and it's only a 16-week internship.**  They mentioned I could continue interning there until I graduate, so that's not that big of a deal. The pros include: **slightly better pay and hours (12/hr up to 40hr/week), and it pertains to my degree.**

There are some other factors that I'm taking into consideration. One is that my car isn't the greatest. The benefit of being so close to my current job is that if my car were to ever break down, I could ride my bike or take an uber. The other is that I'll be starting a lease soon, and will need to pay roughly $450 a month until next August. I'm worried that after 16 weeks at the internship, they may decide not to hire me back on next semester, which would screw me on the lease. Another is that, given the distance, the .75 cents more an hour doesn't really make a difference in pay. I think the only real benefit of switching positions is experience. 

Thoughts and suggestions would be much appreciated!"

I've toured a good amount of schools and some of my favorites are SMU and Tulane.

It's somewhat important that the school has D1 sports, as I am a huge football and basketball fan. Please feel free to ask more questions or throw out some suggestions, I really appreciate it!

4wm6mx,2,2016-08-07,NecroCorp Annual Review,Omoikane13,letsmakeatcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/letsmakeatcg/comments/4wm6mx/necrocorp_annual_review/,"---**Beginning Annual Review**---

---**Staff Code: DULLAHAN**---

---**Recipients: WRAITH, REVENANT, DRAUGR, WIGHT, AZRAEL**---

Field tests began today, and the results are particularly telling. I'll be going through all the relevant products here. Anything still in R&amp;D will be disclosed as needed to you individually

-------- **BEGINNING REVIEW** --------

---**NecroCorp Intern**---

The interns have performed admirably. Resource cost compared to benefit is positive. Work done has been beneficial, and reclamation of failed interns was successful. Promotion is recommended upon survival.

---**Experiment S-001, Fuel**---

Ineffective. Resources required for temporary empowerment of the experiment were not worth it. Recommended that research begin on lengthening time of enhancement or reducing resource cost required. Possible empowerment of base template also an option.

---**Experiment S-002, Amalgam**---

Highly effective, but indiscriminate. Must be used with more caution. Consumed large swathes to great effect, but was easily neutralised by Academy technology. Modifications not needed, but countermeasures for neutralisation need to be researched.

---**NecroCorp Spokesperson**---

*Very* useful. Mere presence dissuaded many smaller units, and Gauntlet Conversion of created corpses is extremely beneficial.

---**Experiment S-003, Titan**---

Strong, but fragile. Requires Anima to function. When in downtime between combat, lack of Anima means that Experiment S-003 often deteriorates, sometimes fatally. More must be done to fund Anima production methods before this experiment will be viable.

---**Experiment S-004, Return**---

Often unable to be tested. Cost of implementation often too high for common use, and conversion of normal Skeletons into Shades is inefficient. Until further use is found for Shades, utilisation is not recommended.

---**Acquisition of Resources**---

Acquisition departments have performed fantastically. Exemplary work. Reclamation of existing units from the opposition turned the tide of combat. Again, fantastic work.

---**Unholy Return**---

Although effective, often unneeded. The temporary nature of many of the base Skeleton units meant that larger experiments weren't being utilised as often, making their resurrection pointless. Not useless.

---**Reincarnate**---

As above. Not useless, just not particularly beneficial when working with rudimentary Skeletons. Will become more useful when experiments arise that can capitalise on the procedure.

---**Aftermath Looting**---

As with active acquisition, passive acquisition departments have performed fantastically. Highly useful work.

---**Life Harness**---

As with the Unholy Return and Reincarnate procedures, simply not enough units are able to utilise this effectively. Fragility is also somewhat a concern.

---**NecroCorp Monument**---

As always, monuments to our leader are both beautiful and functional. The benefit of these on the battlefield far outweighed what was required to erect them. I suggest more be built as soon as possible.

---**They Rise**---

Although I must say I usually detest the flair for the theatrical found in some of our more...casual employees, I cannot deny the effectiveness. Concealment of Skeleton units has been highly successful, and may have potential to be expanded on. Should be considered when developing future experiments.

---**Reaper's Blade**---

Was not utilised in this round of tests. As before, speculation suggests that this will be invaluable against more aggressive opposition that...puts their eggs in one basket, so to speak.

---**Dimensional Bleed**---

Although mildly worrying in its implications, accidental spatial tears provided sufficient combat benefit to consider standardisation. Resource cost to create such tears is a little high however. Caution must be taken as well.

---**Experiment S-000, Pure**---

Although unable to be unleashed in this wave of testing, Pure still holds great potential. The more permanent conversion of Skeletons into Anima is *extremely* promising, and I recommend research into it immediately. More developments in Anima production will also greatly expand the possibilities of Pure.

-------- **END REVIEW** --------

As an addendum, I feel I must add praise to our Interim CEO. Mr. Messor's procedures on utilising Skeletons in place of stock resources have provided impressive flexibility on and off the field. You sir, are a revolutionary.

That concludes this year's review. To summarise, mostly good performance, with a few specific letdowns. More work will be put into adaptation of existing technologies held by our enemies, and the use of this adaptation in R&amp;D.

Yours,
Dullahan

4wmbdu,1,2016-08-07,Attempting to land a job in investment banking from a non target school,squid_the_kid,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4wmbdu/attempting_to_land_a_job_in_investment_banking/,"This summer I am interning in the controllers department at one of the top bulge bracket banks. After networking with alumni and professionals across the firm I have come to the conclusion that my educational background in accounting and finance as well as my career goals align with a job in investment banking. 

I am now going into my senior year looking for a full time job in investment banking and I have no idea how to even get an interview. Internal mobility did not work out for me as I wasn't even given the opportunity to prove myself in an in-person interview. I am at the top of my class at the state school I attend, but our finance program is not well established and the school is of very little help. I was able to secure my current internship on my own through my own personal initiative and I am more than determined to do the same this time around. Does anyone have any advice on how I should go about this?"

4wmm9p,1,2016-08-07,"I'm [21/m] dealing with my [20/f] that is abusive, she attacks me physically and emotionally, but we try hard to make it work. I still love her, and I live with her in her house, but I am extremely stressed.",anonrelationshipq,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4wmm9p/im_21m_dealing_with_my_20f_that_is_abusive_she/,"Hi /r/relationship_advice,

I wish I didn't have to post this here but I genuinely need a little bit of guidance because I am struggling to wrap my head around my current situation. Here is a full overview:

My girlfriend and I met when we were 17 and 18 respectively in university. We started dating immediately and very much enjoyed each other's company. Things got complicated when at the same time, I decided to drop out of university to start a company and she decided to buy a house.

She can afford the house because her parents gave her $100K for university, but she managed to get a scholarship to cover her entire tuition. So, she had $100K to  put into buying a house. The house also has a basement apartment that she rents out for $1000 a month. I moved into her house, and I pay $700 a month. She pays ~$2000 a month for her mortgage and other associated bills with owning a house. She also works 4-8 months a year on a co-op internship making a modest amount of money. 

Now, this arrangement has caused both of us a ton of stress in many different departments.

1) Financially -- I, since I work full time, am expected to pay for everything. She does not buy me birthday gifts, or Christmas gifts, or any gifts at all and cites it as ""she is poor"". Of course, I am expected to pay a hefty chunk of change for her gifts. This also ends up causing us to not go on many  dates or do much that costs money because of course I don't want to pay tons of money all the time, and she will never pay for anything.

2) Emotionally -- She is the definition of stressball. If I spill water on the floor when doing dishes she will go ballistic because of past issues with water leaks. If she has a bad day at work she will be in a bad mood all week stressing about work. If I accidentally buy the wrong flavour of a drink in the grocery store, she will not let me do anything in the house until I return it. Sorry for so many examples, but my point is her situation owning a house and going through school kills her emotionally causing unbelievable amounts of stress, which in turn hurts me. She will sometimes attack me emotionally by saying I am ""lazy"" or ""just like my father"" or any number of swear words or insults you can imagine about someone.

3) Physically -- This is the more recent issue. If she has an assignment she has to do all day and I want to do something else, or if I don't clean the bathrooms one weekend and leave it until Monday, or in the general case if I don't do 50% of the housework or make a mistake doing housework -- she will be so stressed that she will start to attack me physically. She has punched me, slapped me, kicked me, twisted my ear, everything you can image. I never retaliate. This, of course, is awful to deal with.

4) Quality of Life -- Since I work full time, I  want to try to do fun things on the weekends, but she is always busy with cleaning the house again, or doing coursework, or extra work for her job, or teaching assistant work, etc, she rarely has a day where she is free and we can have fun. So, I often have little to do, or I go out with friends for the day. This bothers her because she feels alone, but she is also unwilling to go out with my friends if there is ever a time to, because she is so shy. Of course, if I am out, we will eventually argue that I never set up dates or spend time with her. It is also difficult as she has very few friends, and only sees any of them maybe once every 3 months, whereas I have many friends that I like to spend time with at least once a week.

Sometimes, I look up lofts or apartments that I could buy or rent because I feel like the root of all this is this damned house which needs so much maintenance (mow the lawn, feed birds, fill birdbath, pick out weeds, water plants, wash the deck, vacuum, clean all surfaces, dust every corner, etc). I just want a small clean apartment so I can enjoy my youth away from it and not spend it all inside something that demands I keep it clean.

We have been dating for 3 years, and I am the type of person that is aspiring to do well in his career. I love my work and I love meeting new people and creating opportunities with my business. She is the opposite, she is in a typical career path for high achievers (e.g., law, accounting, finance) and wants to get her designations, move up the career ladder, and enjoy her home life.

I want life to be exciting, I want to travel, and I like to compromise my time to be with others and do my chores / personal work on off-hours. She wants life to be relaxing, comfortable, and does not like new experiences; she also always prioritizes chores and personal work before time with friends (e.g., spend an entire afternoon cleaning and don't be with friends versus be with friends during the day when they're available, and clean in the evening).

I don't mean to paint a picture of opposites, but this is my perspective of the situation.

I am trying hard to try to make this work with her, and we have a great future ahead of us considering how young we are and already financially off to a nice start with a house and growing business, but this relationship has been really financially, emotionally, and physically stressful for both of us lately. I'm scared to break up considering out history and possible future together, but I am so stressed and hurt right now."

**tl;dr**: My first girlfriend now of 3 years bought a house while still in school and I dropped out to start a business. The house is extremely stressful and is causing her to stress out so much she physically and emotionally abuses me. I don't know what to do."

Thank you for bearing with me, I'm feeling a little conflicted and confused and unsure and all just bleugh! My apologies, it is really really long!

I'm a Masters student and about seven months ago I (24F) broke up with my girlfriend (25F) after four years together. Honestly, I had missed sleeping with men and have always ALWAYS (since I was a child!) been drawn to BDSM/felt submissive, so i thought that now was as good a time as any to finally go about exploring this stuff. 

So i signed up for a FL account and was chatting to this Dom guy (36) - I wasn't really physically attracted to him but I always enjoyed our conversations and we got on well. We chatted every day for ages and he was always nice and respectful and I was happy that someone would try to build a relationship with me and gain my trust rather than just leading with explicitly sexual messages which seems to be the norm on fetlife. I'm shy and obviously the idea of meeting a guy from a kinky sex site is nerve racking - I've only been with women for the last four years, so pretty inexperienced with sex with/even just interacting in a non-platonic way with men (let alone within a BDSM context) and just didnt really know what to expect. 

We went for drinks a couple of times and I stayed over once and got my first taste of being a sub which I did really enjoy. I was  looking forward to pushing myself a bit more next time and told him as much. 

However we were texting a few days later and he essentially told me I was a complete idiot to be studying the subject that I study as I won't get a job (it's a very competitive field) and it doesn't pay very well anyway so even if I do get a job I'll always be poor. He also slammed me for saying that I would do an unpaid internship  if I was offered one (unfortunately necessary as obviously candidates with experience will be favoured when going for paid jobs and internships are endemic in my chosen field) and basically told me that I was morally bankrupt as I would do an internship even though my personal view is that having to work for free sucks.

He told me that if I continue on my favoured career path I'd ""never be able to afford my own drinks"" and then had a pop at me for never buying the drinks when we went out. But we only went for drinks twice, he has a full time job and is pretty sorted financially and I'm a student living on a part time wage with substantial debts, which he knows about. I also attempted to pay for my own drink when we went out the second time but the bartender told me he'd add it to the bill which the guy just paid. 

This was obviously mortifying as i thought he would be happy to pay for them and i don't want to be seen as an asshole. I've been on dates with men before and bought us drinks but I just didn't really know how to act in this particular situation; I'd never met anyone in this context before and I was so nervous both times i let him take the lead. I got a bit defensive and told him that he wouldn't have to buy me any more drinks and we haven't spoken since. So I guess that is that and we won't be seeing each other any more. 

My confidence has really taken a bash. I never told anybody else about my submissive thoughts and I put myself in a vulnerable position (literally haha) when i stayed over and now I feel the experience has been sullied because he clearly does not respect me as a person and thinks I'm some silly little girl who can't make good career choices and is out to squeeze free drinks out of men. 

I feel like I don't want to go back on FL now as I don't want to open up to someone else only to be slammed again. I told him lots about myself and we really did text a lot so I feel upset that he would say those things to me.  

I don't know why I'm posting this really.  I just felt like I needed to share this experience as I really don't feel comfortable talking about this to any of my friends. I feel really ashamed and like I've done something wrong. 

So.... I was wondering if you guys had any pointers on what I should reasonably expect from a dom? How should I act/how should i treat them? as they wouldn't necessarily be a ""boyfriend"" so do different rules apply? Should a submissive not defend their career choices? He seemed to genuinely want me to say that I would give up and do something else instead, but I'm halfway through a degree! I literally can't! 

If you've read all this then thank you and I would appreciate any response, anecdotes or advice! :)

4wmuq7,3,2016-08-07,[software engineering] Need some tips on applying for entry level positions out of state,roharia,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/4wmuq7/software_engineering_need_some_tips_on_applying/,"Hello, I've been searching for a job for two months now out of college in May. I have a bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Multimedia Web Design and Development.

My focuses mainly lie in full stack web development, LAMP mainly. Things like PHP/JavaScript/HTML/CSS, I'm pretty good at all of it (or I think so anyway). Also done a little bit with Node/Mongo/Express.

For my summer internship I did a lot of .NET and Microsoft SQL stuff, and I see a lot of jobs with .NET.

I've created two seperate resumes for both of these things (web dev side and .NET and more of a general resume) to tailor myself more to the jobs I want.

I've applied for entry level, internships, and regular mid level stuff (just to try) and have had 3 interviews. 1 of the interviews just from the employers calling me out of a favor my dad asked of a friend. The recruiter gave me some advice on tailoring my resume for the job description, and he said my resume actually looked very good otherwise and that he was surprised that I could not find anything. They were looking for more senior level developers, nothing my pace.

My dads friend works at Chase/JP Morgan as a software developer and she officially referred me and submitted my resume to some of her friends at Chase. I haven't heard back yet, but it's been a week. 

I'm not being picky about jobs here. I am open to almost anything and have been applying as such. Pay is not a huge factor for me, I do not have loans and my parents are willing to help me relocate and support me until I can stand on my own feet. (Very thankful for this). I'm asking for pay like $40,000 in cities where the average pay even for an entry level is closer to $60,000 and adjusting per the average pay in those cities. So when I said earlier that I'm applying to the .NET and web developer jobs, I'm really applying to everything, but those are my two major focuses from my resume point of view.


I'm honestly just not sure why I'm having no luck. My roommate who studied the same thing as me is also having difficulties. We went to a decent university, nothing great, but not bad either (or at least I hope so).

Now, I am applying out of state primarily in San Francisco and San Jose. I understand that these are very competitive areas. These people want to be able to interview me in person. My uncle has a vacant house in the area which he has graciously allowed me to stay at if I get an interview at any places, or simply want to go to CA to look around. I figure this might be a waste of money if it doesn't work out. Instead, I've put his address on my resume when applying to any CA jobs. At very least I can use this as a gauge to see if actually being in the area will help me or not. If I get more hits or potential interviews, I am able to go out and interview if there is a reasonable chance of getting the job. My dad said if I really want to go out and search for jobs that way I can certainly do so. 

Also applying in NY. Washington, Colorado with no luck. I went to school in CT but do not wish to return to CT if I can help it.

Going to post my resume(s) here.

This is general resume I use for most jobs: http://imgur.com/a/kIHOz

This is the resume I use for more web based jobs: http://imgur.com/a/8HvxU


I'm looking for any input on any areas I could improve on, any places I could specifically look at. By the way, I did apply to some companies that my school is affiliated with, but most of them are in CT. Also, do you think I should actually make my way out to CA and stay there for a month or two? I understand that it is very competitive right now, and I should have probably applied for jobs well before I graduated. I ended up applying a couple weeks after I graduated which was just so late.

* **What?** The San Francisco Marathon
* **When?** July 31, 2016
* **How far?** 26.2 miles
* **Website?** http://www.thesfmarathon.com

### Goals
| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| A |2:49:59 | 
| B |2:59:59 | 
| C |Finish |

### Training
I signed up for the San Francisco marathon because the company I spent this summer with offered free entry for all employees. It would by my first marathon after racing shorter distances in road races and triathlons for the last few years in college. I had a solid base from the past semesters on my university's tri team, but marathon-focused training started at the beginning of the summer when I moved to SF. By chance, I met another intern who signed up for the full and had a long running history as well--he was even from my hometown! We had similar paces (ok, so he was a little faster than I was), so we decided to train together and became good training buddies over the course of the summer.

While I originally planned to follow one of Higdon's marathon plans (because it was the first one I found), we eventually decided to take ideas from several plans and choose our own destiny. We weren't always consistent, but our weekly schedule generally followed the structure of easy Monday, #TempoTuesday, easy Wednesday, track workout Thursday, easy Friday, medium long run at MP on Saturday, and long run on Sunday. Mileage built steadily for me throughout the training cycle from 40 &gt; 45 &gt; 50 &gt; 55 &gt; 60 &gt; 70 &gt; 70 &gt; 80 &gt; 60 &gt; 45 &gt; 35. This brought a number of firsts for me: first week over 60 miles, first run over 14 miles, and a 5k PR in a tempo-turned-time-trial. Originally aiming for any time below 3:00, hubris mixed with taper-renewed legs shifted our goal to sub-2:50.
### Pre-race
Gun was scheduled to be at 5:30am, so we did most of our training in the morning. For the two weeks leading up to the race we were out running every morning by 5:30. The day before the race we met for lunch and to discuss our plan: easy for the first three miles, consistent effort on the hills, split the first half at 1:25, and ride the hills down for the second half. The SF Marathon has approximately 990ft of climbing throughout, and the first half has a net uphill of about 200ft. The course is one loop around San Francisco, so the second half has an equivalent net downhill. Before heading to bed at 7:00 pm, we borrowed a friend's pair of hair clippers to cut my hair into an arrow, which I dyed blue for the race in hopes of harnessing any latent airbending powers I might have.
### Miles [1] to [6]
6:36, 6:38, 6:26, 6:31, 6:26

The race started on the Embarcadero--the very east coast of San Francisco. Being one of the only parts of the city around our apartments that didn't have traffic lights every couple of steps, this was one route we had run to death in training. The atmosphere of the race, though, was electirc and made the initial five miles a breeze. The first interesting point in the course comes during mile 3: Ft. Mason hill, which is small enough to seem inconsiquential but large enough to make you feel it. We planned to start slow, ride that pace up Ft. Mason, and use the downhill to roll into MP. Otherwise, this section [was flat](http://imgur.com/a/h5SEE) and [felt great](http://imgur.com/a/jcBwQ).

### Miles [6] to [11]
6:52, 6:21, 6:04, 6:27, 6:26

Mile six started our ascent up to the Golden Gate Bridge. We chose to lay back on the hill rather than push. It payed off because the next four miles, an out and back on the bridge, let us stretch our legs and get moving. The GGB is very windy, so we tucked in behind a really tall guy and soon enough had a group of about seven running and drafting off of each other. I took my first gu (strawberry banana, yum) at the turnaround and missed my first water cup basketball shot of many. These miles especially felt smooth and controlled--we were cracking jokes the entire time and thanked the tall guy for leading as we came up on the next section of the course.
### Miles [11] to [20]
6:07, 6:28, 6:31, 6:17, 6:26, 6:39, 6:33, 6:19, 6:23, 6:14

Mile eleven marks the first major descent of the course and provides a breathtaking view of breaker beach. The end of that hill also marked the beginning of my glutes and hamstrings complaining. I'm not sure which ended up feeling worse through the run--the uphills or the downhills. Rolling hills and sporadic internal cursing followed as we made our way south towards Golden Gate Park and the halfway point of the race. 

The SF marathon also runs a first and second half-marathon, so the crowd thinned and we found ourselves relatively isolated as the half-marathoners split from us at mile 13. I checked my watch at 13.1 and--a pleasant surprise--found a new HM PR (the old one was pretty soft)! Even if I didn't finish at that point I would have something to be proud of, right? Anyway, running through GGP was beautiful and something we'd only been able to do once before. I took my second gu (also strawberry banana, why change from perfection) at mile 17 and my legs continued to feel strong through the park as we crested the last hill onto Haight Street. Unfortunately, my partner was having some stomach issues and chose to forgo a gu in hopes water and nuun would be able to fuel him to the finish. 

### Miles [20] to [26.2]
6:14, 6:33, 6:54, 6:24, 6:21, 6:22, 5:53

The second half of the marathon has a net downhill and I'm fairly certain all of that comes within one half mile (at least that's what it felt like). My legs, after feeling strong for the first 20 miles, decided that, eh, maybe this running stuff really isn't for us and maybe we should slow down (see mile 22 split). I've heard that a marathon is a 20 mile warm up with a 6 mile race, and I absolutely agree. The last six miles consisted of an endless cycle of checking my watch, cursing that it really didn't _feel_ like I was slowing down, putting my back into it to get to the right pace, and waiting ten seconds before checking my watch again. At mile 24 I realized we needed to speed up in order to meet our goal and, in the most dramatic of ""save yourself!"" moments, was forced to drop my partner as he was running out of matches to burn. The last 0.2 miles of the race felt like [the longest 320 meters of my life](http://imgur.com/a/uBwNW). In the end I got outkicked by a guy who looked to be in his 50's (how can you sprint for so long at the end of a marathon????), but ended up crossing the line with an official time of [**2:49:43**](http://imgur.com/a/LJYNO)! Strava even had me 0.15 miles long!
### Post-race
I was wiped, but stuck around to cheer in my friend who finished with a time of 2:50:47. I took my time walking (more like hobbling) to get recovery food and bask in the catharsis that is the post-race finish line. The week after the race has been one of incredible soreness and slow recovery. It took me at least four days before I could walk down stairs at a reasonable speed and the recovery run I took yesterday started out great and ended with me barely holding onto recovery pace. To add insult to injury, I had ordered a pair of shorts from Tracksmith at the beginning of the summer to claim their PR bonus. Unfortunately, when I submitted my application, they told me that first-time marks can't count to the bonus. Total bummer! I don't think I'll have a chance to run another race by the end of the summer either, so I won't be able to claim the reward. Double bummer!!
### What's next?
When I signed up for the marathon I didn't realize it was two weeks before another race I signed up for... A half ironman (which at least isn't my first HIM). Hoping I can ride the fitness from the marathon and that I'll be recovered by next Sunday. After that I'm signed up for my first full ironman in October.

4wmx48,8,2016-08-07,"[20F] My boyfriend [20M] of 2 years is emotionally draining, and needy - or am I just harsh?",throwawuay123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wmx48/20f_my_boyfriend_20m_of_2_years_is_emotionally/,"Sorry it’s so long I had to get it all out.

Basically my boyfriend of 2 years has become very needy and clingy in some ways.  At times I feel he borders on almost being controlling.  However I don’t know if his behaviours are just normal and my frustration is just making me see them this way, or if I am justified in how I feel.  

Firstly, he is **clingy and overemotional**.  If we can’t see each other for even a week, he becomes anxious and gets in foul moods over it.  We recently didn’t see each other for around 6 days – Monday to Saturday – and he cried on seeing me because he missed me so much.  To me this seemed overemotional and I told him to stop.  He also constantly throws himself pity parties and has a very negative attitude to life – he will complain that nothing is going right if he can’t see me for more than a few days, when in my mind, we have it extremely good at the moment.  Seeing each other every few days is ideal for me, as I’m usually busy with other things like seeing friends and family, and as I’m introverted I need time to myself in between these things.  He doesn’t respect my introverted nature either and takes it very personally when I ask for alone time.

His negative attitude and ‘poor me’ attitude also means often times when I am upset or need support, he ends up making it about himself.  For example, I am soon starting a new internship job and his only concern is that he won’t see me because I’m working in a different city five days a week.  He brushes over my fears about the new job.

In some ways I also feel he borders on **controlling behaviour** a little.  He has rarely actively stopped me from doing anything, but he sometimes guilt trips me to the point where I feel bad for things I do.  These things include him ignoring me and acting huffy over text when I see friends or go for a ‘girls night out’.  He’s expressed that he dislikes me posting nice selfies and going out dressed up or wearing revealing clothes as it may attract other guys attention.  These are all things he disapproves of and guilt trips me for, but has never flat out told me not to do.  However, he has practically prohibited me from having male celebrity crushes, from talking to guys when I’m out in clubs or bars, and he hates me having male friends and has prohibited me in the past from taking to male friends, who I’ve thus been forced to keep a secret from him.  I know this sounds awful, but they are male friends who I have lived with in college accommodation, worked with, or guys who I hang out with in my main friend group.  Cutting them out entirely is rather impossible!

He also expresses that he should be my number one priority, above friends, family, work, etc.  I understand that we are very important to each other but in my mind I do not ditch friends or family or work for him.  Am I being unreasonable?

He also becomes angry and moody if I don’t text back pretty much constantly all day every day – but when I’m with him, he hates me using my phone at all.  However he always wants me to put up pictures of us on my snapchat and if I say no he becomes very sad. He also expresses and overall dislike for most of my friends.

**HOWEVER** I know all of this paints him in an awful light, I know, but when things are good, they are great.  He’s my best friend and he loves me unconditionally, would never hurt me or cheat on me, would never so much as look at another girl, thinks I’m always beautiful etc.  He built my confidence up from next to nothing when I met him and I know he has insecurity issues which cause this behaviour.  Thing is, I don’t know if I can help him get over those issues when he still worries I’m not attracted to him after 2 years of me showing the opposite... He is the kindest person but at the moment this relationship is emotionally draining me at a time when I’m in college and about to start a great intern job – I need my energy.  The emotional drainage is making me question also whether I’m still “in love” with him.

I can’t bear to break his heart however and I love him so much.  We have a holiday coming up very soon so I can’t make my mind up until after then.  This will be a very hard year for us as he is starting college and I don’t know whether breaking up would just destroy everything. I could always picture a future, even now, if his negative attitude could end and I could get around feeling like he’s limiting my freedom.

**TL;DR**: I feel like my boyfriend is over emotional and too needy at times and sometimes borders on controlling, but I don’t know if I’m justified in thinking this.  I love him and want the relationship to work but don’t know how to solve how draining he is.

4wn8ka,25,2016-08-07,I can code in a few languages. But I want to become proficient in one and be confident about it.,spartan_noble6,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4wn8ka/i_can_code_in_a_few_languages_but_i_want_to/,"**Preface:** I ran this post by the mods

**Backstory:**

I will be a junior this fall majoring in CS. In preparation for applying for summer internships, I want to solve a load of problems like the UVa Online Judge or HackerRank. I want to focus on data structures, and solve enough problems to be able to confidently tell a recruiter that ""I'm 100% proficient in [this] language; here is my proof for it.""

This is how my college classes have gone so far:

Java was the first language I learnt.

I learnt data structure concepts in C++ by implementing every structure from scratch.

I learnt systems programming in C.

I recently started learning Python on my own time, but I dont have as much experience with this language. But its definitely a breeze.

So from learning C and C++, I'm very familiar with pointers, mem alloc, running times for most data structures.

**The Problem:**

I've never used the standard libraries to work with data structures, I've only used the structures I've had to implement from scratch. 

Can anyone tell me about the D.S libraries of the languages I listed? I want to know which language is the best to work with D.S. I want to pick one, code a lot in it and be able to say I'm 100% confident in this language.

Thank you

Edit:

Also, something I'm worried about: not being taken seriously when I say Python is my best language. Sounds dumb, but how dumb is it? Its a high level language, and people might think I dont fully understand programming the way you would from programming in C... :/ Sorry for piling on questions."
4wn8ox,1,2016-08-07,"Still don't know what I ""want to be when I grow up""...",MaximumIntroversion,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4wn8ox/still_dont_know_what_i_want_to_be_when_i_grow_up/,"So, I'm 27, quickly approaching 28, and I've been incredibly frustrated for several years, now, because I feel like my life is going nowhere, and I can't seem to figure out how to get a handle on it. Unfortunately, I've never really know ""what I want to be when I grow up"". Throughout high school, I considered myself a computer nerd, so I just assumed I'd end up doing something with that. 

After high school, I went into college and started with an IT-related major. For five years, I ended up bouncing between different IT majors, because I wasn't really feeling like any of them were the right fit for me. I also briefly tried majoring in business, but I hated it. By the end of year five, I was feeling like I needed a break from school. I then finally figured out something I felt like I could pursue; it occurred to me that I really like working with video production, specifically editing and post-production details, and that I wanted to learn and better my skills, and hopefully do something with it.

Having been burnt out from college, though, I didn't have the energy to pursuse another 3-4 years of schooling, and I ended up attending and graduating from a trade school program in media production. It's been two years since I graduated from that. Since then, I've been looking for and sending my resume off to any opportunity I can find, whether it be local or something that requires a move, whether it be a paying job or just an unpaid ""internship"" type thing just for experience. And I've made zero advancement towards this career. I've not even been able to get an interview with anyone, heck, I've not even been able to get any kind of communication with anyone aside from some generic ""Thank you for your interest, but we're looking at candidates with other skillsets"" rejection letters.

So, I've come to see that this venture of mine was nothing more than a failed pipe dream. Such is life, I suppose. The problem is, I don't know where I go from here. Since I was 18, I've just been working super low level retail and retail-ish positions, just to have some level of income, but I hate that, and I have no desire to advance up the ""retail"" path, into management and corporate work. It's just not for me.

I'm not opposed to returning to school, but I don't want to go back unless I have a plan in mind, because I don't want to waste another 5+ years bouncing between majors and aimlessly taking classes, and racking up debt for nothing. But I can't figure out what I want to do with myself. There's nothing that really strikes me, there's nothing I feel like I have an affinity for, there's nothing I can think of that I feel like I could reasonably do well and be successful at.

Over the last few months, I've been browsing over different majors at my local colleges, and I'm just not really finding something I want to pursue, nothing that stands out to me, nothing that interests me.

Now, don't misunderstand. I'm not naive, and I'm not looking for some magical ""dream job"", I'm not expecting to do something that will get me ""rich"", or whatever. I know that most people don't really ""love"" their job, and I get that. But I think that, for the most part, a lot of people will end up doing something that they feel makes sense for themselves, something that they're confident in their abilities to perform, something that they can be satisfied with saying they do. I'd be totally happy just to have that.

And yeah, I know that plenty of people have ""late starts"" in life, and may not hit their stride until their 30s, 40s, or even older. *Maybe* my situation might be better 10, 15, 20 years from now. Who knows? But what can I be doing now to have a more satisfactory life for myself in the short term? I feel like I'm wasting away, in a super menial job, making maybe 15k a year if I'm lucky, and I just feel stuck. More than that, I feel lost. I don't know what I CAN do that I haven't already done or been doing.

So... What do I do?"

he told us the crew got 'sent home' less than a half hour after we found the address of the warehouse. 

also he goes from eating donuts at the stream warehouse to eating at home extremely fast, especially in NYC.  as someone who was watching it unfold live it was about a 20-30minute difference between when he posted hes eating donuts to when he said hes home.

ALSO if he was the legit why the fuck wouldnt he take any pics when the crew was told they were off for the day?  especially knowing there is a whole subreddit he just did an AMA for desperate for any information.  he didnt think to take one pic on the way out?  not of the building nothing?

lastly we have this jen bullshit.  we called his bluff and told him to go take a picture in front of the ware house.  he said he would but voila [jen came to intervene](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrankOcean/comments/4wn1km/we_all_just_got_told_to_go_home/d68c5p0).  it is obvious is using the device of this fake jen character so he could get out of taking the promised pic in front of the warehouse.

4wncfb,138,2016-08-07,A few pieces of helpful advice from a recent Engineering Graduate to current students.,the_Vagabond7,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4wncfb/a_few_pieces_of_helpful_advice_from_a_recent/,"Hello, Reddit Engineering students! I am a recent graduate with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I graduated this past May with a 3.6 GPA and a minor in mathematics. I am now working for a company that designs and builds industrial robotics and automation equipment. Before that I had a part time internship as a systems engineer for a major international company.

I spent some time this past week reflecting on school and some of the things I wish I had known as a student that I now realize working in industry. I figured I might as well share some of my conclusions with people that might still benefit from it.

1. Academia and industry are two very different animals with very different priorities. In academia everyone cares about what you know, in industry people only care about what you can do.
 
 As a student every project, homework assignment, and lab required me to show detailed math working out the physics, signal processing, ect. I was required to include some kind of math on my reports even if I didn't need any kind of advanced math. I would find myself looking on google for relevant equations to include in a report even though the math in no way helped the project.  But this is the priority of academia. Academics do research and publish academic papers. In project classes, if you built the machine or accomplished the objective of the project but didn't use math, the professors would say ""Well if you didn't use math, then you aren't really engineering anything. You are just building something.""

 That was bullshit. I work for a company that designs large and complex machines, we do work for a variety of large companies in aerospace, aeronautics, automotives, and more. I work with engineers that have masters degrees and engineers with associates degrees. Nobody here is solving differential equations by hand, none of our documentation has linear algebra matrices, no one is including calculus on our reports. Actual math is done by software, or we consult charts (that were made by software.) By my professors definition, none of the people I work with are actually engineering anything. We are just building stuff. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a bunch of people with PhD's were telling us all that the only jobs that count are the types of jobs that are being done by people with PhD's.

  All of the math I did was helpful in developing a strong physical intuition for how things work. Being able to ""think in calculus"" is invaluable. I have a much deeper understanding of electromagnetics, mechanics, signal processing, and the like because I internalized the math behind it. But realistically, in industry, nobody is ever going to run into your office and say ""quick I have 5 differential equations that need to be solved in an hour by hand and the client needs you to show your work!"" 

   All of the math and physics you learn is a means to an end, not the end itself. Which leads me to point number   two.

2. Projects are more important than theory. In industry, real world knowledge is vastly more important than theory. 

  It doesn't matter if you are really knowledgeable about the electromagnetic physics that goes into the inner workings of a synchronous motor. It is great if you know all about the nonlinear equations that go into the power electronics of a motor drive. But the real question is are you familiar with the different brands and models of VFDs currently on the market? Do you know the difference between a powerflex 525 and a 527 and which one would you choose for a specific application? Do you know all the parameters of the 525 and how to set it up? Can you get it to communicate on a network with a PLC and then program it to do what you want through the use of an AOI? Does the PLC you are using even support AOIs? Would you use a star or ring network? 

  This is the stuff that matters in industry. You don't learn it from text books or studying for exams though. You learn it by doing projects. Maybe it is a school project, maybe it is a project at home, maybe it is a project at an internship, but you learn the important stuff from projects. If you go into an interview and can talk intelligently about the stuff that actually relates to the industry you are going into, that will be far more impressive than being able to talk intelligently about convolution integrals.

3. Network, network, network. Some of my friends that I graduated with are still looking for jobs. I had four offers before I graduated. I had great success because I went to every industry showcase, career fair, or industry lecture that I could. I talked to every engineer and HR person that would come to campus. And it was often times uncomfortable or awkward because like many engineering students, I am not a very social person. But the engineers and HR people from companies knew my face and knew my name long before I graduated. When I started putting out applications I got called back to places because I knew the names of people that worked there and put their names on my cover letters. Networking is very important even if it is annoying and uncomfortable.

 I got my internship by going to industry dinners that my school set up and talking to people. I think my one big regret is that I didn't push sooner for an internship. I didn't have an internship until my senior year. I reasoned I didn't know enough to be useful as an intern, but even a senior doesn't know enough to be really useful. You learn to be useful on the job from experience. Get an internship as soon as you can. Don't wait til you are a junior or senior. Trust me, you aren't going to be any better of an engineer when you are a senior than you were as a sophmore. You are only going to have more math and theory under your belt and I've already told you how much that counts for.

  Those are the most important points I can think of. Most people try to emphasize good study habits, do alot of practice problems, and things like that. That is the way to be a good student. But one day you want to be a good engineer, and studying is only going to take you so far. You can be great at solving problems on exams and still be a really crappy engineer in industry.

If any other graduates or working engineers want to add things they wish they had known as a student please add them. If you are a student and have questions please ask. With school about to start back up (or maybe your semester already started) this is a good time to have a conversation."
4wne18,1,2016-08-07,Advice needed regarding ECs and college shortlist,rawizard,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/4wne18/advice_needed_regarding_ecs_and_college_shortlist/,"Hello all! I am a rising senior just now beginning college applications. I believe I am a strong applicant in general, though I honestly feel like my ECs might be a bit weak for my school choices (despite the opinions of my parents, lol). Obviously I can't do much to improve them now; but how should I describe them in the activities section and essays to make them sound as good as possible?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a male, White and Asian Indian (might not put that in applications), going to a public high school and regional STEM Governor's School in VA. Like I said, I'm happy with my academics and test scores:  

* 4.0 UW GPA  
* 4.37 W  
* 35 ACT composite  
* 780, 790, 800 on 3 SAT II subject tests  
* 5 on 4 AP exams, 4 on 2 others  
* Mostly AP and dual enrollment classes

&amp;nbsp;

Here are my ECs. They are not in order of importance yet because I am unsure about that. Let me know what you think:

**Programming**: This is a hobby that I got into in middle school and didn't have the opportunity to do in school until last year. I have taught myself languages/technologies including HTML, CSS, JS, Python, some Java and C++. Last summer I spent a large portion of time developing a game for iOS with Unity3D (game engine) but I haven't finished it yet. I have also completed 30+ problems on the math/programming website Project Euler.  I have competed in programming competitions with a school team (but not required), including 2nd place at an area competition.

&amp;nbsp;

**Guitar**: I have been taking lessons weekly for about 6 years now, learning rock, jazz, and classical. My teacher (who I might ask for a letter of rec) holds annual concerts where the students perform a song with a band, and I have been the headlining player the last 3 years.

&amp;nbsp;

**Soccer**: I have been playing in general for about 9 years, first a rec team and now playing with a club for the last 4 years. We practice or play games every week for about 3 seasons a year. I love playing but I don't want to give up all my time for it, so I haven't played in high school and won't play in college except club or intramural.

&amp;nbsp;

**Volunteering**: I'm not sure if I should split this up or keep them combined, so here goes. 
- I have been a volunteer at a local hospital for 3 years, in the emergency and guest services departments. It's a summer program, 20 hours/week for 2 weeks. I've done a few hours in the school year, too.  
- Starting last year, I became an assistant coach for a middle school MathCounts team (one which I was on just 4 years ago). I go to 2 hr weekly practices during the school year and help the students do practice problems, explaining some problems they can't do, and teaching problem solving skills. I have also led practice in the coach's absence.

&amp;nbsp;

**Work**: I feel like these are some of my more impressive ECs, but the first two are just starting this summer and onward. Also, should I split these up?  

* Paid intern at a local tech/business consulting company, working 30 to 35 hrs/week. My title is Jr. IT Business Analyst. I work with a team doing web development, using HTML, JS and jQuery, on a company product that's being marketed to large businesses. I have gained experience in real-world software development by doing testing and documentation, and soon I will get to work on feature development and backend/database stuff.  
* Paid intern at a local healthcare magazine (owned and run by family members but colleges don't need to know that ;)), working about 15 hrs/week. I am the solo developer of a companion app for the magazine. I'm self-taught in Swift and the use of iOS development technologies like Xcode and some APIs. I hope to finish and submit the app to the App Store before the summer ends.  
* This isn't really work because it is unpaid, but it is basically an organized business. In freshman year, I joined up with my precalculus teacher and several peers to cofound a group that develops web-based math games for high school level math topics. We began meeting weekly throughout the school year. In the first year, I contributed to two games focused on graphing. Then in sophomore year, we reorganized and I became a team lead for two other games, focused on geometry and trigonometry. We also started to demo the games to teachers in hopes of integrating them into classrooms. However, last year, meetings fizzled out because most of the group was seniors applying to college and they got too busy/lost interest. The website is still up but nothing has been done with it in a long time. So this was really only a 9th and 10th grade thing.

&amp;nbsp;

**Clubs**: I am in Mu Alpha Theta, the Science National Honor Society, the Spanish National Honor Society, the National English Honor Society, and as of this past year, the National Honor Society. I do tutoring for all of these groups, but I have no leadership roles. I am part of the school's Interstellar Team, where we compete every two weeks or so in an online math competition against another school. Also, this past year I joined the Scholastic Bowl team as a varsity member. We had matches every week in the fall and almost made it to regionals. I was one of the team's math specialists, usually put in for the team round when there were math questions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Cubing**: Last year, I got into cubing (solving Rubik's cube-type puzzles) because I saw my friends doing it in school. I bought my own speed cube and now have been practicing almost every day since April. I average around 40s and my personal best is 26s. I haven't done any competitions yet.

&amp;nbsp;

**Languages**: For a little bit in past summers I was teaching myself Italian and keeping up my Spanish using Duolingo, some penpal websites, and some books. However, I haven't been able to stick with it so I might not mention it. Although I may write about it as an interest in essays, since ""language"" is a common theme in a lot of my interests (programming, music, math, foreign languages).

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone have any advice about how I should write these in the activities section in order to best portray them?  
Also, in regards to my college shortlist:  
If you hadn't already figured it out, my intended major is CS and possibly math. My current list includes MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon, Rensselaer, UNC, UVA, Ga. Tech, UIUC, W&amp;M, and Va. Tech. Are there any other schools I should be considering, especially matches?

Thanks!"
4wne6n,2,2016-08-07,I hate my father,Jersey--,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4wne6n/i_hate_my_father/,"My father is an awful man set in his own ways. Growing up it always had to be his way or no way at all. Now at 20 years old, nothing at all has changed. I am not allowed to sleep over anywhere. He's mad at me for working at a part-time movie theater because he does not think it is a good job, even though I have the ability to do my schoolwork there. He is forcing my 10 year old brother to only play one sport, tennis. My brother expressed interest in baseball, basketball, and soccer but my dad would not sign him up for any of these because they do not suit his interests. My brother is a very awkward kid and I think he should be playing more team sports where he can talk to other kids and have fun, but he is stuck playing tennis for 10+ hours a week because of what my father wants.


I recently got an internship at a dentist office because he asked me to, and I did that while still working part time at the movie theater for a month until my summer class started. I will also add that I was playing on a baseball team and a softball team at the time. I decided to cut down on hours at the internship because I am taking biology because thats what he wants me to do. I am struggling, which I am okay with, but he yells at me daily telling me I should have quit my job at the movie theater and kept the job at the dentist office. My test grades so far were an 84 on the first test and a 68 on the second, but the second was on 13 chapters of material that we covered over a period of 10 days. I was planning on moving out this year to live on campus again, and I was fine taking out loans to pay for but he told me I could live at home and enjoy some freedoms. I decided to spend a saturday night going to a friends house and I spent the night there. Ever since then I keep hearing that it was a mistake to stay over that one night.


Another thing that I hate about my father is how he is overweight, but criticizes my attempts to get in shape. Right now I am currently cutting weight with the goal of retaining as much strength as I can so I am in the gym 2 to 3 times a week. Today he told me I am ""Withering away"" Just because he can see my abs. He has been overweight my whole life and thinks any attempt to lose weight is unhealthy even though hes never tried it. I can't get a word in with him, because he is never willing to listen and my mom doesn't help out. He is retired and he spends all of his time either with my brother or at home on the couch or computer. I can't think of anyone that I hate at all except for him."
4wnexe,2,2016-08-07,Choosing to live with Nparents to get through Masters. Need advice!,wornout2016,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4wnexe/choosing_to_live_with_nparents_to_get_through/,"Hi. I currently am in contact with Nparents in order to get through Masters. This upcoming two semesters I have a form 2 and a half hours away which is a huge relief. I took out the loans for the tuition and board in my name so it can't be taken away or hung over my head.

However, they help with food and some school expenses such as research. I have decided that having them in my life during this time is overall beneficial since it allows me to gain full independence as quickly as possible instead of struggling to pay expenses and possibly being forced to drop out for that reason. Furthermore, I am applying for my citizenship from the country my father is from and I need him to be involved in order to get it. It is,important to me to have this citizenship as I want to move there and work. I am not afraid of them stopping me from graduating as they love to brag about degrees.

The two semesters,of my internship in hospitals will be with them. I work 40 hours a week and do research so I can be out of the house most of the time and my 25 years of living with them has shown me how to make a rhythm of avoidance.

I have a wonderful fiance who completely understands and accepts that this situation in my family is real. We plan to move in together right after I get licensed. We cannot do it right now as he is stuck 2000 miles away getting his green card.

What I need advice on is how to not lose sight of independence after graduation. I become depressed on having 2 more years with them before I graduate particularly after a family reunion in which my SG sister was threatened with physical violence. I am the sometimes SG sometimes ignored. It emotionally crushes me to see the abuse she receives even more than the abuse I have. How does one deal with seeing your siblings suffer?

How can I start planning for NC now to make it smooth after graduation? 

How can I believe this will end sooner than it feels?

And did anyone else allow contact in order to get through school? Sometimes I feel that I am being a wimp but I truly do believe that my education will lead me to greater and truer independence.

If you need any more details please ask."

I didn't have it on my resume but during an interview I was asked about my tech side. I mentioned that I really enjoy building computers and troubleshooting and he said he really enjoys hearing that. So would it be a decent idea to be upfront about that and put it on my resume? Along with some programming projects I'm doing.

4wnmwy,5,2016-08-07,My [22 M] girlfriend [21 F] physically threatened her roommate. Not sure how to feel.,hellothere222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wnmwy/my_22_m_girlfriend_21_f_physically_threatened_her/,"Hello all.  So my girlfriend of 1.5 years has always been the type of person who does not take shit from people.  This is not a bad quality at all but there was an incident a week ago that has been hard to get out of my mind.

My girlfriend (who i'll call Amy) subleased an apartment over the summer for her internship and has had a few disagreements with the existing roommates about responsibilities around the apartment.  In short, they expected her to do dishes, take out trash, and purchase supplies for the kitchen even though my girlfriend never cooks or uses their plates, utencils, etc and had separate trash. 

Last week one of her roomates (Jen, for the story) demanded very rudely that she do the dishes but Amy chose not to respond and ignored it altogether.  Then Jen demanded that she ""at least take out the trash"" and again Amy ignored the request.

*Edit: Amy was very drunk at the time of the incident and when I confronted her about it (friday)*

On Friday the same week, Amy and I arrived at her apartment to find bags of trash stacked outside of Amy's bedroom door.  She was furious and moved them to the middle of the floor in the kitchen.  About an hour later, Jen arrived and knocked on the bedroom door and demanded that Amy take out the trash.  Amy refused and said ""what are you going to do about it?""  Jen then threatened to have her evicted by claiming that I lived with her (I had spent the night several times and had some clothes there, admittedly) and called Amy several offensive names.  Amy then stepped towards her and said aggressively ""you can either call me names like a bitch or take this outside and settle it"".  Jen retreated in fear, calling Amy ""white trash"" and hid in her bedroom.

I am not the type of person to physically threaten anybody, regardless of the context.  Even though I feel Amy had a point about the trash and Jen is a huge asshole, I was disturbed that the solution was to threaten her.  What made it worse is that Amy felt happy and said over and over to me that Jen ""shouldn't talk unless she can back it up"" and that Jen was ""a little scared pussy"".

This behavior was, and still is, disturbing to me.  When I told her that I felt very uncomfortable with her threatening people, Amy became very angry and accused me of ""trying to make her feel like shit"" and claimed that I didn't support or love her.  She said that this was her way of handling things and I shouldn't care because it has nothing to do with me.  I told her that I do love her and I want to support her, but I don't like the idea of her beating people up over verbal disputes.  She then said that I could never understand because I ""am a rich, spoiled pussy"" who doesn't know what the world is really like.  I reiterated that regardless of my background I don't agree with what she did but we concluded that we have our own views so there is no point in discussing it.

I feel disturbed by her aggressive nature.   I don't want to talk to my friends or family about this since I do not want anybody thinking negatively of her, but I feel like I need some outside opinions.  Am I overreacting?  Is it normal to threaten people in this way?  Am I in the wrong for judging how another person handles a situation differently?

tl;dr **Girlfriend threatened roommate over dispute about taking out the trash.  When I told her how I felt, she said she did nothing wrong and I have no right to judge her.**

Thanks for your time."

Of course, being a stupid 18-year-old, I had no idea how truly expensive it was.  You told me everything would be fine, and that my father was covering half of my tuition.  He makes decent money, and I know both of us would have to take out loans.  However you said that wasn't a problem.  After all, I got need-based grants, and together, we wouldn't have a problem paying things off.

Throughout the process, I was glad about how open I thought we were about talking about debt.  I liked that I could check Great Lakes and see how much I owed.  If I took a summer class, I discussed how much it would cost and where we'd get the money before I did it.  I thought we were in a genuinely good position in that we would openly discuss debt and how much I had.

At the beginning of each enrollment season, you sent me an invoice about how much I owed for loans under my own name.  I looked over the invoice, usually signed it, and didn't question it.  You also would casually bring up Parent Plus loans, which you said you'd pay.  At one point, I asked you how much debt I had accumulated.  You gave me a non-response and said ""Don't worry about the debt.  Everything will be fine.""  After I pressed, you told me $60K.  $60K is a lot, but in my field, I'd be able to get rid of it in about two years.  Except there was the caveat that my degree program had zero prospects due to shitty, dinosaur professors and no connections at my school, which meant no internships in my field because none of my professors worked a real job in their lives.  So off it was to grad school, where I racked up another $40K in debt.

Of course, I take full responsibility for knowingly going $100K in debt, but I came out with good job prospects.  It was an issue of ""Make no money at a shitty job in a city with low wages and be $60K in debt, or make a lot of money at a better job in a city with high wages and be $100K in debt.""  For me, it was a no-brainer.  Yes, being $100K in debt was going to suck, but I had all of loans mapped out in order of interest rate and a solid plan to pay them off in three years.  I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I'm making low six figures directly out of school and knew I'd be done with them reasonably quickly.  Let's hope I'm lucky enough to keep that salary and that I don't get hit by a bus or have a stroke and become unable to work.

Last week, you sent me an email casually asking ""Do you get these?""  It was an email from a loan provider with a list of Parent Plus loans that, surprise, *you want me to pay off entirely.*  One of them has a **7.8% interest rate**, which is more than any of my other loans.  Remember how you said I was $60K in debt when I asked?  Well with interest accumulated, I was actually $100K in debt.  Those loans are an additional **forty thousand fucking dollars** that you stupidly kept me in the dark about.  I currently live without roommates because it fit into my plan.  I paid a lot for grad school because it fit into my plan.  My plan did not involve ""By the way, you have 1.5 times as much debt as you thought you did.""  If I had known, I would have done a PhD for two years and dropped out, or I would have found roommates in my current city.  But you withheld vital information from me, and I heavily resent you for it.

Oh, and you want me to pay your Parent Plus loans off because your finances have always been abysmal.  You make very little money because you don't want to do anything beyond retail management and your supplementary income comes from a pyramid scheme.  You genuinely believe that one day you'll ""make it big"" selling products for this pyramid scheme because you post on Facebook constantly about it and they occasionally fly you to a fancy scam retreat.  I've explained multiple times that this is going to collapse just like every other pyramid scheme, but you're insistent that you're making good money off of it even though the products themselves cost hundreds of dollars.  You've been tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt in the past and are only beginning to pay it off now.  You told me recently that our best chance at getting rid of those loans is an elderly relative dying and giving us a bunch of money.

You know what?  *Fuck you.*  How dare you push your financial illiteracy onto me.  How dare you keep me in the dark about how much money I owe and keep me from making financially-sound decisions just because you're a fucking idiot when it comes to money.  ""Everything will work itself out"" isn't a fucking financial strategy, and I feel like disowning you every time I hear it out of your stupid, fucking mouth.

Do you have any idea how selfish it is to respond to my accurate claims that I won't be able to save for retirement or go on vacation for another five years with ""Well how do you think I feel?  What do you think my life is like?""  **It's not fucking about** ***you.*** I don't want to be you.  I went to college and got a lucrative degree because I don't want your lifestyle, and I am not going to let myself be dragged into a situation where I'll be working the entire rest of my life.  I'm not going to be like you where I'm constantly worried about money, I'm financially irresponsible, and I'm actively scamming people to make a few extra dollars.

How would you feel if your husband bought a house, then revealed to you that he lied about the price and it was actually 1.5 times as much as you said it was?  That you'd be losing more of your monthly income on an expense you hadn't planned around?  You'd feel severely misled, resentful, and like you were in a hole you can't dig yourself out of.  You'd probably make him pay off the entire extra amount of the mortgage.

I should do the same thing.  I should refuse to pay and punish you for your financial stupidity by making you pay every cent of that additional $40K without a penny from me.  I should be completely unsympathetic, stop talking to you, and be completely fine with the idea of you being a fucking Walmart greeter in your 90s for financially fucking me over.  I should let the government garnish your wages and ruin your credit for making such a stupid, irresponsible financial decision and keeping me in the dark about it.  I'm very close to doing that.  After all, those loans don't have my name on them, so I am not legally responsible for paying any of them, and you have zero leverage whatsoever.  As far as I'm concerned, *I own you financially*.

But I won't fuck you over.  You're my mother and despite dragging me an additional $40K in debt, I know you had the best intentions.  I won't let myself be a shitty son.  Here's hoping that you and my stepdad come up with a plan to contribute to your Parent Plus loans, or that a rich elderly relative dies and we can stop worrying about this shit.  But I am incredibly resentful that you kept me in the dark about my debt, and I will continue to be resentful as long as I'm shoveling money at the loans you lied to me about."

4wofqt,11,2016-08-08,(M/23) prefers to be a lone wolf. How can I “want” to be around people again?,findingdirection123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wofqt/m23_prefers_to_be_a_lone_wolf_how_can_i_want_to/,"Hi all,


I wanted to put this out there to see if what I have been experiencing is normal or common.  Apologies for the longevity and if this belongs in another sub, please let me know.  For some background, I (M/23) attended a large 4-year university and had a pretty normal college life.  At the time I would have considered myself an extrovert and had good standing within a fraternity as well as organizations I was associated with, in addition to a small niche group of really good friends, and I loved most of my coworkers at the various internships I had.  I desired to be around them.


Since then, I enlisted in the Army and thus far have spent over a year in active duty.  While I have friends here and to some degree keep in touch with those back home, as well as a long distance girlfriend, I can't help but feel a general indifference to my social network which, to some extent includes family and the girlfriend (dating for 9 months now), through no fault of their own.  I'm not depressed and I maintain short and long-term goals, all pretty much career related.  I don't know if it's selfishness or narcissism or what, but I just about feel that if I never spoke to anyone I know again it wouldn't bother me.


My long term goals are paying off student loans, eventually retiring out of the military and acquiring a well paying job afterwards to sustain me until retirement.  As it stands, I won't be a parent as I've already had a vasectomy.  I don't really want to ever be married and sometimes I think maybe I'd enjoy being single as a way of life; it's simply easier to care about only myself and I don't have the emotional capability (or maturity?) to [want to] care for another being, in this case an SO.  These goals are about security and not particularly interesting.  I don't really have hobbies besides a couple of beers with some Netflix some nights. Once I gain enough rank and get a house instead of barracks, I intend on getting a cat or two to keep my company.  The only thing I truly miss these days is my kitty back home with my parents.


I'm good at people in the sense that I can go out and have a good time if my friends invite me but I won't go out of my way to meet new people and human interaction feels more like a chore than anything.  My job by nature is “team oriented” and I look forward to the day that I find a gig in a cubicle that requires minimal human interaction.  It gets annoying because they do their diligence to include me in non-work social things but all I desire after 12 hours of the same faces is retreating to my domain without conversation and decompressing or working out.  It literally angers me when the “inconvenience” of my girlfriend's call comes in because I've simply had enough of people by the day's end and I feel bad for her because I know she needs more as she's expressed to me.  She's concerned about the substantial decrease in the conversations we've held as of late and for those we do have, wonders why I'm not seemingly invested.  I've told her it's stress from work as it is pretty demanding but I can't tell her the whole truth.  


Additionally, I've also noticed that since I was 21, my sex drive plummeted.  It'll fluctuate up and down but currently, it's damn near non-existent.  I can look at women and appreciate that they're attractive but it does nothing for me.  My girlfriend sends me nudes occasionally and all I can think is “that's nice.”  One of my peers suggested that I have low t-levels.  I figure it's somehow related to everything else I've talked about.  Before this, I'd say I had a pretty healthy sex life.


I'm hoping this is just a phase.  I don't have any real purpose or drive other than make my day to day more comfortable.  As it stands, I already feel that life lacks intrinsic value since I doubt there's an afterlife and once we die, there is nothing.  This post isn't about religious quandary, however.  I just want to know if any of you have dealt with this and how do you find connection with life again?  I'm very motivated in my career and it's really the only thing that keeps me going.  But how do you learn to appreciate and enjoy people again instead of viewing them as capital?  Effectively, I maintain relationships because I need them for life's little hurdles when I need a favor and that's also why I keep my end of the bargain when they have issues.  Quid pro quo supercedes altruism always.


Again, sorry for the length.  Do any of you have input?

4wogg2,6,2016-08-08,[29][F][L][Online most of the time] Unemployment + relationship issues + loneliness,ladycorne,KindVoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/4wogg2/29flonline_most_of_the_time_unemployment/,"I feel terrible today and would love to know if it's okay for me to feel this way.

**Unemployment:** I've been a high achiever most of my life. I set academic records in school and college and recently graduated from an Ivy League school. I have financed all my education and have quite a lot of student loan debt. While I come from a financially unstable background, I couldn't give up the opportunity of getting this college degree as the university has such a good brand name and I got a decent scholarship. However it's been a few months since I graduated and I have not been able to land a job. Every job rejection makes me feel more and more dejected and helpless. I've had low self esteem issues in the past and this phase has resurfaced those feelings. What makes it worse is that I'm an introvert and I feel drained by networking events. I'm doing an unpaid internship right now because I need to have some work on this particular visa else I might have to go back to my home country.

**Relationship issues:** I met a guy online 3 years back and even though we were in two different continents, we became good friends. We met about a year back and had a great first date after which we decided to get engaged. I then moved to complete my university degree in his country but in a different city. We were about 2 hours apart by flight and he couldn't travel much because of his work, so I'd go there during my vacations. However there was a lot of friction between us as we were starting to realize that we are not completely compatible in real life. We have a lot of fun during good times but he doesn't know how to deal with me when I'm sad or stressed. In the last six months, we broke off the engagement (while still being in a relationship) and have had at least 6 major breakups. The only reason we're still together is because I beg him to stay. I've been stressed out because of my unemployment and couldn't bear going through a break up at the same time. He doesn't seem to understand how painful it is to be unemployed and rejected on a daily basis and it has been 2 months since he has traveled to meet me. The last time we fought he said that he was faking being nice to me and would break up the day I got a job. We fight nearly every day and I have to force him to say a kind word about me. I know my stress has been tough on him but is it wrong to expect a little bit of love in these situations? Even my family is starting to get a sense that he is not keeping me happy (and they live so far away). They recently told me they know of some friend's son who is my age and is single. But how do I talk to other men when I'm in this limbo relationship? I keep crying thinking of why this is happening to me...

**Loneliness:** I had to move to my brother's place after I graduated as I couldn't afford paying the rent on my place. My brother is younger than me and has just started off his career; we are currently living in a tiny studio apartment in the city. He works most of the time and spends the rest of the time with his friends (he is an extrovert). I spend most of my day hanging out on the couch or exercising in the gym (close to 2 hours at times). I don't like meeting my friends or ex-classmates as I'm tired of talking about my job situation and I have no money to spend on eating or drinking outside. Once in a while I go alone to a nearby coffee shop to work and spend $4 on a coffee. It feels so so lonely and even though sometimes I wish I could break up with my boyfriend, such loneliness makes me message him.

Is it okay to feel terribly dejected with the way things are turning out? Or am I making a big deal out of anything and should just ""get over it""? My family has been through worse circumstances (poverty, hunger, long term unemployment etc) and I can't share these feelings with anyone. Thank you for listening to me :("

He's never seen my code or anything, but I'm attending the same school he attended. My parents are really pushing for me to send him my resume, but I've been somewhat reluctant, mainly because I don't feel like I'm that hot at coding compared to my peers. Moreover, I'm worried that if I happen to get an interview and do badly, it'll reflect poorly on my referrer's part. I've had some previous internships as part of my school's co-op program, but most of the interviews I've had so far have been pretty basic...

Is it a legitimate concern that I might make my referrer look bad? For what it's worth, the subsidary itself doesn't seem to hire that many interns, but the parent company does."

Subject: Fall Internship"
4wq94n,3,2016-08-08,23 Y/o just graduated with 5k cash and 5.5k student loans. Moving to city with high(er) cost of living to attend graduate school in Fall 2017. How do I plan?,EriqLaplus,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4wq94n/23_yo_just_graduated_with_5k_cash_and_55k_student/,"/r/personalfinance, your wisdom is appreciated.

I'm a 23 year old male who just graduated from a state college with a degree in Applied Mathematics. I've made myself marketable by making my concentrations be statistics and computer science. Because of that, I've two software development internships to slap onto my resume. I will be finished with my second internship by the end of September. 

My bank account currently shows a little below $5,000, and I have $5,500 worth of student loans with the first payment coming due in December. The monthly payment will be $57 per month over 10 years. By the end of my internship, I estimate my bank account to be at least $7,500, but most likely over $8,000. I am currently commuting from home using a shared car that has excellent gas mileage. I do not pay food or rent. My only real expenses are Amazon Prime (which I could cancel, but haven't done so yet), and Spotify. 

I have been admitted to a master's program at graduate school (for Fall 2017) in the northwestern part of the country (US) with a much higher cost of living than where I currently reside. I do not own a car, and I would prefer not to own one if possible as the town I will be residing in has excellent public transit for 75% of the places I would need to go. I own a commuter bike for the remaining 25%. I don't have much in the way of possessions right now, but I plan on ordering the essentials once I arrive in my new town. I have been fully funded from my future institution, and I can expect a salary of approximately $18,000 per year from my institution once I arrive. 

My weakest link in my planning is what I intend to do in the mean time AFTER my internship has ended. I assumed I would find a small job around town paying something like minimum wage, but I don't know if this is a good idea. I have considered moving to the new city early, and simply working in town (Job prospects are tougher here though). I think I would enjoy this, but I don't know if I should subject myself to the financial burden when I feel as if I could better myself by staying close to home and build reserves. One of my main concerns with getting a full time job during the break is that I /know/ I will be leaving in X months to attend graduate school, and I don't want to be unprofessional.

Along the line of thought about moving to the new town early, I have applied to a couple of jobs there. However, they are not significant positions. Therefore, I don't expect them to attempt to hire too far outside of their radius (the distance between where I am and where they are will probably be the factor that prevents even an interview).  I could be surprised however, which is why I applied. I don't expect these jobs to net anywhere over $20/hr though, if I were to be offered one. 

While preparing this post, I read over ""How to handle $"" in the sidebar. I think the most relevant part for me is the emergency fund, as I do not yet have one defined. I think this relates back to my question of whether I should pay off my loans immediately or not. I really don't know when/where/how to divide up my cash.

My questions, in order of specific to less specific, are these:

1. Should I pay off my student loans with the money earned from my internship and simply try to recoup cost in the mean time? If not, what is your recommended course of action?
2. Are my concerns about being unprofessional by leaving a full time job &gt; 1 year founded or unfounded? Should I simply work whatever I can find or should I be selective and choose something more fitting of my skill set?
3. Is there any merit or financial benefit to moving to the new town early besides person gratification? 
4. Is there a way to manage one's finances in graduate school in order to make it a positive thing overall instead of the living financial hell people make it out to be? 

Overall, what are your suggestions for planning for my future? 

Bonus Question: I'm a very curious, academic person. However, I also don't see myself working in academia. A PhD has always been the dream, but I've read some negative reviews on it affecting long term financial outcome over time. My goal would be to end up working as a Data Scientist (as my PhD would be, and my master's program is in, a quantitative field). Is a PhD really that bad financially?"

4wqn6p,4,2016-08-08,I [22 M] have an odd/sad relationship with my parents [~50?? M+F] from some issues that went unresolved in my childhood.,thndrfngrs,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wqn6p/i_22_m_have_an_oddsad_relationship_with_my/,"When I was a child, I had some issues with my parents. I suspect my mother has bipolar disorder and there were constant fights. I was sometimes lazy and they didn't like to give reasons for things or be wrong.

I was going through some other issues at the time too with friends and finding myself and whatnot and generally wasn't very happy, but at school I was always able to joke and have a good time with friends. Somewhere along the line I started to have two distinct ""moods"" (I hesitate to use the word ""personalities"" here because I don't have a disorder and it's not like someone else takes over, I just behave differently), one with my friends and bosses and outside people, and one with my family. I was a normal, awkward but well adjusted for the most part teenager with other people, but quiet, despondent, sad and reserved with my family. 

Once I moved to college and out of my small town, I blossomed. I had new world views, actual friends that were good to me, a social life, a love life, hobbies and I pursued things that I was interested in. I feel great (aside from needing to find a job after my internship ends this summer) and consider myself to be a healthy and good person. The problem is every time I'm with my family, I revert to that same quiet and apathetic person. 

The time away from home really helped my relationship with my family because I only see them for short periods of time (once or twice every couple months) and there's not a chance for things to get bad. My parents love me, I know that, but they don't know me. I feel sad because sometimes they'll bring up something I used to like almost a decade ago, or mention something like that from years ago and I've changed a lot and those things no longer interest me or I stopped doing them, etc etc. Flipping a switch and being my ""real"" self around them just doesn't seem right and I get weird feelings when I try to not be that apathetic person around my family. I don't know how to fix this and I need some help. I'm not very good with keeping things concise and getting everything written down, so there is most likely more information, or things that need clarifying, and I'm happy to do that, just ask!

---   
**tl;dr**: Developed as a person when I moved to college, but still apathetic and quiet around my family years later. That persona and my ""real"" self don't match up anymore and I don't know how to bring my parents back into my life."

I can talk and flirt with whatever girls I want tbh. 

I sound like I have the potential be a douchebag right?

But I'm still dealing with addiction and anxiety related issues bc of it, and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone. Ive built up so many walls to my castle I've just trapped myself. I'm so confused on how I can achieve so much yet unable to break this. 

I've always struggled with anxiety growing up which led me to develop hyperhydrosis (basically sweating a fuck ton- hands and right armpit mostly). So I hid from interactions with girls bc I was embarrassed and turned to porn I think to give myself some validation in a controlled setting where no girl would be grossed out by sweaty hands. I hated the position I was in bc I love ppl and love to party and make friends...but I knew I wasn't comfortable enough to let myself get close and intimate with anyone. I've grown up and forced myself to put myself out there while also being terrified the entire time. If I didn't know the struggle, I would've been in a position to use girls left and right. 

When I started college I was PMO once a day I'd say..since then I've lost a gf due to PIED complications, and another two girls wanted to be FWB so needless to say that fell through when I wanted a gf and they wanted to fool around. The last year or so I've seriously tried and I'd say I've gotten down to MO maybe 4 or 5 times a month, including a streak of 54 days when I was falling so hard for this one girl, bc she left me bc she couldnt do distance/the military. Haven't had succeasful sex in that time. While with those girls, I found myself doing whatever I could to make the girl happy bc I knew deep down I wouldn't be rocking her world in bed...but then I found real happiness in doing small little things to make her day and simply being a really nice, understanding, funny guy. 

I'm going to keep trying to quit bc I'm stubborn as shit and will force myself to keep going till I succeed. With all this being said, I think it's important for all of us to remember that if you never knew this struggle of addiction and feeling alone, etc etc...maybe you'd be breaking hearts and messing up other girls and only viewing them as a means to an end for sex. Maybe you'd be a tool like I probably would've been.

The addiction and problems caused by it over the last few years caused me to view the world differently...it taught me to not judge anyone bc everyone's fighting their own battles and to always put some positivity back in the world when I can. I know when I finally succeed, I'll treat my wife like a queen and truly cherish all the amazing things that girls can offer besides just sex. And thats pretty dope. Pressure and stress makes diamonds, so use these addiction struggles as fuel to grow as a person and make this world a better place."
4wqpa5,17,2016-08-08,Linguistic Experiments with iPads?,Buecherlaub,linguistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/4wqpa5/linguistic_experiments_with_ipads/,"Hi!

Currently I'm doing an internship at an linguistic institute and they assigned me to a project about language acquisition, which is great!

The thing is, the team is thinking about a new method/experiment using an iPad, instead of more ""classic"" experiments using eye tracking or in-person experiments. 
I've already read some articles and papers about using iPads to collect data, but, and here's my problem, the team wants to create their own test. 

This means that we have to or develop an iPad App for our experiment (which is more or less impossible, given that my team's and my coding abilities are quite limited) or we have to use an existing App and maybe modify it a little bit. 

As I was searching the Internet for information I came across http://www.paradigmexperiments.com/index.html which seems perfect, the only thing is, that it is quite expensive and I still have to speak with the head of the team about the budget of the project.

My question now is if someone of you guys know any App we could use, or if anyone knows something like paradigm but a little less expensive?

Or if anyone has experience in using iPads as a experimental tool?

I would be happy about any information or help you could provide.

Thanks alot!"
4wqy8h,10,2016-08-08,I'm [21F HL] kind of at a loss. SO [21M LL?] only seems to want me when he can't have me.,veganleather,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/4wqy8h/im_21f_hl_kind_of_at_a_loss_so_21m_ll_only_seems/,"Made this account purely for this post. I'm sorry this is so long, and I appreciate anyone taking the time to read it.

So, early last year I met my SO through some friends. We ended up hanging out a lot, as we were part of the same friend group. Eventually, we became ""friends with benefits"", and were sleeping together regularly. He couldn't keep his hands off me. By August we'd been having pretty regular sex for a couple of months, but we'd also developed feelings for each other. Great, I thought. So we decided to make a go of it as a couple.

A couple months in, I noticed we weren't having sex as frequently (from several times a week to once a fortnight, if I was lucky). I also noticed he'd stopped complimenting me, and wouldn't kiss me for longer than a peck unless we were having sex. This took a toll on my self-confidence, and whenever I brought it up, he got defensive and nothing really fixed. I tried sexting, I tried buying us toys to use, I tried buying nice lingerie, I tried sending nudes. He wasn't into any of it, though we used the toys a few times.

Come January, after his exams in uni, I'd booked for us to go away for a weekend to a hotel in another town. I took some nice lingerie I'd bought, as a surprise. We had sex every night that weekend. It was great, I was so hopeful. But, when we got back he was distant. He wouldn't come near me. Eventually, two weeks later, he broke up with me. I found out he'd sent a text to his ex saying that he regretted deleting her nudes, and wished he still had them. I couldn't believe him. I'd tried to send him nudes so many times, and he'd never been interested.

So, I cut him off. But as soon as I did, he said he'd made a mistake and wanted me back. We were still in the same friend group, so ended up hanging out frequently. And when we did, he was always very touchy-feely and flirty. Against my better judgement, we ended up having sex again. A lot. Again, it was like he couldn't get enough of me. But I realised I still had feelings for him, and the situation was confusing, so I cut him off one final time. I'd been going on dates with other people, trying to move on, while he hadn't.

It was the end of April when I cut it off again. He went on one date with a girl at the start of May, and apparently that made him realise he only wanted me. So he came to me, we talked, agreed to try again. 

To begin with, sex was relatively frequent. Once a week. I have a high sex drive, and wanted a lot more than that, but I was fine settling. Eventually it went back to once every two weeks, sometimes longer. And I noticed the intimacy disappeared again. He wouldn't compliment me, or kiss me, or touch me. He complimented and kissed his dog more than he would me. I got resentful.

He started an internship six weeks ago, and things only got worse. We weren't seeing each other as much, and I still wasn't getting any intimacy from him. I was crying almost every night we spent together. A month ago, I broke down and wrote him a letter about how lonely and unwanted I felt, how sex was important to me, how I no longer felt attractive, and I gave it to him to read. He held me, and promised things would get better. And that week we had sex three times. And he hasn't come near me since. 

I spoke to him a few nights ago, basically bringing it all back up, asking him to go see a doctor, to see if there's anything wrong medically (testosterone levels, stress etc). He said he'd phone the doctor this morning, but he didn't. He says he'll phone tomorrow morning. I told him that if he couldn't work on this with me, it would be over.

I love him. He says he loves me. But I have to ask him regularly if he's attracted to me. He says yes, and I don't believe him. Other than this issue, we're happy together. But it's at the point where I don't want to hang out with him, because knowing that I want him so bad and he has no interest in me is just killing me. We have a holiday booked at the end of the year with friends, and I've said if things haven't improved by then, we'll probably have to split. I'm so desperate for attention and compliments that I'm considering posting photos on places like gonewild, just to have someone tell me that they're attracted to me. 

What else can I do? Thank you, to anyone who read this. I think I just needed to vent.

4wqyto,345,2016-08-08,The Anglerfish,lurefish,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4wqyto/the_anglerfish/,"I am beautiful in ways men shouldn't be.

Pretty boy, lovely boy, with his flaxen curls framing a sweet face and big blue eyes with big black lashes. My mother, when she was in our run-down trailer and not at the bar, would say such looks were wasted on a boy and that she wished I was born a girl. I'm certain she wished I had never been born at all.

School was hellish from the start. Girls viewed me as a living doll to play dress-up with, and boys hated me because I made them confused. My third grade teacher once made a comment about my cherry red mouth, the gym coach complimented my porcelain skin. The computer teacher got fired after cornering me alone. I did not understand it – I wore run down charity store clothes, spent most of my time with my nose buried in a book, and barely brushed my hair. And yet, here was the whole school bearing down on me.

Puberty made it worse. All my classmates grew and stretched, flushed with hormones and lust. I grew some, yet no straggly hairs or bright red pimples popped on my china doll face. Instead, the star quarterback would torment me so he could grope at my long legs and graceful hips. My teachers would compliment my academic achievements and then mention that someone like me being so aloof was a shame. The theater teacher asked if I was ""interested in boys"" in hushed, hopeful whispers.

I was not gay or straight. I was Uninterested. Why would I waste time chasing after shallow and petty girls who were jealous of my appearance? Why would I let one of those testosterone-hopped jocks paw at my body and call me a faggot afterwards? Why would I want my fat, balding English teacher to bend me over for an easy A? They called me frigid, uptight, bitchy, rude, prudish. I wore it with pride all the way to the top of my class.

I left my little Midwest town for a college in the big city. I thought it would be easier there, full of beautiful people to blend into. Towards the end of November, my roommate tried to roofie my water bottle, and the double room became a single room very quickly. For sophomore year, I got a studio apartment on my own.

That fall quarter was beautiful, the trees like brilliant fire throughout campus, and I took a communications class required for my major. It was about giving presentations and speeches, and the school website said Professor O'Malley was to teach it – classmates had described him as a jolly old man, a little longwinded but excellent at teaching discourse and rhetoric.

I sat towards the front, my empty notebook neatly dated, and my classmates chattered all around me. I paid them no heed, eyes casted downwards, but I looked up when the door to the lecture hall opened right before class was to begin. The man who strode in was not Professor O'Malley.

He burnt white hot, reality dimming around his gravity. Everyone seemed so tarnished compared to him, dark-haired bronze-skinned Adonis among the gray and listless dead. Square-jawed and towering, his presence was so thick it was sweltering, smothering, suffocating. My classmates all gasped as his eyes swept across the class.

Adonis-among-the-dead stood at the front of the lecture hall and said, ""Professor O'Malley had an unfortunate family emergency. I'm Professor Alexander Venus, and I'm taking over the class for the foreseeable future. Apologies to everyone who was hoping for good old John, he'll be back next quarter.""

He spoke like rainwater, Adonis-among-the-dead, and no one seemed too broken up about Professor O'Malley being replaced by Professor Venus. His emerald gaze trawled through the suddenly eager students, before finally landing on me, sitting in the corner of the third row. It lingered there on my face, and Venus grinned with perfect teeth. For the first time in my life, my face grew hot.

Professor Venus looked away, then, and the TAs handed out the syllabus as he crooned out the class expectations like love poetry. Despite the crimson flush on my face, I wanted to ace this class like I aced all the others before, a deep-rooted desire to prove myself as more than just pretty flesh and skin. I would not be bested by an unexpected crush.

The first two weeks of class were shockingly normal, just Professor Venus talking about the basics of speaking. He wore designer, tailored clothing and Italian leather shoes, his car a flashy red BMW all the girls wanted inside of. There was no doubt he was a natural at this, his charisma a thing unto itself, and my dreams were plagued with green and bronze and hands and lips.

Two weeks of lecture, and we received our first assignment: an informative speech.

""Make it something you're passionate about,"" Professor Venus had purred. ""Something that really makes your blood pump.""

Based on those standards, most of the people in the class would've spoken about Professor Venus himself. A girl had found his Tinder profile and a boy his Grindr account, leading to frantic little pow-wows about what made Venus tick before class started. He didn't respond to either of their half-nude and borderline pornographic messages.

I wrote mine about the Amur leopard, *Panthera pardus orientalis.* There are only around sixty or seventy left in the wilds of southeastern Russian and northeastern China, due to poaching and deforestation. I gave what I thought was an impassioned speech about the dying species, and my peer reviews agreed with that thought. One girl cried over the leopards, but she was a bit sensitive.

Professor Venus just watched from the front, eyes never leaving me even as he took notes with a black fountain pen. While the peer reviews were given back immediately, the professor wouldn't give grades until all the speeches were concluded. I gave mine on the first day, and ended up being the last person in that lecture hall, besides Professor Venus himself.

I was placing my notebook in my bag when Venus stepped up behind me and said, ""Dante.""

I turned, blinking, and Venus was staring at me with calculation. I had professors and teachers and TAs hot to fuck me before, undressing me with their eyes as they imagined me bent over their desk, but Venus's gaze held none of that. It was simply...assessing.

""You could rule the world if you spoke with a bit more passion, Dante,"" he continued. He pronounced my name like a Florentine.

""What do you mean, Professor?"" I asked. The thought of failure, of not being the best at something, gnawed at me like a hungry dog.

""Exuberance, joy, fascination, anger,"" Venus said with a laugh. ""If you fluttered your eyelashes right, people would rip themselves apart for you.""

I thought about his words all weekend, lingered on them as I stared at the shoes at the local department store. I needed nicer dress shoes for an internship interview, but even the discount rack made my bank account cry out. I pondered what luxuries I could give up – heating, warm water, coffee – when the man spoke beside me.

""Trouble picking out shoes?"" he asked me. He wore a tailored blazer and had gray in his hair, wealth oozing from his pores. I thought about Professor Venus's words, and did not brush off the man out-of-hand like I would've before.

""No, it's just..."" I said, looking at him between my lashes. The man touched the small of my back. ""I have an interview for an internship and need new shoes, but...""

""College is so expensive these days,"" he said. I left that store with practically a new wardrobe, and all I had to do was let the man grunt above me as I laid sprawled on a California king mattress in his mansion. I left before dawn. When I came to class dressed in my new clothes, Professor Venus grinned at me.

I didn't think of it as a con or even prostitution, though people probably feel differently. Women seemed less inclined towards me, so instead I found men, wealthier the better, and let them give me things. In exchange, they'd beg for more of my attention. I didn't really care one way or another about the sex, but the *power* I held over these CEOs and lawyers and stockbrokers was indescribable. They would do anything for me, and I could get anything I wanted with a pout.

It was coming towards the end of the quarter and the long stretch of winter break when Professor Venus approached me again.

""I see that you took my advice to heart,"" Venus said. I knew he wasn't talking about speeches.

""Yes,"" I replied, and Venus smiled, fingers trailing across my shoulder.

""There's a bar I want to take you to,"" he said.

The fallout had we been caught doing this would've been immense; he was still my professor, I was underage. Yet there was no thought of consequences as Venus – *Alexander,* he crooned at me – escorted me into the high class bar on the expensive side of the city without a single person even mentioning my ID. Rules felt like things that happened to other people.

""You're a natural already,"" Alexander had whispered in my ear. ""It's all the pity your father didn't teach you to hunt when you were younger.""

""What do you mean?"" I asked. I had not met my father. When I asked my mother about him, she spat on the ground.

""I'll show you,"" Alexander promised, and inclined his head towards a businessman watching us intently from a corner booth. Nice suit, nice watch, and lust in his eyes – exactly the kind I preferred, and it seemed Alexander did to.

Men are easily manipulated by their egos, and suddenly having two beautiful people make a beeline to you is quite the ego stroke indeed. It was easy to have him bring a car around to drive us to his lonely little penthouse, his wandering hands barely knowing who to touch.

It was Alexander who led us into the bedroom, peeled off the man's suit and pushed him on to the bed before stripping us both naked. He spooned up behind the man, arms around his chest and chin on his shoulder, and he said to me, ""Watch, Dante.""

Then his teeth sunk into the man's jugular.

I always thought that, if faced with a murder, I'd be disgusted and frightened like any human being would, even with my jacked-up sense of empathy. Yet as the blood splattered across me and dripped down Alexander's perfect teeth, I felt strangely...exhilarated. Alive. The blood was warm as it trickled down my pale skin, and my hands reached up to smear it across my white skin.

Alexander pulled out the man's throat with all the grace of a big cat, letting the body flop back down on to the bed. He looked triumphant, my Adonis-among-the-dead, and he pulled me into his arms as the man bled out on to his silk sheets.

""See, lovely?"" he purred into my ear. ""This is what you're meant to do.""

We cleared out the apartment of valuables before we left, laughing and singing as the man's body cooled in the bedroom. That was the first of Alexander's many lessons.

Some of our kind specialize in a single gender, like I do, while others like Alexander can turn the head of anyone they want. None of us stick around longer than a handful of nights – extended exposure can lead to madness, and stalkers are a pain to dispose of. We get what we want and then leave with a kiss. How we propagate ourselves is simple.

Brood parasitism is a strategy where an animal, such as a cuckoo, tricks another into raising their offspring. It's easy to slip inside a stable little nest with a few kind words to an overworked and ignored wife, and leave all the hard work to her husband until the son starts coming into his abilities. Then we come back and take him to where he belongs.

I guess something went wrong with me, and that's why my father never came back for me. My mother must've hated me for being a constant reminder of her failed marriage. I wasn't taught to hunt in my adolescence, not allowed to bloom like Alexander did under his father's tutelage.

Alexander isn't going to let that happen to our son. He's five years old now, with dark curls and big green eyes, and I have his room painted and ready. He's currently with his mother and her husband out in some suburb, and whenever we drive by, we hear yelling. A teacher had recently been fired from his brand new elementary school. Clearly, she can't protect him.

We're coming for him tomorrow night. Our family is going to be complete."

4wraan,1,2016-08-08,Upgrading from failure to success in asking phone numbers - a novice field report,Chopin__,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/4wraan/upgrading_from_failure_to_success_in_asking_phone/,"Hi guys,

Honing my skills on dating apps, I can now quite easily take phone numbers within these apps.

My real struggle is live game. This weekend I went out of my comfort zone and these were my 3 experiences asking phone numbers. I would love to hear **your feedbacks and suggestions**. Note that the end of the post is the most relevant part.

1) I bought my Japan Rail pass in an agency in Paris, and the girl who opened the door and welcomed me was really pretty (8-9). Very French, elegant, hidden smile, soft voice, but very young: 22... Her colleagues were behind a wall and we were in the 6m² entrance, ""isolated"". She was a bit shy as well, I could tell from her voice and body language. I asked questions about the rail pass and she replied, nothing interesting. While paying I started asking personal questions: are you intern here? - Yes, I started in July - Why here? Studying japanese as a bachelor student... Not a lot of connection though. I took my pass, said bye and left. 3 days later, as the agency is close to where I work, I said to myself I would go back only to ask for her number. I rang, she opened (fortunately!), said hi, but could not show my real intentions, was too scared :/ I faked questions about the trains in Japan. Finally I could make some jokes, create a connection, and after 10 minutes said I was pretty busy and asked her number ""in case I have trouble"" with my trains. She gave it on the train map, I asked her name, she flushed and said 'Lucie'. I could leave happy.

2) Saturday, in a museum with a friend, we took a break on the walkway outside with the view of Paris. I saw a girl smoking, asked her a cigarette, said she had none, she was just having a break because she was working upstairs as a waitress of the posh restaurant on the roof. We started talking, she was the litterary kind and was fond of Sartre, which I used to devour. She said she had to go back, and said the view was incredible up there, which I took for an invitation. Asked her to come to see it, went upstairs, invited me to watch the view but discretely, since clients pay a lot to be there, there's no one here just for the view. Then I went back to the reception desk where she and her colleagues were. She said the view was beautiful, like the staff, which I took for an invitation to NEG. I said 'yeah their ego is also way above average' - they laughed. Asked when she generally finished - late, around 12pm - Ok, I have to go but if I'm in the neighborhood would be great to hang out, do you have a number? - Ok, took my phone and entered it. I waived goodbye and left.

3) Saturday night, in an open air club - Nüba for those who want a great place to sarge - opened a 3-set, two girls one guy, around 23 y-o. I asked for a cigarette and I would pay with a joke. The guy said he had only two left (showed me his cigarette pack), but a girl said 'You can have a puff', giving me her cigarette. I said okay, you'll only have half a joke then. I went on with a very bad joke, which apparently makes people laugh (tested it a couple of times). The guy hugged the girls saying 'don't look at that man', then we laughed, and they started saying bad jokes, racist, jewish jokes, but it was fun. The pretty girl (8) said a very bad joke, with 3 sentences (our maximum was 2), and we laughed at her, which was good to show disinterest. Then I asked how they knew each other, the guy and the girl in the middle were together, and the other girl (the pretty one) was the friend of the girl. I used the parisian neg saying asking where they lived - Vincennes - oh that's why you look posh. The girl said to her boyfriend ""did you hear what he said?"" but then we agreed with her boyfriend and he took me as a friend. They left then, and I targeted the single girl, saying ""it would be nice to hang out if you come back in this bar..."" but even if she was looking at me she was leaving with her friends so I said bye. 1 hour later, I went in the front of the dancefloor, near the dj, taking a snapchat, enjoying my life, and saw the guy. Said hi, and saw the 2 girls behind. She saw me and raise her hand for a soft high five, which I took for an IOI and tried to squeeze her hand quickly when doing it, but it lasted one second maximum. Then my friend was leaving and I said to him, go, I ask her number and I'm out. I went in front of the guy to make my way around and finally be next to the girl. I said I'm done, I'm going, she said why, I said can I take your number if we do another Nüba together, she took my phone and wrote her number. I remember the face of the guys behind her looking at me like ""how's he doing it"". Made my night 


The story is not finished, what went on with the numbers:
1) WhatsApp:
"" 
Me: Hello Lucie - *Chopin* who bought the JR pass - I have to be honest, I took your number because I liked your style. But I was a bit disappointed you didn't know the schedule of the shinkansen in Hokkaido 

Her: Hi *Chopin*  I had understood

Me: You understand quickly
Me: You're doing your 3-year internship at JTB?

Her: 4th year?
Her: *!

Me: Tough
Me: I thought in 4th year one would do something else than welcoming clients

Her: I'm doing other things  I'm doing [useless stuff] There are one or two clients a day.

Me: That's why you remember me

Her: Not only... You're a very nice guy. We have certainly many things in common. But to avoid misunderstandings. I have a boyfriend. And maybe I shouldn't have given you my number...

Me: Ah
Me: I'm sorry
Me: You'll have to dump your boyfriend then

Her: Haha..
Her: No I'm sorry
Her: I'm very flattered. I had a moment of madness and I regret now

Me: ""Madness"" ?
Me: At your age you shouldn't have a too rigid moral

Her: Yes I have
Her: So I wish you to be brave with the shinkansen and a nice trip to Japan (lucky guy)

Me: Thanks  Take care

2) and 3) added the numbers on WhatsApp and both pictures are males! First time I am given fake numbers. Of course because I never asked before."

 I lost my man by being a complete idiot and thinking I was too young and inexperienced to settle. He wrote me this when he left. 

"" I hope you become the person you are trying to be, I admire you and all your accomplishments and am excited to see you grow as a person. You have always inspired me to become a better person and I'll never forget all the things I've learned from you. I sincerely hope we will remain good friends""

We have exchanged various other messages but that one sums up how he has always viewed me. We broke up in April and have hung out all summer. He started dating someone else in June and I really wasn't worried about it (assuming it was a rebound). I was calm and collected all summer ""knowing"" he still loved me. 

All summer he would make jokes about how I broke his heart and would introduce me as his ex to all his new friends in a joking manner. We would share stories about when we were together like it was all in the past. He would be as attentive to me as he always was and I felt he was still in love with me. He never stopped complimenting me. 

I have not even begun to let him go. I haven't dated anyone else and was trying to sort out who I was before I committed my life to him. The plan was to move to England for 6 months (I have an internship there) and then move back home and ""win"" him back. I thought the move would help me solidify who I was and be a better girlfriend when I came home. I thought he couldn't possibly love another in such a short time. 

Yesterday is when it all went to shit. His girlfriend left on vacation and we hung out, as the day wore on I slowly realized how much he cared for his new gf and the heartbreak hit me like a ton of bricks. 
I started making mean jokes about her and belittling their relationship in a ""sarcastic"" manner.  By the end of the day I broke down in tears and told him I had been working on getting us back together and that I was crushed. He told me he didn't realize that was what I wanted as I had acted so calm throughout the breakup. He ended the conversation telling me he wanted to be there for me but he would not speak with me if I didn't stop being so mean. 

I posted an uplifting post on Facebook about constantly bettering oneself and he liked it...Which made me feel like he was pitying me. 

So here I am. A blubbering crying idiot begging for her man back. Belittling other women. Posting dramatic shit on social media and allowing myself to become half the woman I used to be. 

I want your advice how to come back from this. I don't want my feminist friends telling me to sleep around and eat ice cream. 
I am willing to accept he is gone. But I would love some advice on the most likely way to get a guy back....even if it is 100% futile. 

Please be harsh and honest. I'm so ready for a change!"

4wrlwm,10,2016-08-08,OSAP and Saving for University,amorebravekitten,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/4wrlwm/osap_and_saving_for_university/,"Hello, PFC!  

I am so, so sorry for the wall of text.

A little background, I am 26 years old and a self-taught web developer.  I've been working professionally with HTML/CSS/JS for a year next month, and I spent about a year prior to starting this job teaching myself using online resources.  

That being said, there is nothing in the world that I want more than to go back to school for a Computer Science degree.  

I attended college for two years in a program that didn't end up being the right choice for me, and I wasn't able to finish it anyway due to finances.  I left that school in May 2014 with ~$25k in debt, half owed to OSAP and half owed to a bank loan.  

I am $3k away from paying off the remaining OSAP loan in full (bank was paid 6 months ago), which I expect to take another 4 months at my current payment pace.  Maybe 2 months if I pause emergency fund contributions until the debt is gone.  I have no other debts.

I am also contributing to a secondary emergency fund (I have 3 months' worth of expenses on hand, would prefer to have 6 for safety) and making small ($25/week each) contributions to both a TFSA and RRSP investments with Tangerine.  I consider the TFSA also a retirement account.

Now, my first question is this:  I understand that I have the potential to withdraw from an RRSP to pay for my education as long as it is re-contributed within some time frame.  If I apply for OSAP in order to return to school, will I be *expected* to do so?  Would I be expected to empty out both the TFSA and the RRSP before I get any sort of financial aid?  I would prefer to continue making contributions to this investment until I go to school and let it simply sit until I am working again and can continue investing.  I have no idea if this is a feasible option and haven't been able to find an answer elsewhere.

Secondly, I don't just need assistance for tuition costs.  I live with my SO and I have bills to pay.  SO doesn't make enough to cover my half of things, and I could never ask it of him even if he does increase his income to that amount by the time I am returning to school.  I have been running numbers endlessly and I am feeling very lost.  

For example, if I spend the next 4 years saving up ~$50k (this is doable with my current income and expenses, hopefully I expect a modest raise once in a while) this amount could cover approximately 2-2.5 years of expenses (I currently require $1500/month for expenses and expect that amount to rise to as much as $2k/month during school to adjust for rent increases and higher transit costs -- I currently travel to work for free).  Would OSAP look at that pile of money and just say *hey look at all that money, you don't need any from us* if it happens to cover tuition fully for all 4 years (which that amount very likely would, and then some).  Will OSAP attempt to cover living expenses as well?  I did not receive enough to finish my last program, and I am petrified that this will happen again.  In that instance it was for the best, but I really don't know how much I can rely on the program.  I grew up in a very financially unstable household and money gives me a great deal of anxiety.  I currently make double what I actually *need* to get by for expenses and I still don't feel safe.

I fully intend to do a co-op program and earn some income during the work terms, as well as informal internships during the remaining summers if I can land temporary jobs.  My current employer may even let me continue during summers, or part-time during the semester.  

As an aside, I am not *naturally* skilled with math, and I do expect to struggle a little with the course load.  Ideally, I would prefer to get by without working during the semester but I fully understand that would be a luxury.



**tl;dr**:  Please help me understand OSAP:

* ~~If I have an RRSP and a TFSA as Tangerine investment portfolios, will I be expected to empty those out towards my education before receiving OSAP aid? (total value between something like $5k-15k depending on if I change current contribution habits and how long I take to save)~~ Answered, thank you!

* If I do save up some cash ($30k? $60k?) intended for use for personal expenses throughout a 4-5 year program, does that mean I won't get any aid for the first year or two and they'll expect me to burn through it all before providing loans? 

* It's my instinct to spend the next 3-5 years saving aggressively (5 years would mean ~$60k in a high interest savings account at my current income) to avoid *some* debt and help make myself feel more financially secure.  Is this a terrible idea?  I won't be able to save every penny I would need for expenses &amp; tuition, but I could save as much as half.  Should I bother at all, or just expect to take most everything I need as a loan and rely more on internship income?  

* ~~Does anybody know how mature/returning students will be affected by the new Ontario Student Grant stuff?  Every resource I've found regarding OSAP in general or OSG was written for high school students and only referred to parental income as a factor.  I live independently so the only factor is my and my SO's income.~~ Answered, thank you!"
4wrmn9,1,2016-08-08,I can't get over the fact that the guy I love is moving on,MediumBird,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4wrmn9/i_cant_get_over_the_fact_that_the_guy_i_love_is/,"For the sake of clarity, I'm also a guy.

I met a guy who we'll call T a little over two years ago. In the same year that I met him, we got to be really close to the point where people assumed we were actually in a relationship. We had talked about it before, and I told him I never really fell in love with someone before. What I didn't tell him is that I felt a connection with him. I held back because I didn't know for sure what I was feeling.

I also knew that T has a bad history with his parents. He told me a lot about himself even before we started dating and told me some pretty personal stories, including that he failed suicide once before. Well one day on his walk back home from work he calls me and is crying, saying he was contemplating jumping into the traffic. Well that was pretty much the catalyst for me to admit my feelings for him and confess my love, and once I was happy that he was home and safe T and I were officially together a year after we had met.

Excluding the last month of our ~6 month relationship, we were the happiest couple. We did everything together. We were even making plans to get an apartment together so I could move off campus and he could be close to his job. He was my emotional support, too, and I gave him everything--I know he didn't mind it because he was the one that encouraged me to vent to him. He loved psychology even though he didn't want to major in it.

Well, that last month he began to become more and more distant. He wouldn't talk to me much, giving single word responses sometimes. I tried to find more activities for us to do, hoping that it would pull us together. He didn't seem to be meeting me halfway, and I really just wanted to talk with him about it. Of course, just a few weeks later, he tells me that he ""doesn't enjoy spending time with me like he used to"", and after an hour of me trying to make it work, I gave up. We agreed that we'd have to wait a little longer to try again, perhaps when college wasn't so stressful for me and he was able to move out of his house. T also said he was on good talking terms with his exes, and that our relationship wouldn't have an effect on our friendship. (I realize that's a typical thing to say and that usually ends up not being the case, but for whatever reason I believed it).

Well, I never really did recover from the break up with T. For a while I felt alright because I did well in school that semester, and was able to get a paid internship for the summer. But when it came to hanging out with him, he seemed distant again. That grew to where T and our mutual friends would hang out together and not tell me, or even think to invite me. When I approached him about it, he said he didn't think I'd be interested in what they were doing (MtG). Well then they started doing things that I enjoyed doing, like getting together and playing videogames, and they didn't tell me. When I started asking if I could hang out with them the next time they grouped up together to play, they went back to doing the stuff I wasn't interested in. When I nutted up and learned how to play MtG and asked to join, they moved on to something else I didn't do. It felt deliberate, and I don't have the guts to approach T about it because I'm afraid it'd be the catalyst to him dropping me altogether.

Now, I'm somewhat confident T is starting to form a relationship with one of our mutual friends. At the same time, the friend group seems to be forgetting about me. I can't get over the fact that he's moved on and left me behind with virtually no one to talk to. I don't have any emotional support, I don't have anyone to hang out with, and every time I look at another couple in a relationship, I can't help but think about how T and I would be together.

Just two days ago, T told me that he planned on moving out of his house within a year and ideally wanted a place with me. I was ecstatic and said yes with the thought in the back of my mind that this was a step towards repairing our friendship, at the least. Well, after I probe a little more the next day, T admits that the main reason he wanted a place with me was because he already knew me and it'd save the trouble of finding another roommate. I was disheartened, again, and now I'm sitting here wondering just how healthy that would be to live with him.

I'm still in love with T. It pains me to see that he's possibly with someone else and that he's leaving me in the dust here and doesn't seem to care...but at the same time wants to move in with me. I don't know if I should silently remove myself from his life, send him a letter detailing how I feel, or just do nothing and see what he does first."

3. I have had an internship during one of my summers and worked as a student research assistant to one of my professors for a summer and a semester. 
4. I know I was at least in the top third of my class, and I have had a few phone interviews.  I got a recent email rejection from one, but the other two have taken more than 5 and 6 weeks respectively to give me any kind of rejection or confirmation. I even have been sending personalized letters to each person involved in the interviews afterwards (I thought it was a nice touch - a little more than an email).

I hope this post isn't against the rules of the subreddit.

I interned at a decently prestigious company this summer, and I have an interview at Google coming up next month. I usually do pretty well in my CS classes (3.8+) at a target school.

As preparation I've been doing questions out of CTCI and Leetcode over this summer. I've done a lot of questions but I don't seem to be getting better at these questions at all.... It's pretty rare for me to get the optimal solution to a problem and many times I can't figure the question out at all unless I look at the solution. Should I be worried? Is CS not for me?

The only way I got my current internship was cause I had seen 3/5 interview questions before, and the other two were extremely easy. I'm afraid that I'll do really badly during my Google interview cause I won't be able to fake it anymore. Not just that but all my future interviews.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? I really struggle with Leetcode medium problems, for example I successfully do maybe 1 in 5.

Any advice for me?

I had a Technical Phone Screen Interview for an internship today, it was estimated to be 45 minutes - it lasted 15 minutes...

To prepare for my interview I was practicing general coding questions, which was how i spent most of my time - as well as reviewing projects I have done.

As I get the call, we had a brief introduction and he asked me about one of the projects I was working as well as my contribution to it. That went along for 5 minutes and it went ok, I was able to explain my contribution but for some technical parts I just did not remember the specifics, such as how cookie sessions were used in conjunction with PHP and SQL.

But that was not the worst part. The complete flop came when he asked me the most basic questions, questions that I know the answer to, but was not able to answer them.

Explain what a hash map is.
What are some basic HTTP functions.
Another 2 i can't recall as at the moment I am banging my head in frustration. 

These are all pretty basic questions, ones that I know the answer too. The problem? I was so focused on writing code that I did not bother to review basic terminology. A quick google search is all it took me to jog my memory, but at the time I was at a complete blank.

Really what is comes down to is not that I failed the interview, it's that I made a complete idiotic fool of myself. I was unable to answer the simplest of questions that I know the answer to. 
Part of me just does not want to go through this again, another part is actually worried that the Hiring Manager (who is the technical lead) is going to pass word of this along to whoever that might damage my reputation.

4wsy0p,2,2016-08-08,"[UT] Former employer accused me of dishonesty &amp; theft, recorded video &amp; audio w/office cameras",thejoyofcooking,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4wsy0p/ut_former_employer_accused_me_of_dishonesty_theft/,"Hi reddit - longtime lurker, first-time poster here looking for some legal advice.

So I was recently fired from my position a small marketing office. During my termination meeting (and on an official termination of employment letter that I received), my employer listed his reasons for firing me, which included reasonable things such as poor performance, missing deadlines and complaining/poor attitude.

These reasons are all well and good, if somewhat exaggerated and untrue in some cases, but not altogether unexpected. However, my employer decided to go the extra mile in what I see as a clear attempt to smear my professional reputation.

The other, problematic reasons cited for my termination of employment include two charges of dishonesty, ""specifically, when asked about [my] theft of company property"" and ""specifically, in telling false and misleading statements to other employees with the intent to cause drama and problems,"" in addition to ""uses of blasphemy.""

It should be said that I did not commit theft of company property. That specific incident, as explicitly explained by my former employer, was about one time when I threw out a former employee's business cards along with other miscellaneous items (about a week after he was fired and failed to clear off his desk, which we needed to use). These business cards were made out of metal and apparently cost $350 to make. My boss was clearly butthurt about it. Anyway, that was my ""theft.""

The allegation of telling falsehoods to other employees with the ""intent to cause drama and problems"" has to do with a separate incident, again explicitly outlined by my employer. After a weekly performance meeting with a coworker went poorly, I was talking in with my coworkers in a small office room. An intern who was assigned to this particular coworker was rather distraught after hearing the results of her mentor's performance meeting, and in an attempt to placate her I told her that the boss hates pretty much everyone's work and that she shouldn't worry too much about it. The boss found out about this particular conversation through his audio-recording video surveillance system, which he regularly uses to listen in on employee conversations to which he is not a party. Anyway, my boss asserted that he ""never said anything about [intern]'s work,"" and ""only didn't like [coworker]'s work,"" which meant that I was lying and telling falsehoods with the express intent to cause drama, apparently.

As for ""uses of blasphemy,"" I will concede that my language choices when speaking with my coworkers were not always entirely professional. However, my boss only knows this through his audio-recording cameras. Also, I'm pretty sure blasphemy isn't a real thing you can fire someone for. In case you didn't already guess, my former boss is Mormon. 

Now I live and work in Utah, which is an at-will employment state. So my former boss didn't need any reason to fire me. The fact that he left me a whole list of reasons, many of which are damaging and untrue, at no clear benefit to himself or his company strikes me as petty and malicious.


So for specific legal questions, I have 3:

Is it legal in the state of Utah for an employer to record conversations to which he is not a party, without our knowledge or consent? Our office did not have a specific ""break room"" or other room in which one might have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Is firing someone for ""blasphemy"" legal? Can I file a complaint with the EEOC for violation of my religious freedom?

Can the written allegation of my ""theft of company property,"" which is both malicious and untrue, count as libel?

Thx in advance


tl;dr my former boss recorded both audio and video of his employees without their knowledge or consent, accused me of theft of company property &amp; fired me for ""blasphemy"""

Went through recruiting in the fall and, with he help of some good ol' nepotism, was able to snag a FT offer in B4 audit. 

So I received my offer in November with a start date of late August and went on with my life. Graduated, did some traveling, and have been working on my CPA. However, 2 weeks ago I received a call from a woman in HR at the firm about my background check (shiiiii). In a nutshell, I was arrested my freshman year the FIRST week of college 5 years ago for underage and possession of marijuana. Hired a lawyer and went to court and received a plea deal to withdraw the drug charge but the underage stuck. Although the possession charge was withdrawn, it still showed up on my background check. I should have paid to get it expunged but it's too late for that now. Even worse, I failed to disclose this information on my application. Stupid, I know, but I didn't want it to automatically disqualify me and by the wording of the application I honestly didn't think it was necessary to include. So pretty much HR was calling to reconcile my background check and what I failed to disclose in my application. The woman told me my start date was suspended and that I would have to write them an official statement explaining my situation. I sent them the statement immediately and have been waiting to hear about any kind of decision. I have emailed and called HR multiple times about the situation and they are still waiting on my ""security clearances"". My start date is ~2 weeks away and I have still yet to hear anything definitive. I have been freaking out over here waiting to hear back. I thought I had this job for 10 months and now, at the last minute, I find out otherwise. Admittedly, I have kind of dug my own grave here, but Christ it was 5 years ago and the only thing that is actually on my record is an underage. 

I guess i'm just wondering if any of you guys have witnessed similar situations and what the outcomes have been. "
4wtcdc,4,2016-08-08,[META] So You Want to Join Nirn Powers,bold0727,nirnpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/comments/4wtcdc/meta_so_you_want_to_join_nirn_powers/,"Hello! I am u/bold0727, AKA Castellan Torelo of Balfiera. Here, you will read an easy way to join the fun and not be engulfed by confusion. You can choose to lead a nation, be an independent character, or lead an organization. I will touch on independent characters and organizations later.

**== CHOOSING YOUR CLAIM ==**

First, you need to choose your claim. Find an area you like on the [map](http://nirnpowers.github.io/). Then, go to the [claims wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/wiki/claims) to see if that area is claimed. If it isn't claimed, you can claim the area. An area is denoted by color, and the little ""mini-areas"" can change what nation they are a part of. So, for example, House Hlaalu consists of the brown area of Vvardenfell.

**== MAKING YOUR CLAIM ==**

First, make a reddit account. Do this by pressing ""sign up"" in the top right. Then, press SUBMIT [CLAIM] on the right of the subreddit to start your claim post. In the title, it should look something like ""[CLAIM] (Area)"" without the quotations or parentheses. In the text, you will put a small history of your area, a description of your area, and whoever is leading your area's backstory. Search on [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13aq9HYdvJT4w1DwJXnFVKVY974jzAZP1omgS46fQkvM/edit?usp=sharing) for your area, and see if there is a bold name beside it. If not, then you can play with whatever character you want (As long as it is lore friendly. A Khajiit won't be running House Hlaalu.) If there is a normal face name, however, you can change who runs the area. For examples of other claims, check out the [previous claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/search?q=%5BCLAIM%5D&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all). Once you are done, hit ""Post"" and wait for it to be approved or be given advice from a moderator to improve your claim post.

**== AFTER IT IS APPROVED ==**

Once your claim is approved, you will get a link to a wiki. In this wiki, you can put whatever you want. I reccomend copying your claim post into your wiki for the start. Check out some [other wikis](reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/wiki/claims) for examples. Make sure you link to your spreadsheet (below) in your wiki.

**== SPREADSHEET ==**

Your spreadsheet is what IS your nation. You need to keep this maintained. See /u/GOOD_GUY_GREG_2810's [post on spreadsheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/comments/4ws09v/modpost_beginners_guide_to_spreadsheets/).

**== MODERATORS ==**

The current moderators are:

/u/GOOD_GUY_GREG_2810

/u/slovakiin

/u/fabricofspacetime

/u/tofukiin

/u/JocundXarxes

/u/MysteriousDrifter

/u/bold0727 (somewhat, I am limited in what I can do)

The current interns (half mods) are:

/u/A_Wild_Wurmple

/u/inguaz

/u/Le_Herp_Derper

/u/Nagailor


(If I missed any tell me!)

**== THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ==**

Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.

A post is done for everything. For example, if you make a ship, make an [EVENT] post about it.

Conflicts are done via dice-rolling to put some randomness into the equation.

I control the map. Send me a PM to request a change.

You can buy or conquest a land. To buy it, negotiate with the owner of the land over Slack (see below) and then make a post about it. Conquesting a land, if you want to incorporate the land into your area, must have stakes of annexation and win. You need to state this in your [CONFLICT] post. If your stakes are vassalation, if you win the land will become a vassal of yours, and follow your rules while retaining independence. Check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13aq9HYdvJT4w1DwJXnFVKVY974jzAZP1omgS46fQkvM/edit#gid=) to see if you want to take over a land or not. It's data is averaged with your data, so keep that in mind.

You can only claim one area at a time, however more land can be obtained by purchasing/conquesting.

You cannot split a mini-region in half.

Renaming a mini-region could be possible if you ask a mod.

This game takes place around 100 years before ESO, so make sure you check the [UESP](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page) for help making your claim post lore-friendly. You can also ask fabricofspacetime in the Slack (see below) to talk to a lore master!

Put a date in the comments of your post so its easier for the mods to determine when your post happened (something like ""1 (real date) Frostfall ([month depends on day](https://nirnpowers.wordpress.com/tag/date/)) Year (in sidebar).""

You must only have one claim, whether it be a nation, organization, or independent character. If you own a nation, you can own an independent character without a claim post as a member of that nation.

**== SLACK ==**

If you want to be invited to the chat, send an email you feel safe giving out to /u/fabricofspacetime. Only he will see it and use it to invite you. You can ask to be invited before you claim if you have questions about anything regarding claiming.

**== INDEPENDENT CHARACTER ==**

An independent character can work for whoever you want and live wherever you want. To make one, simply make a claim post with the title as ""[CLAIM] (Character Name)"" and have the text be your character's backstory. Most of your posts as an Indendent Character will be roleplay posts and possibly nation-like posts if you run a business character.

**== ORGANIZATIONS ==**

To make an organization, make a claim post with the title ""[CLAIM] (Organization Name)"" and in the text, put a description of the organization and where it is based. You also must fill out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dUouVkEQX2nr6adtlX6WxCKT6ql_oXP26HXF-vAVqW8/edit?usp=sharing). These would be run like a nation without land. Follow the directions on the spreadsheet and ask for help in the Slack to set up an organization! ((NOTE: I have been told organizations may not be playable anymore. Please consult a moderator for more information.))

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy your time in Nirn Powers! Make sure you read the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/wiki/pocketguide) before you start playing!"

The lyrics of the Momma's and the Papa's bounce inside my head, remnants of my car ride entertainment still lingering from the morning commute. I stare at the glass entrance to the office, my hand hesitating on the door handle. The two week vacation had been nice. *Really nice,* my brain corrects as I will myself to walk inside. *I could just turn around, walk back to my car. Text the wife, tell her we're going back, forget this hum-drum work life I lead*.  My feet drag the rest of me inside, settling me into the squeaky office  chair that I call home forty plus hours a week. Images of my Nikki, sunning herself on the pool deck, flashes of smiles and wet hair and naked skin in a tropical paradise, flit past my closed eyes. *She'd go along with it, right?*  I shake my head as the computer in front of me comes to life, welcoming me back to my dull existence with a whir and a beep.


*""Every other day, every other day Every other day of the week is fine, yeah.""*

I gaze across the office, the familiar smell of ink and toner cartridge mingling with aroma of fresh coffee. I sigh, not catching the difference, the newness. *Same old office*. At 34, I'd been doing this job for 10 years. I do it well. It pays handsomely. And I am so bored with it. I look around desperately, searching for something fresh, something to excite me again. Nothing. Resigned, I settle in behind my desk, still not realizing the answer wafts right under my nose.


*""Monday morning, you gave me no warning, of what was to be.""*


""Hey Zach."" I glance up at my coworker Chris as he leans over our common cubicle wall. His large, round face splits into a conspiratorial grin. ""How was the trip?""

""Awesome,"" I say with a sigh, silently wishing the younger man away, still clinging to the last vestiges of my escape from this monotonous existence. ""Its kind of hard to be ba-"" He cuts me off.


""Yeah yeah, blah blah blah."" He leans farther into my work space. ""None of that is important."" I shoot him a glare, which sails right over his head. *Ass*. ""The real question is, have you seen the new intern yet?”  He winks piggishly. I grimace at his face. The rich smell of fresh beans tickles my senses again. It hits me. *Real, fresh coffee; that's what's different.*  My coworker's eyes widen and he hisses, ""Here she comes!”

----

I'm looking for the intern I can't resist, the spark of excitement I can't stay away from. I want to be a good husband. Damnit, I *am* a good husband. Wrack me with guilt as you take me by the hand and lead me into dalliance.


I am a huge switch. Expect me to try and stick to my vows, to struggle to listen to the small voice of my conscience as it begs me to pull the brake. This can be a light-hearted office fling or a sinister seduction; rescue me from the doldrums of monotony or relish in the destruction of my marriage. Both work for me. Just know that while I will do my best to be the good man my wife thinks I am, once you tip me over that brink I will happily take the lead, as well as take you in every way you desire.

I took my time in crafting this
prompt. The reply that will get my attention will do the same. I'm not just going to write with the first person who messages me back, so don't just roll your face across the keyboard and hope for the best :).  So send me a message, give me your best. Ideally, you’re looking for a story driven prompt that gets one to two well written messages a day. That's the roleplay in looking for. Looking forward to your orange envelope!

4wtfh6,3,2016-08-08,Having some doubts about the URPV in Albania 2017,monsieurvampy,peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/4wtfh6/having_some_doubts_about_the_urpv_in_albania_2017/,"This is partially a standard ""doubts"" post...


I was recently offered and accepted to be a Urban and Regional Planning Volunteer in Albania departing March 2017. I'm super excited but at the same time terrified, though nervous might be the better wording now. 

One of my biggest concerns is the lack of any information on what have other Urban and Regional Planning Volunteers have done in Albania. The Official Peace Corps Albania page has only a handful of post related to planning, and most of those are GIS related. I've found two blogs, where one guy worked in the permit office but was unable to do anything and another who created this amazing portfolio though his background was mostly in architecture.

Now, I'm fresh out of graduate school in Planning and have *grand* ideas and such. Though I know from Planning in my hometown (or anywhere) projects that actually have the biggest impact usually take years and into decades to actual have a critical mass. Even in the best planning environment, I'd barely do anything in two years. (such as the United States) 

Now, I understand that Peace Corps is largely what you make of it. Some people teach English or do some agricultural thing. *I have no interest in anything that is not Planning or Historic Preservation oriented.* I'll teach Planning, but that's unlikely to be important to the community I'm assigned too. 

In my *grand* idea of thinking. I have looked into the architecture of Albania and the EuroVelo Mediterranean Route as well as the growing tourism and hospitality industry. These can be excellent drivers of economic development in communities if they have the right assets. If I'm lucky enough to be assigned to an area with a UNESCO heritage site or just a large number of historic properties. I could potentially help the community if the government body or NGO is behind it. Also, the bunkers in Albania could be an awesome tourist thing while teaching history.

Personally on my side, I would love just to have a career job in Planning. It hasn't worked out as planned since I graduated in May, but the process takes forever. I also have a bunch of financial issues that I plan on resolving by declaring bankruptcy. I have been putting this off since the beginning of the year in hopes of finding a career job (which would have killed Peace Corps asap). This will absolve me of my current debt issues while keeping my student loans (public and private). The private student loans might be an issue though I plan on going on income-based repayment for my public loans. (yay for loan forgiveness).

Now, my mom has been sorta homeless (moving around/staying with friends) for a year or so now. She is finally staying with me (in the living room) as much as I would rather her not be in the living room. It's better than her being somewhere else. This is something I need to push for her to find a stable place to stay. The original idea was to ask her to move in with me when I got a career job (wherever that may be). 

I'm going to assume this is going to be asked. So, I'll answer it in advanced. - **Why do you want to be a Urban and Regional Planning Volunteer in Albania?**


I want to Plan, I want to be a Planner. For me Peace Corps will look amazing on my resume and may help me get a federal job with either DOT or NPS. If not for a federal job, it will definitely stand out on my resume compared to others. Also, a graduate student my internships were lacking. 

*Peace Corps is not here, its Planning and I want to travel.* 


**In preparation** for Service, I want to up my skillset, Learn GIS, AutoCAD, Rino, Sketchup, InDesign and improve my skills in Illustrator and Photoshop. From what I read Albania doesn't use computers as much, but I could be an helpful to the community. I also want to start working out (mostly to lose weight. I'm 5'10"" and weigh 250 lbs) and learn more about Albanian architecture, historic properties and urban development. Also, their application to be in the European Union. 


**TL;DR: Doubts about the lack of information on what other Urban and Regional Planning Volunteers have done. I have little to no interest in anything that is not Planning or Historic Preservation oriented. I've been putting off bankruptcy but will need to do so for Peace Corps and figure out the best way to manage my private student loans and public student loans. I want to prepare myself in skills, knowledge and language so that I can better serve the community that I'm assigned too. Lastly, I have family issues that make things difficult. I know I'll likely regret Peace Corps if I don't go though**

edit: I'm using the term ""Urban Planning"" in a very vague matter.

4wtgri,4,2016-08-08,College student who had a generous internship this summer.,OtakuDragoon42,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/4wtgri/college_student_who_had_a_generous_internship/,"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* Other than the typical project work and web browsing I'd mainly be using this for CAD projects and gaming. The first priority being that it runs AutoCad and Solidworks smoothly. I don't need to be able to play the newest games on max settings but I would like to be able to finally play Dark Souls III I bought preemptively without my computer having a seizure.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* I aimed to set aside around 800 dollars with my internship this summer, but I was fortunate enough that I have 1000 dollars at my disposal. Unless it's make-or-break I would like to save that 200 dollars for some other peripherals. 

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Hopefully this weekend after I finish moving the last bit of furniture for my room mate.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* Tower, OS, and Monitor(maybe).

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* KY, USA. No microcenter for me. . .

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I have an older HP Pavilion f 1703 monitor which I would like to incorporate into a multi-monitor set up if possible.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Nope, no overclocking here.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Enough space for the moderate library of movies and games I like to keep saved to my computer and the ability to run them smoothly I suppose. But on my previous setup the snail's pace of using AutoCad was much more frustrating. Plenty of USB ports would be awesome.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* My keyboard is black and red, so if possible I would like the case to match. It isn't a must have though. Good airflow and ability to manage cables would be appreciated.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* I would like Windows 10 on this. Not sure at the moment, if I can get it through the school though.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

* Go easy on me, It's my first build. And thanks for the time."

I loved learning programming languages, and I'm wrapping up my first ever internship and I enjoyed the work I did (although it did get exhausting toward the end, glad the project is almost over!). I've always seen myself getting a job (or trying at least) in a field that's at the frontier of technology. That's just what interests me the most: doing something that revolutionizes the industry.

My question is pretty much what makes me as a programmer special? Nowadays people in many other disciplines are learning programming, and not just python either. A friend of mine who is a graphic designer did some VR work with C#, and people in biology learn C++ for computational purposes. It seems that other fields utilize programming in such cool ways, but software engineers just do it to do it. It feels like anyone nowadays can replace me since everyone is learning languages. A computational biologist can't be replaced by a software engineer because a software engineer isn't an expert in biology, a graphic designer can't be replaced by someone who isn't good with art and 3D modeling. There must be some job that computer engineers thrive at and are irreplaceable in obviously, and it's definitely not the 9-to-5 jobs of writing mundane code either (I hope). 

So my question is, what sort of programming jobs push the field forward and do cool amazing things? What are the jobs that I could do that no one else could? This isn't about job security by the way, it's just about pride in work and feeling satisfied."
4wtymp,1,2016-08-08,[25F] falling for my ex's best friend [25M],throwaway_nata,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wtymp/25f_falling_for_my_exs_best_friend_25m/,"Four years ago, I was living in Europe and met my ex (let's call him Mark), who I dated for 5 months. While in Europe, we hung out with his best friend (let's call him Jack) almost everyday in his apartment. Mark and I were really in love and I was completely devastated when he broke up with me over the distance when I went back home to the US. Mark made it clear he still had strong feelings for me and didn't want to lose me, but he was being pragmatic and knew that long distance over many years would be painful and difficult. We are still friends and skype every now and then and he visits me whenever I go on vacation in Europe. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, I found out his best friend Jack would be in the US for an internship. I was excited to hear this because I thought it would be really fun to hang out with him again. We started texting often and he asked me if he could fly in for the weekend and visit me in the city where I live. I love having visitors so I happily agreed. 

I was intent on keeping things platonic, despite him being attractive and single because I am still friends with Mark and wouldn't want to do anything to hurt him. I was a but worried about Jack's intentions but I hoped that he respected Mark enough to not try anything. We ended up having one of the best weekends I've had in a while. We explored the city together and went out every night and had a blast. I felt like there was sexual tension but I never let it go too far. He did hit on me when he was drunk (calling me the most beautiful girl in the room, and grabbing me to dance with him etc.) but he never made an actual pass at me. 

Fast forward a week, I'm missing him terribly. I get a text message from him and he asks me if I would like to come down for the weekend and visit him. Excited to have another fun weekend I said yes, but I was especially thrilled because I missed him so much.

Now, the problem is that I saw this all completely platonically, and while I did miss him and I knew there was some sexual tension, I really knew that because of Mark we had to keep things non-sexual. I was fine with that. Trouble is, all my friends who heard the story and met him while he was here said he 100% was into me and is inviting me down to make things romantic. I scoffed them off but people kept telling me this and eventually I began believing them. Maybe it is crazy to fly across the country to see your ex's best friend? 

Once I arrived we had a great time, but once alcohol got in the mix, he started flirting again. He would compliment me, and dance with me and in the uber home he grabbed my hand and held it the whole way time. At his place, he asked me to share the bed, and we did so platonically, no cuddling but touching. There was never a point when one of our body parts wasn't touching the others (and it was a big bed, we could have easily not had any contact). 

The next day, we had fun sight seeing, but my googly eyes were growing. I kept looking at him and thinking how attracted I was to him. That evening, I decided to be the one with liquid courage, and forced myself to take an extra two shots. We were dancing at a club, and I pushed him against a beam and started really sexually dancing against him. He reciprocated, grabbing me, and grinding with me and coyly put his face to mine almost kissing. After a while, we both couldn't take it anymore and started making out with each other. It truly was the hottest make out I have ever had. He seemed completely into it, but once we left the club, he did a completely 180 in his behavior. He asked me what just happened and seemed nervous. We got back to his place and had a heart to heart. He said he saw me like a sister up until an hour ago and he is confused. And he promised Mark nothing would happen with me, and he thinks I'm a great person and would like to keep me as a lifetime friend and sleeping together would screw things up. I agreed with everything because I know he was right. It still hurt to be rejected but I knew he was right and I was just acting in the heat of the moment and not rationally. 

We had our last day together yesterday and it was fine, and the prior evening's events were never brought up. We slept in the same bed together again doing that touching/not cuddling thing again (even some hand touching), but we were both tossing and turning all night. I don't think either of us slept more than 20 minutes in a row. I couldn't sleep because I was sad about leaving...not sure why he couldn't.

Now I'm back home and I am completely confused. I've developed feelings for him and don't understand how I should proceed. He will be in the US for another two months so there is still a chance we get to see each other before he goes back to Europe. I don't know if he is even interested in me in that way. I would ideally like to keep him as a close friend to see where things might go in the future in a few years. I don't know if I should try and see him again in a platonic way while he is still in the country. What does one do in a situation like this?

I was about to delete my OkCupid account when I saw his message pop up, asking me about who I played in Guilty Gear. He was a cute, brilliantly intelligent guy who loved fine art, played the guitar, and loved travelling. I figured eh, what the hell, and answered. We ended up chatting for a couple of hours and exchanging numbers. I thought he was a little too cocky and forward, but intriguing enough for me to agree to a date.

On our first date we went to a board game cafe and played Scrabble, with the provision that all the words had to be related to butts. We talked about art, music, video games, food...and quickly found that we were into the exact same things. I'd never made friends with someone so fast before.

We went out 3 or 4 times a week, sometimes more. If we weren't together, we were texting or calling or playing Overwatch together. Everything seemed perfect, and I started to feel safe and comfortable around him. He is a kind, sensitive man who’d give you the shirt off his back, and probably the most intense and driven person I’ve ever met.

We decided to be exclusive quite early on. I told him that before I got involved, I wanted to make sure that we both agreed to always be transparent and communicate any issues because my last relationship was ruined by a lack of communication. I was worried he was starting to get a little too attached, but I remember consciously thinking in my mind that it doesn't hurt to let my guard down sometimes and threw caution to the wind.

He did the cutest, most thoughtful things. He showed up at my place unannounced with my favourite foods. He always held my arm tightly so I wouldn't trip on the sidewalk, since I'm ridiculously clumsy. He had a running list on his phone of every little thing I liked that I'd mentioned offhandedly. He tried to learn about my stupidly long haircare regime. He loved my cat and he got along with my parents. He'd teach me how to say cute phrases in Korean and Japanese.

He made it feel so easy. I didn't understand why such an awesome guy would be into me, but was so happy that he was. But if something seems too good to be true, it is. Life always throws a couple of emotional sucker punches in the works just to fuck with me, apparently.

After a protracted fight on the phone about his parents' racism towards me, he decided to break up me as to not rock the boat. I was thunderstruck, since his parents had never really said anything negative towards me and he'd never mentioned that they were racist. Apparently they threatened to cut him off, which would leave him homeless and unable to finish his degree. I told him that he was being naive if he thought that dumping me would magically repair his relationship with his parents and he'd always resent them for it, but I also told him that I understood completely. It would be stupid to expect him to put me, a girl he'd known for a summer, above his career and future - his life's dream.

Later that night he showed up at my place and sobbed into my arms for an hour, apologizing profusely. He promised he'd never act so rashly again, and I promised him that I'd support him whenever his parents pressured him. I was stupid and weak enough to believe him.

Things were a little shaky that week, but we tried in earnest to start mending things. His parents did end up apologizing to me and said they'd try their best to work on their prejudice. I was feeling insecure and hurt, but was trying to build my trust in him again. A few days passed without incident. I'd been busting my ass job hunting all week, but we still made time to hang out.

One day I got lectured on my lack of ambition and on my complacence, which I grudgingly admitted. I'd been coasting for a few months, frustrated because I hadn't scored an internship and was stuck working in horrible jobs. I was getting cabin fever from having nothing to do. He told me he'd been in the same place before, and he was committed to pulling me out of it and I could count on him helping me. But then...

...He had a discussion with his family and literally had a change of heart within an hour. From saying he'd help and support me, to saying that we had irreconcilable differences. I told him I was angry at him because I mentioned him a ton of times in my latest vlog and now I’d have to edit all of it out. I was half-joking, but he agreed with me.

He told me that I had a whole heap of dealbreaking faults that he'd always had reservations about, but he held his tongue to see if he could get over them. He admitted that he tried but he couldn't, so basically I was never good enough for him the entire time, and that's the part that breaks my heart the most, especially when he always told me that I was perfect and complemented his personality in every way.

I tried to convince him that the things he wanted me to change were not fundamental parts of me, and I was ok with changing them to make the relationship work. How dare he try to decide what I’m willing to compromise on? His parents told him a ton of garbage that in a happy relationship, you don't need to compromise or change for the other person, because that just causes resentment. I can't get over how naive that is.

The next morning, I got a phone call with a job offer. Funnily enough, it was from a store he'd encouraged me to apply at.

I tried to call him, but he wouldn't answer. I texted him and asked if he wanted to exchange our belongings, and he said he'd just mail them to me. I was so crushed and angry that he wouldn't even face me after destroying my trust for the second time in less than a week, and I called him a coward. He agreed and said he hated himself for hurting me, and he regretted it, but his mind was made up. I still have so much love to give him, but he won’t take it.

I wrote him a long letter and emailed it to him the next day. His reply was “I understand”.

Spent the next few days staring at my phone, waiting for him to call me. He didn’t call me. I started crying hysterically when I saw that he deleted me off Battle.net. I uninstalled Guilty Gear. All I can think of is how we spent hours practising combos together. Overwatch isn’t fun anymore. Walking to my job downtown is literally a trip down memory lane. The locations of our first dinner date, our first time holding hands, and our first kiss are all conveniently featured in my daily commute. Everything around me reminds me of him.

I went to a party – the party was planned months in advance, so it was too late to back out. He had been excited because I'd planned to wear a dress with strawberries printed on it, when I never wear cutesy things like that. He had asked me to take a lot of photos in the dress because he wanted to see how cute I looked.

I can’t eat. I’m down 2 lbs. I am falling apart at the seams.

The sadness is still there, but it wasn't clouding my judgement as strongly. The reality started to set in. If one person doesn't want to be in the relationship anymore, it's broken. No matter how perfect it felt or how happy we were, it’s broken. And a broken relationship would have eventually turned toxic and one-sided at some point if we'd dragged it out. I have to watch these feelings die. I can't stop checking his Facebook page. I still have all his birthday gifts in my Amazon shopping cart.

My sadness has a deep undercurrent of rage. I realize that the whole relationship was built on lies and doubts that he’d never voiced, despite us agreeing from day one that we needed to be open and honest. He said he didn’t want me to resent him for voicing his concerns…because dumping me out of the blue certainly wouldn’t breed any resentment. I know he didn’t do it intentionally, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I cannot think of any way he could have handled that any worse.

I’m still obsessively checking his Facebook page. He deleted all of our photos and posts, which makes me sad. I’m removing us from all our events on Facebook since I keep getting notifications. Man, we planned a lot of shit. I don’t have the heart to remove him from my friends list because it feels too final. I already know that it’s final.

His status updates are completely normal as if nothing has happened, which pisses me off. I’m feeling vindictive, so I want him to show some outward sign that he’s suffering. I know he is. At the same time, I want nothing more but to see him and give him a hug and tell him I love him. I don’t truly want him to suffer, even if he almost deserves it. I miss him a lot. I wish we could be friends.

tl;dr I fell too hard for someone, got dumped out of the blue, and everything sucks

4wugfc,1,2016-08-09,Crisis About What To Do Next,Kpcostello96,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4wugfc/crisis_about_what_to_do_next/,"So a very brief background on myself just to eliminate the go-to suggestions, I have General Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. I see both a psychiatrist and therapist, both are great, and I am on meds that control the disorders fairly well. (I should mention I do intend to speak to my therapist about the following situation but I don't see her until next week and want more than one opinion)


I am faced with large life choices right now but have no idea what to do. The important background is as follows. I am a 20 year old male about to enter my junior year of college. I started my college career at a school in Washington, DC that we will call College A with a finance major. I hated it there when I got there, couldn't socialize, the anxiety and panic overwhelmed me and became very controlling. Towards the end of the year, I had a few people I would talk to somewhat regularly and I had a girlfriend (a girl I had known since high school, long and unnecessary story). It was very tolerable. Fast forward to sophomore year, I have a wonderful apartment across the street from campus, my girlfriend is around a lot, I'm making some friend in accounting class and things are improving but I'm still not happy. 


This is where it gets complicated. I tell my girlfriend and she tells me she isn't happy there either and so we both want to transfer. We pick colleges independent of each other but end up picking the same college, College B which is almost solely a business school. I make the move in between fall and spring semester sophomore year. I almost immediately regret it. Christmas break was filled with anxiety. We get to College B and its a rocky start as one would expect with anxiety. Now first semester has passed and I just hate where I am at. I don't think I want to go in to business anymore, I think I want to pursue medicine, something I always had an interest in and that I have had even doctors tell me I should do but I can't do that at College B. They don't have the necessary courses. So not only do I not want to be at College B anymore but I cant do anything that isnt business there. But I dont want to leave my girlfriend either even though we could make distance work I love being near her and she helps my anxiety so much and I don't think she would want to transfer back to College A. But I miss College A so much and at College A I could pursue either business or pre-med or both if I was ambitious enough. I have an accounting internship that I hate and I just am not at all happy and its been making my panic disorder worse for weeks now. And I know its already late to change majors and I definitely can't wait any longer to figure this out. I know College B is better for business and I am two years into business but I miss DC and the friends I was starting to make and all of it. Any advice would be so so great to have.


Ask any questions that you have, I am very open about my anxiety.

**If you read this entire thing, thank you so much! You have no idea how much it means to me.**"
4wuhep,7,2016-08-09,Speaking up against ignorance,zboubDeCampagne,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4wuhep/speaking_up_against_ignorance/,"I'm doing an internship in a tech company and everything's going pretty well. Except one thing.

At lunch I mostly eat alone or with random people since we're directly working on a client's site where there are many companies, and my teammates either eat with their families or eat out (which, as a student on a tight budget and who likes eating pretty healthily, I can't afford everyday). That's not what's bothering me though.

Last week I ate with an HR team from another company and they had a discussion about the homosexuals. One of them has a best friend who happens to be gay (she felt like she had to mention it), and the others seriously asked her if she chose him because he was gay. Then I got served with every cliché possible (we love shopping, gossip all the time, hook up with every single gay guy that we see and of course, all have AIDS).

I felt pretty offended and gutted to observe such ignorance, but didn't have the courage to call them out. I was very frustrated and angry against myself afterwards : I felt like I should've reacted. They weren't necessarily ""mean"", just ignorant.

So bros, have you ever faced a similar situation? How did you react? And do you have any advice on getting the courage to call people out when they're being homophobic/ignorant?"
4wulut,9,2016-08-09,I was an intern at Seinfeld and discovered lost tape.,andythestreet,shittynosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/shittynosleep/comments/4wulut/i_was_an_intern_at_seinfeld_and_discovered_lost/,"i was an intern at the seinfeld incorporated studios in 1992. i had been there for a few weeks, doing coffee errands and intern stuff. i was on my fourth week there when something strange happen.
my boss (the big seinfeld man) and some of the crew were going through some tapes of the show that they had laying around. then he came across an unmarked tape and he spit on it and put it into the vcr.

now i, a logical person, am logically a completely logical person, but what happened next made me, a logical person, scared to death.

the episode begin like a normal seinfeld episode; the camera focused on jerry, who was on stage spitting on a mic. the familiar bassline playing softly in the distance. the camera then panned out to the audience of jerry’s show, but there was no one there. now me, a completely logical person who is logical, found this a little unlogical, but i continued logically watching. jerry then began to foam at the mouth and crawl away on all fours, but this didn’t seem too out of the ordinary.

the seinfeld bassline transitioned us into a new scene.  the camera was focused on jerry’s apartment, but jerry wasn’t there. george was sitting on the couch, and he looked normal, but he was sweating profusely and completely still and silent. george stayed in this position for at least 10 minutes, which i found highly unlogical, but it WAS a show about nothing. after about 10 minutes, the door to jerry’s apartment opened. there was no one there. after about 5 minutes, a figure stepped in. it was a man who looked exactly like george but inverted, wearing a baseball tee that said “INVERSE GEORGE”. as he entered, a distorted version of the seinfeld bassline began playing and the quality of the video became extremely distorted. images were flashing on the screen and my boss (the big seinfeld man) paused to see what the images were. we were expecting images of dead people or something but they were just pepsi ads. my boss (the big seinfeld man) was visibly horrified at this, and i heard some people vomiting. he pressed play again.
through the distorted video we could see INVERSE GEORGE come towards regular george. regular george appeared to be screaming but there was no sound. INVERSE GEORGE suddenly had a knife and was stabbing regular george. blood was everywhere and the audio was highly distorted at this point. 

the scene abruptly ended to show outside of jerry’s apartment. it seemed quiet. the camera transitioned to show the inside of jerry’s apartment. it was empty, there was no blood. the scene stayed like this for 10 minutes or so, and we were considering stopping the playback of the tape. that’s when jerry appeared on the screen, very far away from the camera. he appeared to be crying and the video became distorted again. he slowly walked towards the camera, crying for no apparent reason, and the audio began to become fuzzier and louder. he finally became close to the camera, screaming now and spitting blood, and then in a distorted and raspy voice he said, 

“What’s the deal with airplane food?”

then Newman appeared and swallowed him whole. the tape ended.

I shall share with you my story, and what has changed in my life. Some things are still deep within in me, but I will try to share everything, so that some of you guys can perhaps learn from it.

First things first, I was doing great for almost 1.5 years not watching porn. Unfortunately, I relapsed some months ago. I started watching again for a little while. BUT then I stopped watching again. Since then I'm recovering again, so ignore the badge. 

Let's start with the positive things first. Back in October 2014 I decided to quit for good. NO pmo. Before this period I tried several times, but never succeeded. Little background information. Till 2014 I was an introvert person, shy, socially awkward, I was a virgin back then. 0 experience with girls, not much experience in life at all. People found me as a nice guy, but no one every looked up to me. All the girls friendzoned me etc. And you can fill up the rest. 

When I decided to quit in october 2014. The results showed immediately at new year 2015. I went to a party and a talked to almost every girl back then! Yes, under the influence of alcohol. Although back then this was amazing for me. Because with or without alcohol, I could never approach a person/girl. Before interacting in my mind 1000 thoughts occured.

Moving forward to summer 2015. Since December to June. I was even excelling in everything more and more. I became a ladiesman! I started talking to so many girls, I had dates almost every two weeks. I lost my virginity back in february. I got an internship in Sales. Which was beyond my comfort zone. But this helped me a lot. I became open, happy person and could talk to people so easily!

Sounds great right? Well back then I felt amazing, mostly because I was a 23 year old guy who never have had 'sexual' experiences with girls. Looking back now. It was not great at all. Why? Because I had the wrong priorities in life. From 0 contact with girls, my entire focus went on talking to girls, dating etc. 

This is wrong, for the following reason which I learned within time. Guys remember one things, the most important aspect in your life to develop is 1. YOUR HEALTH and 2. YOURSELF (personal development). Speaking out of experience! Back in 2015 january I was sick all the time. But I choose girls, partying before my health. My health got even worse that I got a breakdown. However, since october I focussed on my health and increasing my development on all aspects. 

Forward the time to now. What have I achieved in almost 2 years? 

- Social person, I can talk to anyone now. 
- Girls come and go in my life, I don't have any problems with that anymore.
- My health improved. I do not eat fastfood, I am very concious on what I eat.
- Since march 2016 I sport. I go to the gym 3 times a week. 
- More developed person. I read books, medidate. I am constantly working on myself. 
- My relationships with friends and family have improved. 
- I am in a state of mind that I do not care what others have to say. (I don't give a fuck attitude). I focus on my goals no matter what.
- I have an positive attitude on life, and with everything that I do. 
- My libido increased tremendously.
- I do things out of my comfort zone. 
- People actually look up to me now. 

The list goes on (feel free to ask)! However here comes the downside. Have I elimated the addiction out of my life?

No, some months ago I started watching porn again. I thought I had control, that it wouldn't have any effect on me. I was wrong. I started watching again for a month or so. However, I quit again. 

Another downside, due to all the attention I was getting from girls it was good until I got in a relationship. A relationship where I didn't get any sexual attention. I started sexting with random girls (which I will explain in an other forum if you guys are interested). This process became so deep, that it turned in an addiction itself. It is all linked with the porn addiction. You are not watching anything, but you are still looking for that dopamine kick. This went on and off. 

As of now: I am developing myself daily, my life is nowhere what it looked like back in 2014. But I do know that I have not conquered my addiction. No where close actually, but I am in a rehab, and I will NEVER give up. Even after relapsing. Stand up, and fight again. 

One day, the addiction will be in the past. I know it. And for you guys as well. 

Sorry for the long post! I hope that this post can help you guys somehow. Feel free to ask any questions.

EDIT: This post is not a ""how to"" on how you can tackle your addiction. I am sharing you my story to motivate you guys. Work on yourself day in and out, and grow as a person. In the end you will have the strength to remove the factor of this addiction for ones and for all out of your life. The addiction partakes a percentage of your life. The 100% is a various of different factors. So try to focus on all the factors: health, personal development, relationships, study etc. In the end everything will pay off, have the patience and the desire to change yourself!

4wwg3m,4,2016-08-09,Comparing cost of living in San Francisco and Seattle for a new grad,ai3jfs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4wwg3m/comparing_cost_of_living_in_san_francisco_and/,"Hi everyone,

I graduate next spring and am beginning to consider where I want to be stationed after college. I grew up on the east coast, but after a successful internship in Seattle this summer, I am interested in moving out to the west coast for full time. I have narrowed down my preferred cities to either San Francisco or Seattle, and I would love to hear some opinions/perspectives/experiences about the difference in cost of living between the two cities.

For simple comparison's sake, imagine I am able to reach the offer stage with at least one Big N company in each city. Notably, it seems like both cities have companies that offer new grad salaries of right around $105k, even though San Francisco and the Bay Area have a markedly higher cost of living than Seattle -- at least, that's what it seems like.

On [PaycheckCity](http://paycheckcity.com/), I've calculated monthly take-home pay for California and Washington on a $105k/yr salary. This is with no dependents/deductions/tax complications.

California take-home: $5,555.31/mo
Washington take-home: $6,263.39/mo

On top of that, the average rent for a 1br apartment in San Francisco proper is ~$3600/mo, while in Seattle it's closer to ~$1900/mo. Obviously these are just averages, and living right in SF proper will be more expensive than considering surrounding areas, but in both cases I am motivated to live in the city.

What experiences have you all had? Are those PaycheckCity figures at all accurate, or does stuff like Washington's increased sales tax begin to balance the two out? If you've lived in one or both of the cities, what is/was your monthly take-home like?

Thanks for any perspective you can provide."

Currently we've been dating for about 10 months. G and I met online last year. We really meshed well together. This guy is pretty much perfect for me. He goes to school in another country and was only in my city for his 4 month internship. At the end of it, we agreed to do long distance. He visited me on Valentine's day and we planned for more future visits but unexpectedly, he got another internship in my city again! He'd be here for the entire summer! Everything is wonderful and I love him so very much. Here is my only ""issue"" and I hesitate to call it that because I'm not sure if I'm blowing things out of proportion or not. 

G has an Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. I always post pictures of us (certainly not everyday, and never with extremely mushy captions or with sweeping declarations of love) and usually just to Instagram, where my friends and I follow each other (as opposed to Facebook where I have a lot of acquaintances). On the other hand, G has never posted a photo of us. At first it didn't bother me. I know he's not a social media guy. He rarely posts a photo of himself (and when he does, it's always just to Snapchat where it disappears after 24hrs), never updates his status, etc. The only thing that bothers me is that he once, maybe twice posted a photo of me/us (and only to Snapchat). 

I actually got the courage to ask why he doesn't post photos of us. He said that he doesn't like the way he looks in photos. I asked if he's embarrassed of me, or not proud, or if his friends even know about me. He responded, ""yes of course they know about you! I can show you our conversations where I mentioned you!"" and I said, ""no, that's not really the point."" 

Then I asked if he feels happy or touched whenever I upload a photo of us, and he said he doesn't really feel anything. He's about to go back to his country in a few weeks and this has been bothering me for a little bit. He said that he was really surprised at my reaction to him not posting anything. 

Possibly noteworthy facts: 

* We're not ""in a relationship"" on Facebook. 
* I make a conscious effort to never tag him on funny stuff/memes on Facebook because I know he's friends with a lot of his former bosses/other interns/teachers and he doesn't want it to show. 
* On his birthday I posted a photo of us on Facebook with a short but sweet message and all he did was ""like"" it. Later i asked him if he liked it (because he didn't comment anything) and he said ""of course I liked it, didn't I?"" and he went back to check if he had. 

I just want to know if I'm justified in being a little hurt or if I'm being immature and overreacting. I don't put our relationship on blast over social media but it would feel nice to sometimes get a small public shoutout from him. 

---   

TL;DR G hasn't/won't post a picture of us and I'm not sure if it's upsetting me more than it should. I really need an outside opinion or some stories from people with previous experience with this sort of problem. "

The program I was so proud of just crash and burned. I was told to make it faster.

But honestly I can't even figure out how to make it faster. Everything I try to do, or people say I should do, I have no fucking idea for how to solve it. Anytime I ask in a leanrpython chatroom or programing channel, I get no response. I am going crazy stressing over this program that I cannot for the life of me, make faster. I spend every fucking waking moment thinking about how to solve this problem. I stayed in my apartment in the city, while my parents and dog went to the suburbs for the weekend, to relax. I haven't had a moment to even play a game of Dota 2. I have just get home decimated from hyper focusing all day that I can't even speak properly at home. I just stutter. 

My anxiety, depression and ADHD meds can only do so much. But I have horrible headaches. I have been working this internship for 7 weeks, I already have the biggest year of school coming up. Senior year hasn't even started, not a single application has been sent, but I already have to cross off some of my top choices b/c of my meltdown on my finals. The thought that I will have to work for the rest of the summer on a program I honestly could care less about. All for a recommendation from my boss. 


Thank you for reading.

Our users are, unsurprisingly, not very good at closing things before they exit out of our terminal server, so every so often, maybe once or twice a month, we have to either manually kill their processes or restart the entire terminal server because it gets very slow due to processes taking up resources.

I am just an intern myself trying to get started in the IT field, and my boss has basically told me to try to figure something out, some sort of setting to automatically kill processes every so often after 1 hour of inactivity or something along those lines.

I had enough saved to make it to graduation if frugal. However due to a series of unfortunate events I couldn't afford the months of April and may. I broke lease and started couch surfing until I graduated. I had to stay for 1 more summer class since I failed a spring course. I picked up a temp job. Car payment not going thru due to negative balance and paycheck not being big enough to fix. I finally graduated.

Moved to austin for new job in July, still couch surfing. was a commission based job, however it didn't play out as well as expected. When it came down to pay day, only got paid 150 for 2 weeks. I had to quit and get new job. Started new job but won't be seeing paycheck for a while.

That being said, I was trying to get a place with my cousin who also just moved here for job. We sign a lease, owe 3000 deposit due to broken lease. By the 9th. Not happening since my job didn't work out the way I needed it to. So we find a new place alot cheaper, must have 1600 by the 10th so we get the place cuz the owners are mad cool willing to work with us. So we trying to figure a way to have that amount by the 10th.

So far 400 short. No money for food/gas next 20 days. For both of us.

Now we get phone call from first apt saying they ready for us to move in. But we don't have the 3000. Now it's considered a broken lease because we signed the contract record for 10 years and gonna owe about 15,000. Fuck"

4wxx3x,2,2016-08-09,I [22M] am currently talking to my Best Friend / Ex-Girlfriend [20F] of 8 Months and I don’t know what to do with our current relationship,LimitedEditionKiwi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wxx3x/i_22m_am_currently_talking_to_my_best_friend/,"This is my first post and I’m not sure how much details to put, but here goes.

We began dating when I was in post-secondary in another province; the same province as her. I started dating her in November. I’ve talked and seen her more and more as time went on. Probably 2 to 3 times a month with her staying at my place for 2 to 3 nights at a time because she lives an hour away and goes to a different school.

Initially, I was scared to go into a long distance relationship with her, and she just reassures me that everything will work out. As long as we communicate and talk about anything and everything, things will eventually work out and problems can be solved. Education always came first before anything else.

In school, I was very stressed most of the time to do well on my midterms and finals, but I tried my best to make things work with her. I tried to do things for the both of us and tried to make time for the both of us.

School was also a major factor, and because I was stressed with it, my emotions were fluctuating all over the place (I would have a fun time, and when I start on assignments and stuff, I would just get frustrated and lose it). She was my go to person. She calms me down and makes me happy. She’s seen me at my worst and sometimes at my best (I had to move back home for the summer). I would never get mad at her; I can’t get mad at her.

Her career is an Equestrian so she deals with horses daily. She’s been through a lot in life, but she loves horses and they’re her passion. She would choose her horses over me, and I completely understand. She accepts me with the faults I have and always reassures me and motivates me whenever I’m down. Without her helping me along the way, I’m pretty sure I would have burnt out during my studies. I also cared for her a lot. I tried to be there for her as much as I can while managing school.

I moved back home for the summer in April and I thought everything was going fine until 3 weeks ago. During the past 3 months, she had been busy working hard because of the summer season and attending internships and writing her finals for school (She ended up being top 4 of her class!). There were a lot of ups and downs for her over the summer, but I would always make sure to text her daily and Skype when I have the chance. 

I know I’m not perfect, but I try. But my faults got to her and she got fed up. Most of these, I thought it was at an okay level until she just suddenly told me it’s not one day.  (I’m not good with public displays of affection, so I would suddenly yank my hands away from time to time, but I tried to work on it; I was needy and emotional during school and when I’m back home because of long distance, understandable, but I was on an emotional roller coaster during school and I miss her a lot in the summer; etc.) 

But another reason is because she also doesn’t want to hold me back. She has to take medications because of low blood clotting and really bad migraines because of stress and other related issues; and because of this, she told me she was told by doctors that she’ll have 20-30 years, infertile, slowly developing brain damage and if she bleeds from it at any time then will have only a 30% chance which will half if she makes it the first time.
Regardless of all the illnesses and things I went though, she makes me really happy. I will still dream of a future together and would treat her the same way. I will do everything I can to help her and just live in the moment every day. I mean, no job is 100% safe, and it’s not really fun not utilizing every day to its max potential. I’m still currently a student, but after I get a job in the same province, things will get better. I know it will get better. She even believes I can work on my flaws and be a better person. But doesn’t want me to stress her out.

She’s my role model and my best friend. I really miss her and want her back. Is there anything I can do or say to her?

---   
**tl;dr**: My relationship with my Best Friend / Ex-Girlfriend is falling apart due to stress and other problems. But she knows and I know that I can fix those problems. Is there anything I can say or do for her? 

Any and all advice and comments are appreciated. If more information is needed, I will try my best to provide it. Thank you.

4wydxh,15,2016-08-09,Seattle CS Job Tips,DittoLuck4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4wydxh/seattle_cs_job_tips/,"I'm looking for a first entry level job in CS. Actually I've been looking for several months now, both at internships and full time jobs in Seattle. I'm local and have progressed to the near end of my degree from university. 

But the amount of replies I've received is 1, and it didn't translate into an interview because they wanted more experience. I've been offered interviews in Chicago and North Carolina, but I turned them down because I figured that Seattle has more than enough vacancies. Still nothing and I'm pretty stressed/discouraged because I would expect the interview itself to be the hardest part of finding a position.

At this point I'm continuing by education by reading through my previous course books and going through GitHub to make some contributions.

I've gone through resume/cover letter/interview help from my school and while I've received some advice, I've been told that my presentation of information, 3.2 GPA, and my past leadership experience is very good. But a minus is that I went to a mediocre CS program in state that wasn't at UW or WSU.

Has anyone had this same issue here? Should I think of getting a job elsewhere or a Masters degree from a better school and come back?"

Met some quite nice people there and had to occasionally work night shift. Hovever, this night I was in charge of shutting down the equipment, wiping it down, and turning off the lights with a friend of mine there named John. Everything goes normal until I get to the gym room with the treadmills and and bikes. I go in there and about 1/4 of the way through, I get a cold feeling on the back of my neck. I shake it off as it just being the air conditioning. I continue as normal and just as I'm about to finish shutting the last five or six machines down for the night, I see a figure out of the corner of my eye. I turn around and see a male in his mid to late 20's standing by the water fountains. I tell that the place is closed and to go get John downstairs to unlock the doors for him. He just stands there motionless. I continue doing my business. I finish up and tell him again to leave. No Answer. At this point I just think he's just trying to fuck with me so I walk up to him and attempt to point him towards the elevators. I get this weird vibe from him, for he seems so dead inside, and is pale white. Brushing it off as just a weird guy. I try to get his attention by grabbing his arm, but my hand goes thru him, the air being cold and lifeless. I am now officially freaked out and I run out of there and back downstairs to John. Knowing him well and him having worked there for a while, I attempt to explain the story to him. He doesn't believe me and I bring him upstairs to show him. The gym in empty, not a soul in sight. He plays it off as me trying to fuck with him and asks me if that's everything. I tell him yes and we lock up for the night. I to this day still have no idea what happened in there but I do know for a fact that I saw something in that gym with me. I quit a few days later."
4wynr7,2,2016-08-09,"Should i pursue the only available professional direction, even though i dont like it?",DagonHord,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4wynr7/should_i_pursue_the_only_available_professional/,"First of all, i must say that i dont live in US. My country is in economic crisis right now, so everyone is really struggling here when it comes to work.

I am 23 years old guy and i found myself stuck in career dead-end because i made a lot of stupid decisions in my past and havent done a lot of things that i should have. It started with my school education - i failed almost all exams and got myself into one of the worst institutes in whole city (analogue of american college). It actually gave me good education and journalism degree, but the name of this institute has no value whatsoever, nobody among employers knows the name of this institute. 

While i was studying there i didnt do anything that might have helped me to search for a job in a future. I should have working in institute newspaper or taking an internship in some real newspaper or online-media. Instead i accepted invitation of my friend and began working in real-estate agency. At first i thought that it would be like a temporary thing. It seemed like a good option because i had to continue studying and it was part-time job and very easy. Believe it or not, but part-times jobs here are very rare, so it looked like a sweet deal. 

It was 4 years ago and i still work there. It has nothing to do with my education. This job is so stupid and easy that literally almost any 5-grade kid can do it. I basically change numbers in advertisements all day long and write simplest texts like ""This 2-room flat is located here...it has a balcony and combine WC...there is a pack of furniture..."". But it happens seldom, most of the time i just change numbers. If a price of certain flat goes up or down, my job is to change it on every website that has our advertisements. 

Needless to say, i came to hating this job. I stayed because of few reasons:

1. I like sleeping at morning. My working day starts very late.
2. Most of the time i actually dont work. Instead i pretend to work, while in reality i write a novel, learn languages or read educational books. If i had to do this job 100 % of my working time, i would lose my mind very fast because this job is soul-killing.
3. It is close to my home, i can get to office in 50 minutes
4. My friend, who invited me there, is still around sometimes. Its nice to hang out with him when he comes to work.

So, all past 1.5 years i have been actively searching for another job. During this time i realized one simple thing - the only available career path for me is copywriting in real estate. Basically, its the same job that i do right now, but on more serious level, where i should write about big apartment complexes instead of flats. 

Problem is - i hate real estate. Its hard to make up more boring and annoying topic to write about. I dont want to write about real estate for the rest of my life. But it seems like its my only available option because nobody will ever (ever) hire me anywhere else because i dont have any work experience. The only work experience that i have is real estate copywriting and it opens me the only road that leads forward. 

I would rather work as a journalist. But current economic situation caused a lot of media to close or forced them to live under constant thread of shutting down. They cant afford to employ anyone but very experienced people. I tried to write single items on various topics and showing them to the employers, but they never even bother to reply. They are not interested in anybody who has no actual work experience. If i was 18 yeas old once again, i would go for internship, but now, when im almost 24, i cant afford to live for even one month without money, i need to support my basic needs. So, there is no way to i will ever become a journalist, even though i have the journalism degree.

Tomorrow and day after tomorrow i will go to two different job interviews. They both are big real estate companies who seek copywriters. I have decent chance to successfully lang a position in one of them. But if i do it, i feel like there is no turning back - i will be STUCK in real estate sphere for the rest of my life. Basically, it will be my destiny - to work everyday on something that i dont like at all. Should i go for it?

The concept of ""everyone should have a job that he likes"" and ""job should be a second jobby"" doesnt exist in my country. My mother tells me to shut up and go for it, even if i will hate it. Just for money, she says. But whats the point of this money, if i will be miserable everyday? She tells me - you are miserable now anyway. She is right, but only partly - i am miserable only when i actually work, but most of the time, like i said, im working on my novel at this office. But nevertheless, she is right about money - i earn so little that i even ashamed to say the number. I have to think about my future here. With current job i will be almost free, but i will never afford anything good in life. With new job in real estate i probably will afford much more things, but i will be much more miserable. 

So what should i do?

After watching [his sob story here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLaU2ConUFs) (oops he's made it private now in the last hour since this was posted) that seems to have convinced a handful of redditors / youtubers of his innocence it looks like I need to explain this situation further. He made [an essay of a reddit post](http://archive.is/NDGNr) explaining how what he paid on the burning Viewfinder and his entire excuse for giving nearly 2/5ths value for a 3,500 key item is that ""trading has changed in 2 years."" And then claimed he never's manipulated anyone or sharked anyone in his life. Well, anyone who knows unusual trading can refute that claim right off the bat, high tier unusual trading is about the same as it has been in the last 2 years and even though he claims ""I personally value this View at 2500"" we can see right here on another Venom thread [from same2me](http://imgur.com/a/J6BlL), another high tier trader, that claim is pure bullshit. But here's where the cat comes flying out of the bag - I actually got access to his personal discord server today and have screenshots of him admitting to all kindsa lies, including that [he JUST sold the Burning Viewfinder for 3000 pure keys.](http://i.imgur.com/uCSEWiM.png?1) So much for that rant about values, you reddit pleabs who ""have no knowledge on high tier trading nor how it is done"".

But as for more examples of manipulation that he claims he doesn't do and the sharking he's never done, [here's an example of how he constantly gets help from his friends to convince new unboxers that their hats are worth less.](http://imgur.com/a/Tp4rw) Note that the unusual being mentioned on this unboxer's wall is a Scorching L'homme which has [an active price suggestion](http://backpack.tf/suggestion/57a34ca28667471a171119a6) for, you guessed it, $300. Quite a bit more than him and his posse's claims that it's worth ""less than 100 keys"" a number I'm sure they wished they could have claimed to be lower but didn't want to be too obvious when someone showed up to tell the unboxer the real value.

He also constantly tries to manipulate new unboxers into not trading with anyone else and tries to twist the story that those who are trying to help them are the actual sharks. [Here's him admitting](http://imgur.com/a/Sud6Z) to doing this to a new unboxer when [Business Sloth went to help protect them](http://imgur.com/a/y2R81). 

He also once [paid a content creator to change an item to all-class then bragged about it on his wall.](http://imgur.com/a/23PtR) A hat (federal casemaker) that he collected the unusual god tiers for very cheap. He was [given a direct confirmation email from the item creator from TF2 dev's themselves](http://imgur.com/a/96uuE) that the item was going all-class which he then denied and actually said I did lol [1.](http://imgur.com/a/Qrj3u)[ 2.](http://imgur.com/a/WNN0H)

* The Beams one he paid [around 300 keys for](http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198097412213#!/compare/1461888000/1462060800) literally days before it went all-class but alas [he resold it for 1,000 keys in a bulk trade just days later.](http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198097412213#!/compare/1463011200/1463097600) So there goes his whole ""I'm just a collector I cherish them"" thing lol.  

* [And here's the Scorching Casemaker](http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198040933831#!/compare/1463529600/1463875200) he grabbed **AFTER it was made all-class** (went all class on May 11th). Literally sharking. He paid using backpack.tf prices (~200 keys) then he turned around and [resold it for 700 keys in pure / aussies](http://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198097412213#!/compare/1463961600/1464134400) just a few days later.

[He said literally days ago](http://imgur.com/a/p2AM2) he was a shark and that he was simply more intelligent than other traders and sharking is justified because it's ""hard work"". He always go back and forth about [whether he does or doesn't shark](http://imgur.com/a/0nWU8) and unfortunately, because no one else is really keeping up with his crappy sobs stories and excuses they think he might be genuinely a victim or they're simply his friends he's bribed / memed into sticking up for him. He adds and attempt to shark **every single decent hat unboxed** by a relatively new unboxer, and even if they're fairly well versed in trading he at least adds them to ""congratulate them"" AKA test the waters. 

He magically has people post for him all over reddit / bp.tf forums and other places he's actually banned from and gets them to brigade people's walls when he gets into shout matches with them or wants to shark them. He also uses alts to continue using backpack.tf premium as well as to brigade posts / make fake comments - here he is bragging about it TODAY [1.](http://imgur.com/a/FgegD) [2.](http://imgur.com/a/5rFiW) on his personal discord server. His ""I'm a victim"" video hit reddit 3 times yesterday from low activity reddit accounts and yet he only has 20 subscribers - I'm sure that totally happened organically /s. And the ""[Sharks video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwesftIGiLM)"" that was up on reddit yesterday featuring him, wayne, rick james, and a few others was - oh what's that? completely under the directions of [Venom himself](http://imgur.com/a/wIjLh). All this brigading makes sense when you see this quote from him the other day ""[I've already hired interns who do my trading now due to how much of a fuss you've all been making.](http://imgur.com/a/hyta6)""

Everything he says is bullshit and he always has a small army of useful idiots ready to back him up / help him manipulate. I'm certain if I spent more time combing through his backpack I would find dozens of more examples of him sharking. All of these examples are just within the last few months. It's unfortunate that anyone takes him seriously but he's playing on audiences like youtube / reddit not knowing enough to prove him wrong and he loves the thrill of winning people over through lies. Now he has some bullshit sob story about his family and cancer or something - sorry I couldn't even stomach watching but a few minutes of it so IDK what all he says. A SteamRep ban would be nice, but I understand they don't ban sharks, but I think an exception would be warranted here.

----

**LOOK HERE for the REAL PSA** This post isn't to further any sort of witch hunt. I am only posting it here because of the false claims that were originally pushed on /r/tf2 and I want to simply say that rather than turning pitch forks against ANY specific individuals that instead we should simply use this as an example of why it's good to be proactive in protecting new unboxers from the hordes of manipulators who will stop at nothing to acquire their shiney pixels. If you see a new unboxer in a server or trading site, or if you are using backpack.tf premium and notice something nice come up on an account that's relatively new to trading, please do not hesitate to warn them of the sharks and scammers who are likely to come after them. Point them towards backpack.tf and their forums as a good starting point on how to protect themselves so they don't end up falling for a scam or shark. Thanks!"

Right now i am 20 years old, and am going into my fourth year of a 4 year undergrad program in commerce. The school i attend is a top  institution in the world, with the program i am in being a very competitive school and highly desired school to get into, 6000+ usually apply per year, only around 300-400 are accepted. However, i have always been that ""kid"" who always managed to succeed with minimal to no work- i hardly ever did any homework in high school and achieved straight A's, getting me into this program. In university right now, i don't really do any readings or anything, just pay a little bit of attention to lectures and study a few days before tests, and i am in the top 20% of students in GPA. The program is not time intensive, its only around 12-13 hours of class time a week, with around a 30-40 minute commute back and forth.


After my first year, i got an internship through a family member at a very large and well known insurance company, and i worked there for roughly two and a half months with no real issues (i was bored sometimes at work, but i was mostly doing boring jobs with the occasional interesting business/client looking for insurance). Although near the end i kind of had a panic attack (mainly because i realized my internship was over and i was returning to school, and second year is touted as a notoriously difficult year of my program). 
Fast forward two years later (i did not work during the summer after my second year-i took summer courses to get ahead instead.) and i got another internship from the same family member at a smaller, small-mid sized company in insurance as well. I was looking forward to starting the job, making some money, and having some fun. I was a little nervous before my first day just because i didn't know what to expect.

When i got to the job, i had a quick little tour and meet and greet and a quick rundown of the business the company is in, what we do, what other companies we work with, etc. During this period, i felt fine. After this was over, they showed me my desk and i sat down. I had hardly no work given to me, just basically input 3 numbers into an excel spreadsheet for my first day. I basically had to pretend i was doing work for the rest of the 6 hours of the day, due to the office being completely open (there are no cubicles, more like open desks where my boss would sit in front of me). At the end of the day, i basically went full emo panic mode and had an existential crisis of what is the point of living, do i even like my degree, is this really what its going to be like after i graduate. I just felt like at the end of the day i only have 6 more hours until i have to go to sleep, and feel miserable like yesterday all over again. I tried to cheer myself up by doing the things i loved to do before, such as playing video games or playing guitar, and it just gave me no enjoyment at all, and the only thing i could think about was working tomorrow. I talked to my parents about it and they were kind of dumbfounded and mad, considering for the past 20 years of my life they always expected me to succeed with flying colours at everything i've done based on my past results. They convinced me to go back for the second day. I was anxious literally 24 hours a day, had literally 0 appetite due to being so anxious and panicky, and couldn't sleep at all. My dad said he would meet me for lunch tomorrow downtown because he was down there as well for meetings. I spent the second day there again with no work, just pretending i was working until lunch. I talked to my dad about it over lunch and he said to just talk to my boss and say i wasn't feeling well and would like to go home which i did, and my boss completely understood.

Needless to say when i got home i remained panicky and anxious, couldn't eat and i explained to my parents i can't handle this, being like this all day makes me feel the worst i have ever been in my entire life. They were mad, but at the end they said if this truly makes you this upset and miserable just call them and say you made a mistake and would like to just return to school. I did so and returned to school. I have always been kind of an anxious person, but never constantly depressed all day or constantly anxious. I did kind of go through this thing when i graduated high school, i was worried/panicky that this program was too hard and i would fail and be called a failure, just overall nervous in general about university, but after a few weeks at university i started liking it and realized it wasn't the ""oh no one cares about you in university and they will just hammer you with impossible tests"" speech that my high school teachers gave me.

Ever since then, i haven't been able to truly shake this feeling of anxiety post grad, when the inevitable work life happens. I feel anxious from when i wake up, till about 5-6PM when all of a sudden i feel fine and motivated, and its like i almost WANT to go back to that job and im motivated to work, even if its the most boring thing in the entire world, as long as i am getting paid for it. I have this constant fear through the day that my life is coming to and end when i graduate, and i'm going to be completely miserable 24/7/365 once i start working and i'm never going to have free time to enjoy myself. I feel like i'm going to be so overwhelmed with work that ill never be the same person i used to be. During my first 3 years of school i never had any doubts that i cant do this for the rest of my life, or i hate this program. Of course there were some business courses i didn't enjoy, but there were also some i found interesting. During my first job it never really crossed my mind that i'm not sure if this is what i want to do. I mean i had boring days (i was mostly doing menial work such as spreadsheet data entry and sorting files), but it didn't bother me a ton. I don't know why i got through my first job but couldn't get through this one, but a few observations i have was

- the first company was large and had a well developed intern program with another university, so they knew how to deal with/transition students into working. They knew how to run an internship program properly i guess.

- the second job was much a much smaller company and they were just developing their internship program. My boss did tell me on my first day that they had another summer intern who quit after two weeks. They didn't really onboard me the way the first company did, they gave me a quick rundown and then just threw me at my desk with nothing to work on. My boss was pretty much always concerned with his own work, and seemed like he forgot about me/forgot to check up on me.

- There wasn't really anyone my age to socialize with/be friends with. My first job had other summer interns from other universities that were the same age as me, and i felt like they were my friends. Everyone here was much older, the youngest probably being late 30's, with some in their 40's-50's. Although everyone there was really nice (no complaints about the people being mean or abusive or controlling).

- commuting really took a toll on me. I did take the subway for my first job as well (they essentially in the same location), but early in the morning the subway is busy as hell, hot inside, and takes a long time. My first job i did faint one morning on the subway (probably a mixture of exhaustion, standing up for and hour straight, the sweltering heat inside the subway because the A/C isn't working, and having my arm above my head for two hours holding onto a bar.)

I'm not sure why i can't shake this feeling, i've told myself it's just one job, every job is different, and i've done this before, i can do it again. I've also told myself that maybe i will grow to enjoy it, i mean at the end of my first internship i didn't really want to go back to school. I just always feel like there is some sort of impending doom on my mind. My friend took a job at another firm and said he had the same experience his first two weeks of being bored all day, feeling like work is eternity but he said he started to enjoy it 2-3 weeks in and says its way better than going back to school."

4wz1rh,2,2016-08-09,How is person with Asperger syndrome as a roommate/tenant?,blue_ag_silv,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/4wz1rh/how_is_person_with_asperger_syndrome_as_a/,"

Although I have years of experience living with other people in the house, I never had any experience with living with a person with Asperger. I live in 3 bedroom with one another roommate, looking for the third person.

I got contact by one person who seems very good at taking care of himself. His email was very concise and polite. He gave me some information about him, and he showed me that he has good GPA and good work history for a college student. From just looking at his resume/history, he seems like a honor student, who also work as interns during summer. To me, it seems his very diligent and knows how to take care of oneself. Everything looks good, but he explicitly said in the email that he has Asperger Syndrome.  

Thus, I am wondering how it will be like to live with him.

I am no means a perfect roommate, I try to be best possible. But I do have some rules that I want people to follow. Basically, I stress that shared space to be cleaned and restored after use. Additionally, quietness during the night is a must so people can sleep and wake up at 6am for work. I try to avoid micromanaging people so I like to give freedom as long as big rules are followed.

Biggest worry I have is that, I myself rely a lot on people taking cues from me. I don't like to call out person for not cleaning, making that person feel embarrassed what not. I try to be polite and avoid conflict at all cost. I want the roommate to be considerate and not test my boundary. Thus it seems that my tendency might not be a good fit for the person with Asperger. But I just learned out about Asperger via 15min of research on Wikipedia.

I have yet to meet him in person, so my worries might be unwarranted.
Are my worries overblown?"

I am moving to Den Haag tomorrow for a 5 month internship at the ICTY. I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of some good gyms in the city to check out.

I'm willing to spend a lot for a decent gym with good equipment and not too many crowds. Google maps and yelp have not been too helpful with my search, and a lot of gyms' websites are not very informative, so a local's knowledge would be much appreciated! :)"

I just got an awesome internship offer at a creative agency that I've been harassing for months, and so I wanted to take some time to reflect on all the things I'm definitely not going to miss about this job. The internship is unpaid, that's how ready I am to get out of hospitality. It's been a fun ride, friends, thanks for all you do.

***

**1)** *guest approaches desk*

Me: ""Hi there! What can I do for you?""

Sharon: ""Mullins. M-U-L-L-I-N-S.""

Me: *downgrades room*

This is the south. Pleasantries aren't simply appreciated; they're a requirement. Answer the question first by saying something like, ""Hello, I'd like to check in, please.""

**2)** Does our website say we have a shuttle? How about a bar? How about our rates and availability for the days that you're looking to travel? Oh, that's right, you wouldn't know because you Googled our phone number and decided to call me, rather than Googling our website and finding all the answers to your sophomoric questions therein.

**3)** Do I look like I want to sell you Diet Pepsi and hummus that you're going to insist on paying cash for? As you can most likely tell by the way I'm glaring at you as you walk catty-corner to my desk into that market, which is the bane of my existence, by the way, you can likely conclude: probably not. The market is there because our brand standards say it has to be, not to provide you the convenience of a wide array of overpriced food, beverage, and sundries at your fingertips. That's the job of the grocery store just up the street, for which I have a direction card that I'm just dying to hand you. Walk. Away.

**4)** You'd like the military rate? Sure, I'll be happy to charge you the $165 military rate instead of our $149 regular rate. And no, I absolutely do not care that you're retired military, nor do I care if you're a Costco member or have AARP. Join AAA or turn 62, and then book your reservation online.

**5)** Me: ""Thank you for calling [hotel brand], my name is ES24, how may I assist you?""

Pesky guest: ""Reservations, please.""

Me: *jumps for joy - green light to outsource call to Central Reservations*

**6)** Me: ""Thank you for calling [hotel brand], my name is ES24, how may I assist you?""

Sharon: ""Hi, I think I left my phone charger in room 626, can you check and see if anyone found it?""

Me: ""Sure, let me place you on a brief 1-2 minute hold while I check with housekeeping.""

*browses Reddit for 1-2 minutes*

Me: ""Thank you so much for holding. Unfortunately, nothing that matches that description has been turned in, but can I take down a good contact number for you in case it turns up?""

**7)** Oh, you declined housekeeping service today, but you want me to bring you 5 sets of towels, toilet paper, shampoo, conditioner, and empty your trash? You're so not getting those 250 bonus points for refusing stayover service. Good day, sir.

**8)** Yes, I'd be delighted to provide you with a safe deposit box. Want to access it twelve times today? No problem. I'm just killing you in my head in several very creative and well thought out ways, but no problem, I'd be delighted to get down on my knees twelve. fucking. times. so that housekeeping doesn't steal those diamond studs that, honey, we all know you got from H&amp;M.

**9)** Sorry, no, I don't know where breakfast is served, what time breakfast ends, or what time checkout is. But you would know, had you listened to me when I checked you in.

**10)** No, you can't have a late checkout, a bridge view room, or oxygen, because you booked on Expedia. Oh, and room type is ""subject to availability"" with third party bookings. Since I'm oversold on double queen rooms, I've had to bump your family of five to a one king suite, which is probably a fire hazard, so I hope you have good insurance."
4x019f,1,2016-08-09,Which sort of ANOVA analysis option is best for this repeated-measures design? Is it valid to split up the analysis?,Lucy7328,AskStatistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/4x019f/which_sort_of_anova_analysis_option_is_best_for/,"I’m hoping you can shed some light on how best to analyse the data as explained here. 

Whilst I feel a bit intimidated asking this to stats experts, as they say, it's better to ask then remain silent. I'm a research assistant intern and I've just wrapped up an experiment, but am now uncertain about the best way to proceed with the data analysis.

About my experimental design: I have done a within-subject repeated measures design. Participants’ reaction times were tested before and after either Treatment, or before and after Placebo, on 3 different stimuli. That is, each subject was their own control (took part in both conditions), and each instance we’re looking at 3 outcomes. I need to look at if there are significant differences in reaction times for the 3 different stimuli before treatment, after treatment – and also if there are differences between the 3 before and after treatment. The same thing for looking between the 3 before control, after control, and comparing before and after control.

So I’m looking at:

(1) Differences in reaction times for the 3 stimuli in each of the four: pre-treatment, post-treatment, pre-placebo, post-placebo

(2) Differences in reaction times before and after treatment for each of the 3 stimuli, to see if reaction times changed more compared ine one to the other stimuli before and after treatment. 

The same thing for Placebo

(3) Comparing reaction times across treatment and placebo conditions

(4) I’d also like to see the effects of two different participants groups: i.e., if gender had an effect
What is the best way to go about this?

For (1), would it be ok just to do a one-way ANOVA comparing the 3 mean reaction times for each of the 4 measured time points individually? And then do a post-hoc test to see which of the 3 differ at each point? Alternatively, is it wiser to look at percentage change in treatment compared to placebo for each of the 3 stimuli – and then just be comparing the 3 stimuli in treatment, and then again in control conditions?

For (2),(3) and (4), is it best to do a multifactor ANOVA? If so, how would this be set out?

I am thinking the below are my possible options. Please let me know if I am off the mark with any of these, and which would be best to go about this:

Option A: Perform a multi-factor ANOVA, something like: 2(gender group)x3(stimuli)x4(pre-treatment, post-treatment,pre-control, post-control)

Option B: Perform a more simple ANOVA, looking at percentage change in either treatment or placebo conditions: 2(gender) x 3(stimuli) x 2(treatment and control, percentage change in each)

Option C: Test treatment condition and placebo condition separately

So look at the 3 stimuli reaction times, before and after treatment, with gender as a covariate

And then again, look at the 3 stimuli reaction times, before and after placebo, with gender as a covariate

And see if one versus the other produced significant results. Is this valid? Or am I 'missing out' by not directly comparing the two, given that these were the same participants in each?

Am I even on the right lines on thinking of different iterations of an ANOVA here, or should I be using something different? Is it ok to ‘split up’ the above testing a certain way?

I would really appreciate you help. I’m new to doing anything beyond simple t-test comparisons or simple one-way ANOVAs, so I’ve been doing a lot of reading, but couldn’t find anything that was analogous to the situation I have – so I’m concerned about going about analysis in a way would be inappropriate. That's why I've set out my potential options as I see them, and would very much appreciate your feedback and advice on how best to go about this. Thank you all very much in advance.

**Edit**: Just to clarify the study design:

All participants underwent both the treatment and placebo conditions. Their reaction times were measured before treatment and after treatment, as well as before and after placebo.

At each of these 4 testing sessions (pre-and-post treatment, and pre-and-post control), participants' reaction times were measured in response to 3 visual stimuli. I'd like to see if response times between these 3 visual stimuli differed at each testing session, and also between the four test sessions - before and after treatment/placebo, and across treatment and placebo conditions. I'd also like to identify if gender had any effect on this. 

There were 20 participants in the study, who each underwent the 4 testing sessions. Genders, however, were quite unbalanced (14 females, and 6 males).

4x0bxj,7,2016-08-09,Out of state tuition - is there another option?,ihavenodefiningpoint,VirginiaTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/4x0bxj/out_of_state_tuition_is_there_another_option/,"Hey guys, I just wanted to share my story from this past year in hopes that it might help one/some of you with college expenses. TL;DR Took a year off to declare residency in VA for in-state tuition. I know, not groundbreaking news, but some people might not have known it is an option. 

First off, I grew up in VA through high school. The summer after I graduated, my family moved to Washington (state) and I went with them (not knowing that I'd want to be a hokie). I attended community college out west for 8 months, but really disliked it. I knew that I wanted to transfer, and back to a Virginia university because a. I love Virginia/have friends and family here and b. (long story short) I have a good scholarship for in-state-VA tuition. So, I applied and was admitted to VT. Now, since I was living in WA at the time of my application, they assumed I was an out-of-state student, BUT since I had lived out there for less than a year (and had lived in VA my whole life before that), my dad fought long and hard to classify me as an in-state student. Well, he won, but they promised me I'd be out of state after that first year expired.

\&gt;summer comes, stay in blacksburg to work    
\&gt;weeks before classes start, status changed to out of state    
\&gt;Awkward Moment Seal.png    

Alright, that was a little longer than it needed to be, but you get the idea. My status was changed to out-of-state, which meant I would need to pay an *additional* $9,000 a semester to attend college in the fall. So, i decided (after some research) to take a year off. 

According to what I heard and read, the two major requirements that they looked for were a. that I was not a student for a year and b. that I paid 51% of my expenses. This meant I couldn't take any classes, or be in a co-op (student status still), but still had to live in VA. And, I was already signed into a lease. Sooo I looked for a job, and with some luck and the help of my girlfriend at the time, landed an internship. That's beside the point, though, the point is, I was paying taxes to Virginia and ""paying 51% of my expenses."" 

A quick aside, [here is the VT website](http://www.admiss.vt.edu/apply/residency/) that lists all the criteria that they look for when you apply for in-state tuition. [here](http://www.registrar.vt.edu/documents/va_eligibility.pdf) is more general information, and [here](http://www.registrar.vt.edu/academic_records/in-state/residency-information.html) is where you get the actual application form if you are changing your status from out of state to in state. You can reapply before every semester, so if you don't get it spring semester, you can reapply for fall semester in-state later that year. 

So, I worked for a year, and did my best to be a good ~~sheeple~~ resident of VA: got the license (again), registered to vote, bought a car/registered it in VA, paid taxes, had a lease here, paid bills at that address, etc, etc. As my year working was coming to a close, I began looking at the application, and realized one major issue I may have was the fact that I am assumed a dependent of my parents. That is, I am under 24, not married, not enlisted, not an orphan, not a grad student. But, there's hope! Because by having my parents *not* claim me dependent on their taxes, and by filing my own taxes in VA, I was still able to declare independence/get residency in VA. As of now, I am listed as in-state for the fall semester 2016 and signed up for classes!

So, if you made it this far and are interested in this process, there is hope for you! Looking back I think the biggest things they looked at were 1. was I in school? 2. did I live in VA? 3. did my parents claim me on their taxes? and 4. did I work in VA/pay taxes here. I also tracked my income and expenses for the year, and submitted a spreadsheet with that information on it, but they didn't ask for proof (which I had) so I don't think that was as big of a consideration. 

My application consisted of: Residency Application, a spreadsheet of income, a spreadsheet of expenses, VA license recipt, voter registration, VA tax return 2015, federal tax return 2015, bank statements for past 2 years, lease agreements for past two years, and pay stubs from my jobs I've held over the past year. 

Anyway, that's my story, and if you have any other questions feel free to leave a comment/pm and I'll try to help out as best I can. Good luck! go hokies!

I feel like such a horrible person and I just need to work my thoughts out to the void because I don't think I have anyone to talk to and I don’t know if I even want advice. Just need to feel like I have somewhere to put this that isn't my own head. I'm entirely estranged from my born again christian parents for being a lesbian -that's fine, that's their choice- but I'm better off as my father physically and emotionally abused me my whole life. Manipulated me with guilt/blame and I feel like it's royally messed me up for the rest of my life. I've lost all friends since college started because of anxiety and my only remaining friend is my girlfriend; who's causing my problems. That's just background though... sorry.
I'm 20 years old, currently live about 100 miles from my girlfriend and we've been together for 5 years.We see each other only during school-year breaks as I do not have anywhere to stay near her or my town. In high school we lived about 40 minutes apart and both commuted to a school, so we saw each other every day, but only about once every few months out of school. (She gets overwhelmed leaving the house too often) Things were great for the first couple of years we knew each other when she pulled me from a suicidal funk and I helped her with her anxiety. It was all uphill, I've never been good at making friends and she said no one had ever stopped and taken the time to listen to her. I felt so insanely blessed to have found one person who understood me so wholly.  We were never affectionate but we talked about our life together and how we were going to make each others dreams come true. When we hit 10th grade we slowly worked into a grey area and into girlfriend status. This didn’t really change our relationship, even physically, and we’ve been together since. We're both in college for our respective goals and neither of us could have done it without the support we gave each other that was not offered to us from our parents or friends.
However, things were a little weird sometimes through high school. She needed constant companionship over skype and would get incredibly depressed when I couldn't talk 24/7 to go to church/food shopping/cleaning/etc. If my family went away on vacation (which she couldn't afford but refused to join me and my family as she can’t stand crowds/noises/leaving the house for more than few hours at a time/using public restrooms or eating and drinking in public) she would get incredibly angry that I was having experiences that she didn't. Also, we were both straight A students but I was valedictorian of my small class. I will admit that this was unfair because learning is naturally easy for me and I know I’m incredibly lucky for this. It led me to get honors she wanted before her and to be given a superlative she wanted desperately. She would constantly ask what I got for grades on everything and would beat herself up over it if I did better than her (I'm very shy and wouldn't ever tell someone my scores for fear of upsetting them but she would take things from my bag and then complain that I was hiding things). She constantly put herself down and told me how inferior she felt to me and how she often felt like an accessory to me and not a separate person. We could always work this out. 
The trouble really started in college. Over the summer, I got an internship with Harvard. She hated me for it and despised the fact that she didn't do anything significant compared to me that summer. Again, I would never brag about it or point it out, I still talked to her every day, and tried to comfort her to no avail. At some point I asked if she was mad about it and she said she was very mad, she loved me, but a part of her would never stop hating me for that. She reminds me of that to this day.
She went to the prestigious school of her dreams and I went to a community college I hated because its all I could afford once my parents kicked me out for being gay when her parents told mine about our relationship. I thought maybe that would give her a confidence booster that she was in such a better place but she still complains about how worthless and useless she is compared to me. She is busy every day working towards her dream job and comes home to me so happy to talk about her day, until, as always, she’ll take a nosedive and suddenly begin sending pages of text about how I made her feel like shit in high school and how it's only festered in her since then and how every little thing i say brings up all the horrible feelings I’ve inflicted on her. I’ve taken honors classes all through college and she tells me how stupid I make her feel because her major doesn’t offer honors classes. She tells me that my work study and my lab internships are ten times more interesting to her and how she must mean nothing to me because I have all these independent experiences without her. How my life must be so incredibly interesting and how she’s just a waste of life. How if I really loved her I would quit work so I can talk to her all day and all night about how disappointing her life is while she ignores my advice. She refuses to listen to me anymore and will ignore praise/advice and just ignore all her responsibilities to mope. She refuses to go to therapy because she thinks the government will keep records on her and refuses to take medication because she's afraid of drugs. College took a very bad toll on me and I’ve been battling depression again. I’ve been taking medication but cannot also afford therapy. It’s been severly taking away from my time and ability to help her with her own issues. This is especially terrible because she ignores the help her family and friends offer her because they don’t know her as well as me and only wants to complain to me and blame me for all her problems while I roll over because I don’t want to be another person in her life that doesn't understand. I feel like I’m absolutely ruining her life, in every way possible. Still, since we talk so many hours of the day we still get along and laugh together about 85% of the time. Whenever we argue she reminds me how much she loves me and how she's been planning our future together and all the dreams we've dreamed up together about our future. How she’s so lucky to have me there for her for the long run.
But, at the end of the day, she’s always pissed at me and herself and tells me how little I must mean to her even though I tell her how important she is and how I imagine us together in the future. I’ve mentioned taking a break if I’m bothering her so much and she says I’m ruining her life, but she still can’t imagine a future without me. She says I should just break up with her since she makes my life horrible by being such a bother but she could never break up with me and it will probably drive her to total self destruction if I DO ever break it off; but still, “I should do it if its best for me”. I’m so so worried about what's best for her that I’ve never broken up with her, I just want to make her feel better. However, as much as I want to stick around and make sure she's happy and life works for her and spend my time with her, I feel very abused and manipulated… but I can’t tell if its my fault or her fault because my past experiences have confused me about blame and responsibility and give and take.
I question myself every day. Should I have not given everything my all in high school and college? I feel like I did everything I possibly could for her besides throwing my life in the gutter to make her feel better about herself. If I really loved her shouldn’t I be able to be that selfless? Am I being abusive and ruining her life?? I can’t stand to think that I’m doing that to someone because I know what it feels like.

So, I don’t know what to even think at this point. Thanks for letting me work out my thoughts and throw it into the void of the internet, Reddit. Maybe I’ll figure it out soon.

4x0l33,167,2016-08-10,Use Conversational Unpredictability to Your Advantage,DontBeFredo,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4x0l33/use_conversational_unpredictability_to_your/,"*TLDR:* After a man establishes his value to a girl, being different and unpredictable helps a lot to seal the deal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
**Story Time:** Last Thursday I went to a new place for a haircut because my old barber moved about 2,500 miles away. I had to attend a wedding on Saturday night and desperately needed a trim, so I took whatever appointment was available. Turns out it was with a woman who is by anyone's standards a solid 7, and was my type to a T, so I'd give her an 8. 

Background on me: I'm lean and extremely youthful looking for my age. I'm 27 and still get asked for identification at some places; it's the super high cheekbones. For reference, I'm built slightly like the actor Aaron Paul (Jesse from Breaking Bad). 

Given these physical traits, women are often comfortable around me, but if I don't hold frame or show value quickly, I'll get passed over for much bigger Chad right quick. 

Anyhow, I go to the appointment after work (In NYC), so I'm in a button down shirt and nice pair of pants. We'll call the hairstylist Jackie. Jackie asks how my day is, and I think she's trying to decide if I'm a local intern or a big boy worker. I can sense some potential attraction so I try to establish frame quickly: I happen to work for a consulting firm, and tell her some presentation I put on for the client earlier in the day. 

Of course she's slightly more interested now - I'm a decent looking guy, and now she knows I'm not pimple-faced frat boy working for daddy's PE firm for the summer. 

*This is where I implement what I consider to be the lesson of this story*: Now that value is established and she knows I have a job of some societally perceived status, I use the next part of the conversation to avoid being *that guy*; that guy that only talks about work, his coworkers, his promotions, basically doing everything but telling the woman *yeah I make a lot of money, therefore you should sleep with me*. Instead, I try to be a little unpredictable and quirky.

Jackie asks how the rest of my day went, which I assume is typical hairstylist talk. I mention to her that I did a fair amount of research, out of boredom and curiosity, on ice-cream men and how to own an ice cream truck (which is true, only that I did it over the weekend instead). She is taken off guard...I'm sure she expected her new client (me) - likely as most of her corporate clients do - to talk about work, or what awesome connections I have in the city (I don't...I have exactly zero connections). But instead, I tell her that North Jersey has approximately 4x more licensed ice cream trucks than the average city. 

So for the rest of cut we talked about ice cream, and pretend plans to drive an ice cream truck together if our respective careers didn't pan out. 

Her final remark was: ""it's been so long since I've actually gotten ice cream"". So I got her phone number (absolutely stab in the dark that she was single; she actually gave a good cut, making it a riskier move), promised we would get ice cream while intoxicated, and then proceeded to do so last night...she stayed the night and that was that. 

**Lessons**

* **Capitalize on luck -** a lot of things had to fall correctly for this to occur; Jackie had to be attractive, single (I suppose not, but it helps), and ask about my day. When life helps you out, capitalize on that shit. 

* **Establish value, then be unpredictable -** This could manifest itself in a bunch of social settings. But if I was some unemployed guy shedding insight on the ice cream truck industry, Jackie would think I'm a weirdo. Of course, this harps back to the fact that valuable, attractive people are seen in the best light regarding everything. But I suggest trying to be creative with this - dividends it might pay. Now, is talking about ice cream the most off-the-wall unpredictable thing ever? No. But I'd say it's more memorable and unique than the average conversation.
 
* **Adding to the last point, learn interesting things -** read books, listen to podcasts, travel to weird, underrated cities, get a hobby. Combining traditionally valuable features (like having a good job or dressing nice) with quirky lifestyles and nuggets of knowledge makes you much more desirable in my opinion.

* **Only give a little** - when a woman finds out that you have something - anything really - of value, she wants it more than anything else in the world. If you have a good job and that's all you got going for you, hint at it, then lock it away in the conversational closet. Keep her guessing. If you are built like a Greek God, wear a slimmer fitting shirt, but leave the rest to the woman's imagination. Women can sense try-hards, so find the balance between expressing value and maintaining mystery.

**The ultimate question to this FR:** Could I have said anything after establishing value to seal the deal? Eh, likely yes. But I truly believe talking about something atypical made everything more fluid and much easier to develop a connection leading to something more. "

So at the moment, I am laying down in my bed staring at the ceiling at 3:00am even though I have to get up at 7:30am to volunteer for an organization on my college campus. 

I've recently had reastless nights due to a shit ton of stress I've been having. This is the third night in a row that I've stayed up until 2:30 in the morning since there's so much shit that's been clustered in my mind. And every single day following I've had to get up at around 7:00am or so, so my days have tremendously long and insanely stressfull. 

To start off with things that have been in my mind, we'll start with my organization I'll be volunteering for tomorrow. 

So basically I'm a 20 year old guy who goes to a California University. About a year ago I decided to join a business fraternity on my campus thinking that getting involved in it would not only help me meet new people, but to also try and boost me further in life so I can learn real life skills for after college. Well... I'm a year into the fraternity, and I feel that even though I've meet people that I consider to be some of my closest friends I've ever made, I feel that I haven't learned much to advance me past college. I was so heavily involved in my fraternity the first semester, that I was unanimously elected into an officer position, which is the second highest position to attain behind President of our chapter. Now, I thought I would be happy to be in this position, but the main issue is that I don't even get paid for working in this fraternity. And on top of that, as stated before, I feel that I'm not learning many skills to give me an edge past college. Not only am I not learning skills though, but it seems like all the people that are in my fraternity are working on their own personal projects and are excelling in life, whereas Im being left in the dust by all my friends since I have yet attain an actual paying job. Instead of having a paying job, I'm stressing out over doing a year long job I don't even get paid for. Many of my friends are part of a business startup, and some are in multiple internships, whereas I'm just sitting here, and I feel like I'm doing nothing. 

Second thing that's been bothering me is a girl. 

One of the girls I've come across has honestly amazed me in every way. She is not only working on starting her own business, but is working 2 paid internships as well as going to college and maintaining a social life. We recently went out together on what wasn't an official ""date"" but I did ask if she wanted to go to a night market with me, which she happily agreed to. We spent the entire night together and learned more about eachother. I've actually known this girl for 7 months now so we know eachother fairly well at this point. Although, her friends are my friends as well, so most times that we socialize, it's in a group environment. So this was one of the few times where I got to spend time alone with her. The night though, was one that I can't ever forget. I've always known that she was amazing, but being able to be with her and laugh with her and have fun with her, made me realize that I have stronger feelings for his girl than I originally had though. The issue is though... That I feel like this girl is on a whole different level than I am. She does everything in life, whereas I'm stuck working in a job I don't get paid for, where I feel like I don't learn many real-world skills. I know she wants to be around me because I'm fun and always positive, since people have told me that's how my personality is. But to be honest, I've been stressing out if she could like me or if she just straight up has no intensions of going any further than a friendship.  

Thank you for reading my post anyone that got this far. 

TLDR: I haven't been sleeping because of stress. I feel like I'm in an organization that doesn't help me specifically grow. There's also a girl that I think is out of my league. "

My question is at what point should I start applying for jobs? Whenever I do apply should I apply entry level or even consider internships since I have no programming experience? Is it something that I should just start applying to and see what happens?

Thanks for the advice everyone!"

4x1xq0,4,2016-08-10,How does VR back-end development operate?,pakipowah,virtualreality,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/4x1xq0/how_does_vr_backend_development_operate/,"Hello! 

I am currently conducting some research for my internship on Virtual Reality. I am a little confused as to how the development side of VR works. 

I understand that, for example, a video game developer would of course write code for the PC-powered video game. In order for Virtual Reality technology to work, the ""goggles"" must be connected to the PC, correct? 

Now, will all VR Goggles work with this game? How does the compatibility work across the different goggles? Are they all the same? Do game developers need to take into consideration which goggles they want to develop for? 

I'm no expert on coding or programming, so am not too sure how it all works. Any insight would be much appreciated!"

4x216k,1,2016-08-10,"Как найти программы по обмену в США: FLEX, UGrad, Fulbright, W&amp;T, AuPair и др.",Pora_Sezhat,pora_valit,https://www.reddit.com/r/pora_valit/comments/4x216k/как_найти_программы_по_обмену_в_сша_flex_ugrad/,"Всем привет. Сегодня я решила рассказать, как найти программы по обмену, для того, чтобы приехать в США по обмену. Есть 2 официальных сайта правительственных, на которых можно посмотреть, какие программы по обмену есть для вашей страны. Первый сайт – это http://exchanges.state.gov/ , как вы видите здесь. Зайдя на этот сайт, вы выбираете «NON-U.S CITIZENS», потому что есть программы для граждан США по обмену в других странах, и есть программы для не граждан США, которые хотят приехать в США по обмену. Выбираем «NON-U.S CITIZENS», и кликаем на «find programs». И здесь можно выбрав вашу страну, например я выберу Украину, найти программы, которые есть в правительстве США для Украины. Здесь можно выбрать программы для студентов, спортсменов, преподавателей, и если ничего тут не выбирать, то он выдаст все программы. Например, для Украины есть 15 программ и можно посмотреть, что это за программы. Вот, например, Flex, все знают это программа для старшеклассников, которую недавно отменили в России, но в Украине она есть. Fulbright - это программа для получения магистратуры в США. Visiting Scholar – это для преподавателей, а есть Fulbright Foreign Student – это для магистратуры. 

UGrad – это для тех, кто получает бакалавра, она позволяет год проучиться по обмену в США. В общем есть 15 программ, 2 страницы, я не о всех о них знаю, не все они подходят под каждую ситуацию. Есть программы именно по каким-то специальностям. Sports visiting program – это для спортсменов и т.д. То есть на этом сайте можно посмотреть программы по вашей стране, естественно, для разных стран программы будут разные. И следующий сайт, на котором можно посмотреть – это сайт http://j1visa.state.gov/ , как многие из вас, наверное, знают, j1visa – это для тех, кто приезжают по обмену, это виза Work and Travel, это виза Au Pair и т.д. 

Чтобы поехать с Intern ships, нужен спонсор. Например, я зашла на Interns, спонсора можно посмотреть здесь. Find Intern sponsor, и он выдаст вам список компаний, которые могут стать спонсорами. Например, если вы ищете Intern ship, вы можете написать в эти компании, очень многие крупные компании, например Hewlett Packard, ABM, по-моему, тоже является спонсором на следующей странице. Я хотела показать эти сайты, потому что я знаю, что большая путаница есть с тем, как подавать на разные программы. Какие вообще программы есть, ну и вообще, если люди думают пользоваться услугами каких-то фирм, которые им обещают какие-то программы, они могут просто зайти, посмотреть, существуют ли эти программы на самом деле. Или это просто обман, или они называют учебу на ESL программе «work and study», я знаю, очень многие мне пишут, что они хотят подать на «work and study», но такой программы не существует. По крайней мере, для стран СНГ бывшего. 

Так что можно будет либо просто проверить, если такая программа, либо узнать, под какую программу вы подходите и подать на эту программу. Посмотреть на этих сайтах либо спонсоров, если эта программа связана с J1 exchange, либо отдельных сайтах, если это Fulbright или какие-то еще программы по обмену. Там обычно есть отдельный сайт и отдельный application process, который нужно пройти, для того, чтобы участвовать в конкурсе и выиграть возможность проехать по обмену в США. На этом все.

4x2hu4,95,2016-08-10,I'm an escort who dabbles in the occult and acts as a therapist to clients. Need help with sorting out my energy.,magickalwhore,occult,https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/4x2hu4/im_an_escort_who_dabbles_in_the_occult_and_acts/,"Okay, so I'm a fairly regular poster on here (created a throw away account just to post this question to avoid any future repercussions). I've been dabbling in the occult since I was very young, but I am by no means a ""pro"". 

I am probably going to get a lot of hate thrown my way (before you do post something hateful, please think carefully about wasting your precious energy on that-I get to deal with all kind of shite in my professional life, mean comments about my profession do not bother me much.) So long story short I'm an escort. A whore, a hooker or whichever derogatory term you want to use. Its a part time job to get me through university, a series of unpaid internships and hospital bills for my mum. (not that I have to justify what I do)

ANYHOW

Escorting is not as simple as sexually pleasing men (phew that's the easy bit).  It involves being people's therapist, counsellor, listening to people's heartbreaking life-stories, watching their pain, having grown-ass businessmen cry on your shoulder when their family members die. You give a lot. I have always been an empath, I feel people's emotions (good and bad) as acutely as my own, the slightest changes in people's moods-I notice them. 

If I were to chose a reason for to why not to do this job, the main one would be, this job is deadly to someone like me. It DRAINS me emotionally and spiritually. I have always been great at talking to people and counselling them, talking through their problems with them, helping them emotionally. But it's always taken its toll on me, but I never used to do it as often as I have to in this job. 

When having sex with people, I used to be able to do this weird thing where when the guy would climax, I would make eye contact with him and almost absorb all of his energy ""down there""...? It's weird, it used to be completely instinctive- I never used to think about it! I don't think I was causing any harm but I would always get this weird kick out of it, and feel really energized afterwards. Does that mean I have ""vampiric"" tendencies? What was I doing? It seemed so natural to me. Over the past few weeks I seem to have lost my ability to do it! What's happened?
 
I'm planning on doing this job for the next year or so purely because I need to save up enough money. Energetically my body feels polluted. I regularly take cleansing salt baths, clean my space with palo santo and incense, meditate and invoke Aphrodite (feel like i have a connection with her). But lately even meditation feels difficult. Throughout the day I start to feel an odd kind of lightness all over my body (and suddenly feel really happy), and then all of a sudden lead-like heaviness where I suddenly feel sleepy and tired. Physically there is absolutely nothing wrong with me, I have regular check ups, blood tests STD tests, take supplements and eat super healthy. I'm a happy healthy hooker ;) 

After finishing with this job I'm planning on remaining celibate for a year or two because I think it will help.

Does anyone have any ideas on what should I do (maybe crystal work or etc?) in order to maintain my emotional and spiritual balance in this job? I feel so drained as if something is being ripped out of me every time I see a client. 

Oh and please abstain from moralising, innuendos and STD jokes if you can thank you very much. Gentle reminder that whether what I do is moral or immoral is not for you to decide. :) 



UPDATE: spent the whole day today exploring unknown places and walking around a giant nature reserve-feeling a ton better already! (Not amazing, but still better :) )"
4x2jro,11,2016-08-10,Should I keep running or cut it back (or stop completely)?,coloraso,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/4x2jro/should_i_keep_running_or_cut_it_back_or_stop/,"A little background about myself: I'm 22 years old, 5'9"" and about 135 lb from the last night I weighed myself a few weeks ago. I've been pretty big into running on and off since I was 18, but I only really got seriously into it within the past couple years. In that time, I've done a few 5K's and 10K's and just did a half marathon a few weeks ago. About a year ago, I took a break because I was doing Insanity paired with running and got a stress fracture at that time. Around that time I was dating a guy (I'll call him Jeff) who was really against running and really dragged my self-confidence down about it saying how bad it is for you and how a runner's body isn't the ideal physique in a woman (or man) and how my body could be so much better by doing other things. I know it wasn't what he meant, but it's how I took it.

I was able to start doing some lifting through Stronglifts 5x5 and back off running for a little while, really for a mixture of what Jeff said and my injury. After a while, I was even able to get over my fear of being the only female in the weight room. 

Once my leg was better, I was dating another guy (I'll call him Pat). Pat told my my body was perfect the way it was and I be lifting as it would only hurt me and talking about how beefy and unattractive female lifters were. I don't think he thought women should lift at all. I kept lifting, but maybe a little bit less because of what he said. I really don't like admitting it, but I think I did change my schedule a bit because of him.

Then, that brings me to this summer where I'm in a new city for an internship so no gym and I've been running anywhere from 4-6 days a week. Everything was fine until I read some articles last night about how terrible running is for your body and basically what Jeff said; that it isn't ideal for anyone. (This site for example http://rpmftns.com/running-yourself-to-death/) I generally do workout for myself, but I put more thought into what people say than I should for these types of things.

I'm currently lowering my mileage to train for a 5K, but I'm not sure what to do after. If I keep running, will I blow out my knees? I'm young enough now that I'm worried I'll damage my body later and currently, I am struggling to get 100% the body I want; I'm thin but I've struggled to lose fat around my waist and hips, but I wouldn't go as far to call it ""skinny fat"". 

Would it be better to take a break, alternate between lifting and running, or cut out running all-together? Sorry for the longer-than-needed text.

TL;DR: Distance runner, read articles about how bad running is for your body and how ""undesirable"" of a body it creates. Want to know if I should continue or what.

Also, if anyone has any workout plans or anything they'd recommend let me know!


edit: Thanks everyone so much for the feedback! For reference, I run anywhere from 10-25 miles a week generally. Sometimes more, but only really if I'm training for something. I definitely don't buy into the ""women shouldn't lift"" because there's no basis. I'm going to work on not caring what people think and listening to this sub more."

He'll stay with my husband and naps are gonna be tough at first but (lots of crying) but I won't be there to hear it and they'll figure it out. 

I'm just so worried I'll miss milestones, I'll miss so many cuddles and smiles, I'll miss nursing, I'll miss his sleeping face in my arm, I'll miss kissing his head and smelling his hair, I'll miss how he smiles and squeaks and then gets shy and buries his face in my shoulder, I'll miss him so much.

(Long post),sisyphus77,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/4x3e7l/does_my_exgirlfriend_seem_like_she_has_bpd_long/,"Hello first post here :) Please pardon my mistakes as my first language is not English. First I would like to thank everyone on this board, you have been of such great help for me as I am gradually detaching from my BPD-like relationship. I'm on NC Day 16 and am starting to move on.

I am 23 years old, she is 22, she was my first serious girlfriend and the one I truly ever loved. We met on the internet three years ago, she was so vulnerable, putting herself low, and so tender, loving, romantic, lively, incredibly seductive... I fell in love with her almost instantly, and she with me too. So we started dating.

The first few months she had frequent thoughts that I was going to abandon her someday, and often expressed this concern. After my constant reassuring, she seemed to ease up a bit. However one thing bothered me: She was so feminine yet claimed to have always wanted to be a boy, a gay boy and a bottom. She seemed to enjoy Japanese yaoi (Boys' Love fiction) so much that she sort of put the identity onto herself. But at that time I didn't give it much thought. I view myself as female-to-male transgender, so this gender-fluid thing was not new to me and gave us more of a commonground.

We mostly talked online, and occasionally talked on the phone. She sometimes sounded different on the phone. I've commented on the fact that she had two voices, one was loud, plain, emotionless and the other was sweet and soft, and she agreed to that.

She was so in love with me and saw and treated me as fully male, which I loved. She admired me and I was so protective of her. To her wishes, I also regarded her as a cute, feminine young boy, but during the relationship, her own gender identity seemed to change. She said, ""You have brought out the little girl in me, because what you give me is so much of what she wants. So I'm naturally more and more girly."" Seeing it as a confirmation of my gender identity as a male, I felt flattered, naturally. (As I revisited this memory, I realized it was a giant Red Flag which at the time I persuaded myself that she was only young and experimenting.)

The first half year we were together I had never seen her in video chat. When we did, she kept her webcam turned off so only she could see me. She explained that she was unprepared, but all the photos she sent me were extremely beautiful. We had our first sexting at the 3 month mark which both of us enjoyed a lot - The next morning, I woke up to a short message: ""I don't know why but my feeling has changed and can go back no more.""

I felt confused but accepted it without replying much. Later she sent me another message, ""You don't know about girls, girls feel insecure after the first night, I only need you to soothe me so I'll feel good again."" Which I did by saying sweet words, and the crisis was resolved.

We met in person after six months, and because I've never seen any normally-posed not-beautified photo of hers, she looked like a total stranger. But she was not bad looking, and I was deeply in love with her so I tried to connect her to my mental picture of the girl on the internet. That night I kissed her without feeling much physical attraction, but it was a very sweet night of mutual intimacy.

The next day, she looked detached and distant, and wasn't interested in anything that I was saying. I was very uncomfortable around her. That night I told her how I felt and she said in a dreamy tone, ""We are soul mates. I believe that we are both very special people, and we come from the same planet that others don't even know about..."" to the point of saying, ""I'm a fairy and you are my last human relationship."" I was moved by how romantic this all was, and decided to stay with her to see if my feelings will change.

I stayed with her the following month, and there were instances where she would exhibit passive-aggressiveness that drove me crazy. They were all about my life habits that I consider minor to a relationship, or at least can be directly talked about, yet she used silence and distance tactics to punish me without telling me the specific why-s. Due to this I ran out into the rain once, fell over the street and bruised my knee.

She explained all this by ""This is me. I like to bully those I love. It's scary isn't it? If I don't love someone, I wouldn't think of bullying him."" I almost broke up with her but didn't as I looked into her innocent-looking eyes.

And then I started a graduate program at her city and focused on my new campus life for about two years while dating her. We would have weekly dates. She was very fond of having her photos taken, so we did that every time. On one occasion she acted out and physically assaulted a woman at the ticket office as a means to ""protect"" me, which I still cannot understand to this day. Also, she hated crowds, noise, hot weather and wetness. At such times she would refuse to let me talk to her and enter a silent rage mode. She would say, in a tormented, squeaky voice, ""I'll be okay in a minute, just wait me out!""

Apart from that she was very clingy on the internet as I provided consolation and solutions to many of her relational and academic problems. She had lots of ever-changing plans but never followed through, and was always complaining about people around her. She was unhappy and self-absorbed and felt hopeless about her future. She admitted that the mask she put on to others and previously to me had been a lie.

It was around this time that I discovered signs of her falling for someone else. It was a middle-aged, married professor about whom she spread her obsession all over social media. I was hurt. When I confronted her about this, she denied her love. She said, ""If I really fell for him, would I really be stupid enough to tell the world?"" I believed her words.

But her obsession escalated, as I found that she was secretly talking to everyone about it but me. A friend of hers commented to her that ""the professor is walking at the edge of hell trying not to fall under your spell"" ... As I found out, my heart was broken into pieces.

Four days of no contact, and she came around. She said, ""To tell you the truth, I don't like him today. He smoked today and made the room smell bad. I never liked him in a romantic way. If you don't believe me, I have nothing more to say. In a way, I hope he is my grandma."" Later she said, ""Even if he is as good to me as you are, I still feel manic and empty inside. I eat food and it's all tasteless. I'm only keeping myself alive.""

By that time I was already so emotionally invested that leaving hurt too much. I chose, yet again, to believe everything she says, but our relationship went downhill from that.

I had too many questions left unanswered, and I began to have a lot of doubts. She was often asking me to tell her what to do but her focus was never really on the subject matter, but on my reliability and validation. She still made me feel uncomfortable, to the point that I was constantly tripping over myself in front of her, losing stuff, stuttering, etc... I felt like I never really knew her. I was forever walking on eggshells for fear that she would judge me (she often did, explicitly or implicitly). I thought my fear was out of love. She was ignoring me, indifferent to my feelings, flirting with others in front of me. For many times, I experienced strong impulses of violence towards her but never acted on them. Instead, there were tears of desperation, which she deplored. Once she raged and blamed me for crying on her birthday, a taboo in traditional Chinese culture. Meanwhile, my internship was keeping me busy so I wasn't catering to her as much, and I was showing a lot less affection than before. When she failed to explain her behavior, I too said a lot of hurtful things. At 1 a.m. on a January night, as I was alone in my dorm, she broke up with me. She said that she loved me but didn't like me anymore, and that she disliked my laugh, my overly nice attitude to waitors, and that I got impatient when shopping with her. She said she wanted to keep me as a best friend though.

I was devastated. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I never knew that break-ups could hurt so much, so much so that I had to hit myself to feel better, numbing myself with physical pain. 

A week later she explained that her idea of a best friend is someone you can secretly sleep with. She said she was only bored because our relationship has been too secure and wanted passion without a long-term relationship... I was relieved. So we were still in a relationship, right? All I need is to make some word-switching. And spice it up. I took her to my gym, wrote songs for her, took her out to restaurants, played card magic for her, and simply became my best self. She was enjoying everything, looked in-love and sweet, and everything was good for a while.

Later I discovered that her real reason behind the breakup was for someone else, this time a butch lesbian (gender identity affirmed female) whom she referred to as a ""boyfriend"" and was love-bombing on social media and making life-long promises. At this moment, I was suddenly struck with the realization that perhaps she had never seen me as truly male.

She never concealed her infatuation with her new-found lover. To me, she said, in a dream-like tone, ""she's someone new! Someone new says that she likes me! It's so exciting... she french-kissed me in the cinema.""

I believed I was in the wrong and failed to keep her attraction, until I came across an article about BPD. I was so relieved to see at least some of the symptoms match up, but was also afraid that I was painting her black in order to make myself feel better.

I forced myself to go No Contact. Despite knowing about BPD, I missed her too much and was broken without her. Every day was too painful, I couldn't do anything else. I read hundreds of BPD articles and threads hoping to comfort myself. I missed her, missed her and missed her. Friends were all helping me, saying that she's a b**ch, comforting me, taking me out for meals, etc. But my heart still only went to her.

I knew BPDs recycle their exes, but when I saw her heart-wrenching long messages left on a rarely used APP where I forgot to block her, I felt like I was on drugs again. Satisfaction and joy and excitement crept back to the bottom of my heart. She was missing me and desperately reaching out to me. She was crying inside. What if she didn't have BPD after all?

I was recycled back four times during six months, each of her attempt more intensified and crazier than the last (her mother literally begged me to the last recycle). I gave her the benefit of the doubt because she didn't self-harm, never talked about suicide, and the rage and acting-out seemed few and far between. Every time she was desperate to contact me, she said she was deeply sorry and realized that she was sick and she loved me the most but she couldn't control herself, and that she will miss me terribly forever, and that she would break up with New Guy (never did); but every time, about a week after I went back, she either started to ignore me, message and flirt with New Guy at my face, or said things to push me away (""We just aren't made for each other"" etc.).

From January to July, I was tossed back and forth between Heaven and Hell and never a second passed without me missing her and ruminating about everything. I was mentally exhausted, and fell ill every time things changed for better or for worse.

She said that she doesn't even like New Guy, saying she's too young, weak, ordinary, immature, boring, girly, etc... that I'm in all aspects better, and the only reason for her to keep talking to New Guy is that at least they are in the same university so she doesn't have to feel alone in campus, and that she wanted to ""take revenge"" because New Guy was not caring for her as much as she wanted, yet she kept sucking up to New Guy. All through her new relationship she was cheating with me and victimizing herself to everyone around her that New Guy was abusive to her because New Guy didn't like her, all the while lying about just everything to the new guy. Like she would take a picture of the gift she once sent me and send the pic to New Guy saying ""I still want you to have everything I like."" Once I peeked into her phone, where she said to New Guy, ""Maybe you think I picked you over my ex because you're in the same uni. This is not true. It's only because of my feelings, and my feelings only...""

This was the last straw on the back of the camel. I immediately decided to come back to my home city and to never contact her again. I had totally given up on the relationship. My spirits hit rock bottom. After 15 days of No Contact, journaling and BPD research, I am finally feeling good for the first time in six months.

So I guess my question was: Does she seem like BPD to you? I think I have to trust external opinions to be really sure of myself... I am so worried that I could have made this up, or that she simply lost interest in me but I was mis-diagnosing her to save my self-esteem. I know it's a long post, so thank you for reading (if anyone did :P). I wish you all a nice day."

I have dabbled in international, M&amp;A, SALT (most my experience is SALT), but really have no idea which of those areas I want to go into. I don't think I would be unhappy in any of them (never met a type of tax I didn't enjoy), but it's giving me anxiety just thinking about having to pick one potentially for the rest of my career.

Also I am a JD with an accounting background and a lot of internships (3 tax internships). I am leaning towards SALT because I have a decent amount of experience in that area and I think it might be good for my long term career aspirations.

I think SALT is a little more versatile than M&amp;A/International because even small(er) businesses need SALT work, where only massive corporations needs M&amp;A/International work; plus one day I would potentially like to move out of the big city I currently live in which I don't think would be possible if I specialized in M&amp;A/International and potentially would be possible if I did SALT because I have seen smaller accounting/law firms with SALT practices but not with M&amp;A/International practices).

4x3snc,5,2016-08-10,A confused Aerospace Engineer,iiWolf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4x3snc/a_confused_aerospace_engineer/,"**Disclaimer:** I *have* researched all these questions beforehand, but ya'll are always so good at providing extra information/viewpoints!

Hello everyone,

I am in my third year at UF studying **Aerospace/Mechanical** engineering. I am also, however, pursuing a minor in **Computer Science**. I really love programming, and would like to try to work as a computer engineer somewhere while I finish my studies.

I have taken just 3 programming courses, though I spend a good bit of time outside of class learning miscellaneous languages/algorithms/ideas. 

I can solve easy - moderate level problems on HackerRank consistently, and I have learned/coded a bit in a few different languages (Python, Java, Objective-C, C#, HTML &amp; CSS), but I use C++ the most by far. I know about common OOP concepts like polymorphism, inheritance and all that fun stuff. Though I haven't put them to a *ton* of use. The most involved code I have written is basic 2D game engine following TheCherno's *Sparky Game Engine* series. I wrote my own semi-functional physics engine for it, and I am able to code very simple games quickly.

My question is hard to pose succinctly, but basically, **am I at any point to be confident enough to apply for internships/part time jobs as a programmer?** I know this is a weird question to ask people who don't know me, but I guess I just really have no reference for what a intern or part-time programmer (if that's even a thing) might do. **Is it on the complexity of moderate algorithmic challenges that I can just do some research on and figure out myself? Is it writing low level code given prompts for bigger projects?**

I understand that this all very much depends on what kind of job I am looking for.  To answer that question, it is really anything! I'd help an indie group make a game, or just write code to sort through applications at an Allstate office. I guess that is another question, **what kind of places/companies look for a ~~novice programmer~~ advanced beginner?**

Finally, **what topics should I pursue if I want to be a well-rounded programmer that can tackle any opportunity that might arise.**

TL;DR Am I is bad program or no?

- **What do interns/part time entry level programmers usually do?**

- **What skills, as a ~~novice programmer~~ advanced beginner, should I learn to jump up to a level 2 true elite programmer?**

- **What type of companies other than Intel and company look for decent programmers? Local tech companies? Local businesses? Local farms?**

**EDIT:** You guys are the best! I really appreciate your time! Going to go research some projects to start coding, as well as local jobs I can apply for!

Thanks for any and all help!

I am unsure of what to do about my car.

I was just wondering if anyone else who came into CS a little later in the game could offer any bits of advice for life in UTCS. Specifically advice on making friends/connections/finding opportunities inside and outside of school. In my last major (Human Development and Family Sciences) I was in a lab and I found that extremely helpful in finding internships later on. I know I want an experience like that in CS, but I don't know if it is better to pursue a research assistant position on campus or getting a CS related internship (is it even possible for me to get a CS related internship with only limited knowledge of Python (I took CS 303E)?). 

Also, when should I decide if I want to be BS or BSA (I think I've ruled out a BA). Do employers at big, prestigious companies look down on the BSA, and for that matter, do ANY employers look down on the BSA. If so, what types of employers? 

Also, I don't know if it's silly to mention this, but I'm also a girl (funny how we have to proclaim these things online)!! Would any other women (or men!) have any advice to offer a girl coming into a male dominated major/field? "

The work involves Apache Spark, Scala, Hive, Power BI and a little bit of basic Machine Learning. Th company which makes products/services for mostly US/Europe based clients. Recently they've been taking some projects in Talend ETL, Power BI and also Android App Development and not getting as many projects in Apache Spark.
Also I have my Accenture joining very soon at Bangalore. I am thinking of joining it for 4-5 months and then switching to a product based company/startup, so that I can get some work of my interest.
So,

1. Does one get enough time during free time in office and time after office to prepare for other companies, like competitive programming and contributing to Open Source ?

3. Will having the experience of a startup not so known but still able to grab good and known clients be more valuable or having the Accenture brand be more valuable for my future career interests( Apache Spark, Scala, ML)

4. Does having the work experience at Accenture be more valuable for a masters degree (MS/MBA) than that of a startup ?

5. Are websites like GitHub and HackerRank banned in IT companies ?

P.S. the pay is 33% better in my current company, plus the traffic and commute doesn't take much time, living is cheap. But I'm uncertain whether I'll get the projects I like here (as right now I've been assigned an Android dev project) . So should I join Accenture, prepare and pay the bond amount and leave Accenture or should I just stay here and prepare and try for other companies online.

4x4elc,3,2016-08-10,Taking a low paying job early in your career?,beginDelawarehead,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/4x4elc/taking_a_low_paying_job_early_in_your_career/,"(throwaway, since I try not to discuss this kind of stuff using accounts that take nearly no work to trace back to me)

edit: I ran the numbers about cost of living and those make the compensation look much better.  Well actually they just make all the ""cheap"" areas near me look shitty.

I got a tentative job offer from the DoD.  Employment is (obviously) conditional on passing a background check) I need to complete the forms and pass the background check before I get a ""real"" job offer.  The job requires a clearance which I don't yet have but would likely (eventually) acquire wherever I go to work.  I have to get the forms back to the DoD within a couple weeks so they can start doing background check stuff.  The clearance would be TS.  I don't foresee anything that would make me ineligible for a TS clearance.

I've got two summer internships at a multinational defense contractor.  One was doing some security related stuff with network traffic for customers, the other was plain old software development.  I'm about to be entering my senior year in college and am planning on seeking employment at that company in a cyber-security related role.  Based on how these past two summers have went I don't think I'd have a problem finding a good job by the time I graduate.

Here's my dilema.  The DoD job is a offensive position.  The group I would be working for does offensive stuff.  To me that's really important because it's something I really want to get paid to do and IMO it's a heck of a thing to have on your resume.  Short of pen-testing there aren't many other opportunities to get paid to do offensive work.  The job sounds great.  What doesn't sound great is the pay.  I'd get ~50k + a $10k signing bonus.  The opportunities for increased pay aren't that great and are very well defined.  I know that there are very good retirement and health-care benefits available to federal employees but I won't be needing the former for a very long time and am very unlikely to need much of the latter.  What I'm worried about is this impacting my future.  I don't want to be that guy who makes 1mil less over his career because he started out making 10k less on day 1.  For comparison, I have three friends with similar qualifications, also working in cybersecurity that started with ~80k salaries.  After cost of living adjustments for where they work vs where I'd be working it's probably closer to 70k

Part of me says that I'm over thinking it and should just take the DoD job because it's a fairly unique opportunity and I can just negotiate my way out of being shortchanged by future employers (I'm not too bad at negotiating, I sure as heck don't fear it like some people do).

Another thought that crossed my mind is that I should email my recruiter and see if there's anything he can do to get me started at a higher spot in the pay-scale or include student loan repayment (I have under $30k in loans) or some other thing as part of my offer.  $50k seems really low to me considering that my intern hourly wages extrapolate to a ~$40k salary and employers are paying about double that for my college buddies with nearly identical qualifications.

Anyone have any advice?

tl;dr: Would you take a low paying gov't job as your first job out of college if it was something you really wanted to do?"

Many posters here claim to have great jobs and since my career is dead in the water right now I was wondering if I could ask you all for some guidance.

Here’s my backstory. I’m 26 and I live in the UK, I graduated in late 2013 from a shit university with a good grade in a generally worthless subject (journalism). Since the journalism industry is a wreck right now, I decided to try and find work in marketing, PR or internal communications.

Since graduating I have completed 4 unpaid internships, applied to hundreds of postings on job sites, taken marketing courses, learned enough basic CSS and HTML to build several decent looking websites to help promote a few local businesses as well as my own site to host my portfolio, run successful social media platforms for those businesses, started a marketing blog, learned useful skills such as using google analytics and email marketing, attended dozens of industry networking events, attempted to leverage my contacts, contacted recruiters and made numerous speculative applications to marketing and PR agencies.

All attempts have failed. Apart from a brief content writing contract position which paid minimum wage and ended in December last year, I have not been able to land any other paying work over the past 3 years. I have applied to entry level positions, basic admin positions, paid internships and simple manual labour or retail positions to make some money. I have approached companies through every conceivable channel and applied every job hunting technique I have read about online but my applications are either ignored or I fail the interview.

I have failed 23 job interview this year with feedback ranging from “we hired someone with more experience” to “we didn’t think you would bring the right kind of energy to the company.”

I have no idea how to find a job. I am almost 27 years old, I still live with my parents and I am going nowhere fast. Everything I have tried to find work, build a useful network or improve my employability has failed for no discernible reason.

I’m sorry for the text wall but I’ve run out of ideas and I really REALLY need any advice any of you can offer. Please help."
4x4vct,14,2016-08-10,I just finished a successful internship and received an offer to come back next summer... but it's not in my field [x-post from engineeringstudents],engineering23423,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/4x4vct/i_just_finished_a_successful_internship_and/,"I'm currently an incoming Sophomore in my university's chemical engineering program. I got a job working in an analytical chemistry lab this summer and I've been working there since May. It's at a Fortune 500 company that I did enjoy working at as far as the workplace environment goes.


Today, my boss gave me an offer to come back next summer. However, she's only giving me two days to make my decision and I'm pretty reluctant. I've just been accepted to my university's chemical engineering program after working my ass off and even retaking a class for a slightly better grade just to ensure that I got in and I'd feel really stupid backing out of it now because of a job offer. Admittedly, though, I did enjoy my time this summer. Could I see myself doing this for the rest of my life? Probably not. While I enjoy chemistry and I've been doing it for a little while, my interests are really in process and design. And while I could handle doing analytical chemistry, a lot of it was grunt type work and it felt kind of soulless, and everyone without more than a bachelors degree did the same things that I did (as an intern). Also, this is the year that everyone really kicks into gear with job applications and job fairs, so staying in an analytical chemistry lab instead of getting a engineering internship for a second year would put me behind my peers in a big way.


But... I'm concerned that I won't be able to find an internship in engineering next summer because of my GPA, and that if I don't take this job I'll be jobless next summer, which is literally the worst possible scenario I can even think of. Last semester, I ended up dropping to a 3.36 because I earned basically straight Bs. Also, all of my experience is in chemistry. I've worked in an organic chemistry lab, an analytical lab (this summer), and a prep lab. I did spend a year doing CAD, though, but that doesn't necessarily help in ChemE. The job market also scares me-- I hear so many horror stories of people my age who can't find work after they graduate, and letting go of a decent job that pays $18 an hour to ""explore"" and ""focus more on my major"" seems dangerous and misguided, in a way. Should I be playing it safe in this job market?


What I did learn from this job is that I'd prefer working in industry R&amp;D over anything else. I enjoy the environment, and the collaboration, that goes on. However, I envied the interns who got to work in the pilot plants and on engineering-based projects, since those were much more my interest.


My boss DID say that she'd put a word out to the other departments to see if they want an engineering intern next summer, so I might still get a chance to work with the company (and I'd probably say yes to an offer in engineering). But I don't know how sincere she is about that. She adamantly wants me back, so I don't know if she'd actually help me find something more in my field (and why should she?)
I'm just really conflicted and I'd be awesome to get some input/similar stories."

WHAT THE FUCK?!

I've been looking for a job for seven months now, since I finished my master's degree. Seven months. And I have it better than some - I do have tech experience. Older experience, but it's experience. And I did take internships. My resume's good enough that I'm getting lots of attention from recruiters, and I get interviews, and even second interviews, but every time, I get told ""Well, your skills were good in A, B, and C, but we think you're not quite there with D, so we're gonna pass.""

Just today, I learned that one of the employers that I had interviewed with, that passed on me, had still not filled the position, because they wanted someone with another year of experience in Python. PYTHON IS NOT A DIFFICULT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. And I have experience with multiple programming languages. It's one thing if I'm not selected because they chose another candidate, but to learn that you were passed over in favor of an empty chair? That fucking hurts.

What the fuck? The unemployment rate is down, the recession is supposed to be over and the economy's supposed to be great, and everyone's finding work... except me. I must be damaged goods."

4x635a,5,2016-08-10,The Intern,Frobro_Baggins94,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4x635a/the_intern/,"Last week was supposed to be a relaxing one. I was finally finishing up my summer internship. This entire summer has been terribly boring. As far as internships go mine was pretty simple. Watch. Learn. Repeat. I expected the 40 hours of my last week to equate to several years. I was very surprised when my boss called me into his office last Monday to discuss a ""big project"" that he wanted me to be a part of. 

He always struck me as a strange man with his dry sense of humor and quirky posture. I jokingly told my mom that he seemed like the type of guy to have a basement full of bodies; however, there wasn't anything particularly menacing about the guy. He was lacking some serious charisma, but his polite demeanor made up for that. Strange? Yes. Dangerous? No. In general, most of the people at the factory seemed strange to me. They weren't the pleasant sort of strange either. The word grotesque even comes to mind when thinking about the employees. Something just seemed off. Some of their bodies were grossly misshapen. There were lumps and contours in all of the wrong places. Several oddities included abnormally long arms, bloated guts, menacing limps, and tainted smiles. I told myself to stop letting my imagination run wild.

I was kind of surprised when my boss said this project required me to come in on 3rd shift for a few days (11 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. here). I was also confused because no interns ever get moved to 3rd shift. I didn't want to mess my sleep schedule up too bad right before school started. I almost decided to quit a week early and take a two week vacation. I decided to stick it out as one week of work is roughly a month of rent. It was only going to be Wednesday through Friday according to my boss. The request was a little bizarre because I hadn't done anything of importance for the entire three months I was there. I printed documents, made spreadsheets, and pretended to be busy. Why ever would they need my help on 3rd shift? 

I was having trouble sleeping during the day Wednesday. My body can't get used to the adjustment that quickly, so I only had a small cat nap before it was time to head in for my first night shift. At 10 p.m. I ate a quick meal, then I proceeded to enjoy a few episodes of Adventure Time. After the few episodes I grabbed my work badge, put on my boots, and headed in for another boring shift at my internship.

Normally when I arrive I just sit at my desk that they provided for me. That night I didn't have any clue where to start, so I headed to my bosses office. I will refer to my boss as Tom going forward. The entire front office area was eerily dim. I wasn't sure if Tom was even there. I just barely glimpsed a hint of light peaking out from under his door. It was slightly cracked open. Common courtesy in the offices was to give a light knock and walk in. I did this, and Tom seemed pretty unresponsive. He looked unusually stressed in the yellow light radiating from his lone desk lamp. He was furiously writing something down and muttering under his breath. His hair was sticking up in random spots, and his usually clean shaven neck fat had patches of untamed hair. This guy looked like he hadn't slept for days. I didn't want to interrupt; I softly asked, ""Tom? What would you like me to start working on?"". He didn't respond. ""Tom?"" I asked again. He quickly jerked his head up. The last thing I remember seeing was a a sinister grin and the yellow light reflecting out of his bloodshot eyes. When I opened my eyes I found myself staring into a blinding industrial light. I was shirtless. My back was stiff against cold steel. I felt a droplet of sweat run down the left side of my face into my ear. This gave me a sudden chill. I went to wipe it away with my left hand, and I wasn't surprised to see blood on it. My feet were bound tightly. The most terrifying part was the machine press that my right hand was clamped directly under. I could not reach anything with my left arm to free myself. If the press were to go down on my skull it would be the equivalent of somebody hitting a jelly donut with a sledge hammer. 

I am starting to get anxious the more I write. I am going to need a small break to get my thoughts together. I have been super paranoid since these events. I just had to rant somewhere to prevent myself from going crazy.

First time posting here but I figured it'd be best to ask for help in this situation. Bare with me.

I have an internship coming up in the fall. It's unpaid, but a great opportunity, and I've spent all summer working 2 jobs just to save for it. I'm flying all the way across the country to live in California for 3 months, and need to pay for housing ($2200 all together), transportation, food, etc. 

I have about $3500 saved up just from my own money. I have a credit card with a $5000 limit. 

These were the two sources of money I was initially depending on to make this opportunity happen. I knew I was gonna have to scrape by but the opportunity is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, so I wanted to make it work. 

I also was anticipating getting about $2500 from a savings account my grandparents put away for me when I was little. I figured it gained interest over time, but I had no idea how much. When I went to withdraw the money, it ended up being just shy of $8000 which was very surprising to me. 

My biggest stressor was knowing I was pouring my literal life savings into an internship opportunity that might get me a job, or might land me right back at my parents house when it's all said and done. I knew I was going to be spending everything I had just to make ends meet. But now I have a little more. Of course I don't want to use it all just on this 3 month internship, though. 

I need to plan ahead, and that's why I need help. 

Now that things are more comfortable for the 3 month internship, I need advice on how much more I should put toward it with what I've already saved up myself...and I also would appreciate advice on what to do with any extra money once I'm done there. Should I put a set amount aside for when I return? How much of the money should I use or not even touch from these savings? 

I appreciate any advice, thanks"

My nmother screamed at me an hour ago. What happened was that I was annoyed that she got some clean dishes dirty and just took some off the drying rack and haphazardly stacked them. Then, on top of that, she put her rice cooker on top of a container with food without checking what it was first. I'll admit that the last thing I was being a bit of a dick by being annoyed. I should have remembered that that's where she put her rice cooker, but I work six days a week touring Shakespeare in the park plus trying to de-stress, update/maintain my programming skills, write.

Anyways, she's yelling at me as I go back upstairs to my room about how things that fell in on the floor are dirty (I knocked over the rice cooker when I took the container below it out, I'm a total klutz on a good day \&gt;.\&lt;). I yell back it didn't fall on the floor (it didn't, it fell on my aloe plant, which is beside the cabinet things sit on). And then she starts yelling about how the lid is missing. Ok, whatever, don't care, already on my way back to my room to hide. 

The thing is, she keeps yelling about it. Angrily. I'm in champ select in League of Legends. Once I lock in my champ, I let my team know I need to afk and hope I get back fast enough as I go downstairs to clean the dishes that were dirty. Apparently my brain exaggerated, only one she dirtied. The rest were just oddly greasy. Whatever, it happens. Luckily she didn't catch it or there would be more yelling. Except at this point it's screaming.

I match her screaming tone. I know it's not helpful but it's a defense mechanism that protects me from some of the fear and panic.

I look before I do the dishes. The lid is right beside the rice cooker. WTF. Did she even look?

Then she goes on about how she's been asking me where it went. I'm fed up. She hasn't been asking, just demanding in tone and words and semantics. I tell her asking isn't the same as demanding/scolding (it's in Cantonese so probably used scolding instead of demanding but it's basically the same thing right now). I repeat this about five times until her brain clicks that I'm defending myself. So she switches to of course she knows the difference. I tell her the lid is beside the rice cooker, did she look? No, she didn't, but she's blind so how could she? I know she can read, it's just hard cuz she has a hole in her vision. I say just that, I know she can read.

Then she goes on about how she's blind, she can't read, she can't see, woe is her, no one helps her ever. Except my brothers help her all the time. She takes $5000 of my dad's money every month. She doesn't work, brags about how she doesn't have to worry about workplace stress cuz she doesn't work when the topic comes up. 

Then she goes on about how I'm stupid and how when she comes in the room people just leave. Which is totally untrue. It's just me who does it as far as I can tell because all her psychological and emotional and physical abuse has led to me having anxiety attacks when she's in the same room; she doesn't even have to be doing anything. Woe is her, she has to do everything alone. Eat. Buy groceries. That's her list? Well, by this time I'm halfway to the stairs having done the dishes. The whole time she's screaming like a banshee. At 10 or 11pm. When my dad and brothers are in bed, usually sleeping. Cuz they get up at 5am to go to work.

I just can't do this anymore. I'm an intern right now. I would go get any job but I have really bad social anxiety. Like I freak out if I have to tell on the phone, meet new people, go to a new place, be in groups larger than 4 unless I really trust people. And if there's a combination... HUGE NOPE. 

I don't know what to do. I want to get out. I have for years. I don't know how to get the income to live on my own. At this point, I'm really close to just walking into oncoming traffic. Or maybe something more final. Yes, I'm depressed and suicidal. I'm taking meds for depression that take the edge off a tiny bit. 

I'm in Ontario, Canada if that helps. "

I'm not sure how to approach it because I don't know why he is like that. Any ideas?",soconfused20188,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x6qzq/me_24_m_with_my_close_friend_24_m_of_6_years_in/,"So me and him used to work in a restaurant together for a few years while we both finished high school and started college. We became really good and close friends and hung out all the time.

I got an internship for my college program and quit my job, I worked there for a year and stayed on part time as I currently finish up my degree. Right when I quit I also broke up with my SO and relied on him for support and such, which he was there for. He soon after moved to a different restaurant were he currently works while he goes to school part time.

We stayed close friends up until even now, but recently I've started to feel bad when I hang around or talk with him.

I think the best way to describe it is with examples, but the summary of it is it feels like he is always trying to undermine everything I do and say and make me feel like my opinions and way's of doing things in my life are wrong. I'm always doing things wrong. It feels like its just me, because he doesn't do this with anyone else as much.

He always says things like ""how do you not like this, I don't understand"", ""if I had your life I wouldn't be complaining"", ""you should just do it this way"", ""I told you this, you should have listened to me"".

For instance I gave my friend some advice about something, and he heard the advice I gave and he said ""wow, you know you must be doing the dieting wrong if Jon (me) is the one giving you advice"".

Another thing that pisses me off is he will ask about my day and when I tell him he tears apart my day. For instance, the other day I got kicked and my backpack grabbed off my randomly on my way to work and had to call the police and such. And he's like ""why didn't you just punch him in the face"", ""you weren't hurt sounds like your making this sound a lot worse than it is"", ""what do you think the police are going to do?"". It's just like screw you, I'm just telling you about my day, and it would be nice if you could just listen. You can joke about it and laugh fine, as I am too as it wasn't that bad, but tearing my whole story and situation apart is just crossing the line.

I lent him $20 one night to take a cab home, and when I asked a couple days later for the money he told me I might get it in a couple months. I knew he was joking, but I said, hey, I need it back, I need to pay for insurance. And he told me he highly doubts the $20 is going to make a difference to me and so and so owes you $80 and your not bugging them about it.

I kind of got pissed and told him I don't care about so and so, you are one of my closest friends and I'm asking YOU for the money.

We talked for a bit, and he said one reason he gets like this with me is because I don't set boundaries very well with people, if at all, so when I do it comes across very harsh as I never set boundaries.

I told him that doesn't give him the right to take advantage of me and then blame me for it, he's an adult and should know better.

It kind of sucks if we hanging out in a group, because he acts like this too, and it just makes me feel bad when I'm trying to enjoy time with other friends. I feel like I have to be social manipulative to try and work around the way he acts towards me sometimes.

I'm trying to approach how I should act, but I'm not sure what would cause someone to act like this is the first place to know how I should approach it?

---   
**tl;dr**: My close friend picks apart my entire life and tells me how I should do things, and I'm not sure why he does it, I'm trying to figure out how I should act and why he does this so I can approach it better?"

I'm unsure if I should press for a better reason and/or try to convince her to reconsider.",myaltneedsanalt,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4x6v0p/my_girlfriend_of_a_whole_six_weeks_who_meant_the/,"She was my first girlfriend, and even though we really weren't together too long, I'm terrible with people so she meant a lot to me. I was proud to tell my family and friends who never believe in me that I have an amazing girlfriend. (Who they never got to meet.)  

Earlier today, I get a message from her saying 'hi.' I bite and say hi as well. She proceeds to break up with me, and give me the whole 'being just friends would work out better' spiel.  

Her reason was that with school starting back up and her not being able to drive herself anywhere (We're both seventeen, I have my license but can't legally drive non-family yet, she doesn't have her license) and that it wouldn't be fair for her to try to hold a relationship. I tell her that I understand, but I can't help but feel that I'd done something wrong. She assures me that I did nothing wrong. I tell her I'm sorry anyway. She tells me I have nothing to be sorry about. She says that a relationship won't work for her right now. I say that I understand again. And that was that. I'm honestly a little disappointed she couldn't at least have called me. I obviously didn't tell her, by I'm kinda calling bullshit on her rationale. I was more than willing and prepared to juggle school, a job, an internship, finding and applying to colleges, and her. It's confusing to think she wouldn't be able to juggle school, me, and getting rides.  

We weren't extremely close, (I always felt like I was more attached to her than she was to me) but nothing ever seems explicitly wrong. We had some nice times, I even kissed her a week and a half ago, and she kissed back. She'd always said she had a great time when we did anything. She regularly verbally assured me that I was worth a damn.  

Then last week I kinda lost contact with her for a few days, so I messaged her and asked if things were ok between us. An extremely awkward conversation ensued as she tells me that she's just been overwhelmed by vacation and family stuff, but things were left, at least I thought, well enough.  


I honestly don't know if I'll ever see or talk to her again. We don't go to the same school and don't live near one another. I just hate for things to end so abruptly, when I felt they were going ok. I don't know if I should press her for a more concrete reason, at the very least to give me some closure. I don't know if I should try to make her reconsider this whole thing. I'm just afraid that if I do, the chip of 'clean breakup, friendship still on the table' will be gone.  

As someone who is obscenely lonely and depressed, she brightened everything up. I just don't know if I should press to try to either close things up or maybe try to keep her around, or if I should just be thankful it was a clean breakup and try to let go. She made me feel like I had someone who saw value in me. Now I feel more alone than ever.  

**TL;DR-** One of the only people who make me feel like I'm worth anything just left, and I don't know if I should just let her go, or if I should risk hurting any potential friendship by pressing a bit. "

# Extended Summary:

**A Tiny Naga Village Has Been Spearheading Women’s Rights &amp; Sustainable Farming for Almost a Decade**.

A model village in the Naga society, Chizami is today visited by youth from Kohima and neighbouring villages for internships in the Chizami model of development.

The Chizami village is perched in the upper reaches of the densely forested hills of Phek district in Eastern Nagaland.

The council plays an important roles in the village governance.

In 1994, Monisha Behal, womens rights activist and founder of North East Network (NEN), landed in Nagaland to improve womens health standards in the state.

Seno was a representative of the Chizami Womens Society (CWS) and worked as a teacher at the government primary school in Sumi, a village adjacent to Chizami.

Behal and Seno knew that the main challenges ahead was to engage and empower the youth to bring about socioeconomic change.

In January 2014, in a landmark move, the village council passed the resolution for equal wages in agricultural labour and next year, another milestone was achieved with the induction of two women as members in the Enhulumi village council.

In 2008, NEN started Chizami Weaves, a decentralized livelihood project to create sustainable livelihood opportunities for the marginalized women in the district as well as preserve the unique textile tradition of Nagaland.

Chizami Weaves also promotes textiles made by one of the oldest looms  the loin-loom or the back-strap loom  that is still traditionally used by the Chakhesang Nagas and other tribes of the North East India.

Due to the nature of the loom, the width of a fabric is normally woven at one time and do not exceed more than 18-20 inches.

Not only do the weavers support their families through their weaving, they are also making their presence felt within their homes and in communitys public spaces by raising their voices on issues of health, livelihood, and environment.

NEN is also working to address another major concern of the villagers  food security.

NEN is now working to revive millet-based biodiverse agriculture in the villages of the district.

Several other steps to revive and enhance traditional agricultural practices have also been taken.

The efforts of the NEN-CWS partnership to bring about a positive change in society have been recognized by the central government.

However, Seno believes that it is more important for the farmers to receive some kind of state recognition for practising sustainable agriculture.

is a beacon of development and change in the state.

Sometimes it seems like my depression has gone away as I'm focused on my work. However, over the last two months, my parents have devolved into some serious turmoil and emotional destruction, with both of them crying and constantly complaining about each other to me. I feel very apathetic towards the matter but I still offer my support for them. But this apathy still gives me a troubling headache at times. I feel very frustrated and irritated at the slightest thing.

Recently, my friends, family and other acquittances have told me that I look very tired, world-weary, and ask if everything is alright. I feel dead. My eyes are open but sometimes it feels like I'm looking into a forever stretching abyss. I feel hollow, empty, and dead. I have lost my appetite for gaming, music, and now recently, even eating. I don't like eating, feels like a chore. I find it very hard to concentrate, drifting off within seconds of reading an article. Very short attention span and consistently fogged memory. All I want is sleep and that's the only thing I like.

I don't know if this is depression coming back, or am I just stressed out by it all from work and family issues. I just want to feel alive. I'm going on exchange for university starting September and I don't want to spend this golden opportunity in a down and drowsy mood. Emotions are contagious and I don't want to spoil the party.

 I wanted to give a bigger introduction but I'll leave that for another time and give you the short version. Basically, about 5 weeks ago I started an internship at a company as a sales analyst, they use Salesforce but had no one in charge of it in any shape or form. So I saw an opportunity there and took it, i self-taught using Trialheads, blogs &amp; of course trial and error. Now I'm the Salesforce guy in the company among other duties!

The company suffers from a lot of problems in the database department among others which I'm trying to address. I've been able to deal with everything I've come across so far such as dupes, improving layouts etc but I think now I've reached my biggest challenge which I'm hoping you guys could advise me on:

Our database consists of around 10,000 companies and 40,000 contacts but while pulling reports for a mailing list it became apparent that a large percentage of those contacts are well out of date and have now moved on or got promoted or changed contact info or are mislabeled etc. Note that we operate in the sports industry where people move around all the time

Why questions are

1- what are the best ways of first cleaning up the data and then making sure it stays up to date?

2- a good number of those contacts are connected to our employees on LinkedIn, could this be used to our advantage in terms of tracking their movement and contact details in at least a semi automatic way?

Thank you!"

Came to the States in 2014 to start my undergraduate education at an R2 university. Will be applying to grad schools next year. One of the programs that I want to get into is the M. Eng. program in CS at Cornell - it is a 9-month, terminal, intense degree program made to prepare students better for the industry. Realistically, I believe I have decent chances of getting into this as I have a pretty good profile - 4.0 GPA, solid GRE scores, 2 semesters of research, and 2 semesters of being head TA for a core course. The program is undoubtedly hectic, but I like challenges, and I believe I can manage and afford it. What I want to get out this degree is to emerge as a top candidate worthy of being considered for a full-time position at companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.


The main problem I have with this program is the lack of any professional (internship) experience I would be having by the time I finish this degree. I don’t have any experience as of now. I would like to get an internship in the summer of ’17 (before I start my grad school) but I am not sure if I am legally or officially able to do that THEN since I am on a student visa. I also do not have any opportunity to get an internship once I start my grad school as my program will end before the summer begins, and I will immediately have to search for full-time jobs and find one within 3 months after I get my degree, as soon as I get my OPT (Optional Practical Training). I have also thought about the prospect of deferring my acceptance to Spring, in case they even allow something like this.


Would this career path hinder or make it difficult for me to land the job I desire of?"

A month ago we had a storm that knocked out the phones and internet connection for half our work force. That guy was gone so I had to figure out how to fix it. That just doesn't seem normal to put on the intern. 

He does not give me adequate information on how to fix problems, he seems to just figure things out as he goes and he has even given me incorrect information in the past. Oh and I just found out today that he's leaving, no preparation or warning. He just says yep I won't be here for month.

That said, I'd still like some advice and what my realistic expectations should be. 

So after a failed attempt at a career as an artist, I've decided to go back to school for CS. I took the edX CS50 course, and have taught myself some js on top of that. While I could continue on the self-teaching route, school will get me where I want to be much faster and cost isn't an issue. Right now I'm leaning toward a BS as I really want a solid core competency. However I'd like some input on my options, as life at 31 has its own demands. 

I have BA in Physics from a 'public ivy' and a 3.5 gpa, so I feel confident about my application for a second BS. However of the top cs universities, only CMU accepts second bachelor's, which includes all public universities in CA and Stanford. As for personal restrictions, my wife works as a project manager in tech, so I'd rather not end up in a small college town. My short list is:

* CMU
* UW - Seattle looks really tempting,  Wife could get a good job and good tech companies for internships
* UMD - We live, and have family close by
* USC - used to live in LA, city has its ups and downs.
* Columbia
* NYU

My ultimate goal is getting a really great job at a really great company. While education and opportunity is a priority, so is a healthy life balance. An education at CMU sounds great, but it would mean moving to Pittsburgh, and then potentially summer internships in another city (I'm guessing). UMD provides some family support nearby. As for UW, we have some friends and relatives in the area there, and internships could be local. 

I guess my question is whether I'd be doing myself a disservice aiming for a BS at UW, and forgoing a better ranked school? Even as I'm writing this, I think UW is the best choice, and would make us both really happy. We really like Seattle and have friends and some relatives there, and I'm confident my wife could get a well paying job at a good company. 

**However, there's another option**, which is simply moving to the Bay area, and focusing on self teaching until I get a job, and then continue educating myself until I can get an MS. However, if I were to pursue this, I'm curious how my application would fair. The catch is my 3.5 gpa in Physics is only for a BA (not a BS) and while I had plenty of A's in math, I got two C's in Quantum Physics I &amp; II. Assuming I get some junior developer job eventually and work there for a while. How would my resume fair for Master's programs? What would be schools would be within reach?

Would love to hear feedback on what my expectations should be for either a BS at UW vs CMU or aiming for an MS down the road, given my two C's and lack of a CS undergrad. Thanks in advance."

I work for a computer consulting company who generally is quite good.  But this year is really ticking me off.

So every year we have a science fair.  Last year, only interns were allowed, but this year the interns have the option, but regular employees are allowed.  So I spent months working on my project.  Full disclosure, I'm not a great coder.

Here's the rub...not enough people signed up (me and 2 others), so toe encourage that, they offered prizes.  Awesome right?  And how many more people signed up?  One.  So my competition is now 3 others people...fine by me...but not the judges... so they changed the rules AGAIN.

The judges are now coaching 3-4 hand picked people with projects they want to see/develop.  Bear in mind, we had to submit ideas MONTHS in advance.  Not these guys...handed an idea, handed the implementation, handed the EXACT requirements from a judge of the competition.

Now I'm thinking I don't even have a chance of winning because...well...when you cater your project to what the judge wants, that's obviously far better than a project based on customer feedback (who does not get to judge).

Ticks me off, because I had 3 other people to compete with...now I have 7 and by playing by the rules, my chances of winning is now cut essentially in half.

I'll grant this is not a catastrophic thing, but it really pisses me off when things like this happen.  Play by the rules, get screwed."

I am entering my senior year in high school, and need to start applying to schools. I plan to double major in computer science and mathematics, along with a possible minor in music (probably piano performance, but perhaps conducting). I have made the first cut for the National Merit Scholar awards, and have a 33 on the ACT. I have also taken and passed 11 AP tests so far, most of them being 5's, with plans to take another 8 this year. I have had two internships over the last two summers. In 2015, I got to work at IBM's Linux Technology Center doing software tool and open source development. This last summer I worked IT Support at a local construction company. I was also lead software developer at my school's world championship qualifying robotics team. Unfortunately, last year there was trouble with some of my teachers. My English teacher graded harshly, and I ended up with a much poorer grade in that class than I had been getting previously. In addition to that, my Stats teacher was fired for grade rigging against my entire class. A massive shitstorm also went down in the music program with inappropriate relationships with the assistant teacher and a prior student, making the year tough for everyone at the school. I'm going to end up with something along the lines of a 3.7 raw cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale.

My question is what schools I should apply to.

Currently I am looking at (no particular order):

- Rice
- RIT
- University of Cambridge
- University of Oxford
- Imperial College London
- UW
- UT Austin
- Georgia Tech
- MIT
- UC Berkely

Any additional suggestions are much appreciated! I am looking for a good computer science school mostly, and would prefer a reasonably exciting city."

The only issue is for about a year now I can't decide if I want to be a mechanical/electric engineer working on robots or if I want to be a software engineer for places like Microsoft and google. I was thinking taking a year off in between to take up an internship. I live close to microsoft headquarters so I could try to find an internship there but idk about a mechanical/electrical internship. I was wondering if anyone could give me some insight on what I should do because I'm kinda lost right now."

First post here on this sub! I could seriously use your help. I am a MechEng Tech Student working an internship where I am making a testing device that utilizes PLCs. I actually really enjoy using them but they can be a pain to learn with no formal instruction, which is what I am experiencing now. So, by default I am reaching out to the PLC masters of reddit lol

I am slowly but steadily learning how to use ladder logic. I understand the basics of the relays contacts and outs along with timers. However, I need to use a counter and I cannot get it to work. 

Here is my ladder:
[in reversed order](http://imgur.com/a/WrauM)

What this is doing is controlling 3 solenoid valves. After the process of controlling the valves is complete I want it to repeat a certain number of time. Currently it loops indefinitely. Why isn't the counter counting? Sorry to be kinda vague but I will answer any questions!

Thanks guys

4x8o2l,2,2016-08-11,Undergrad trying to Pursue deep learning engineer or data scientist job in cybersecurity,willcodeforbanannas,security,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/4x8o2l/undergrad_trying_to_pursue_deep_learning_engineer/,"I wasn't sure where to post this. If you know a better sub for this to go in, please let me know. 

I’m currently a first year student in computer science, minoring in mathematics, going to a university where the focus is software engineering(or web development depending on your preference). My destination is kind of tricky. I want to work in cybersecurity as a deep learning engineer with the freedom to switch to  a data scientist role. The reason is both practical(some of the personal projects I want to create involve both skill sets), and economic(more freedom of opportunity, and depending on the company one may be more valuable than the other). correct me if I’m wrong, but the skill sets almost completely overlap, except DS requires more on the statistical analysis side, and less on the software engineering side(doesn’t employ advanced ML models, worry about “clean code”, or really build anything meant for anyone but the data scientist). 

now, from what I’ve read, outside of cybersecurity this would be pretty easy, as someone who can wear both hats is really valuable. I don’t know if this really holds true for cybersecurity though. I’d much rather focus on cybersecurity than business applications: to be fair, almost all the applications of programming, data science, and machine/deep learning outside of cybersecurity, the healthcare system, and government(al oversight) and tech seem uninteresting. I don’t want to work in finance, business, advertising, or web-based services(quora, linkedin, facebook).

Now I know the pathway if I didn’t want to do this in cybersecurity, computer science bachelors, spend my summers working on coding and trying to land internships at programming companies, take as many math courses as humanly possible, with linear algebra and statistics being fairly mandatory.  around my fourth year summer, try to land an internship at data science for social good. probably would go to CMU for their machine learning masters program, and just take every advanced statistics course I can.I would work on open source projects throughout my schooling. 

Now what do I need to tweak if my end goal is to work in cybersecurity? Is their particular companies I should try to intern with? Is there any certifications, or classes outside of school, I should take in order to improve my resume? Is there a machine learning program that would be a better fit other than CMU(that’s not Harvard; unless I get it paid for I don’t want to spend the next 20 years paying for [4:6])? Also a PhD isn’t an option I’m looking to take. At the current rate I’m going to be 30 or 31 getting out of my masters program. Worst case scenario, I don’t want to be getting my first job at 40, and still wind up making less than my peers who decided to stop at getting their Master’s. It would be preferable to work in another field then transfer to cybersecurity if getting a job in cybersecurity 

I’m taking classes at my college in java, though I spend my free time coding in python3. My current short term goal is to be coding with scrappy and selenium by next summer and to be generally skilled enough to land my first internship.  with the end goal in mind what are some other modules/tool sets I should get comfortable with at this early stage in my coding practice?

Well, straight to the point... The job I've been at the past 6 years is shutting it's doors in March (food manufacturer).  I'll have my associates degree in April. 

First question, I want to obtain an undergrad degree in either Computer Science or Computer Information Systems, which one would help gear toward a career in Information Security/cyber security?  I've read that a good amount of people getting ""cybersecurity""  degrees are not getting jobs due to improper training/not being truly qualified.  Which would be the best route to go? I live near Chicago and I don't want to go to a school more than a few hours away from here. 

Second question.  I'm a 32 year old male with no kids or anything to support, and because my factory is leaving us as ""dislocated workers,"" I can draw unemployment while going to school at the same time, however I want to gain some kind of experience, whether it being on my own or internships or etc.  What do you recommend in this situation while trying to support myself?

4x970e,1,2016-08-11,Should I take the better paying job or stay where I am?,zebluntone,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4x970e/should_i_take_the_better_paying_job_or_stay_where/,"Hi there! First time posting in this sub :) 
I am a 23F, and need some advice on whether I should leave my current low paying retail job and go work for another company with better pay. 

So from the beginning.. earlier this year I moved to a major metro downtown area with my boyfriend because he was offered a well paying and high position within his friends/ frat brother's start up company. Invested into by his friend's wealthy family. Great. Things are going pretty well for them.

Now, just this week they hinted they want me to be In charge of inventory once the product starts coming in so I would be the manager for that part of the company which means I'd be working full time and making between $15-18 hourly, and managing the other workers and whatnot.

Currently, I work at a retail shoe store making $10/hourly and only like 25hrs/ weekly, sometimes less. I like my job, I work with cool people. I just dislike having to be ""aggressive &amp; excited"" when selling our merchandise. But nonetheless, I just had my review and got promoted with a tiny raise, they just need me to be more outgoing with the customers, which again, I find tedious to my personality and always found it the reason for leaving previous retail jobs.

The problem: 1. the wealthy family with the start up are very stuck up, religious, judge mental people, the complete opposite type of people I ever associate myself with.
 2. I'm an aspiring graphic designer so I feel like I'd have a better chance of getting my foot in the door within my retail job as I've proven my diligence with management and I know I can probably get an internship at hq in the future, once I have my degree.
3. If I keep my retail job, I'd have to get a second part time job (which wouldn't be a problem to acquire) I would just have less time in my day. I feel like I'd be too tired to clean up and cook and workout and I'd also have school to deal with soon, along with taking time to practice my artistic skills. BUT I am pretty good at planning and organization so I think I can handle a hectic schedule once it's set in motion.

Should I take the good paying job and work for these douches or keep working hard at the bottom til I move up? 

SO, thank you so much for reading this. Any advice would be very helpful. Maybe anyone with a similar past experience or something would be great to read your input! 

Thanks!!!

I've done a nonimpressive front-end internship and I worked in front-end dev for about a year, but no research jobs where I could get a letter from a manager. I've done well in classes, but as far as I know, no one cares about the typical ""kittu_katsu got an A in my class, she showed up, yay"" style letter.

4x9n3v,5,2016-08-11,Was let go from my internship today,leobreaker78,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4x9n3v/was_let_go_from_my_internship_today/,"I really need to get this off my chest because I’m not sure how I feel about it and how I should. Today I basically got kicked out of an internship I’ve been doing at a startup for the past 3 months. I approached them on my own 3 months ago and the founder/CEO took me in.


I worked with him on electronics related stuff for about a week before I had to take a break due to endsem exams. After my exams I resumed my work there, but unfortunately the CEO was out of the city. Since it’s a small startup, he is always travelling himself and looking for clients. I was really bummed out because that guy is just awesome, and a pleasure to work under. I have loads of respect for him, even after everything that happened and my only regret is that I didn’t get to work with him enough. The startup builds robotics labs for schools and colleges. As an electronics engineering student, I am interested in robotics and this was supposed to be a great experience for me. Something to note was that the startup was very chilled out and so were the people. Everyone was always smiling, cracking jokes, sharing snacks, etc.
The problem is, I learned absolutely nothing in the 3 months I spent there. With the CEO gone, I had to work under one of the directors, which I absolutely hated. All the work I did under him was mainly research and assembling/testing some stuff. But I never once complained about the work I was given or refused to do it.
After 3 months all the projects I started were hardly 25% completed. Either I wasn’t able to figure out how to do some of the projects, or bad hardware prevented me from continuing and the only thing I actually completed was the research and basic assembling/testing/labor stuff. I told the director several times that I didn’t mind doing this work, but I would also like to do some work/projects that would teach me a new skill. He said okay and eventually gave me some new projects but they too reached dead ends and so I didn’t learn anything from them.


I also didn’t like the attitude of the director. Some of the stuff I was working on, I was very passionate about, and tried to do above and beyond, but he wasn’t interested in that and always told me just to do what he required. He also took a *long* time to make any decision(s). For example, he would never be satisfied with my project research. His requirements were vague and every idea I had was usually rejected. When he finally accepted something, and we needed to order the hardware required, he would again take a long time to order even though I gave him a list of materials and links we could purchase from. He also asked me to test some related hardware we already owned. It seemed to me like he was stalling because he knew I would be working there for a year and so there was immediate deadline.


Now for the reason I got kicked out. Yesterday I got into an argument with him regarding the state of my projects and how I hadn’t learned anything in 3 months. The “office” I work at is basically a 2-bedroom flat where a few of the directors live. Since there have been many interns in the past few weeks, all the rooms were almost always occupied. A mistake I made was starting the argument with him outside in the hall where many people were present. I had taken a look 5 minutes prior, and there were people in both the rooms so I decided to speak to him in the hall. My second mistake was that I spoke too loudly. I am recovering from a sore throat/flu/cold thing so my throat was dry and fucked up. I had no intention to speak loudly but I was told later that I actually was.


What sparked the argument was that he was refusing to order the parts for one of the projects I was doing because he still wanted me to test some more hardware. I got frustrated and confronted him about why he needed me to test more stuff when I had already tested most of the hardware that would be required for the new project and it would take a few weeks for the parts to arrive anyway – so why couldn’t he order them now so time wouldn’t be wasted? He went on to tell me that research is very important and that I should first make sure everything is working before we invest in the project. I countered by saying I have done weeks of research for this and the other projects I am working on but all of them have hit dead ends. We argued back and forth and I told him everything I typed above – how I hadn’t learned anything in 3 months, everything I was doing was just research oriented, my projects were not really electronics related, etc. I told him that I hadn’t learned a single new skill in 3 months. Every reply he gave me was vague and pretty stupid. The only thing he had to say about my projects hitting dead ends was that it was “bad luck”. I told him that if I wanted to add my internship work on my resume, I couldn’t say that I didn’t complete any projects because of bad luck, and at the rate we were going, I would not finish my desired number of projects in a year of working there. I emphasized on how I was willing to do this work, but I also needed to do something that would let me learn a new skill.
About 20% into the argument, it was clear to me that he didn’t want to have it. He kept trying to brush off what I was saying which pissed me off. Anyways we finished by him telling me to make an excel file stating what work I had done on what projects and what work was left. He left and went back to his desk. I was not satisfied with anything he said, so I approached him again after a few minutes and asked to speak with him privately in one of the rooms because I noticed it was empty.


Now in this conversation, from the beginning, I kept stating (repetitively throughout the conversation) that I was not angry or trying to antagonize him and only wanted to clear the miscommunication between us. However, I think he was angry at this point because the entire time we spoke, all he did was point out my mistakes/things I didn’t do and it seemed like he was implying that I hadn’t really done any work. Now I’ve worked on a lot of different stuff over the past few months, and some of those things transitioned into other projects, so I stopped working on the stuff that wasn’t directly correlated to the new project. I also didn’t complete a few small tasks that were pending from more than a month ago – but they were all very small things, just a couple hours’ worth of work. Mainly they were just insignificant compared to my main projects.


He started by saying that there was so much work left I had to do and brought up each and every little thing I hadn’t done. I mentioned that he was often vague with his requirements, but this time he went into detail about what he wanted and explicitly pointed out I hadn’t delivered any of that. I had nothing to say to any of that because it was the first time I was hearing him mention it in weeks and he had never previously told me he wanted it done in so much depth. I tried to tell him I never knew that much work was expected from me for those tasks and if I had known I would had done it, but he brushed it off saying he had already told me this before. 


At one point I asked him what I was doing wrong, and whether or not I was working/behaving to his standards. I told him that I wanted to know so that I could change my behavior/way of working to better suit his requirements. He flat out told me he had no interest in helping me change. I didn’t know what to say to that.


For some of the bigger projects, I told him that I wanted to work on a small version of it because I had never done something like that before and it was a bit advanced. I told him that getting a smaller version to work would ensure that the main version could also be implemented. He told me that he didn’t have the flexibility/resources to work on a prototype. The only reply I had was questioning him how he expected me to complete advanced things when I couldn’t confirm the basics were working, and he said that was my problem and if I couldn’t do basic things then he didn’t have time for me.


He brought some other stuff into the conversation that hurt me. I brought up many times that I had been working with him for 3 months, and he told me that it wasn’t true. I had taken a few 1 week leaves due to exams and it was more like 70%. He also told me that I didn’t stay the entire duration I was supposed to every day (3 hours). This was somewhat true, on the days when I finished a huge piece of work, I didn’t want to start something new with only 15-30 minutes of time left so I left early (he never complained once). But there were also many days when I stayed late to finish stuff. What he said regarding my attendance sounded like I wasn’t working enough, which really hurt because I was working and enjoyed a lot of what I did. At this point I started choking up so I just said ok and he ended the conversation by saying I was little and I would understand what he was saying when I matured (I’m 21). When I was leaving (he asked me to go home) one of the other directors (lowest in the chain of command) jumped on me for apparently speaking rudely with director I was working under since he was one of the main guys in the company. I almost started crying at that point because I never intended to insult or disrespect him, but I held my composure and left. Before leaving the director I worked under told me again to make the excel sheet with my project details.


Today, I decided I was going to do everything he said – complete all those small tasks quickly and finish testing everything so we could finish the projects asap. I hadn’t made the excel sheet, but I began working on one of the small leftover tasks. After completing it, I went to him and told him I finished it, and needed some clarification on another task. He told me not to do that work (struck me as odd) and asked me to make the excel sheet. I spent a while making a nice detailed sheet, which he checked, and then handed me a document stating that I had completed my 3-month internship at the company. I did not expect this, and I was really confused so I asked him if I was being terminated as an intern. He said yes, and told me that this was being done so my mistakes wouldn’t be repeated in future and that one day I would understand.
I just said thank you and left. The internship certificate was great, it said I worked on a variety of projects, did well at them and also had a line about me being a great intern.


I have replayed this in my mind over and over and I don’t know what to think. I’m very hurt because I was actually the first intern there before all the others arrived and in the end it seems like he threw me away because he got better interns. The company develops all their robots on a platform that I had no experience with, and I made this clear when I first approached them. I told them that although I had experience with a different platform that they didn’t use, I would be willing to learn anything. I felt I was close with everyone there, spoke with all of them every day, went out of my way many times to let them know of good deals/project opportunities and I even went on a hike with them once! I am shocked this one 30-minute incident was enough for them to cut ties with me. Did the 3 months I spent there mean nothing? Am I actually just a little kid like he said, who thinks he knows stuff but actually doesn’t know anything?


I am not a social person and have a hard time forming relationships with others. I thought that I was doing good this once, going out and approaching people to work for them, but in the end it seemed like I failed at this relationship as I do with most others.


The worst part? I don’t even know if the CEO is aware. He was out of town the entire time. I have so much respect for him and feel like I’ve disappointed him greatly. I know for a fact this never would have happened if I was working under him or if was in town (I would have spoken to him privately, as I’ve done many times before). I have decided to ask him to speak to the director I worked under and get feedback for me that I can actually use.


The only thing I can see that I did wrong was how I spoke to him. Speaking to him loudly, unprofessionally and in front of others was something I never intended to do, but it happened. I would not change anything I said to him, I still firmly believe what I said was true and valid. The only thing that really hurts is that I thought that despite not always seeing eye to eye, we were friends. But apparently not, since he threw away our 3 month relationship in a day.

Clearly this puppet is paid because he doesn't even try to have a brain of his own.  It's constant mindless reposts of anti-hill republican fed propaganda.  This man is the biggest fucking Trump hand puppet on the planet.  

Those are **only 3 of many** politically paid mindless propaganda trump dumb fucks spreading bullshit here on the norm and way too many of you fall for it hook line and sinker without looking at the user spamming on an otherwise fair political playing field.  

TLDR: Who is giving you your ""news""?  Before falling for some paid interns force fed bullshit, read who the user is who is posting it.  If you click on their name and they have literally nothing but political reposts chances are they are full of shit spammers who's accounts should IMHO be banned from here for not being real people."

Secondly, the school semester would not have even begun by then, which means I would not even have a chance to see what other companies are doing before making a choice. Is this normal? Or should they be giving more time, considering that school hasn't even started and that the internship is 8-9 months away? Thanks!

Also, I do love the company I worked at; it was fantastic. It's just that I feel scared graduating and yet not knowing what else is out there."

It's been over a month since this process started (applying/interviewing) for this internship and I'm not sure if I should just forget about the company or keep inquiring about their decision.  

(Sorry for the wall of text)  

So this year at my University's Career Fair I met a recruiter, ""D"", for this software company, she tells me that there aren't any internship positions at the moment, but they're planning on opening one up later on. She takes my resume, a couple weeks later, has me fill out a general application on the company website. I don't hear anything else from her or the company till early this July.  

**Week 1**: Another recruiter, ""B"", calls/emails me to see if I'd be interested in a new SWE intern position that opened up at the company. Has me apply for the job on their website, listing has already been taken down (before they even get in contact with me), so B has me apply to another position and he'll just mark it so they know it's for this particular internship. I do a coding assessment, turn it in that weekend so they can start doing interviews the following week.  

**Week 2**: I don't hear anything back from B.  


**Week 3**: I email at the beginning of the week about an update about my coding solution/continuing the application process. B emails me back saying the HM will get back to him about setting up interview. Calls me later and sets up an interview for later this week.  I interview with 2 Senior Engineers and then with the Director. I'm told that they'll make a decision the following week, so I'll hear then.

**Week 4** B calls to followup on the interview, see how it went, and then informs me that one of the Engineers is at a conference, it shouldn't last the whole week, and so I should hear back early the following week. 

**Week 5**: Don't hear anything from the company or B.

**Week 6**: I call and leave a message with B about a status update. B then emails me a couple days later saying he's at a company office in a different location and hasn't heard anything yet. He'll update me the following Monday when he gets back in the office.

**Week 7**: Current week, still no calls or emails.  

I feel like if I didn't get the internship, that's fine, it was nice to experience the whiteboarding process, etc, but they should at least be able to inform me of their decision. So my question is, should I email/call B again for an update? Or just let it go and move on?

Basically, this is the situation:
-I move into a residence near ULB in Brussels because I'm a Stag (intern) at Parliament for 2 months
-This is a privately run student residence
-The girl who I'm subletting from said she almost didn't get her deposit back because she didn't ""vacuum under the bed"" and the landlord lost her shit and said she would have to hire a cleaning crew to clean the mess up
-I move in and get everything, except for a locker in the kitchen that I am meant to put food in but that doesn't bother me because I eat out all the time and have some salt and oil and lemon juice at home and that's basically it, so I keep it in my room
-My current roommate is in France where she lives for the summer so I only meet her once and she seems normal enough
-While I am on vacation in Greece, my landlord enters the room (with my knowledge) to show the architect of the building some problems with the design, and takes pictures of the state of my room (there is luggage on the floor and my bed is not made) and sends these pictures to me saying my room is unacceptable 
-I move out at the end of July and my landlord evaluates my room and says it is all fine
-She emails me after I land back in Canada (where I live) and says she will send me my deposit back sometime within the week
-It's been 1.5 weeks and she sends me an email saying me roommate came home and found that a bunch of her things were touched
-She sends me pictures that the roommate took of her things touched (note: I did not touch her things but that's besides the point)
-Landlord then says she will not return my deposit to me until she gets an explanation out of me about why the things were touched
-Why did she not send the deposit back to me the week before? I have no idea
-Only one of the pictures actually contains something that belongs to me -- my oil, salt, and vinegar that I left in the food locker that was meant for my room
-I admit to the landlord those are mine and I meant to take them but forgot
-Landlord says she will wait for a reply from the roommate before sending me the deposit
-I have no idea what the roommate has to do with a damage deposit, because the landlord is contractually obliged to return my deposit to me if i have fulfilled all my contractual obligations
-my contractual obligations in short are: be the only person staying in my bed, pay my rent, do not damage property of the landlord
-i have done all of those things
-she confirmed to me via email she would return the deposit and then for some reason held on to it for another week until she found a reason to keep it
-now she is saying that i left the locker in an unacceptable state because i forgot my oil salt and lemon juice
-i cannot believe i am losing out on 780 euro because of that


Can I do anything? I have contacts in Belgium who could act on my behalf, I guess."

I'm not sure if this would be worthwhile as I've already gotten permission from my boss and another supervisor to use them as employment references in the future. Is that not enough?

I'm wondering because I got this internship by searching on joblink and going to the career fair (and I plan to do the same thing again for next summer). I don't remember seeing any companies ask for a letter of recommendation. Any RPI alumni or upperclassmen who can weigh in on this? Is the letter of rec a relic of the past like the cover letter?

I am definitely in need of some guidance so any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I'm about to start my senior year studying Computer Science and I've done well in all of the courses I've taken. While that's true, I have never worked on a project outside of Python/C/C++ code for labs in classes and feel as though it's time for me to do so. I have zero web development experience (which annoys me because I feel as though this is something I should have learned studying CS for the past 3 years) so I am at a total loss of where to even begin.

I want to create something simple, my idea is this: There is a paleontology database which has GPS coordinates of dinosaur findings. I simply want to retrieve these coordinates, plot them out onto a Google Map, and when a user clicks on a point information and a picture will be displayed about that specific dinosaur/finding. That's it.

I feel as though I am fairly proficient with Python (internship this past Summer was writing Python scripts to download data, web scrape, etc.). After fiddling around with this idea and looking at the JavaScript API for Google Maps, the first thought I had was to web scrape the GPS coordinates using Python, store those coordinates into a file/database, use JavaScript to read from this file/database and output the points onto the map.

I'm pretty sure I'm *way* over-complicating this and that there must be a better solution. I've looked at a bunch of different things but I really just don't know where to start. I obviously need to use JavaScript but should I use Python at all? Can I use Python for this whole thing? Do I need to learn and use jQuery/Ajax/something else? Do I need to learn a framework like Django/Flask? I'm feeling super overwhelmed even though this should be a really simple task (I assume). This is something that I'd ultimately like to deploy as a website/webapp.

Any help/guidance would be really appreciated. Thank you! "

The thing is, the grad school requires I submit a resume (besides SOP and objectives, etc).

I looked online and I am having trouble identifying what I should try to emphasize more and what changes to make.

1. Do I keep it ~1 page still?
2. Do I emphasze my coursework to a greater degree? For example, I worked in energy and im going to apply for computer science...there wasn't much comp sci related stuff in the energy job I was doing it (it was engineering 100%).
3. do I discuss irrelevant research and internships?

I know my resume can get me a job, but I don't know about how to go about changing it for graduate school. I think you guys are more familiar with grad school applications so I am posting here as opposed as opposed to resumes first to see what I can get. 

Also: I am planning on getting 1 LOR from a professor and 2 from my workplace (who had nothing to do with comp sci). Is that ok, or should it all be professors?

4xatn9,6,2016-08-11,"I'll never be happy with who I am, and I don't think I can live like this anymore",jemafds,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/4xatn9/ill_never_be_happy_with_who_i_am_and_i_dont_think/,"I’ll preface by saying that I have a lot of issues. I’ve been diagnosed with pretty bad OCD (although no one in person knows this) and I was abused for a long time growing up, so I’m a pretty fucked up person. For some reason, my entire life I’ve been obsessed with the idea of being absolutely perfect. Like a doll or an android or even just a really elaborately photoshopped and dressed up model. With getting older comes realism, and as much as I’ve tried to be perfect and beautiful, I don’t think it’s possible for me.

I attend a top university, fully paid for by scholarships, make great money working as an intern at a Fortune 500 company, will be doing research in Europe next summer. I have the ideal life that I always dreamed of.

But I *hate* myself. I can’t stand who I am. A lot of times I wish that I was a part of a specific religious or ethnic group so that I had a community to cling onto that would tell me that I’m wonderful for being a part of it. But I don’t even have that. I’m a total mutt, but fully European and white (seriously, there’s not a single region of Europe in which I have no relation to people). I’m not religious. My family is just generic American middle class, and we don’t have any real traditions (we have good times and things that we do, but no culture whatsoever). I hate being American. Regardless of going to a great school known internationally, whenever I’m around someone from a different country, at work or otherwise, I feel immediately inferior, because I know that my early education was inferior and that they’re much smarter than me and have had a much better life than me growing up, much more cultured and diverse and well-rounded. They’re just better people than me. And I know they think the same thing. Why would they think positively of me?

I know even now that I’ll die young by suicide. I already plan to kill myself by my thirties because I know that I’ll never be satisfied with my life, no matter what. And it’s bad enough while young, so I don’t want to have to deal with things when I’m old. That’d be infinitely worse. A personality-less, boring, below average old white lady? The world has enough of those.

So I’d like to experience life now, and I try to do interesting things, but there’s a constant background noise of being generic and useless. I really bring nothing interesting to the table. I don’t enhance anyone’s life. I’m not interesting or exotic. I’m not beautiful. I’m not smart. I thought I was smart when I was little– I was in gifted classes and everything. But they kicked me out, saying it was a mistake, and put me back in regular classes.

And I feel inferior around pretty much everyone, so I can’t enjoy a single moment. My best friend? Better than me because he went to private school. My coworker? Better than me because she’s almost fully Italian and grew up around a rich culture. My best friend from abroad? Better than me because she’s from a European country and got a much better education/life experience growing up, she probably thinks I’m a trashy American and thinks nothing but ill of me, doesn’t take my work seriously, etc.

I also have severe eating issues, stemming from my insecurities and my OCD. When I was in high school, I starved myself because even though I’d always been thin and had a below average BMI, I convinced myself that I wasn’t “European thin” and that I needed to be smaller than a US extra small to fit into a European small, so I lost 30 lbs (went down to 92 lbs) very quickly and ended up really sick from being malnourished. Now I’m 120-ish, although a little taller, and I feel disgusting, like all of my non-American friends think I’m a hog. But I was directed to gain weight, and I gained back to my original weight (which is probably normal for me, considering BMI, but who knows. I don’t feel nice or pretty anymore though).

Ideally, this is who I’d want to be, and the issue is that I *can’t* be this person because I wasn’t born this way. But ideally, I’d be 
-A lot smarter than I am, and clearly smart, not just a hard worker
-Born anywhere but America, grown up with culture
-Distinctive looking without trying
-Very thin and svelte
-Good teeth
-Likable and relatable. Can make friends easily
-Not as neurotic 
-Multilingual by upbringing
-Cultured
-Does things right the first time– doesn’t fuck up all the time
-Much smaller thighs 
-Flat stomach, not “marshmallow” texture despite being pretty flat already
-Good athlete

I could go on. And on and on. The majority of those things are things I can never change. My upbringing is my upbringing. I was abused or 9 years. I never had a culture. I never played sports. The deed is done. I’m light complexioned no matter what I do, I hate my skin color. I think darker skinned people are much more beautiful. I look like unbaked bread. My face is fat even when I’m skinny. I’m completely unlikable, especially to myself. And if I can’t have the life I want, I can’t live. I can’t live like this."

Furthermore, my school also has a good relationship with dartmouth and I actually know a woman who wants to interview me from Dartmouth (she was once my boss). I have several other Dartmouth grads who wish to write me a letter of rec.

She texted, ‘Are we still on for tonight?’


He answered, ‘Yes.’


‘Can you get kinky?’


‘How kinky?’


‘Ben Wa balls.’


Charla waited and waited for his response. He was probably using a search engine to find out what Ben Wa balls are. 


Finally, his response. ‘In you, right?’


'Of course.’


‘I can accommodate that.’

Thomas Keller was a good looking man with strong looking hands and a great smile under his hipster beard. At least that how he looked on his profile picture.


“Ms. Fox?”


Charla looked up to see her summer intern Jason Graham standing at the door. A twenty three year old kid with charming good looks, the senior from Columbia had been her gopher all summer in her investment banking department. He stepped in with a three inch thick manila envelope.


“The contracts from Wassermans are here,” he said, setting the envelope down on her desk.


“Good. Thanks. Have a seat. I want to talk to you,” she said, setting down her phone.


He sat looking a bit anxious and confused. He should. She was wearing her power suit for her breakfast meeting she had this morning with executives in from the firm’s west coast office. And though her jacket hung on the coat rack and her blouse was delicate and lady like, she still had the aura of a boss with her keen deep blue eyes set in an alabaster face framed with lush dark hair. Jason took a seat across from her.


Charla said, “Well, I just wanted you to know that I think you did a good job and I appreciated your efforts.”


He looked relieved. Charla pushed an envelope his way saying, “You’ve earned this letter of recommendation.”


“Thank you,” he said, taking it and pocketing the letter in his jacket’s breast pocket. “I was going to ask but I didn’t want to push it.”


“Can I take you out for lunch? Show you my appreciation for all of your coffee runs.”


“Uh, yeah sure. Thanks.”


The two walked to a noisy steak house where she and Jason got a booth in a dark corner where the ordered lunch and drinks. The two never returned to the office, drinking the afternoon away, as she shared her tips on how to succeed in cut throat corporate America. When Charla saw the orange light of a sunset glaring through the one shaded window, she realized how late it was. The crowd was becoming more raucous and women in tight dresses were now mixing with the men at the bar. Her buzzing phone skittered over the table. She picked it up, tapping the screen to read the message.


From: Thomas Keller ‘Sorry. Can’t make it.’


Translation: ‘Sorry, I found a hotter woman.’


“Shit,” she said, slamming down her phone.


“What?” he asked.


“That was my date for tonight. He can’t make it. I’m about to lose a bet.”


His brows furrowed in confusion. She sipped her drink and thought what the hell, tell the guy. The shock value alone will be worth it.


“My girlfriends and I give each other sex toys, you know to spice up our sex lives, and we take pictures of using them as proof that they were used. If you don’t, you have to buy the girls a gift. We meet tomorrow. I need to prove that I used my gift.”


“And what did you get, if you don’t mind me asking?”


Charla looked both ways before pulling the box from her bag and handing it to him. She had planned to go straight to her date after work and had brought them along. Jason opened the box and looked at the heavy silver balls.


“What are these?” he asked.


“They’re Ben Wa balls. They’re used to tighten and stimulate your pussy.”


He quickly closed the box and handed it back to her. His eyes lingered on hers before looking down in submission. He grabbed his beer.


He asked, “So you just going to shove them in?”


“My date was going to do that and take the picture.”


“So, you need help?”


She looked at him and laughed. He looked dejected and she stopped laughing to reach out and touch his hand.


“You’re my intern. There’s this thing called ethics.”


“As of four p.m., I’m no longer your intern.”  


The executrix and her former intern took a ride share to the lower east side where they walked up a flight of stairs to her apartment. He looked around her airy modern apartment three times larger than his with teak wood floors, plush rugs, well placed artwork and streamline furniture.


“Drink?” she asked.


“Sure. I’ll have what you’re having,” he said, sitting on a butter yellow leather couch.


She stepped into her kitchen and sliced some lime before throwing ice into two tumblers, splashing vodka over them and garnishing the drinks with lime wedges. She handed him his drink and sat beside him, drunkenly kicking off her shoes.


He said, “Nice place.”


“Thanks,” she said, gazing at him with a silly grin on her face as she played with her hair.


“I’ve got to be honest with you. You made my day when you walked by my desk. The way your ass flexes under those tight skirts, it made me chub every time. I mean I’m not sick, and I was taught to respect women, but you,” he said, biting his lip. “You, with that dark hair and those blue eyes and that body. I just wanted to get up in that.”


“You watched me walk by?”


“Every day.”

She giggled before kissing him again and again until they were making out like horny teens in the backseat of a car. His arms pulled her against him until her boobs smashed against his body. Panting, she pushed him away and he opened his eyes to see her flushed face.


“The balls,” she said. “I need to get a picture.”


He sat up as she reached for her purse and pulled out the box and her phone. She set the phone on the coffee table before removing one ball from the box which she raised between the both of them. He kissed it with his bow shaped lips which brushed her fingertips. She handed him a ball before standing to her feet to unzip and shimmy out of her pants. She stepped out of her panties and stripped off her top as well, to stand in front of him dressed only in a black scalloped lace bra. He couldn’t take his off the neat strip of sable fuzz on his boss lady’s pussy inches from his nose. The steel ball was warming in his hand as she leaned over to loosen his tie and unbutton his shirt. She kissed his waiting lips, straddling his lap to sit her naked bottom on his thighs. She took his face in his hands and kissed his lips before drunkenly falling over onto the couch. She giggled, flexing her pedicured toes, lazily gazing at him as she watched her handsome young assistant get up.


“You want to take pictures, Ms. Fox?” he said, getting up to aim the lamp light her way. “Let’s make a movie.”


Jason picked up her camera, aimed it at the couch, and propped it up against a candle before pressing on the video recording button. He plucked the second ball from its box as Charla became comfortable spreading her legs a little to accommodate him.  
The camera recorded as he bent to lick her clit. Her fingers roamed in his soft hair as she pressed his head into her moist private warmth. He looked up into the camera before kissing the silver ball, then backed up to insert it inside her wet fold. Charla moaned with pleasure. Her head sank into plush pillows as she processed the feeling of heavy cold steel inside her. Jason backed away to make sure the camera caught it all. He stared at his former boss writhing and hissing like a cat in heat, knees up, cunt out, her swollen pink nub peeking out from between her controlled fuzziness. The sight made him very hard in his pants which he’d take off only if invited. He still thought of her as the boss lady but he couldn’t take it anymore. He dove down between her legs to suck on what teased him the most. 


“Oh, Mr. Graham,” she said, enjoying the weight of the ball inside her as his tongue tripped and slopped over her clit. 


She contracted and relaxed her Kegel muscles over and over, feeling the steel ball against her soft accommodating insides as Jason planted his palm on her inner thigh to spread her legs and lick a little deeper inside her. He took the second ball and popped it into her pink moistness. She arched her back against the couch as he nuzzled the secret flesh he was privileged to kiss.
Charla panted out, “Okay, turn off the camera.”
Jason reached over for the phone, fumbling with it until the screen went black. 


He asked, “You want me to take them out?”


“What’s the rush?”


He returned to his obsession, burying his head between her legs once more. Charla clutched her knees around his shoulders as she sighed in absolute heaven at the tongue bath he was giving. It went on all night.


Charla awoke in her bed to the grey morning light with Jason beside her. She nearly panicked when her arm hit his back curled up beside her. With an overwhelming sensation to pee, she got up, wrapped a robe around her and walked into the bathroom. She peed as she held the Ben Wa balls still in her. She wiped and rose a little, steadying herself into a squat to take out the balls. She was just about to insert a finger to fish them out when she thought about it. Maybe her pussy does need a little tightening. After all, the ex-husband was a stud with a solid nine inches of girthy length. Four years of his kind of pounding would make any girl wonder if her pussy will snap back into shape. Hmmmm. Maybe she’ll wear them a little longer. "

He told me he wants to personally train me over the course of five or six years. By then I will have graduated and presumably begun working full time at the company. He says that the job is very secure and that I'm basically guaranteed a job at the company if I accept.

He has tried this once before with another intern but found that the other guy just wasn't up to it. He lacked passion for the work and could not remain focused. He says, ""this is really something you have to love to do.""

Obviously, this is a HUGE commitment. This man expects that if I accept, I will train under him for the remaining three years of college, as well as a couple years beyond that. I will also probably study more along that branch of EE. Basically I will be setting my entire career path in stone. I don't really like the sound of that.

4xbsxi,1,2016-08-12,Offer location,alsuhr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4xbsxi/offer_location/,"I am asking for my partner, who I'm helping with career things at the moment.

My partner recently completed an internship at Big Tech Company where he received a lot of positive feedback from his team/manager, and was offered a fulltime position after graduation (he has one more year of undergrad). 

His company does not put fulltime location in the offer letters. They say that they don't know what positions will be available in those locations, and will notify the employee in Q4... which is so late! However, as far as I'm aware this isn't the case for all such companies (my offer last year was for a particular location without specific team position, at a different similarly-sized company). 

He doesn't want to work at their headquarters, but in another city in which they have an office (I am going to graduate school in that city). We aren't sure of the size of the office but it does have software engineering positions available. However, the number of open positions on their job board is 5% of what are available in their headquarters, so it is likely a small office. Throughout his internship he has emphasized that he wants to work in this city to his coworkers/recruiter.

His offer expires in a week, but I have personally been able to extend offers past those deadlines (especially fulltime offers).

He is having a lot of anxiety about the offer letter. I don't think it's reasonable for a company to leave off a location on an offer letter, personally. He also only has a week to decide. He hasn't spoken via phone to his recruiter, and hopefully can extend the offer and get more assurance that he can find a position in the city. He is starting to apply for other tech companies in the city. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? What advice would you have for him?"

Scam?,RevenantFiend,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4xbvkl/what_is_going_on_here_job_offer_letter_after_a_10/,"I have had an interesting history of getting job offers in this way, so I'm not as skeptical as I used to be, but still very skeptical. My very first job was as a summer intern for a large company. I went in to interview and I wasn't asked any questions, the CEO of the company just talked to me about random stuff like sports and what I'd be doing in the job for 15 minutes and offered me the job. Pretty cool right? Well it happened again with another company after I graduated college, I was looking for a job as a fresh graduate and got a call from a government contractor who saw my resume on Monster and asked if I could come in that day to interview. I literally walked in and he introduced me to the people I would be working with, asked me like 3 technical questions and offered me the job. I said maybe 50 words the entire interview. So to get the story. I got a call yesterday from a lady with a different government contractor. She went over my resume with me and said she was going to send me a contingent job offer letter that I had to sign after 10 minutes of just reading my own resume to me, saying ahh, yess good, yess, you know this, that and the other, yesss good.. I am really confused here because I literally was asked no questions. Again, I said like 50 words the entire interview. And this is for a very technical position working with high tech, costly equipment. I could have basically lied about everything on my resume. Do I have the best luck in the world for getting job offers or is this a scam? The other job offers I got seemed like pure luck because I said basically nothing and got the jobs, but this one just seems fishy because she never even met me in person. "

It's a prestigious all-girls institution that had the creme de la creme of the academically elite.  Anyone who attends and graduates pretty much have any pick of college they want. And you, a recent Yale graduate had just recently applied for a teaching internship there to help speed up the process of receiving your state teaching certificate. You're excited to see how much has changed since the four years since you graduated. But even more, you're excited to help guide some of the nation's brightest girls into their future.

After a quick visit with the principal, you found yourself assigned to class 6B. As you stride down the hallway, you can hear other teachers and students chatter away about the class. How they can tear a whole room apart in a matter of minutes. How they made their last teacher suffer a mental breakdown so bad that he was forced into a very early retirement. You shove those thoughts away.  They're only sweet little sixth graders. How bad can they possibly be? You approached the room and opened up a literal hell.

The class room was covered up and down in graffiti, loud punk music was playing in the corner. Hell, even some of the girls were busy putting their hands and lips all over each other. You just couldn't believe your eyes. Your first real teaching job, but they stick you with the worst of the worst. And being a young girl at some point, you instantly recognize the leaders of this troublesome class.

Ally: A girl with a very developed body for her age, And modified the conservative uniform to show off her skin and curves. She seems to use her body as a manipulation tactic.

Jackie; A very tomboyish, but cute looking African-American girl. She seems to have no problem smoking a cigarette right in the middle of the class room.

And Rachel: The de facto queen bee as she's happily overseeing the class from the teacher's desk and chair as if she's teaching the class.

You want to back down and resign. But then you start to think about how that could make you a failure. You'd be quitting your first teaching job without having anything done. So, with determination, you decide to bring these girls in line. Somehow...

(And that's my prompt! I'm looking for a a long-term, story heavy roleplay, but of course there will be naughtiness abound. I envision an older girl and a younger girl for this so ladies only fellas. If interested, please message me your Kik and we can discuss the story in greater detail and start playing.I'll take about 3-4 partners at a time, so don't worry. I'll get to you at some point. I look forward to hearing from you! &lt;3)

It's time to see which teams had a good plan, and who's plans were terrabad and they should feel bad!

---

**Gay Goblins** - We will be doing Option 2.
Trent tells Dominic to say the following, ""Hey Chris, before you say anything, please let me go first. I know I've been a domi-dick for a long while now and I just want to say how sorry I am for that. It's just that the combination of your looks and being a host of a successful show made me insecure, and so I acted out and just began to spiral. Every nasty thing I said wasn't really about you, it was just how I viewed myself, and for that, I totally understand why I got banished to the Abyssal Plains. I really needed the time to sort things out and realize how unhealthy this relationship was. All I want for you is to be happy and with someone you care about, and I'm starting to understand that I might not be the best person for you. I also brought some things I think you'll like. (At this point he hands over the gifts that will be explained below) I know it's not much, but I think you should take it. One is a little sculpture of you I made when I was first banished. I think it really captures how great your hair looks and that chiseled jawline. I also brought a series of scary stories that feature the Abyssal plains. Even if you don't like scary stories, I figured some of the scenes could be fun to force the contestants to act out in some challenges. I guess that's all, but ultimately I just wanted to say how sorry I am, and that I'm sorry for any way I mistreated you in the past.
Duncan will provide the scary stories from his own personal stash of horror novels that are popular within the kingdom, and the figure will be a wood sculpture that Duncan made with his own woodwork skills.

**Alrighty, let's see what I liked about your submission first; “domi-dick” was inspired and hillarious, sucking up to me also would work pretty well as I am pretty egotistical, I'm a fan of horror novels, so that's good, I love that you also bring up my sadistic nature of wanting to preform horror story feats on you guys. I also appreciate that the entrire post wasn't one big begging mess.
Now for the things you did poorly, first off, there are no trees in the Abyssal plains, so getting a wooden sculpture from there was an obvious lie, that and Domonic has no artistic capabilites whatsoever. To be honest, that's the only problem I have, otherwise, your submisson was acceptable, and would be enough for me to take Domonic back.** - **80/100**

**Total – 127/300**

---

**Noble Nobles** - I'm resubmitting our plan. There was, believe it or not, some stuff I left out that I felt needed to be added.
For our choice, we are going to do Option 1. But we're going to trick Domonic into trying to apologize.
I, Gerry, will put on a blackish-gray wig and act as Chris. If there are no wigs readily available, then I'll run to a dressing room and get one. If there are literally NO WIGS OR HAIR PRODUCTS ANYWHERE, we can just roll with it. Ryan will direct Domonic to me to apologize. He will also give Domonic a long poem (4 pages) to read, so he can apologize to me. If I'm currently gone or looking for a wig, Ryan can go over the poem with Domonic and help him practice to buy me time. But I DON'T think that'll be necessary. Just making sure. If Domonic asks, Ryan is my (Chris's) ""bodyguard"".
I will play hard to get with Domonic, stalling him as long as possible, having him read the poem and try to impress me however he can, by showing off more recitals/body/etc. Whilst Domonic is attempting to apologize to me, the team of Mike, Tom, and Ella will be preparing and strengthening the ritual. If Domonic notices them, we can say they're my new ""interns"" setting up a ""Chris Worshipping Center"". If Domonic doesn't recognize me as Chris, I can make an excuse saying ""I haven't put on my makeup and gel yet."" Also if he doesn't recognize me in my outfit, I can say that I'm ""getting ready to host an extremely dangerous (only for the contestants) tennis challenge."" IF he thinks my voice is weird I can say I got a strained voice from ""yelling at the dumb contestants."" If all else fails and he tries attacking someone, Ryan can punch him and I can yell things at him to piss him off and distract him. Or also hit and punch him, if necessary. Mike and Tom can even sneak in for extra support and hit him, whilst Ella finishes the ritual.
Once Domonic finishes reciting his long poem &amp; apologizing, OR starts to freak out and come near Ella, I will give him a kiss to incapacitate him, followed by helping Ryan (and Mike and tom if necessary) to hit/restrain him long enough for Ella (if she needs help, Mike and tom) to cast the ritual.
One last thing. If Domonic sees the real Chris, I can claim he's a ""stunt double."" A good host needs his doubles.
...And that's it. Basically trick Domonic into thinking that he's about to apologize, keep him distracted, and jump him if necessary.

**Alrighty, so I'm pretty sure you stole the plot of this story directly from one of history's most famous works of art… red riding hood. “Oh what great strange tennis clothes you have Chris” “All the better to host tennis challenges with my dear!”. Plagerism will not be accepted under any circumstances! But in all seriousness, like red riding hood, your entire plan relolves around Domonic being incredibly idotic, like, a brain-dead level of stupid, which just wouldn't work. Since that takes away the entirety of your distraction plan, all that's left is for your team to jump him, and… kiss him. Which isn't going to work. While the plan wasn't good, I do appreciate the use of the other option in the challenge, so I'll give some pity points** - **20/100**

**Total – 80/300**

**Boastful Bards** - While Scott hides and prepares the ritual in the back, Josee approaches Domonic and tries talking to him. She tells him she knows what Chris feels about the whole thing, she knows that he wants to get back together with him as well. She tells him she wants to help him. This will be an attempt to stall for time, as Josee's talking will take some time, and so will Domonic's response, which will probably be him replying with his feelings. From here, two things could happen:
If she actually does convince him, he'll talk and there'll be a whole touchy-feely moment and she'll approach him for a hug, but she'll knee him in the balls instead, which is also a signal for the others. If she fails and he tries to hurt her, she'll (very loudly) yell NOW, and back off. If the yelling happens, the loudness will also be an attempt to startle Domonic and confuse him for at least a few seconds. In both cases, Domonic will be distracted, either from pain or from getting startled.
Either way, in both cases, Izzy will hit Dominic in the back with multiple arrows. As he recovers from the pain, Lightning will come out of the shadows and run at him with his OP strength and punch Domonic down. While he's pinned down, Izzy will shoot arrows in his eyes which will knock them useless, thus no more laser vision. (Also, it will be hard for Domonic to hurt Izzy as she'll keep changing her position. It'll be hard for him to hurt Lightning because he's in pain from Izzy's unexpected arrows and he won't see Lightning coming at him with extreme momentum while yelling the war cry of Shabam!)
After his laser vision is gone, Tyler shows up and gives longswords to Josee and Lightning. As Dominic gets up, the three circle him, each standing 120 degrees apart from each other. Josee, being the shortest, focuses her strikes on his legs, which makes it harder for him to move. She will strike them hard, and not only will that make it harder for him to move, but it will also make it impossible for him to fly as he's too weak. Tyler focuses on his chest, while Lightning focuses on his arms. While all this is happening, Izzy is also shooting arrows at his head. (Keep in mind that while the 3 swordsmen are always 120 degrees apart, they don't have a fixed position, which means they're always rotating, which makes it harder for Domonic to hit them. Plus, remember that he has arrows in both his eyes, so he pretty much can't see either.)
Finally, when Domonic has taken enough hits to get weakened, the three swordsmen will all strike a sword through his chest and pin him down. Scott will come, and finally cast the ritual, and Domonic is sent back.


**This is actually a pretty good submission, and essentially everything I was looking for in the combat side. I literally have one one thing that faults it. Which is this line “he won't see Lightning coming at him with extreme momentum while yelling the war cry of Shabam!)” If Lightning is yelling, Domonic will notice. Your also putting a lot of faith into Izzy's so-so archery skills.** - **80/100**

**Total – 110/300**

---

And there you guys have it! The **Gay Goblins** win the challenge, and I'm reunited with Domonic, by the way, here are Carrie, Topher and Noah, I figured you'd want as many people as you can, because both **The Noble Nobles and The Boastful Bards** are going to need to sacrifice one of their own in this vote!

See you at dinner! I mean Elimination!"
4xcncd,20,2016-08-12,Pokemon Go (not-so) basic guide: What are IVs and are they important to you? PART 2,Neverlake,PokemonGo_Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGo_Singapore/comments/4xcncd/pokemon_go_notso_basic_guide_what_are_ivs_and_are/,"Hi all, I’m back again to bring in a more in-depth guide for IVs. This is for people who want to fully understand how IVs work.

Who am I? 
I made a casual guide for people to gain a basic understanding of what IVs are and whether they should be bothered with IVs. LINK: https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGo_Singapore/comments/4x6oa1/pokemon_go_basic_guide_what_are_ivs_and_are_they/
I’m currently level 25. An intern at a law firm by day, a pokeball throwing enthusiast at night. I did get a little head start as I played Pokemon Go for a week in the UK when it was released there.

What is this guide?
It is more detailed guide on IVs compared to the first guide. The first guide was sort of to inform people that something called IVs existed and how IVs impact them. This guide will go into the specifics. So I recommend reading the other guide first if you are clueless about IVs (link above). I apologise for the long read, I think writing long bodies of text is becoming a habit due to law school…

So here goes…
_________


What are base stats?

Each pokemon species has a base stat that is constant for all pokemons of that species. What this means, all the freaking magikarps will have the same stats as all other freaking magikarps of the same level. Same goes for every other species e.g. pidgeys, pikachus, purple rats, slimy purple thing, bigger slimy purple thing. This is BEFORE taking into account IVs. 
Example-time: Snorlax has a base stat of 180 Attack, 180 Defence and 320 Stamina at max level (40.5). So all Snorlaxes (I think that’s the plural of Snorlax) will have those exact stats, if they had no IVs. So at half of max level, Snorlaxes will have 90 Attack, 90 Defence and 160 Stamina, once again not taking IVs into account. At quarter of max level, Snorlaxes will have 45 Attack, 45 Defence and 80 Stamina. Hope that I am being clear here. 



So… What is max level?

Max level in Pokemon Go for Pokemon is 40.5. In Pokemon Go, Your Pokemon’s level is capped by your trainer’s level. Only when your trainer is at max level of 40 (take your time, its part of the Pokemon journey), will your Pokemon be able to reach the max level of 40.5. So if you are not 40 (everyone who doesn’t cheat), your Pokemon’s level will be capped. How do you know if your Pokemon has reached the max level for your current trainer level? If you cannot power up your Pokemon anymore, the game would notify you along the lines that your Pokemon cannot be powered up anymore till you level up your trainer level. You can tell how close your Pokemon is to the level cap by the semi-circle above them when viewing them (individually) in your Pokemon tab. The more of the semi-circle bolded, the closer your Pokemon is to being at your current level cap. 
Powering up your Pokemon levels them, this is why the semi-circle is filled up more as you power up your Pokemon. Like I said above, the cap is raised when your trainer level increases which is why you will find that you are able to power up pokemon that were fully powered up previously before you gained a trainer level.



Why is the perfect value of IVs for each INDIVIDUAL stat ‘15’?

There are 3 main stats in Pokemon Go: Attack, Defence and Stamina. Your Pokemon's IV can be anything from 0-15 for EACH stat. Which means a perfect IV Pokemon would have 15 in all 3 stats, giving it a total of 45/45 IV (100%).
So why is this number 15? This is due to a flat amount of 15 being added to your Pokemon's base stat when it is max level.
Only at max level would you get the full value of your Pokemon's IV. If it is half of the max level, you will get half the value of the IV added to their base stat. Example: Perfect IV Pokemon A at half of max level, approximately 20, will get 7.5 additional stats to each of the 3 stats compared to 0 IV pokemon A. So a perfect IV pokemon at approximately level 4, will have 1.5 additional stat in each of the 3 stats compared to a pokemon with no IV. So it’s basically this formula: &lt;IV value&gt; X (Pokemon’s current level/40.5) = additional stat for your pokemon. 
Example: My level 10 ponyta has an Attack IV of 14, using the formula: 14 X (10/40.5) = 3.46 (approximately). So my ponyta will have 3.46 more attack stat compared to another level 10 ponyta with an Attack IV of 0. 
When you power up more and more, it becomes more obvious. When your Pokemon is low level, the difference between 0 and 15 IVs will be a mere 1 or 2 actual stat difference. When your Pokemon is max level, the full value of the IV can be seen. Power up = increase level. So this is why when your pokemon starts getting more levels differences in IVs between Pokemons would be more obvious. 



So always keep the highest IVs version of a pokemon?

This will be up to you. As you must take into account that sometimes it is not worth the stardust needed to power up your low level pokemon. 
Example: You have 2 Pikachus, one is level 1 with 95% perfect IVs, while the other is level 20 with 85% perfect IVs. While the first one would be better in the long run, you would spend more stardust (and candies) leveling it to reach the same level as the other Pikachu. So it is all up to your personal choice to keep which Pikachu.



So how does this affect me?

I have no clue, I just thought I’ll make a guide to help those that want to know more. All you really need to know is, more IVs, GOOD. This guide just shows you exactly HOW good those IVs are in actual fact. It isn’t much IMO but it matters to people who want to be competitive and be the very best. That being said


________
Tl;dr IVs are good. The more, the better (but not that much better). The higher your pokemon level, the more obvious the difference in IVs will be. 

I hope that this is helpful and clear. If you have any questions, feel free to comment and I’ll try to reply when I am free. Cheers! =)

At the time of this story, I had just finalized the manual for the upcoming release.

Management knew that companies like theirs usually had a technical writer, but they had no idea what I did, and didn't know what to do with me. In the 9 months that I was there, my desk moved from one end of the building to the other, with some intermediate stops at offices in between, and I had at least 5 different managers. They tried putting me with sales and marketing, product management, UI design, and R&amp;D. I finally ended up sitting in a room full of the other employees who didn't fit in anywhere else, including their communications ""director"", my clueless manager, and a summer intern.

My first husband, who was also a student, worked at the same company as a developer. He accepted a position in a 3-month research project in another country, and negotiated an agreement with the company to continue working part-time hours remotely while he was away. I was going with him, so I went to management to discuss how to handle my own absence. I should point out that my clueless manager was not empowered to make these kinds of decisions, so I had this conversation with someone from middle management:

&gt;**finnknit**: Do you want me to continue working remotely while we’re abroad, or should I request a leave of absence?

&gt;**Middle Manager**: Well, now that the manual is finished, we don’t really need a technical writer any more. You can just put in your notice before you leave.

I was too shocked to argue, so I put in my notice and left. When I came home 3 months later, I found out that they had hired another technical writer. It turns out that the manual didn’t magically update itself when they released a new version of the product with new features.

I have had to take 4 days of sick leave in 2 months and I'm worried this will affect my reference. The first 3 were because I had a reaction and my face swelled up and I was covered in a rash. The last one is because I have diarrhoea. (sorry for tmi - we also only have one toilet between 10 people at this office!)

I understand this is a lot of sick days for 2 months, and I really don't want to look bad. I have offered to work from home, and the first time I was told not to worry and the second time I did not even get a reply. 

The company do not often have a lot of work for me to do, being an intern and all. I am always on time, complete work I do get to the best of my ability and get on with everyone. When I had the reaction, my collegue even joked that he was happy i had been ill as he didn't have much for me to do.

Am I worrying unnecessarily? Or should I have just braved it and gone in? "

Boss tells me he's keeping me, but letting my friend go.",Feuver,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xd9ag/my_22m_it_friend_27m_got_me_a_contract_job_for/,"So, one of my long time friend (We'll call him A) hooked me up in a nice company that needed an IT consultant. Now, I don't have my degree yet (I'm still studying for it), but I still applied. I was hired on a contact that would end by summer's end. It was fine with me, lots of hours, but good environment overall.

A has been an IT in that company for years. He's got his IT degree and currently attending university. He works part time there. I, on the other end, worked 40-60 hours for the company, and I worked really hard the whole summer. Out of interest and because I really liked the job (used to work in a gas station, so...).

Over the duration of the summer, the boss and I really bonded well, I've made good connections with everyone in the office, became the problem solver (I'm one of the only two IT at the office, including my friend) and was always there to help. 

So by the summer's end, boss offered me a full on job. It's IT work, has advantages, nice-pay and I can do my studies at work when I'm done with the tasks. The problem is - if you've read the title - that my friend is going to be let go.

Now, I know this position is coming to me due to the amount of time I gave to the company, the fact I told the boss I wanted to move into an apartment too. The boss also knew I was working at a gas station and didn't really like it (I worked both jobs the entire summer) so I'm really thankful for the opportunity, and I've already got a full on IT job hooked up before I'm out of college.

But A has university bills, lives with his parents and has no other jobs. I'm afraid of how he'll react when he finds out that he hooked me at his workplace and I proceeded to take his part time job away from him. He doesn't know yet, but the discussion is going to eventually come up, and I'm not sure how to act around him. I would be really annoyed if I was in his position.

Add to that he wanted to get me into his game project, which I don't exactly I'm interested in as a career venture, and I think anyone can see this could go very badly.

Thankfully, I'm not the one who has to give him the news, but I can't help to think that when he'll learn, our relationship may change for the worse.

UPDATE: Friend was told by boss that I would take his position. Friend was ultimately okay with it because he was about to start a university internship anyways. Crisis averted.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Worked hard all summer as an IT without actual degree. Friend with degree now in University that worked part time is going to be let go while I'm taking his job away from him. He doesn't know yet. What can I do?"

After months of searching for a job, I finally got an interview with one that felt like it would be the perfect fit for me, a dream job basically. The interview went well in my perspective - I was calm, cool, and collected. I was confident even with questions that threw me off a bit. I had some doubts, but they liked me enough that I got a second interview  with a higher up.

And this is where I blew it. I got there a bit too early and went to a Dunkin Donuts beforehand, got a decaf coffee and looked over my notes. I'm almost positive they gave me non-decaf, but who knows. I felt a little nervous, sat down with the interviewer, who asked me the first question (a very basic one) - and all of a sudden I couldn't breathe. Physically could not breathe. I was trying to hide force words out and hide it the best I could - but my chest was so tight and my heart was pounding because I knew I was fucking it up and it out of my control at that point. I don't know what happened. The questions were straightforward and all ones that I had anticipated and prepared for - yet I couldn't focus because of what was going on internally. I'm cringing thinking about it and how I must have looked. This is a job where you can't be nervous, one that required a lot of talking with people and diffusing tense situations - very similar to what I did for an internship so I know I could handle it and handle it well, but there's no way I showed that to the interviewer.

I drove, in total, about eight hours to and from these interviews. All to completely ruin my chances within twenty minutes. I cried the entire way home. I cried myself to sleep, then woke up at 3 am and couldn't go back to bed. I hate myself so much right now. I feel so stuck in life. Just needed to vent."

&amp;nbsp;


I started with this company just over a month ago. I have two years of experience before that since college. I got hired into an ""early career rotational group"" which is supposed to be two 9 month rotations, and then getting placed into a permanent group. I've been in contact with our CISO (boss's boss) due to some unrelated, major issues. After expressing my interest in moving to a more technical role, he's given me the green light to move within a month. This will remove me from the rotational program and it will be a permanent position on the team.


From the get-go, I felt cheated regarding my salary. I was told I could negotiate but then they stuck at their original number and told me tough luck. And then I found out what my peers are making, plus a fresh college grad new hire joining my current group. I'm making slightly more than them, but not much.

&amp;nbsp;

**Few details:**
&amp;nbsp;

* I have my bachelor's degree in CIS
* Two years of experience at a Fortune 10 company
* I interned at this company for two summers during college
* Compared to my peers still in the early career program, I'm making slightly more, but I have more experience, a technical degree, and internship history here

&amp;nbsp;

Since I will no longer be considered ""early career"", is it appropriate to ask for more money after just two months? I don't want to come off as bitter, especially since I've had to bring up the other issues to HR and the CISO after just a month here. But I also feel like I got the short end of the stick.

&amp;nbsp;
 
**********

&amp;nbsp;
 
Oh my God… Oh my God… I’m sorry guys. I’m seriously freaking out right now. I wanted to put this up yesterday, to tell you guys as soon as possible, but I just couldn’t… I’m so freaked out, you don’t even know. We were right. My mom WAS hiding something, something huge. I can’t… Jesus, it’s insane... Guys, you were right. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

I am not Ari. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
My name is Elena. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
Almost everything I have been told is a lie. I did go to BU, but I was an English major, not Environmental Science. I have always hated running. I play(ed?) guitar and I was in the photography club. My favorite color has been and still is orange. I have never been religious, but have always had an interest in my mother’s craft. But I am not an only child. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
I’m going to start at the beginning for this one. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
My mom visited me on Wednesday. We did the normal; she asked me superficial questions and I failed to get her to say anything about herself. I waited almost the entire two hours for the right moment. I didn’t want any of the supervisors to overhear us. When they finally got distracted with another patient, I told my mom that I thought my doctors weren’t taking me seriously. She asked what I meant, and I told her my suspicion about the supernatural agents in the incident last summer. (Don’t worry. I didn’t tell her I’ve been posting here.) She told me that such a thing wasn’t likely, but I could tell she was lying. So I told her about my dream, the one where I saw myself standing beside the little girl, and my mom burst into tears. I was able to hear what she said though before the supervisors separated us, and, soon enough, I figured out what had happened.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Turns out I wasn’t seeing myself in the dream. I saw Ari, my identical twin, the sister they haven’t been able to find. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
I insisted the doctors give me answers. I was (and still am) furious that they’d been keeping this from me, so I refused to take my meds (they can’t have this) until they filled me in. Here’s what actually happened:  
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
It all went down just like I said before. My sister, Ari, got an internship up near my grandmother’s and decided that’s where she’d live and unplug for the summer. The two of us were inseparable apparently; we went to the same college for God’s sake and we roomed together there. So, when she decided to go off the grid, I said I’d join (I had applied for a job at a local bookstore and planned on spending all my free time reading). My parents didn’t expect to hear from us, and we never contacted them. When my dad and the cops arrived, they found my grandmother dead in the kitchen, and me acting like a wild animal in one of the bedrooms. There was absolutely no sign of my sister, except for her things, neatly laid out in one of the bedrooms. They have yet to find her. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
As for the whole mix-up (which, if ask me, is absolute insanity), because of my wild state, no one, including my parents who apparently have always been able to tell us apart, knew which twin I was. Neither of us have ever been finger printed, so there was no way of knowing. The confusion came when I didn’t respond to my own name. In my feral state, I answered only to “Ari”, so they assumed that’s which twin I was. Apparently they thought wrong. When I finally came out of my more permanent flashback state, it became pretty obvious that I wasn’t my sister. I hate running, the color blue, and enjoy reading and music. Also, I guess all my old mannerisms returned, like my constantly bouncing leg and my habit of cracking my knuckles. Why they made the decision not to say anything is just beyond me. Honestly, it’s probably one part medical bull shit, four parts embarrassment. What parent doesn’t recognize their own child? Well, who am I to say. Anyway, they said they didn’t want to disturb my fragile mental state by giving me, yet again, another identity crisis, so they were going to refrain from telling me until I was more solid or my memories returned, whichever came first I guess. Honestly though, with one twin missing and the other with no memory, what difference would it make if I thought I was my lost sister? So now, not only do I have to remember what it is that happened to me, but I have to know what happened to Ari… She’s been missing for almost a year now. The police aren’t physically looking for her anymore. They’ve assumed she’s dead and now they just want answers. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Hell, so do I. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
My mom isn’t allowed to visit me again. My head doctor told me. They’re worried she’ll only compromise my mental health like she did with this bomb shell. Here’s my question though; why would they keep her from seeing me if she’s made the big reveal? I mean, she’s already told me the thing they were so concerned about; what’s the point from separating us. That’s why I’m positive that there’s something else they’re not telling me. There’s definitely more to this crazy story. I just don’t know how to find out. They’re still going to let my dad visit, but only under close supervision. That’s my only opportunity I think. Unless… I can break into patient records and open my file… That would require some serious hacking though, and I’m not sure I have that skill… I bet I could find a way though…
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Oh my God… No this is crazy talk. I can’t break into the computer system. I’ll just have to find another way. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Anyway, throughout all this ridiculousness, I think one of the weirdest parts is that I haven’t episode since I found out about Ari, or myself rather… or, whatever… since my mom let the secret out. My doctors are kind of freaking out. I guess they’d been giving the information they gleaned from my episodes to the police, who were trying to piece together whatever happened to my sister and I. Needless to say, they didn’t really get all that much from me. But that fact that I haven’t been having episodes leads me to think that maybe my episodes were trying to send a message or something. I’m not quite sure how that would work but it’s odd that I haven’t had any in this long. Mind you, this has happened a couple times before, so I can’t say that this is something the doctors should be panicking about, but it’s just a tad unusual. Can’t say that I’m complaining though. The episodes were huge interruption to my day. Not that I'm ever doing anything of consequence. 

&amp;nbsp;

The only thing that's nagging me at this point about those episodes is why I respond to Ari and not Elena when I'm having an episode. I mean, everyone here is one hundred percent positive that I'm not Ari, but if that's true, why do I answer to my sister's name? Honestly, it feels strange with everyone calling me Elena now. Admittedly, they've been calling me Ari for months, so it's bound to feel weird, but what if they've just mixed us up again?  How do they know for sure that I'm Elena? Or I know some of you said in my earlier posts that I might be possessed or taken over by a new spirit, but what if I'm both of us. What if Ari lives inside me too? Oh God this is just too freaky. I don't know... Is something like this even possible? 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Moving on. Despite my disappointing lack of crazy, uncontrollable flashbacks, I have had two more dreams since my mother’s bomb. It’ll come as no surprise when I tell you that I was forced to tell my doctors about the dream I saw my sister in. Since then, they interrogate me every morning as soon as I wake up, so they know about these dreams too. Long story short, they don’t trust me anymore and they’re worried my dreams will lead me to start asking questions. And they don’t want that. Do they really have my best interest in mind? I’m starting to wonder… There’s definitely something else going on here, some sort of secret motive they haven’t told me about, and I just don’t trust it. I need to know. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Anyway, so the first dream I had was the night after my mom told me about myself and Ari. I saw the little girl again. She was sitting next to me with her head in her hands, and she was crying. I asked her what was wrong, but she wouldn’t answer. She just kept saying over and over again that she was sorry, she was so sorry. She wouldn’t look at me. When I asked her what she was sorry for, she said “it’s my fault she’s gone”. Then she looked up at me, and instead of crying tears, she was crying blood. Before I could do anything, someone grabbed me from behind, and then I woke up.  

&amp;nbsp;

I have couple thoughts on this one. First off, I think this little girl might be real. I mean, I saw Ari, right, and Ari was real. Could these dreams be memories or something, maybe flashbacks like the episodes? I don't know... They don't seem to be as intense as my flashbacks. But, the girl, could she have something to do with what they're not telling me? Why she is always so upset? Now that I have a little more of an understanding of what happened, is the ""she"" the girl was talking about my sister? Or someone else entirely? Also, I feel like the word ""gone"" could mean a lot of things... dead, missing, lost, running errands... Like what exactly does she mean? I also can't help but wondering what grabbed me at the end there. I wonder if it was that dark thing I saw in the other dream, the thing with the antlers/horns and the funny walk? It seems to represent the darkness that has been plaguing this entire event.  

&amp;nbsp;

The doctors think the girl is a manifestation of my guilt. They told me that I am blaming myself for what happened but I cannot express it because I don't have any memories. However, that theory doesn't fit into the other dreams I've been having about her. They had an excuse ready of course; they said she also represents my fear of remembering, and she is a physical representation of my memory block. In theory, she is the one holding me back. In addition to the little girl, they also say the dark figure is supposed to be memories themselves; they're scary, so I see them as a terrifying, inhuman thing. A part of me wants to believe this. Honestly, it would be easier to believe that these things, these people I'm seeing, aren't real! I want this to be the truth, because honestly, the possibility that they have something to do with whatever happened to me is even more scary...  
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Ugh, I don't even want to think about it right now. Moving on... 

&amp;nbsp;

The second dream I had was different. For once, the little girl wasn't in it. But I did see Ari again, and she was terrifying. She was standing in front of me and smiling, but not in a friendly way. She looked almost sinister. She was telling me to join her, that I should leave everything behind, that ""he"" would make the pain go away. I kept refusing though, and she gradually became more insistent and angry. She screamed at me to join her, that I would regret it otherwise, that ""he"" would make me suffer, that I would die painfully... Still I refused, and then her face went absolutely blank, and she said I wouldn't have a choice. That's when I saw a massive figure coming up behind her, it, the thing, ""him"". And I woke up.  

&amp;nbsp;

See, this one doesn't really fit into the doctors' weird, psychological theories. Why would Ari, my sister, who I was apparently very close with, be threatening me? Why would she be trying to convince me that this dark figure, supposedly my ""scary"" memories, would make me feel better? It doesn't make sense! I'm sorry. This is just so frustrating... I'm just really sick and tired of being in the dark and being afraid and I just hate it. I hate it! Ugh...  

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I'm not putting up any transcripts today... I'm too shaken up by all of this, I'm sorry. I'll post again next week. I'll keep you updated as best I can... I'm not sure what will happen, whether or not this episode dry spell will continue (honestly, I highly doubt it). My dad is coming on Monday I think, and I plan on asking him about the little girl again, and maybe the forest (that's really the only lead I have). Maybe he can tell me more about my sister. I mean, she is/was my twin, and admittedly I'm curious. It's not like the doctors know anything about her. I'm going to keep my ear out too, see if I can figure out what it is that they're still not telling me. It will be difficult; they keep me under constant supervision, but I need a plan. Thanks again guys for all the support. I appreciate it. Until next time, signing out under my actual name for the first time here... 

&amp;nbsp;

I just graduated from college with a BS in Information Technology and about one year of IT entry level experience. I ended up securing a position in a county position because I had known the IT director personally. I really didn't know what exactly I would be doing besides ""project management"", but I know it's a good place to get into in the IT profession. At first this was going to be an internship, but when I told them I was willing to work more hours, they decided to take me in as a contractor (I signed up with a hiring service). 

The problem is that I have no experience in project management. Right now the Director has me making customer service follow-ups for internal and external users that call/email our operations techs, making sure I know what everyone is doing each day, and doing small projects for him (right now I am following Ethernet cords in switch closest a mapping where they go).

Here are a few questions I have:

1. What skills should I be learning? My boss said I should get into the PMI, but the only thing I can work towards is the CAPM and I would need to take classes for that, but I just started my job.

2. Everyone on both sides (Operations/Developers) are all really smart, specialized employees who have been working here for 5-20 years, and I feel out of place. I know this feeling will probably go away, but I could use advice on how project managers learn about what the team is doing. 

I need the skills to be able to get a full time position and be able to contribute to the team. Thank you for your help, and if you have other advice I would appreciate it!"

Student A or Student B?,cskid18,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4xeay8/whos_more_likely_to_get_hired_student_a_or/,"Student A: Has a great grasp all algorithms and data structures, and is able to solve interview questions pretty easily. This student also has a high GPA and has done well in their academics in college. However, this student does not have any personal projects (no GitHub) that he/she has worked on outside of class nor has/she been to a hackathon or worked with any other developmental technologies other than what is used in class (Java, C, C++). 

Student B: Is decent with algorithms and data structures, but not as good as Student A in solving interview questions i.e takes a longer time, solutions are less efficient. Also, this student's GPA is no where near as good. Has made C's in some CS classes. However, this student has worked on several side projects outside of class, attended and competed at hackathons (might have won 1-2) and has taught him/herself several different developmental technologies outside of class including technologies the interviewing company uses.  

So, which student do you guys think companies would typically hire? Someone who's good at questions during the interview and has an amazing academic record, or someone who has developmental experience under his/her belt and knowledge on many technologies?

Interview can be either for an internship or full-time position (Software Development)"

4xf12d,2,2016-08-12,I'm feeling pretty useless,playwithfire721,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4xf12d/im_feeling_pretty_useless/,"I feel weird even writing this, but I just need to vent to/at something or someone. I completed my undergraduate degree in Music, but after the end of my third year, I was very burned out and completely unmotivated. I sat down and decided that I needed to move into a new chapter of my life. I didn't have the option of switching majors (I was on scholarship at an out-of-state school, and my scholarship would run out before I was done), so I applied for and was accepted to an honors program in International Conflict. 

Over the next two years, I learned Russian, I took all sorts of government, history, and international relations classes, did a couple of internships, and took a shot in the dark applying for grad school. I applied for several top programs, in addition to my alma mater and a couple of ""backup schools"". Much to my surprise and delight, I was accepted to a top 10 program for my Master's degree in a field that I only had two years of educational experience in, and no relevant undergraduate degree. I was ecstatic.

I took my first semester off of working to get used to the workload of graduate school, then got busy applying for internships for this past spring semester. I ended up getting a couple of interviews, and was offered an internship on Capitol Hill working for a great subcommittee with great people. 

I started applying for summer internships throughout the spring semester. Nothing. No responses. No interviews. Legitimately nothing. I had a stronger resume, great references, had someone read over my cover letters, everything. I got nothing. So this summer has flown by. I've been working a little part-time just to make some money, I've been running and cooking a lot, and started playing through a few video games that I've been putting off for a while. I also had started applying for fall semester internships and jobs.

I've applied for more of them than I can count and have received exactly 1 interview. I progressed through to the second stage of interviews, which was a timed research exercise, which I feel is a real strong suit of mine. I work very well under pressure, and all of my previous internships have been heavily research-based. I thought I did well. However, I just received an email this morning saying that I was not selected for the internship. So now it's mid-August, fall semester starts in two weeks, and I am, once again, without an internship or relevant job.

I am very aware that it isn't healthy to do this, but I can't help but compare myself to the people around me. Many of my peers in graduate school, which is heavily mid-career people, all have rewarding and cool jobs. Of my two closest friends, who are around my age, one has just been offered a full time position out of her previous internship, and the other has never been without an internship since she started graduate school with me. Of my larger group of friends, nearly every single one of them has a position lined up for fall, or has a continuing internship/job from the summer. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't know if the fact that my undergraduate degree is in another field is harming me more than I realize. I don't know if my former internships - one of which was for an admittedly controversial figure - are harming my chances. Or maybe I'm just extremely unlucky. I am so entirely proud of myself for making it so far in such a short period of time, but I really can't help but feel helpless and kind of useless right now. I'm hoping that something will pop up at the last minute, but it's not like I can hold my breath for something like that to happen.

Maybe I'm looking for advice. Maybe I'm looking for help. Maybe I just needed to vent. I've been networking as hard as I can, I've been applying for anything even remotely relevant to my graduate degree. I desperately love what I'm doing now, and can't see myself doing anything differently. I just can't seem to get my full foot in the door, and it is starting to really get to me. My problems are not dire. They aren't life-threatening. I realize that things could be much, much worse. But they're very real to me at this point in my young career.

Thank you for reading, anyone that bothered to get this far. It really means a lot to me, even if you choose not to respond."

Advice?",trashaccount0001,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4xf70l/i_47m_married_think_my_divorced_coworker_35f_is/,"tl;dr is in the title.  Her is the long form:

I am a lone consultant who works for large tech companies.  The nature of my work is that I am embedded in a team of full-time employees and work closely with them for several months on time-critical projects.  Long hours, late nights, and travel are common.  My current assignment has me with a team of 8 people: 5 female, 3 male.  I am three months in to a 6 month contract.

Everything has been normal until this week.  On Tuesday we had a dinner in Silicon Valley.  When people were discussing drinks, one woman - let's call her ""B"" - said she recently got in to whiskey.  Several of us then proceeded to discuss whiskey and even thought to order some, but the restaurant we were at had none.  In the end, very little alcohol was consumed.  

We normally rarely talk about anything but work at these dinner meetings but this time people shared a few things.  Among other things, I learned that B was divorced with two kids, 3 &amp; 5, and she shares kid time with her husband.  I shared that I was divorced once but have been remarried for 16 years now and have two kids with my current wife and 2 with previous.  That is all background.

After dinner it is about 10:30pm.  I was planning to take a taxi back to my hotel, which was in San Francisco (about an hour away).  B said she lived in South San Fran near the transit station and offered to drop me there.  At this point I didn't think it was anything but a coworker being friendly and I accepted.

On the drive, conversation was pretty casual - where do you vacation, what do you do for fun, dealing with kids and the ex, etc.  About halfway there, B pulls off the freeway and heads onto surface streets.  I asked her if she needed gas or something and she said that she lives nearby, not far from the train station.  I was kind of surprised since we are still pretty far from the city, but whatever.  I assume she is taking me to the station.

Instead, we pull up to her house.  She pulls into the garage and says ""we're here"" and gets out of the car and goes inside without another word, like this is the most normal thing in the world.  I go in and ask if I can use the restroom.  At this point, I think it is strange but am not thinking she is hitting on me, just that she maybe is a bit tired or something and wanted to go right home.  So while in the bathroom I call an Uber, not wanting to deal with the train anymore.

When I get out, B is sitting at the table and has a VERY nice bottle of whiskey out (Hibiki 21 yo) and has already poured two generous glasses.    She says ""Since we didn't get any at the restaurant.""  To be honest I am kind of speechless.  It dawns on me that her kids must be at the dad's house since it is so late, and I think this must be a set-up.  I am thinking of what to say when my phone rings.  It is the Uber driver out front.  Saved by Uber!  I apologize.  She makes a comment that it would be a shame to waste the whiskey, and in my nervous haste I say something like ""I guess I can take it to go.""  She actually pours it into a plastic cup for me and I head to the Uber with a quick thanks, anxious to get out of the situation.  I have a 30 minute Uber ride to sip whiskey and contemplate what to do...

The next day at work, I am actually dreading it a bit.  But B is like nothing happened.  I start thinking maybe I read too much into it, or that it is a momentary lapse on B's part and she would just as soon forget it.  In any case, I feel it is safe.

But then last night we (the group of 8) were planning travel to Seattle.  People are flying up mostly late Sunday night and we have a 8am meeting Monday morning.  The plan is to meet in the hotel lobby at 6am, get breakfast and carpool over.  (The office is about an hour from the hotel)

B sends me a message (this company uses a chat product for most communication, not email) at about 10:30pm:

B:  Are you staying at the &lt;hotel&gt; also?
  (This seems like a legitimate question, since we consultants book our own travel.)
me:  yep!
B:  Do you also arrive late?
me:  my flight lands at 11:30pm so yeah.
B:  How do you feel about BJ in the morning?

  (I don't really have a response since I am just processing this.  Is she making a proposition??  At least two minutes go by with nothing type from either of us)

B:  We can use the hotel conf room and don't have to drive in so early.

At this point, I remember that this company uses a teleconferencing software called Blue Jeans.  People just call it BJ in chat.  She is suggesting the first meeting should just be done from the hotel.  So maybe it is innocent.  But - given the previous night, and the long pause, I am wondering if this was another flirting attempt.  

So - advice time, reddit.  How to best handle this and avoid unpleasantness for all involved?

Here are some more data points:
- Technically B (along with everyone else in the team) is my manager, and she certainly has impact into future contracting
- I don't THINK I did anything to encourage B, but I can't rule out something subconscious.  I say this because B is Asian and I have an Asian fetish.  My wife is Asian, and almost all of my relationships have been Asian.  I would say that B is for sure my ""type"".  So I don't think I can honestly claim that my body isn't sending some signals.  Also, I am a friendly, outgoing, fun-loving guy (survival skills in consulting) so that can feel flirty to people.  
- I have had a case in the past many years ago where I thought an intern was hitting on me, and it turned out to NOT be the case.  Long story, but was very awkward for all involved.  So I am a little gunshy there.
- If I had 100% trust in myself I would just flirt along.  But to be honest, if I am in a hotel room with a good looking Asian and we've have had a few whiskeys...  best to avoid that situation all together is what I am saying...

Thanks in advance!  If you can get me some good ideas before Sunday night when I arrive in Seattle, that would be great.

I could hear, hear my heartbeat. I had a feeling, he had called in the medical residents, his fellow doctors, even asked the interns if any of their recent medical knowledge mentioned whatever I had.

I felt mostly fine, except...well, I couldn't really eat any foods anymore. Not even their weird feeding tubes helped, I rejected it all. ""All you can eat now is pussy"" he confirmed, sighing loudly. ""I don't know why or how, but it's the only way you can survive. Go too long without it and....well...""

He didn't complete his sentence. You (my best friend, girlfriend, fiancee, wife) reached out and tightly squeezed my hand. ""We can fight this. I love you."" Your teary eyes and shaky voice offered little reassurance. 

""You're right, I just need to eat you out whenever you're with friends, or working or doing pretty much anything. If not I die."" I tried not to be too sarcastic but given the circumstances, well, I had the right to be.

I don't need any sort of Financial Aid, fortunately enough!

2400 SAT 1 (Single sitting, second go), SAT 2s - 800 Math 2, 780 Chem, and will probably get 790-800 in Phy. Planning on taking French without listening as well.

96-97 percent average, ranked 1st-2nd out of 150ish students, no APs offered(self studied CS but got 4, don't know whether to send this), some usual ECs at national level / inter school level such as debating , football, quizzing, programming etc. Have one somewhat unusual EC which I have worked very hard at to develop from way before college came into the picture, all the way up to one of the best U-18s internationally and consistently placed there for more number of times than anyone else ever has(fact :)), and I have given back to the community and done a lot of other things with this EC(not really willing to specify). Placed runners up in national coding challenges, done a couple of internships, other stuff.

Essays will be decent, don't expect anything amazing from them sadly, and recs too are not gonna be anything special(never really had any teacher outright love me, shame).

So this was the list I came up with, comprising some notoriously selective schools:-

Stanford 

Princeton

CMU SCS

MIT

Harvard

UC Berkeley

Cornell

Columbia

UIUC 

U.Washington Seattle

UCLA

Georgia Tech

U.Mich

UC San Diego

USC

Purdue

And finally, University of Waterloo from Canada.

I just finished my second busy season at a National Firm. My original plan was to stick around 3 years and leave for industry after I had competed one busy season as a Senior. However, the plan suddenly changed when I found out I would not be promoted this coming year. I received pretty much all 3s last busy season (Meets Expectations) and even in charged a few smaller audits and a 401(K) Audit that went well. After meeting with my OMP, he said he'd like me to do one more year as a Staff to solidify my skills as I didn't do a Public Accounting internship.

There were also several other people in my office who didn't not receive a promotion to Senior as well. It is worth noting our office lost two major clients this past busy season and we are pretty top heavy at the Senior level. 

I received a decent raise (6%) and bonus ($1500) for not getting promoted and can see the OMPs point. However, I really think I could've stepped up and done Senior work this year. I am a CPA as well if it matters.

What should I do? Thanks! "

4xfwuj,5,2016-08-12,Acting while pursuing a separate degree?,yellowwatermelo,acting,https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/4xfwuj/acting_while_pursuing_a_separate_degree/,"Apologies in advance for a very long post.

I'm an 18 year old girl that will be starting college at UCLA very soon. I just finished an internship with the local theatre company that I always used to attend for their summer conservatory (I was teaching the young children's camp during the day and run crew for the professional shows on weekend evenings). This made me realize that I want theatre to be so much more than a hobby and that it's very possible as a profession. Several of the actors there followed the same path as me by doing all of their levels of conservatory then an internship and coming back to work for the company after obtaining a theatre degree. Except I'm not really on that path because I'm going to UCLA to major in Bioengineering. 

I'm not asking how I can switch into the Theatre major. I honestly don't think I would get that transfer approved with how competitive it is and my parents would not approve which is not something I want to challenge them on. However I would like advice on some other choices. 

Is it worth it to switch into Computer Science over Bioengineering? Because I am already in the school of engineering this would be a relatively easy switch, just a few extra classes and some paperwork. I ask this because I think that programming is probably better suited as a survival job than biotech. My parents (who are both programmers) have brought up the fact that it tends to be more flexible in terms of hours and that taking a hiatus to ""work on independent projects"" is not unusual so if I did leave the tech world a while for theatre it wouldn't mean that I would have trouble finding employment when I returned. Looking purely at CS versus BioE, I am more interested in BioE, but given the benefits that CS might have for doing more theatre, I am less clear. 

Also, would it be worth pursuing a Theatre Minor? It would be difficult and time-consuming because of how many classes engineering already requires (whether it is CS or BioE), but it is possible. It's also something that I would want to decide relatively soon because of the unit cap for UCLA. If I decide to pursue a minor in theatre, that basically means I only have enough units to take things for my major and for the theatre minor, no possible extraneous classes. 

Am I overlooking the possibility of acting classes outside of school? I am in LA, but I don't have a car, so I would have to be able to reach it by bus, walking or biking (do people bike in LA?), which makes me think that it's unlikely to find something possible for me. 

If you have any advice for joining UCLA’s theatre clubs that would also be wonderful.

TL;DR: Is a Computer Science degree better for an actor's lifestyle than Bioengineering? Should I try to minor in theatre? Is there a best way to continue theatre as an extracurricular (acting classes, clubs)?"
4xfxe5,19,2016-08-12,Really afraid to start my first programming job.,iheardacrimego,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4xfxe5/really_afraid_to_start_my_first_programming_job/,"Hi all,

So first come backstory. I graduated in May with a BS in CS from a small state school in the midwest. Started late, at age 24, cause I didn't know what I wanted to do for a living (and still kinda don't if we're being honest). I'm now 28, which I think contributes some to my anxiety, cause I'm not some 21 year old kid just figuring stuff out. I'm at the age where a lot of people are established in their careers already.

I had pretty good grades in school (3.6) but I struggled in algorithms, discrete structures, other CS theory type courses. Our professors tended to let us through with B's or B+ anyway, which is bad, but what am I gonna do? Ask them to fail me instead? I put in extra time on my own to try and get a better grasp on stuff like big O notation or (insert algorithm here), but it still just confuses the hell out of me.

I didn't work on side projects, because I had/have little confidence in my abilities and when I tried, just had no clue where to even start. People would say stuff like ""build some Android apps"" and when I would pursue that, I would end up just totally lost. In addition to just not really being that passionate about programming. I didn't have internships for the same reasons (well, also cause I did not realize til finding this sub how important those were considered).

To be clear, I did fine in programming classes, mostly. Java is my strongest language, and I struggled at times with bigger projects, but usually was able to solve problems and get things done with it.

In spite of all this, to my surprise, I got hired at a junior programmer job where I get paired with a mentor and work with a small team. I start next month. I guess I must have interviewed well? It felt like the two managers liked me. They asked a few technical-ish questions, but there was no whiteboarding or any of that stuff. Looking back I almost wish there was, because then there would be no question whether or not I was ready. I would either sink or swim in that room, and then know for sure what I needed to work on even if I failed big time.

On the one hand, I know I should be happy about this. It's a well-paying gig, especially for someone with zero real experience. There are people out there,  more skilled than I am, struggling to find a job.

On the other though, I can't help but have a lot of fear. I didn't lie in the interview, but what if I oversold myself and they think I'm a lot better than I am? Like I said, I have no legit programming experience outside of school projects. I have a rudimentary understanding of git version control, but I can't even comprehend how programmers work on huge products in a company like this. The whole process is completely shrouded in mystery to me, seriously. What do professional programmers even do all day? I have no clue what this job is going to entail.

I just feel woefully unprepared, which is my own fault I know. And I feel like I got a job I don't deserve. I don't know if this is just normal nerves or something to be legitimately concerned about.

Sorry for the whinefest, thanks for reading.

I have anxiety stemming from my abusive parents, and it's really hitting me full force as this upcoming college semester approaches. I need advice on how to talk to a professor that I will have this semester, if anyone would be so kind as to give me advice.

TL;DR: I failed a summer class. I have the same professor for an upcoming class, and I don't want my past performance to influence how this professor will view my work (I'm usually an A student). What should I say to this professor on the first day of class?

Some background:

This upcoming year will be my last year of undergrad. I'm usually a very good student and I look forward to taking my final classes and completing my internships.

In May and June, I took a couple of classes that were accelerated intro courses to graduate-level work. This was with the intent of having a head start on a Master's degree, which I would finish after I graduated with my undergrad degree. This was through a program my university offered, heavily discounted in tuition. I did not make passing grades in the classes, however, and I am 80% sure that I won't be allowed to continue in the program (I'm disappointed, but I know I did not put the amount of work in to the classes as I needed to).

The problem is that one of the professors who taught the accelerated classes will also be my professor in an undergrad class this coming semester. I'm worried that my performance in the summer classes will impact how she views my work in this coming semester.

I want to talk to this professor on the first day of class to start off with a clean slate for this semester, but I have so much anxiety about it that I can't even open my school email in fear of seeing something about the program I failed. I simply don't know what to say to the professor. Can anyone give me advice on what to say?"

4xguhd,1,2016-08-12,"Me [23M] with my girlfriend [23F] of 4years, seems like we are about to breakup due to incompatibilities and depression",comissar_pancake,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xguhd/me_23m_with_my_girlfriend_23f_of_4years_seems/,"Greetings Redditers,

After four years and a half into a relationship with some ups and downs I don’t think I understand anymore the things that are happening between us.
Putting this in a context.

We started dating when we were both 19y in the final year of high school. My longest relationship until this one was a 2 months one, with no sex involved. I was always a histrionic type of guy, charismatic, humorous and sometimes selfish (the type of selfishness you’d expect from a single child) and girls whom I date may eventually found me immature. She was quite the opposite. An extremely romantic person, very mature, and emotionally intelligent. She was also a little bit sickly, having spine and stomach problems from birth, albeit minor. She was also a hopeless altruistic person, who was always ready to share things with her beloved ones and always having the same expectations from the others. It always upset her the ones who didn’t were as kind with her as she was with them.

Nobody gave us a chance in the beginning, when we started dating and it seemed like we spoke different languages. Eventually, we figured out how to make things working, me trying to understand as much about her as possible and doing a lot of romantic things (seems that I was a sleeping romantic, never having the chance to manifest myself this way) and she being happy that I’m showing her my romantic half for the first time.

Over time I felt more and more insecure because whenever she was upset, I didn’t knew exactly how to react. She would kept criticizing me for not meeting her expectations, as she was always thinking how to brighten my day or give me a smile (she is, overall, more uplifting than my parents), whereas I didn’t. I ended, usually, desperately trying to comfort her. 

The insecurity of mine eventually plagued the whole relationship.

9 months into the relationship (Sep. ’12) we found out that we’ll attend universities from different cities, at about 8-9 hours distance. Initially we agreed to break up and I was quite torn that it would’ve ended this way, but she had the idea of at least trying to make things work from the distance. It was difficult and my insecurity grew so much that at some point, when I was visiting her and she kept criticizing me and I had a nervous breakdown, felt into my knees and started crying. I felt like a miserable person for not being able to make her happy despite trying to and I guess it was also some sexual frustration (no sex with her, as she was still a virgin). I felt numb for about 2-3 weeks and acting more distant with her (at the phone) and I told her that it’ll take some time to feel better. Even then I still loved her, but I lacked the energy to show this. Right after those 2-3 weeks, when we met again at home, she broke up with me saying that she doesn’t think that things will work.

I do not remember how things turned out after right after that, but I returned to the university for some final exams, I think I slept with a few girls after a 1 year pause, and came back home for Christmas. We met each other, shared some presents but I didn’t really felt like we should start over again, despite her thinking about this at that point.

After another 2 months I started missing her and when I found out she’s visiting the city I was studying, I went straight to her, trying to reconcile with her. I confessed sleeping with other girls, she slapped me, cried, but we started all over, forgetting all these things. Bonus, after another month or two, we finally slept together.

That was our first year together.

Fast-forward 5-6 months (summer of ’13), I applied for a summer internship in my university’ city and I was rejected. I was devastated (although now I don’t think it was such a big issue), starting developing an anxiety due to my reborn insecurity and the relationship again took the burden. When courses started, I tried to make it up for the lost internship and started a lot of volunteer work to gain experience and we had less and less time to talk see each other. This time, around Christmas, again I couldn’t stand the criticism that I kept receiving and this time I broke up with her. I never felt so lonely in my whole life when I drove her home. I developed an emotional anchor and whenever I am feeling a cold wind during the night, it reminds me of that moment.

She was devastated and in the meanwhile I started dating other 2 girls. Somehow, she managed to overcome her grief and started to get in touch with me. I was focusing on getting hired so I really didn’t wanted to make up with her, especially when I found another girl.
But when I finally got a job and my insecurity vanished, I realized that I wanted her again. So I broke up with the girls I was dating and we were back together, somewhere after 5-6 months after the Christmas breakup (spring ’14). We agreed, however, that if she wouldn’t be able to transfer in September, when the courses are starting again, we would breakup for good.

In September she managed to transfer, but she had nowhere to live, as her parents would have spent all of their money on tuition loan and she couldn’t apply for student dorms. I was living in 3-room apartment, with my best friend and he accepted that she could stay over as much as she wants, without paying the rent, just sharing the utility costs. I was reluctant as I had to share my room. It’s not a big room and I never had a room tailored to my needs. I knew that we will eventually argue because of the small space but I knew that this way I’ll fulfil a wish of her, so I accepted. She was delighted and I thought that this gesture of mine, offering her a place where to stay, together, almost for free, would make up for all the bullshit I’ve done until then. If I would’ve been in her place, it would.

Turns out, it wasn’t such a good idea.

I started to work a lot overtime and I started to develop an anxiety, again. We had some arguments which might have been small ones, but I couldn’t stand them and my best friend’s gf moved over and this made the apartment even more crammed. In January ’15 she had some health problems and I rushed her a couple of times to hospital, right when I had some of my degree exams. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to finish the degree, but I wanted her to get healthier. I felt like that was more important than my degree.

2-3 months later (spring ’15), my friend decided that he wants to move in with his gf, now that she bought herself a new apartment. We had an argument right at the end, because my girlfriend couldn’t accept that he wasn’t going to tidy up a room. A stupid reason to even argue about. They argued and I literally froze in place because I didn’t knew how to react. Right after that, she told me that she doesn’t know what to do but she seriously considers breaking up with me because I didn’t stood by her in front of my friend. I once again broke down because I was between the hammer and the anvil.
I managed to comfort her over the next month and her brother moved in. Unfortunately, she started to experience pains whenever we had sex. Eventually, we stopped even trying knowing that it’ll be painful for her. The problem persisted throughout the whole year. She started having serious confidence issues and kept saying that I’ll no longer love her because of her pains. I always comforted her that we’ll find a way to get rid of her problems, that I’ll support and love her no matter what.

Unfortunately that was so demanding of me (I stopped going to the gym, studying at all, going out with friends, reading or watching movies) and I think that from there on my anxiety worsen and began to develop into a depression, right when the summer started.

1.	I couldn’t remember things.
2.	I couldn’t forecast things, nor make plans
3.	Complete lack of energy or initiative and a constant feeling of loneliness
4.	Inability to relate to other people

From June to December 2015, I only have a few memories.

We spent a 4 day holiday at the seaside. We started arguing even before arriving, and kept arguing throughout the next day. In the last 2 days I had a very tooth pain that made me feel even more miserable. I didn’t expected too much from this holiday and didn’t felt like I should party or be happy. I was “whatever”-mode on. But it was another of example of us unable to spend some time together without arguing so tried to avoid going out together for the time being. Don’t imagine these arguments are serious ones. They aren’t, but it felt like there are way too many.

In September I started going to a psychologist and right after my first session, she again wanted to break up, thinking that there’s nothing more to be done. I once again managed to change her mind, convincing her that we can still find a way to repair thing and I promised that next time I’ll attend the session, I’ll bring her with me.

In October a friend of mine died (along many other people). I was devastated and I simply stared at the walls for a couple of days. A few days earlier I went to the psychologist but without her, as I didn’t felt like I should do this yet, but I’ve lied to her, telling her instead that I’ve worked overtime. She found out and she was determined to break up, right during the day I found out my friend died. I desperately and successfully managed to convince her not to.

Until April or May this year (’16), I literally acted like a robot. I had frequent breakdowns during this period, like 1-2 per week, mostly because of our arguments and work overload. I couldn’t remember things happening hours before or portray myself/ourselves more than 1-2 days in advance.

Since May things are a tad better. I started to improve my memory, I do remember things from 5-6 days ago, I can make schedule things some days in advance but I still avoid any sort of conflict or doing things out of the comfort zone. This led to my present situation:

I declined multiple requests from her to spend our holiday abroad. I’m simply too scared to do this. Either of arguing or of something unexpected and dangerous happening. Due to my avoidance of conflict, we stopped communicating and just having small talks for the past weeks. Last night she confessed the she cannot continue like this and we should stop talking until we have a real talk, although she doesn’t know when she’ll want to have this talk. She’ll come over to move some things from her home here, on Monday, so most likely we’ll have a talk then. Despite having so many issues, I don’t feel like I want to break-up, but being realistic, I know that I haven’t overcame my depression and I’ll be difficult to deal with until I will.

  **tl;dr**: Having a 4 years and half relationship with ups and downs, plagued by insecurities and depression, and I'm not sure it's worth it anymore."

I am also low-income and do not have to pay any application fees. 

I am interested in studying neuroscience/Psychology. I have compiled a list of -*brace yourself*- 36 COLLEGES. Yes, this number is humungous. Yes, this number is INSANE. Thus, I need to cut it down. Big time. 

Help this crazy college hopeful cut down her list, please please. 

All of these schools have a neuroscience program. Most have a major but some have a concentration/minor with a psychology major I am happy with. I think I want to go pre-med but I also want to toy around the idea of going to grad school for Neuroscience and working in a research field for neuroscience. 

I can take Japanese classes at all of these schools

I can see myself going to a LAC because of the accessibility of Professors, Intimate Community, and often beautiful campuses. I absolutely love the idea of being so close to a professor that we can go out for a cup of coffee to just talk. Small classes are definitely where I learn best. I think it would be nice to have a close relationship with the faculty and be able to approach them for research opportunities.

I can also see myself going to a research university for the opportunity to take grad classes in undergrad, more course offerings, and a wider array of research opportunities to choose from. I am sure that I can get research at most LAC's but if I don't like anything that the smaller selection of professors are offering then that is tough luck. 

All the colleges on my list have a wide range of sizes too. from 1,800 to around 15,000. The Claremonts are smaller but they are part of a close consortium. Frankly, I don't see either size as a problem for me. I just really don't have a preference as long as a school is under 20,000 and at least around 1800. 

Also I can afford all of these colleges after running the Net Price calculator

As you can tell this poor diluted soul needs some major changes. I have way to many reach schools like I need to just calm my tits cause I am being hyper unrealistic. I  JUST CANT GET MYSELF TO PULL THE TRIGGER AND REMOVE SCHOOLS.

I Have already poured HOURS AND HOURS into researching to get this monster list. Imagine it this way OUT OF ALL THE THOUSANDS OF UNIVERSITIES I brought it down to 36, do I sound less crazy now?


**My Stats**

* GPA: 4.0uw, something really high weighted, I have taken the max amount of IB Classes I can. I am a Full IB student. 

* Rank - Somewhere between 4-8/500~. At my school, all people with an uw 4.0 gpa and met honor requirements are valedictorians. There are around 10 each year, I will probably be one of them. Honestly don't know if my school reports unweighted or weighted ranks because of this. We have 2 official transcripts with both. I think I get to choose which one to send in, if I do I will send the rank 1 unweighted transcript. 

*SAT- Around 1400 New Sat, retaking in October. Chem and Math 2 in November

* EC- 2 Club presidents, 1 VP, 2 Officer, Tennis team, Science National Honor society co-founder, NHS, Japanese National Honor Society. Communications Internship, Meals on wheels volunteer, Library volunteer, Food bank volunteer. 

One of the clubs I am president of I am REALLY passionate about. It's a club where we fundraise for a different sick child each year. Last year it was for a girl who had the same cancer my mom died of. We raised $15,000 and I am immensely proud of that. I know I don't have a fancy research position but I really take A LOT of pride in this because of the history with my mother. Before I became president we raised $3000 so there was a big difference when I took over. The club only had like 10 people and the old presidents just wanted to give up and disband, but I took over. There is around 100 members now. 


NOW YOU GUYS COME IN. **PLEASE HELP THIS CRAZY PERSON BECOME SANE**

I want to go to a school where there is plenty to do without drinking. I don't party or drink, but I do want the option. This could mean I live near a city and could explore it. But it is okay for a college to not be near a city, as long as there is plenty to do on campus. 

I do not plan to join Greek life so I don't want social life to circle around it. I don't care if there is no greek life. 

I am interested in going to a college with a strong campus feel. I want to know I am in a campus, and not just a place that just feels like it is a part of the city (If you know Portland OR I despise the look of Portland State for this reason). I am fine with being in a city as long as there is a distinct campus feel. 

I also want to avoid any type of commuter vibe a college may have. Right now I think I want to stay on campus throughout all of my undergrad. This ties back into my desire for a strong campus feel. I am a liberal person, but not insanely liberal. A college does not have to be liberal as long as it is not conservative, so middle ground places are just fine and I think I would be fine in a more left wing school as well. I am not that artsy but I do not mind artsy people.

I come from a very poor background. My family has consistently been below the poverty line. I was even homeless for a period of my freshman year of high school. I don't want to go to an overly preppy-snooty college that has a really strong upper-class presence. I am afraid that my inability to pay for activities, concerts, events and just eating out may ostracize me. Similarly, I would like to have a lot of opportunities to have fun on campus without being a burden on my thin wallet.

I think I have a better chance at schools like Bowdoin, Pitzer, Bates, Wesleyan, Brandeis, Dickinson, Wake Forest and Skidmore since they are test optional. 

What school do you guys think I should cut? Do any of these schools have horrible psych/neuroscience and I just didn't notice? With the information I gave you which of these schools would I not fit?

I really need help guys T-T


**TLDR** GIVE ME REASONS TO CROSS SCHOOLS OFF MY LIST PLEASE GOD

ALSO- I plan on applying to colleges through QuestBridge as well. Emory, Pomona, Tufts, and Wesleyan do not require a supplement with Questbridge. Because of this lack of supplement and app fee I really see no reason to take them off my list. They take 0 extra effort so they don't need to be included in the number of applications I have to fill out. So I can be at a sane number of colleges with these taken on when my list is finalized. 

Also I for sure am applying to Stanford, Yale, and Princeton because they are non-binding schools in the Questbridge college match. Very few get in that way so I will just let my apps roll over to RD and that wont be any extra effort either. 


I need to be done with forming my list so I can focus on essays and SAT studying!"

At least I know what's waiting for me. I don't know how long I've been stuck in this shopping paradox, where time seems to have come to a complete stop, and yet I can feel my day off slipping through my fingers like so many grains of sand. My in-depth study of the floor tiles has produced nothing conclusive as I follow my wife blindly around the store, shoulders slumped, offering occasional nonverbal forms of agreement. 

We're examining a thoroughly uninteresting dresser when I notice an attractive piece, and I'm not talking about furniture. It's just a glimpse from across the room of a woman in tight clothing that hugs curves that would make Botticelli blush, but there's something magnetizing about her. She's ahead of me, moving toward the desks and then vanishing. I urge my wife forward with renewed vigor, and she is caught up in my sudden and rare enthusiasm. 

""I really want to check out those Bjergensens honey! They looked great in that catalog you showed me."" Were Bjergensens a thing? I don't know. Sounds Swedish though. I round the corner, wife in tow, frantically scanning the area for the goddess who had just graced my peripheral vision. There was a twinge of familiarity in my brain, telling me I knew the woman, but surely that was a false impulse. I couldn't think of anyone I knew that looked like her.

Not a corner of the department escapes my sight, yet she somehow does. Maybe she's farther along? My heart sinks. I have to find her.

""Here are the Brusalis, dear. Is this what you meant?"" my wife calls out from behind me as I walk along the aisle.

Yep, this really is hell. We must have crashed on the way here and this is how I shall forever spend eternity. I make a note to pick out something light because I'll probably be pushing it on an inevitable broken shopping cart later and forever.

I turn toward the Brusalis -- that doesn't sound Swedish at all -- and bump right into my mystery woman. Only it's not a mystery at all. I know you. How could I not know you? 

""Holy shit! Hi!"" I say, my surprise overpowering the small bit of any goddamn sense I have left. I did know you, but I certainly could tell my wife how. She appears at my side so fast that I'm sure she's really some otherworldly demon in disguise here to torture me for my earthly sins. An afternoon of arguing must be next on the agenda. Kudos, Satan, you know me too well. She/it speaks before you can.

""Who's this, sweetie?"" The last word is absolutely drenched in venom. 

""Oh, uhhhhh ..."" I say, locking eyes with you.

Thanks for reading! My idea is that you realize the predicament I'm in an decide to take advantage, teasing me in various ways, which eventually turns into sneaky sexual escapades. I wrote this with the idea of your character being a pornstar in mind, but we can do something else if that doesn't suit you. A recent affair, an intern at my office, my favorite stripper or whatever else you might want to be. Also doesn't have to be IKEA, if you find that Target is what really rustles your jimmies.

Kinks obviously include cheating and semi-public sex. I find character and setting are often my biggest turn ons, so I'm pretty open to accommodating your interests, but I just can't get into ageplay or the darker stuff.

I'm also looking for more detailed responses over a longer period of time. I have some time tonight but we likely won't finish unless you're just that good.

My background was in applied mathematics and I switched to study computer science for my master's degree in 2010.

I'd worked at a startup as a DSP engineer for 10 months while I was still working on my own online shop. After I quit my engineering job (because I was extremely busy with two jobs), I didn't keep my coding skills sharp. I shut down my online shop and came here last August to study a 9-month certificate program in Software Engineering, which allows me to have one-year work authorization in the US after finishing it. But I'm not allowed to be unemployed over 90 days during the period. That makes me feel more stressed. I have a hard time getting interviews.

She'd tell me after every time we did something that she had a nice time, and we kissed about two weeks ago. About five days before she called it off, things had been kinda stiff between us. She hadn't really been talking to me, so I asked her if we were ok, she said that we were completely fine and she was just really busy and without her phone. Then out of nowhere, she decided we were done.  

Her reason for it? School was starting back up later this month, and it 'wouldn't be fair' to be in a relationship. I even got the whole 'let's just be friends' spiel. (I know full well that I'll never see her again.) I was prepared to juggle school, a job, an internship, and her. I told her that I felt like I'd done something wrong, and she assured me that I hadn't, and doubled down on the whole 'it just won't work for me right now.' We haven't talked since then, and I know that I'll probably never talk to her again unless I do something unnecessary and reckless like reaching back out.  

Now I'm curious. I don't believe her, and honestly, I feel that I deserve to know why she ended things. I'm just not sure if I should prod, or if I should let well enough be well enough and be thankful that it was a clean breakup. I just feel like I let go too easily. Maybe I could also tell her that I really wished things would've ended differently."

Last year, I'd fallen in love with a girl. My friend warned me that she's rejected many before and she'll probably reject me too ( conservative family, religion etc. ). Regardless, I asked her and she rejected me. I was already battling with depression then and after this, I suffered from a lot of panic attacks. 
My friends tell me that I wasn't in love, it was just a crush, but I really don't think so. 
Four months later, I start to hang out with another girl. She's pretty fun and we both have a really great time. We meet almost everyday and make time for each other. She'd broken up with her boyfriend for a month by then. 
I finally felt that someone was attracted to me. But what happened was that people told me she was attracted to another guy. I asked her about it, but she told me he was just a friend.
One day during a depressive episode, I let it slip that I liked her. She stopped talking to me after that.

2 weeks later, I run into her at a bar, and I see her hugging and laughing with the guy.

During this time, I'd been also rejected by many companies for an internship, sometimes due to my CGPA and sometimes due to lack of skill. 

Since then, some suicidal thoughts crept into me and I always used to stare at the scissors on my desk and fantasised about slitting my wrists. I'd been a mess for month after that. I started doing mindful meditation and went to a therapist. 

But the thoughts on suicide keep coming, although less frequently. I feel like I'm ugly the first thing in the morning. I feel like no one would ever want to be with me because of my condition. I'm self aware about the fact that they are overly negative, but they're feelings so I feel them. Logic doesn't prevail in these fights.

4xicnk,2,2016-08-13,Feel like a walking zombie and failure,rainbowbirb,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4xicnk/feel_like_a_walking_zombie_and_failure/,"I can't take it anymore. Just graduated college w/ biology degree where everyone seemed smarter or at least more disciplined than me. Whereas students were working at a top firm each summer, I failed to get internships except for one for research on campus, where I was so clearly singled out by partners/TAs as the worst student to the point that I spent a lunch break crying alone in the adjacent classroom. It was supposed to be the one thing I should be able to do, and I had never felt judged like that before.

I can't help comparing myself to my friends/peers, while I'm doing nothing at my parents'. I drifted in and out of premed and didn't prepare myself for the corporate world. I feel embarrassed but I'm too terrified to even land my first job interview, no competence or credentials for job in bio research or industry (I couldn't afford grad school). My parents will not let me touch any position that's not prestigious, lucrative, or related to getting me into med school, which I excuse for all the hard work and money they put into my education and their belief in my potential.

I have zero idea what to live for. I lost all my hobbies. I'm not interested in dating or having kids. I never had a big sex drive, but after years of bullying/repeated rude or lukewarm treatment by males who would instantly be very kind only to my hot friends, I grew extremely bitter to the point that I destroyed my self-esteem and can't feel romantic interest. I cannot bear to hear my family pressure me one more time into birthing a damn baby for them already. I've lost my friends due to busy lives and quitting social media, but also secretly don't like to see them since it's excruciating effort, and I feel even worse about myself. And I really don't want to hear about their 51 boys.

I no longer hysterically cry in public, now I feel as exciting as a stick, and about as assertive as one. My parents have surrounded me with lots of love so I ceased wanting to end my life, I eat well and exercise, but I'm on autopilot everyday for the sake of my sanity. (Inb4: already tried therapy and meds, tired of volunteering because of underqualified bosses treating me super rudely for my free and very trivial work.)  I feel so used to rude or racist treatment that wherever I go, I'm paranoid that people are still judging me for my gender and race.

I'm studying for the MCAT, but it's very hard to focus; I know I'm going to feel so upset if I can't even get a good score or get into med school. I posted in StudentDoctor, but I doubt their advice (healing my mental health first) will ever come to fruition while I'm like this.

Nothing is wrong, yet nothing feels meaningful. Am I the only one ?!?"

So my question are:

- how much coding do I need to learn?  (I know html/css and a little bit of mysql, wordpress and php only) 

- what classes would you recommend me to take? 

- this might be a silly question.. But for a female in tech.. Is it harder to break into and get a job?  (I'm a bit worried). 

- any resources outside of school that you can recommend me? 

- what kind of portfolio does a ux designer show? (can you kindly review my portfolio?) 

- what is the program you use to complete said tasks? 

- as ux designer,  what are your main tasks in the job? 

- any other advice you can give me?

Im working as a intern in a small firm (10 ppl) that does environmental simulations. I program some app for them. Recently i got asked to substitute my superior for some months and also do their IT. Sure, pay is good, and it will be a new interesting challenge. 

So my superior spends a week to hand over all the server data, passwords, mails, etc to me, talks me through stuff i have to do, we even start a trello board with weekly tasks, important server stuff. I also get a 20 page document that contains all the emergency procedures.

Im a bit overwhelmed, my major is on programming, im no sysadmin and i mainly use windows, not linux. But i can do it. I set up a raspberry pi at home to mirror the server setup (well, not exactly mirror, but i try to familiarize myself at home with all the backup procedures, etc)

Fast forward one week. My superior is gone, i prepared myself really hard. Time for some challenges! Here they come:

- Can i get a replacement mouse? -&gt; Yes.

- How do i print? -&gt; See that drop down list? Select a printer.

- Please reset my password. -&gt; No. You are writing it wrong. Its a small o, not a big O.

- We have no WLAN?! -&gt; Someone disconnected the router.

- Can you install word? -&gt; Sure.

- And my biggest dread: There is a modern coffe machine with a LCD monitor in the kitchen. For me its a ticking time-bomb. I just know it.

Totally not what i imagined my job to be. Well, ofcourse its great that the server works, but i dont feel that im doing IT.

4xj7tj,352,2016-08-13,Kimmy Schmidt helped me climb a mountain past my plateau. (SV and NSV),BrianLemur,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/4xj7tj/kimmy_schmidt_helped_me_climb_a_mountain_past_my/,"Today marks 90 days of this, and I thought I would share this week's victory to celebrate.

Most of my loss strategy has just been counting calories and going on walks. I have arthritis in a lot of joints, so most exercise is a massive painful chore that inevitably leaves me in bed for the next day or two after. I often had to sit out of activities that I loved like kickball in elementary school, quitting the football team in Jr. High, and at one point even standing out of a parade when I was in marching band. It made me grow to resent most physical activity, because if I heard my friends were out playing a game of capture the flag, or getting together to go for a hike, I was basically just going to not attend. At least, that WAS the case.

About 3 weeks ago, I hit a bit of a mini-plateau in weight loss. I've been easily doing 2 pounds a week, and some weeks closer to 3 or 4. Then suddenly, I was stuck at 249 and no amount of calorie counting would make it work. I started extending my walks from one hour to two. I cut some more junky foods out of my diet. Nothing changed. I even went back up to 250 for a few days.

The IT guy at my new job is a bit like me--kind of an overweight gamer type, but who's trying to turn that around. He often takes the interns out on long hikes, and finally invited us to our first one last weekend. ""It'll be a blast. Not too difficult. Tons of fun. We just hike up the trail on this small mountain, it's a few miles of a walk, then come back down and go get some lunch.""

Because of hid description, I wore basically cloth shoes--the kinds I go on for my long walks. This was a huge mistake, but made for some pretty funny moments. See, what they didn't tell me is that this ""trail"" actually involved actively climbing rock walls at a 60-75 degree angle. This was not a ""trail"" so much as series of rock climbing walls. I lost my shoe so many time I can't even count them, and definitely dropped it on a kid's head once. Still, once I was there, I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of the other interns, the IT guy, his son, his son's girlfriend, the old intern... so I bucked up, figured I would either hurt my body or hurt my pride, chose my body and kept climbing.

I was puffing and panting my way up the whole time. I threw up after the first climbing section (likely because I had been drinking the night before, but also from exertion). After the first half hour, I was considering climbing back down and waiting in the car because it was just too much to bear. And then I remembered something Kimmy Schmidt said: ""You can do anything for ten seconds. So just count to ten while you do it, and when you're done, count another ten seconds."" I don't know why this was so motivating to me, but I did it. I counted to ten, then started over. And over. And over.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/ZSOXd) is a picture of us at the first peak. I'm the one on the right with the horrifyingly inappropriate shoes. We continued up about a mile after this, then back down for an extra mile of walking. After this, I drove home, took a shower, took a nap, and then woke up feeling... refreshed? I was definitely sore, and not lactic acid sore, but it felt good anyway. I stayed in bed because I had definitely overdone SOMETHING, but it felt SO GOOD to have just climbed a mountain on a whim.

I did my weigh ins for the week (I do daily, I know a lot of people recommend against it but it keeps my OCD happy and lets me get a detailed graph of my weight loss) and immediately noticed the number start to dip again. The day after, I had already dropped 1 pound from all the work (and probably water). Throughout the week, I was finding myself losing about a half-pound per day, which is about right based on my CICO measurments. What's more, the weight I've already lost (about 15% of my bodyweight) has made many of my symptoms improve, and I was able to get back out of bed later that day and go for another walk. I was officially past my plateau, and I felt like the world's biggest badass.

I guess my advice is, if you hit a plateau, climb a mountain. Every single setback on this journey feels like an insurmountable object has been placed in front of us and it's incredibly easy to just sit back and give up because it's going to be a challenge. Climb that mountain anyway. It's what makes us look good, feel good, be in a better place. And if you think that mountain is tough, just climb that mountain for ten seconds. If you survive, climb it for another ten. Then do it again until you conquer that shit.

Edit: Wow! Thank you all for the support. It has been an incredible week for me in a lot of ways, and today I decided to finally take the plunge. I consulted with my doctor, asked about some options, and finally joined a gym. It's not just about weight loss anymore. I plan to spend the next year of my life getting somewhere that I can be proud to maintain. I already had my first workout tonight, and it felt fabulous. I plan on doing two separate workouts tomorrow (assuming I don't wake up crippled from today's mistake) and pushing myself further than I've ever been. I'm going to climb that mountain again some day, and beat its ass for the way it treated me. Keep kicking ass, all of you!"

She was an intern at a newspaper for the summer and she was arrested and charged with trespassing for doing her job,trespasslegalhelp,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xk3rm/help_needed_for_my_niece_she_was_an_intern_at_a/,"She was charged with *California Penal Code Section 602* for trespassing. Basically it was a misunderstanding and she was just doing her job (she had an internship at a newspaper in our town for the summer)

What happened was that she was sent by her bosses at the newspaper to go and ask someone for an interview. The person had exposed corruption and bribery with people who worked from the town and was fired years earlier. Some of the people who were arrested in that case are getting out of jail now and the newspaper was interested in hearing from the exposer.

My niece went to the person's home and knocked on the door but the person wouldn't open the door. She told my niece to leave but when my niece called her boss at the newspaper the boss told her to keep trying so my niece knocked again. The person opened the door but wouldn't answer any questions and told her to leave but at the point the police showed up.

My niece was arrested because when the police officer asked her if she was asked to leave she did say yes but she was trying to explain that she was just doing her job. My niece was raised to be truthful and respectful to the police. She was arrested for trespassing. To add insult to injury the person who she was supposed to interview took pictures of my niece being arrested with her cell phone and posted them along with my niece's name on Facebook about how she was being harassed and continues to be harassed since she exposed the corruption. The police won't investigate our concern about my niece being slandered on Facebook.  

The person won't drop the charge. The prosecutor offered a deal where my niece would plead guilty and get a $250 fine but no jail. Her public defender told her to take it because she told the police she was asked to leave and because the doorbell camera on the front porch has audio where the person told my niece to leave four times and she was being recorded. My niece doesn't want a criminal record so her parents got her a paid criminal lawyer and he told them the same thing. They both said she could go to jail or pay $1000.00 if she has a trial.

This was all a misunderstanding. She's only 20 and has never been in trouble before and she still has two years of school left and a guilty plea means her losing her scholarship and a criminal record. Her bosses knew this person has never given and interview about what happened before and doesn't like reporters but they sent my niece anyways. What can we do here? Can my niece sue the homeowner for slander for posting pictures of her on Facebook without permission? Can her bosses be held liable? Sorry for all the questions but my niece needs help and I am going to do everything that I can for her."

I already tried searching to see if it's been asked/answered before but no dice.

Background: Young 20s college kid studying CS, right now working an internship making an iOS app for a local government agency.

Exactly what the title says, how do you get your mind off programming when it's time for bed? If I've been working on a project all day, when I lie in bed all I can see is lines of code fly across my eyelids. It's especially frustrating when I think of a solution to a problem I'd encountered and feel compelled to rocket out of bed to try it immediately because I know I won't remember it in the morning. 

I definitely try to disengage some couple hours before going to bed, but as a college kid there's just some nights where I'm up working until I physically can't keep my eyes open anymore. I feel like I'll pass out any second but just can't because my brain is stuck in developer mode. 

Sometimes it even sticks around across weekends or vacations! I'll be out with friends or even just chilling reading a book or gaming but my mind will suddenly kick back into programming mode and work on my project even though I'm not even physically in front of my workstation.  

I really really enjoy problem solving--that's what got me into CS in the first place--but sometimes I just want to disengage and do something completely unrelated...do you have any tips?"

A study 6 years ago found that 30% of Americans are arrested by the age of 23. Some dismiss that figure, believing that being arrested isn't a big deal. It is. It's traumatic of most people. Often you're in jail for days just to see a judge to get bail. Many defendants cannot afford bail and have to wait in jail for months just to get a trial. After about a month, given the option of a plea bargain (which often for minor offenses would allow them to get out that day) or waiting, in jail, for months for a trial, all the while they can't earn money and they have bills to pay and a family to support, almost all of them take the plea regardless of their guilt. For those who have been charged with more serious crimes, going to trial generally comes at the cost of facing a ten times longer sentence. This coerces many to take a plea despite a strong defense. And it leads to those with the strongest defenses receiving the worst sentences because they're more likely to beat the government at trial. Unfortunately the government has massive advantages, which leads to it winning almost all of its cases - even when it shouldn't. Our criminal justice system ruins the lives of young people by destroying their employability over the most minor of offenses.
One man took a plea bargain after he was arrested for being in a public place without a stated lawful purpose (that's a real crime in Georgia). He was really arrested for allegedly looking inside cars in a parking lot. He was in jail for months before he was able to take a plea bargain. Another 18 year old boy was arrested and took a plea bargain for trespassing. He was visiting his parents at their apartment. He had been banned from the apartment complex except to see his parents. He had forgotten or not known about another caviat that he could only be on the grounds to walk too and from the apartment, but they were hanging out outside the apartment. He was also arrested for giving false information to the police. Specifically a false name, when in fact he gave his legal name, as shown on his drivers license and social security card. Fortunately the prosecutor dropped that charge, but the police did charge him with it. I could write a book on how unfair our system is and how irrational an attitude of ""if you can't do the time don't do the crime"" is, but I will end here and ask that you share your opinion."

My major concern is that I have no work/volunteer experience and barely any personal projects. I'm not making excuses but for context I had to deal with a bunch of family problems in highschool and freshman year I spend all my time studying so that my GPA would be high to get into the CS major (at UW students need to apply for majors and only 30% get into CS; thankfully I did). I also tried to get an on campus job but waited too long into summer and got rejected from almost everything I applied to because they already hired. My question is this: How fucked am I for getting an internship in the greater Seattle Area and is there anything I can do between now and when I apply to boost my chances?"
4xkqg2,2,2016-08-13,"I [20 F] hurt from past relationship, hesitant to be in relationship with best friend [20 M]",crocsandinlove,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xkqg2/i_20_f_hurt_from_past_relationship_hesitant_to_be/,"The back story. About two years ago I had my ""first"" relationship were I felt so lucky to be with this guy and I fell in love with him in a very short period of time. It was my freshmen year of college, and i had the opportunity to move in early for this leadership program. I met my friends Alex, Daniel, and James (Not real names) who also moved in early for the same program. Alex, Daniel, and I lived in the same dorm, whereas James lived on the opposite side of our small campus (it was about a 10 min walk from our dorm to James's). We all got very close and James and I ended up dating for about a month. I fell deeply in love with him because I never had been in a relationship before, and he is the first boy who has openly had taking a liking to me. James was the sweetest because he gave me so much attention. I would literally wake up to 30+ text messages saying how much he cared about me, and other goofy nonsense. I was the happiest girl in the world.   


This attention quickly came to an end after a month. He would no longer kiss me, walk me back to my dorm at night after we had spent the majority of the night together, and the text messages stopped. Furthermore, he would openly state how he was in love with a girl he went to high school with, and pondered if other girls around him would date him as we walked together between classes. It hurt but I pretended everything was okay. Alex stopped hanging out with us after we started dating too, because he didn't like the way James treated him (ex. Forcing him to come to his dorm instead of coming to where we all lived), in addition he didn't like that we were dating (within our friend group). I should have taken the hint that something was wrong, but I instead resented Alex because he didn't support the relationship. 


James, after a week of pandering about other women on campus, broke up with me and of course I insisted that we remain friends. I quickly fell into a deep depression that left me crying before each class and I was in a constant state of anxiety. I felt so alone. To bring this sad story to an end Alex, after treating him poorly, helped me so much. He was my rock and made me go out and do things, and as a result I made so many more friends. Although I ended the year a lot better off that how it started, the residual anxiety and depression from the relationship lingers on within me. My coping to improve my self-confidence was to have flings with guys, who I just used for sex, but they themselves used me just for sex and it overall did not help. My self-confidence was still and I instead told myself that I need to keep working on improving myself and not rely on others to feel happy (nor let others dictate my happiness). I completely cut James out of my life and Alex and I are still very good friends to this day. 


During this rough time I applied and was accepted to the school of my dreams that has the best program for my major. Fast forward to this past fall where I am starting my first year (as a sophomore) at my new school. I am living in the dorms again (Ugh!) so that I could meet new people and maybe make connections with others like I did with Alex. I met my roommate who had a strong personality but was very friendly. Her two friends lived in the room right across from ours and were equally as friendly. I was excited because they had invited me to parties, football games, and movie nights with them. I was having so much fun! However as school began to pick up, everyone became more on edge with each other and my roommate actively began excluding me from activities. It was entirely random and I didn’t think I did anything wrong. I had no one else to go to. I would literally spend the whole day not saying a word which left me at the end of the year (this past May) begging to come home, and leaving me with no social skills at all. 


Much to my surprise I applied to a paid internship and I got it. Meaning that I needed to get a sublet that was close to my new place of employment near my University. I knew that an acquaintance of mine Penny was looking for a sublet as well. I didn’t want to go into some random strangers home alone so I messaged her and we ended up picking this place just outside of campus. Each of us had our own rooms and it was very cheap!


Now, for the main part. I live with Allen and Kent who have a very close friend that doesn’t live with us, Oscar. We all hit it off together because of our similar interests like cars, video games, and TV shows. Oscar and I bonded over the video game Halo because we both share strong childhood bonds to the story. He is not the most attractive but he is still cute. He is very mature and the exact opposite of any guy that I had met previously (ex. He is mature, dresses nicely, and we both have the same reasoning/though processes about things). I feel so comfortable around him. I never feel like I have to reserve anything around him. Without a doubt Oscar and I clicked very easily and I feel like we have known each other for a very long time. 


About a month and a half ago we had a party at my house, where Penny invited some people from a club that we were in together. I wanted to have fun so I got pretty drunk. I started talking to this one guy at the party Brian who was blonde, tall, and muscular. We were talking about school, family, and what we were doing this summer. Drunk me thought it would be a good idea to show him the basement were there are various different paintings of our school mascot and colors (it’s actually really cool). I start showing him around and he and I end up making out for a while but nothing goes beyond that. I come up from the stairs after a good 15 minutes of being the only people down there. At the top of the steps I see Oscar and he just looks at me and walks away. My stomach just sinks and I feel so guilty because I knew that he may have feelings for me. I just run up to my room and start balling, in my inebriated state. I text Oscar “I need you right now” and moments later he is in my room taking care of my blubbering drunk self as I apologize relentlessly for what had just happened. We end up kissing once and I fall asleep.  


Things seem to be normal, but I try and shrug off what had happened (not a good ideal). Naturally, he confronts me and explains that he is upset with me and wonders why I had been ignoring/not giving him the same attention that I had used to (my reason: a poor attempt to distance myself from the situation).  What I tell him is that I don’t want to be in a relationship because of what had happened to me, to be independent, and work on myself after I apologized for not communicating with him. He starts crying and telling me that there is no way that him and I can hang out anymore because it will be too difficult for him. This devastates me because he (besides Penny) is the only person that makes me feel comfortable and really the only person that I can hang out with. He has single handily has cured my anxiety and depression. He is being very persistent, and brought up a very compelling argument stating that my independence does not need to go away if we were in a relationship and that we together can work together on improving on each other. I agree that that is how relationships are supposed to be built on but at the same time I want to be single. I ever since have been very flip floppy with him. Every time we hang out alone, he hugs me from behind, and gives me kisses on my forehead. But I don’t return the favor because I made that promise to myself that I would not involve myself in other guys (although I have actively broke it) in order to find out who I am without that defining factor in my life. 


As much as a gentleman that he is, he drinks a lot on his own but never gets hostile in any way. I just don’t drink that much, only this once in relatively large amounts. I had also talked to a new friend that I had made this summer Shannon who also knows Oscar. She explained to me that he is very rude to women, just wants them for their bodies, and when he dated Shannon’s friend he was manipulative. This came to me as a shock because this is not the guy that I have come to know this summer. Shannon saw that he and I were getting close, and she wanted to tell me before things got serious. I also explain to her my past relationship and why I want to be single (and what had happened that night). 


Tonight I agreed to go out with him on a date (something that we have not done) to my favorite restaurant to see if this who relationship can work. I don’t know what to do, because in the end I feel like I am just with him to make him happy and not myself. Yet at the same time he makes me so happy. I know i have treated him poorly and I feel bad for what I have done to him (I m surprised that he has not left me yet).  I really just don’t know what to do…   


  ---   
TL;DR: Past relationships is making me hesitant to be in another relationship. Become best friends with guy, I get drunk and make out with him who now wants to be in a relationship.  Am I being shallow for not wanting a relationship (because of his looks), wanting to be independent (to improve myself), also the fact that I only have known him for 3 months? Can I take an outsiders perspective (that describes him to be an abusive person) into consideration, although I have not seen it myself?

I realized after having accepted my internship last fall that I had all the necessary hours to sit for the CPA exam without having to attend a MAcc program, so once I realized this I planned to study full time for the CPA exams this fall, and take time off next winter/spring to work part time, relax, and travel before starting in the fall.

However, I got a call from my recruiter two days ago informing me that I could actually start this fall because hiring needs changes, and I would start about 6 weeks from now. I'm definitely thinking this is the way to go; but i can't decide which is the better options. My main hesitations about starting next month are:
1. I'll now have to study for the exams while working, and I'll most likely have to take some after they are changed next spring.
2. I feel like having some time off of school and work could be personally refreshing. I don't want to feel burned out. 
3. I would have to forego a 10 day trip to Portugal I have booked in January (aka eat the 2000 as a loss I spent on this).

For those of you who are currently working, what would you do in this situation?

After going through so many threads on here of the CS grads talking about having side projects, good grades, internships, and still having a tough time finding a full time job at the entry level. So many stories of students applying through job boards and STILL being unable to get a job.

The reason I say this is because I have a friend who graduated with a biology degree and he cannot find a job in his degree. My friend has had an interest in CS recently and even started a second bachelors which he is not sure he will finish. Already, he has to pay 1k+ for his first semester where he will be taking his intro to CS class because the school has the bullshit ""mandatory fees"" nonsense and his area does not have any community colleges in it that offer CS classes.

Now if he manages to finish his second BS, he would have already spent 10k+ and the prospect of still not being able to find a job will be very depressing for him

Then you also read the stories here about all of the guys that went to bootcamp and were very employable afterwards and the ""high demand"" for people that can program or are competent in this.

4xlv5w,11,2016-08-13,Request: First Bird Stories!,Probably_A_Ghost,parrots,https://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/4xlv5w/request_first_bird_stories/,"Hey all, I lurk here pretty often and wanted to ask for some of your stories about first birds. And the feelings right before you got them, and of course, right after.

A little story is behind this post too!

**TL;DR: I don't have a bird of my own and can't have one.**

To explain why I am making this specific request, it is a bit of a coping thing. I am in my late teens (Sophomore) and I love animals, except for when I was a kid I hated birds. This was because I had a relative with birds that were screeching bite monsters (and later I found out that was because they weren't taken out of their cage at all). Well, a couple summers ago I started hanging at a pet store as basically an unofficial intern (I even got offered a job for when I turned 18). I helped stock shelves and try to teach people the basics of owning animals, and how they behaved (in reality, it was mostly me telling people that rats are not disgusting monsters). But, one day, when walking past a particularly large bird cage a little blur of orange darted toward me in the corner of my vision. When I turned to observe what happened, I found a cheeky (haha, pun) little Sun Conure dancing at me. I found it sort of funny, the little bobbing motion, so I squatted down beside him. And of course, he did it again, and I mimicked him, and he started to sort of chirp at me and hop around. I started to figure that this was because his only visual opening was facing the inside of the aisle, and he might have been lonely. So I spent maybe an hour there with him, just laughing and enjoying his company, and I did the same thing for the next few days. Sure enough, one of the employees noticed and asked me if I wanted to hold him, and of course I said yes instantly. She gave him a step-up command (thank god for no nets) and then held him in front of me. I got a bit nervous, as my interaction with these creatures was never pleasant in the past, but I put my hand out and sure enough he hopped on. In that moment, I fell in love with birds, and especially conures. He just did a little happy jig on my hand and came up my arm a bit, exploring and letting me pet him as well. I came to know him well and within about a month he was gone, and I hope to a good home. I was researching birds for a year after that. Be it wild, domestic, or anywhere in-between, I had seen every online resource for it. Especially, of course, for conures. Proper diets, housing, interaction, all of it. Within a year and a half, I saved up plenty of money and asked to get one, which was replied with a ""yes"" by one member of my household who is a family member. That night, I spent 300 dollars getting a cage, proper toys, cuttlebones, etc. I was ready, extremely ready, to take in a feather-child and pamper it. Yet, the next day, a member of my household said no. Everything was set up and ready, and I knew of a sweet Greencheek waiting for a home. This person isn't family, and to not give out too much personal information, is a terrible tyrant of the household. When I looked to the actual FAMILY MEMBER who said yes, they would do nothing to help me, as that always tends to happen. As manly as I try to be, I cried that night, and it still gets to me if I stare at that cage in my room long enough. As a rather lonely student, I was excited to have a loyal and unconditional friend, and it is still heart breaking to me without a bird. So, often, I browse this sub or youtube for bird vids to fill the gap until I get out of this home, which should be soon, I hope. And with that slightly depressing story, thank you for reading, but help cheer me up with some stories!"
4xlvge,3,2016-08-13,How's the job perspective in San Jose for recent grad?,ViolentPotato06,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4xlvge/hows_the_job_perspective_in_san_jose_for_recent/,"I'm a recent grad in DFW area having a hard time landing a full-time job due to my visa status, despite a year and a half of internship during school. Meanwhile, I'm working on 2 part-time projects (unpaid), one locally and one in NYC, to hold off the unemployment day count, while looking for other opportunities within the area. Over the past 3-4 months, I had no luck. About 400+ job applications sent online but only a few calls for actual technical interview, most of which were unable to proceed due to USC/GCH requirement. Other kind of calls came from IT staffing firms which end up going nowhere as most of the recruiters were unaware of either my status or my actual years of technical experience. I want to keep trying, but my family fidgets and suggested me to relocate to San Jose where I will be living closer to my relatives and their supports. 

I've got a tough decision to make. 

My reasons of not to do it:

* Relocation seems risky since I don't know much about the job perspective for recent grad in San Jose, esp for those like me (I wonder if its going to be any different). 
* Google turned me down after an on-site interview earlier this year made me think that Sillicon Valley is only reserved for the most intelligents.
* Living expeneses there are probably higher than Dallas's as far as I understand. 
* Having to start making new friends and connections all over again (this will be my 3rd time doing this over the past 6 years)
 
Reasons to do it:

* Silicon Valley
* Family support, living closer to relatives
* Weather??

Please fill me in on this matter. I know if it's not much different from Dallas, I wouldn't want to move at all.

4xmcv0,1,2016-08-13,[M4F] Love amid the Swedish furniture,sexpanther12,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4xmcv0/m4f_love_amid_the_swedish_furniture/,"If there's a hell, surely it's IKEA on a Saturday. At least I know what's waiting for me. I don't know how long I've been stuck in this shopping paradox, where time seems to have come to a complete stop, and yet I can feel my day off slipping through my fingers like so many grains of sand. My in-depth study of the floor tiles has produced nothing conclusive as I follow my wife blindly around the store, shoulders slumped, offering occasional nonverbal forms of agreement. 

We're examining a thoroughly uninteresting dresser when I notice an attractive piece, and I'm not talking about furniture. It's just a glimpse from across the room of a woman in tight clothing that hugs curves that would make Botticelli blush, but there's something magnetizing about her. She's ahead of me, moving toward the desks and then vanishing. I urge my wife forward with renewed vigor, and she is caught up in my sudden and rare enthusiasm. 

""I really want to check out those Bjergensens honey! They looked great in that catalog you showed me."" Were Bjergensens a thing? I don't know. Sounds Swedish though. I round the corner, wife in tow, frantically scanning the area for the goddess who had just graced my peripheral vision. There was a twinge of familiarity in my brain, telling me I knew the woman, but surely that was a false impulse. I couldn't think of anyone I knew that looked like her.

Not a corner of the department escapes my sight, yet she somehow does. Maybe she's farther along? My heart sinks. I have to find her.

""Here are the Brusalis, dear. Is this what you meant?"" my wife calls out from behind me as I walk along the aisle.

Yep, this really is hell. We must have crashed on the way here and this is how I shall forever spend eternity. I make a note to pick out something light because I'll probably be pushing it on an inevitable broken shopping cart later and forever.

I turn toward the Brusalis -- that doesn't sound Swedish at all -- and bump right into my mystery woman. Only it's not a mystery at all. I know you. How could I not know you? 

""Holy shit! Hi!"" I say, my surprise overpowering the small bit of any goddamn sense I have left. I did know you, but I certainly could tell my wife how. She appears at my side so fast that I'm sure she's really some otherworldly demon in disguise here to torture me for my earthly sins. An afternoon of arguing must be next on the agenda. Kudos, Satan, you know me too well. She/it speaks before you can.

""Who's this, sweetie?"" The last word is absolutely drenched in venom. 

""Oh, uhhhhh ..."" I say, locking eyes with you.

******************

Thanks for reading! My idea is that you realize the predicament I'm in an decide to take advantage, teasing me in various ways, which eventually turns into sneaky sexual escapades. I wrote this with the idea of your character being a pornstar in mind, but we can do something else if that doesn't suit you. A recent affair, an intern at my office, my favorite stripper or whatever else you might want to be. Also doesn't have to be IKEA, if you find that Target is what really rustles your jimmies.

Kinks obviously include cheating and semi-public sex. I find character and setting are often my biggest turn ons, so I'm pretty open to accommodating your interests, but I just can't get into ageplay or the darker stuff.

I'm also looking for more detailed responses over a longer period of time. I have some time tonight but we likely won't finish unless you're just that good.

Looking forward to those orange envelopes!"

My mother and I moved to the United states when I was 5, we immigrated here illegally from El Salvador after we were denied a visa to enter the country. The main reason as to why we immigrated to the U.S. was because of the danger that we faced in the country, due to the death threats brought upon by the actions of my mom in reporting a crime that she witnessed. The period before my high school career has nothing of significance, I performed horribly in middle school and did not partake in any extracurriculars besides soccer. My Freshman year I was very unmotivated academically, due to that I performed poorly earning various B’s, this is what tanked my GPA. The following years my GPA saw an upward trend and since then I have not earned a grade lower than an A-. I also started to become more involved in extracurriculars after my freshman year.

Internships:
Chemical Engineering: I’ve been working at the ChemE department for about a year, during my first 6-7 months here I aided my mentor in preparing materials for his classes and helped in his own personal research endeavours. In the last 3 months I’ve been working on a project that he assigned to me, it’s really close to completion. 
Molecular Biology (via a university sponsored research program): During the 8 weeks of the official program I was able to work in a lab researching a project assigned by the lab’s PI. At the end of the program a poster session was held and we were able to showcase our research. I will continue to work in the lab throughout the school year.

Senior project:
We are required to complete a senior project in order to graduate at my school, the project has to be approved by a board, mentored by a selected faculty member and presented towards the end of the year to a group of faculty.

In collaboration with the technology/engineering teachers and clubs at my school I will be launching a community outreach project. This project will be aimed at the children/ siblings of faculty and students ages 7-13. I will be teaching 4 classes in which the children will be introduced to the Arduino microcontroller, the final objective will be to create a small car from a kit of parts provided to the students. The kit of parts will include various electronics as well as an arduino microcontroller, I will fundraise the capital to purchase and create these kits. The last component of the project would be to create a website where I would upload videos and tutorials which cover more material than the class and have additional resources. My mentor and I hope that this program will become a legacy project for future students, I have high hopes for it and i'm working my ass off to make it a reality.

4xmxj5,19,2016-08-14,[MEET REPORT] USAPL Summer Showdown Open - 562.5kg/1240lbs @ 89.6kg/196lbs (350 Wilks) - M Raw Open,DanieiTran,powerlifting,https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/4xmxj5/meet_report_usapl_summer_showdown_open/,"**Background**

* Powerlifting for 2.5 years now
* 5th meet but first IPF sanctioned meet. I'm actually Canadian and in the CPU, but I'm doing an internship in SoCal with Chad Wesley Smith, Max Aita and Dr. Quinn Henoch at Juggernaut Training Systems.
* The day before I had to work and do some heavy lifting moving and building deadlift platforms.
* The night before I slept from 9PM to 1030PM. Went back to bed at 3-4AM and woke up at 9-930AM.  

**Training**
* Training wasn't the best and I wasn't expecting much. I was supposed to compete in Canada on June 12th, but I flew out to California on June 9th. So, my training went from a high volume accumulation phase to a peaking phase to dicking around for 2 weeks before my internship (no training plan, just having fun).

* When I got out here, Chad told me to do to the meet and I had 8 weeks to prepare for it. Was following Blaine Sumner's protocol in his book, Gorilla Warfare, but changed it part way through because it wasn't working for me. Final weeks of training I did Smolov Jr for my bench.

* Squats were feeling good, but there wasn't enough volume for me to really do anything and I actually failed 455lbs in the gym. Towards the end of the training block though everything started to click and I hit 463lbs the week prior to the meet.

* Bench started off really poorly because I injured my AC joint a few months back and it hasn't fully recovered, but things started to pick up towards the end. I remember my first day I struggled to bench 100kgs for a single cause of my AC joint when just prior to hurting it I was doing 102.5kgs for 3x5 and even hitting an 8RM on it and doing close grip with 90kgs, close grip, at the end of my workouts. I managed to hit 115kgs a week out.

* Deadlifts were going terrible the entire cycle. One day I would hit 455lbs for 3x3 on deload week, then pull 210kgs for a bunch of singles and then one day I couldn't move 215kgs off the ground. I ended up taking 2 weeks off from pulling and hit 225kgs for a single a week out.

**The Meet**

* I got to the gym at 1130AM and was set to lift at 130PM. Don't think I actually started lifting until 3-30PM though. Had to go commando because I didn't bring any briefs with me from Canada. I should also mention I had to mail my singlet over from Canada 2 weeks out.

**Warm Ups**

* Had to warm up Squats with bumper plates making things harder than they should've been. Last warm up was 190kgs I believe.

* It's impossible for me to warm up for Bench because I have such a low rack height and such a big arch that I can't share racks with anyone. So, ended up having to share with some people and getting them to unrack for me and getting set up after it was unracked. Last warm up was 105kgs, which moved well.

* A few days out from the meet I tried a wider stance Sumo and liked how it felt and thought I'd warm up with my regular Sumo and the wider Sumo, and whichever felt better I'd use. I opted for the wider stance that I had like 3 days of practice with.

**Squats:**

* 1st: 202.5kg: Felt heavy on the unrack, but the lift itself moved well and I nearly passed out afterwards
* 2nd: 217.5kg: Same thing as the first.
* 3rd: Debated between playing it safe and going for 220.5 or 225, but opted for 227.5 instead. Felt super heavy, coming down I thought I was going to fail, but coming up I thought I had it. Got stuck about half way up and failed.

217.5kg is technically a PR. I've done 222.5kg in a meet before, but that was with a 24hr weigh ins and I weighed in at 88.2kg and was probably up to 93-95kg for the meet.

**Bench:**

* 1st: Opened with 110.0kg. I have a really wide grip with Japanese grip and a big arch, so it was impossible to warm up with sharing racks. Spotter ripped the bar up and out on the unrack and I almost lost tightness making it harder than it should've been, but got it.
* 2nd: Went up to 117.5kg and smoked it. A little tough off the chest for a second, but got it up.
* 3rd: Went to 122.5kg I believe and it felt good coming down until I touched it on my chest. Knew I was gonna fail, but then it started moving and I thought, ""Woah! I might get this!"" Then I didn't...

Still a meet PR. Previous best was 112.5kg, so it was nice to hit this. Think I could've been smarter and done a smaller jump, but I knew what I wanted.

**Deadlifts**

* 1st: Opened with 215kg and this went up very well. I looked around at the judges because I thought I dropped it too quickly, but they all gave me whites. I talked to the head judge who is Joey Flexx's girlfriend, Tina, and she told me I dropped it as she said down.
* 2nd: Went to 227.5kgs and it went up well. It went up so fast that I didn't have time to lock out my knees before my hips and I had this weird stutter like a hitch. 3 whites. Also tore a callus on my hand.
* 3rd: Went for 240kgs and I made the mistake of going too wide and having my toes on the plates. As I pulled it up, my feet were pushing the weights down. Then I moved my feet in, but knew it wouldn't count and stopped there.

**Overall**

* Overall, technically a PR on everything. Not the best meet I've had, but considering all things it did go fairly well. Marisa and Chad did a great job of running the meet and it was so fucking cool having Leanna Carr, Joey Flexx and Tina Tornado being my judges. Also lifted in the same flight as Hani and were helping each other out. He won best lifter. 

* Oh and Leanna Carr gave me a hug at the end of the day. No big deal.

I'm currently a general Comp Sci student who's about to graduate (Fall).
As such, I was wondering if any recent or soon to be grads have any advice for the job market. 

Ideally, I would prefer some job in Ontario or BC, but Montreal works too!

That said, I have a few questions if you don't mind. 

1. Did you have internships? If yes, how did you get them? (I am not in co-op)
2. Did you complete personal projects? How big? What about?
3. How many interviews have you had, and how many offers have you gotten? 
4. If you landed a job, is it something that you enjoy doing or is it just to get your foot in the door?
5. What would you advise upcoming students to do to higher chances of work? (Think 2nd or 3rd year students out of 3.)


Thank you so very much for any and all replies! If any have any other tips or tricks, it's a blessing too! Job market here for CS feels very stagnated.."
4xnaib,1,2016-08-14,Is there any chance she is into me?,EasyPeezy124,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/4xnaib/is_there_any_chance_she_is_into_me/,"So let me lay out the timeline since it may help understand the situation. Let's call this girl Chelsea

**May '15:** I start a summer internship and meet Chelsea

**May '15 - August '15:** The interns spent all day 40 hours a week in the same room so obviously we spent a lot of time together. I become friends with Chelsea first then another girl, and another guy. We started going out to lunch together everyday and hanging after work some too. 

I always felt much closer to Chelsea and she seemed to always be kinda flirty with me (would come over to my desk to talk, send playful e-mails, etc). We got along really well and I started to really fall for her. I didn't enjoy the actual work we did, but I looked forward to going to work everyday just because I'd get to spend time with her. 2-3 weeks in, she brings up her boyfriend which I didn't know she had. She never talked about him. So that obviously changed things and dampened my hopes. We still hung out and everything became really good friends. I'm not great at reading people so she could have been flirting with me or could not. I do know for sure that she made way more of an effort to talk to me than anyone else.

**August '15:** The internship ends and we all go back to school. Her college was about an hour away from mine. And also at this point, I know for sure her and her BF are still together because they were going to a lakehouse together right after the internship ended.

**September '15:** A few weeks after it ended, she snapchatted me. Then we start sending back n' forth over the next few weeks. 


She likes my instagram picture that was just of me. She texts me out of the clear blue to ask how my job search was going (I was graduating college in December). We then start texting back n' forth for a while. She would take a while to reply, but always had very long responses with questions to keep the convo going. So kinda mixed signals there.

**October '15:** We are still texting occasionally, and I'm feeling pretty good about things. All signs in my mind point towards her liking me, but the problem is the boyfriend. I wasn't sure if they were still together (no pics on facebook or snapchat or instagram of them) and she never mentions him. And I didn't want to randomly just ask ""hey are you and that guy still together"". Eventually I just decide to say fuck it and ask her out to dinner. I didn't have much to lose. She says ""That sounds like so much fun, but I can't because blah blah blah. Maybe we could do another weekend?"" I try to play it off cool and just say something like ""Okay, well have fun! Just let me know whenever you're free"". She very well could have still been dating her boyfriend at this point, but she didn't mention him as why she couldn't go to dinner. She was actually busy that weekend because her friends came into town to stay with her, but on the other hand I figure if she wanted to actually go out with me or be with me then she would find a way so I basically give up on us being together. 

**November '15:** We are still texting occasionally, but not anywhere near as much as before. So, I end up meeting another girl who eventually becomes my girlfriend.

**December '15 - May '16:** My girlfriend and I continue dating.

**May'16:** One of our friends from that internship is getting married so I go to the wedding with my girlfriend. Of course, Chelsea is there as well. We catch up on things and she mentions that her and the boyfriend broke up (didn't seem like it was recent at all). I realize I still definitely have feelings for Chelsea, but that wasn't very surprising.

**June '16:** My girlfriend and I break up. Nothing major really happened, but I felt like the relationship had run its course so I broke up with her. This had nothing to do with Chelsea. At this point, she was just someone in my past in my mind.

However, my ex-gf and I do the whole change your profile picture on facebook to a picture of you not together. And I change mine then Chelsea likes my picture, but she never liked any of the many many pictures of me and my gf together which I found interesting. So this combined with seeing Chelsea at the wedding has her right back in my mind. 

**July '16 - August '16:** I move into a new apartment. I see on snapchat that Chelsea is moving as well and so I text her to see where there moving. She got a job in the same city as me and her new apartment is only about 10 minutes away. We text back-n-forth catching up on things. So now I'm really not sure what to do, is there any chance this girl is into me? I mean she never did ""let me know when she was free"" so that we could go out. However, she could have still been with her boyfriend at that point then whenever they did break up I was in a relationship with my new gf.   Also, I'm not even sure now if she knows I'm single. The profile pic change may have hinted it, but we never really talked about our relationships. But I keep going back to the whole thing of ""If she wants to be with you, she'll be with you"".So I kind of have no idea how to play this. I feel like now is the perfect time to start dating if we are ever going to, but I don't know what to do or if I'm just wasting my time here and she just thinks of me as another guy. I was thinking maybe I'd invite her to go out to the bars whenever we get a group together, but I don't want to fall in the friend-zone if I'm not already there...Or do I just give up since I already asked her out once and it'd be incredibly stupid to keep pursuing her

I apologize for the long post, but I wanted to lay the whole thing out there."
4xnb5r,4,2016-08-14,"[24/M] cheats on his [24/F] repeatedly. Ended it, now feeling lost. In crisis",Mayt13,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4xnb5r/24m_cheats_on_his_24f_repeatedly_ended_it_now/,"I don’t know what to say. I hate myself so much. For the first year it was the best thing I had ever had in my life. Gorgeous smart girl, great sex, similar interests, wonderful comradery, equal partnership; it was beautiful. 
Then we started to rub one another the wrong way. I am aggressive and irreverent and she can be controlling and pig headed. We always managed to work through it; I always put communication first. The great sex helped. It stayed like this for another eight months.

&amp;nbsp;

We went through some serious troubles when she began to act cold and distant, turns out her birth control in particular made her really disinterested in sex (found this out later). 

&amp;nbsp;

This is where I started to compromise the trust and sank down this slippery slope of lies into the pit I am in now. Just today, I broke up with her because It was the only way I had out. I couldn’t tell her I loved her one more time after all the things I have done. I love her and couldn’t bear to do her wrong anymore; I want to die.
About a year ago, I randomly ran into an attractive older woman who asked me to help her move. Being the shameless flirt I am, we began to hit it off. To my surprise, I managed to seduce her. I came to my senses when she was stroking my dick in the parking lot. I’d never had an experience where the flirting lead somewhere so quickly, especially with older women. I tried to keep it from mind and never told her. At the time I had no idea what a mistake this was.

&amp;nbsp;

She was still being so cold and cruel to me I had mixed feeling at the time. I had no idea how this single “little” act could lead to me completely compromising my character. I was consumed with lust for this woman because it felt amazing to be wanted again (especially so strongly).

&amp;nbsp;

Then she cheated on me with her ex. I knew he was still interested and urged her not to hang out with him, she did anyway. I was mad, but since they only made out, I got over it quickly. We managed to hate fuck it out without much consequence. 

&amp;nbsp;

She was still on the birth control and acting cold. She became more and more distant until finally I asked her if we should break up. She said yes. I was torn to shreds. This was the woman I loved and wanted for the rest of my life. I was so fucked up I went out and hooked up with her gay friend (who I had flirted with before); it was awful. Turns out I’m not gay. 

&amp;nbsp;

I thought we were done at this point, but then Her friend mediated between us, and we ended up getting back together a week later. It was so nice to have her back, that I was so afraid to tell what had happened. 
For the love of god, why didn’t I take that opportunity to return to honesty? If I could give up anything to go back in time and redo this I would. Anything, any amount of pain.

&amp;nbsp;

Things started to improve, and we fell back into love. However, we couldn’t escape our history. Old stupid arguments kept cropping up, breaking up the happy times with little farces. For the first time in our relationship, she moved out. I felt empty and alone without her, but the relationship improved, steadily. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was focusing on school and graduated, she was dealing with her life. We would meet up, smoke hookah, fuck and cuddle. It wasn’t perfect but it worked for us. Some really intense romantic moments kept us feeling like it was something we wanted to do.

&amp;nbsp;

Then I got an internship and started commuting out of state. This is when I ruined my life (even more than before when I had compromised my character and integrity by not telling the whole truth). 
To get on my work schedule, I got on Ambien to deal with my insomnia. It hardly worked for me so I started drinking with it. One night when I was at the hotel bar, to which I had been a dozen times I got into a conversation with an old man. I had taken my Ambien and gotten a few drinks, as I had done before so I could go up to my room and fall asleep immediately. 

&amp;nbsp;

We were talking and I followed him up to his room to finish my thought (I had no reason to believe this was anything but platonic). Then as I was leaving, he grabbed my dick. This is when I found out that Ambien makes me act insane. I let him fuck me. I have no idea why. It must have been intentional because I went back to my room to retrieve condoms. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I woke up the next day, I felt like I had raped myself. I wanted to die. I almost did kill myself. It was something I knew I’d never be able to reconcile with her. She was always concerned by my bi-curious tendencies. This was such an utter betrayal of myself and of her that I felt physically ill. It consumed my thoughts. 
I tried desperately to compartmentalize it. To forget it. I started making all kinds of wild justifications. I thought that maybe if I just never did it again, we could live happily. I didn’t want to tell anyone and carry this secret to the grave. 
I broke down and confided in a friend over the phone the next night while also drunk and on Ambien (It seem obvious now that this was stupid, but I had been drinking and taking Ambien for months without incident, and didn’t immediately correlate it with the previous night, yet anyway).
An obviously gay Indian man overheard me talking sitting outside on the curb. He paced back and forth in front of me, then sat down about 10m away. Once I had hung up, I went and sat next to him (for the love of god, WHY? WHY DID I DO THIS A SECOND TIME?!?). 

&amp;nbsp;

He asked to see my dick, so I showed him (I’ve always been quite proud of it and love to show it off). We went to the hotel guy and he started to suck me off, then he decided he had to go and asked me to fuck him the next night. I gave him my number.

&amp;nbsp;

I tottered up the stairs and fell into my bed. When I woke up the next morning, I had a crushing feeling as I realized what I had done. I wanted to die. I blocked his number. I got tested before I went home (luckily clean) and tried to act as though nothing had happened.
I saw my girlfriend, we had sex (which was intimate and amazing and only made me hurt more because I realized what I had thrown away) and I tried to forget. 

&amp;nbsp;

I started to talk to my friends about it. I was in moral crisis. Committed to this life I couldn’t have anymore. How was there any way back to honestly? How could I ever apologize for what I had done? I couldn’t and I knew that, but I felt like I could master myself and change, maybe I could get back to what we’d had (I knew in my heart this was a lie, but I had no idea how much worse it could get).

&amp;nbsp;

I stopped taking the Ambien. The next week, I was bored and lonely and decided to go out and grab some hookah, maybe try to meet some friends. I started a conversation with two girls, keeping it strictly platonic. Eventually her friend left and it was just the two of us. I wasn’t quite done with the night and she recommended drinks. I consented. 

&amp;nbsp;

We went to an arcade bar and played some House of the Dead, I was pretty shitfaced at this point. She started coming on to me and I kissed her. She drove me home and we fucked (she is nowhere as hot as my ex and I have no idea why I did this, it wasn’t even satisfying, not that it matters).

&amp;nbsp;

The next night I met up with her again and this time we smoked some hookah and this time I fucked her sober. We hung out, then she left. I felt strange. Like I had lost my way in my life. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just got back in town, and my now ex sent me a heart. I didn’t even respond. I felt like the world’s biggest piece of shit. I wanted to die. I talked at length at the bar with a man I respect about the situation. He told me to end it, and I knew I had to.

&amp;nbsp;

I called her up and somehow she knew. I meet up with her, got in her car and told her we had to break up because I was a cheating piece of shit, and that I couldn’t bear to do her wrong anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I’m lost. I have very few people in my life I care about. I hate my family; I have two real friends. That’s it. I just want to pick up this Glock on my desk and end it.

&amp;nbsp;

If I somehow get through this, all the pain I’ve caused the woman I love, at least maybe I can learn to love and respect my SO properly. From my time on r/Relationship_Advice, I have learned absolute honestly and trust are essential to a relationship. Generally, I am an extremely honest, upfront person; I hate lying, it makes me feel sick. 

&amp;nbsp;

That little seed of dishonestly I planted has grown into a web of vines tying me down and throttling me. I’m reaping the reward. I had no other path back to honesty or the kind of man I want to be. But now I’m broken and alone (and rightly so).

&amp;nbsp;

Perhaps I will remember this pain, the pain of knowing I’ll never be able to get here back *before* I decide to step out on an SO. Or maybe I’ll just blow my brains out and be done with it. FML

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR
Cheated, didn’t tell my SO
Hooked up during breakup, didn’t fess up
Cheated again, twice in the most horrible way while high, had a crisis
Finally cheated in an even worse way, while sober.

so what I'm looking for is a gaming laptop for up to 1000€ (about 1116$)

I'll probably pick one out of these 4, but I'm just not sure which one to get.

I want to play games like GTA 5 on it or other games that will be available for ps 4 later on. But I also want to use it for school or college.

Notebook 1:

This was my number 1 choice for a few days, but I think I might have found better ones (the other 3). It doesn't have an intern drive, I'd have to get an extern one. But it does have SSHD. And it's only 2.3kg.

Notebook 2:

It has skylake (which I guess is a good thing?!), It has an intern drive and only weighs 2.4 kg. It does have a hybrid-disk, which I've heard isn't as good as an ssd(?)

Notebook 3:

This one has a SATA-disk, which I've heard is better than hybrid. Other than that it's basically the same as Notebook 2.

Notebook 4:

This one has two slots for RAM (which I'm not sure if it's a good thing... I'm not sure if I'd actually put something in, as I don't know too much about notebooks)
It also got SATA-disk with 1 TB.

so I'm not too sure about these, I hope they help a little bit since all the information is in german :/

which of these would you choose? which of these would you choose and change something, put something inside?

I hope you can help me :)"

I only have to submit a Master Thesis and I'm finished with university. Since I'm in the engineering field we have the option to work at a corporation for about a year and then write the Master thesis in cooperation with the University and the corporation.

I'm currently looking into companies which I'm interested in and one of my main goals is to work for Tesla one day. (I already have experiences in the automotive industry and its components suppliers due to some internships)


* I was wondering if Tesla has a student program where you can make an internship and write your thesis with them since I haven't found something online?

* How high are the chances that they recruit someone from Europe for their US locations?

* Are there any chances that I'm going to write my Master Thesis with them?

I'm graduating in May 2017 with my Mechanical Engineering degree. I've been working since my freshman year of high school and have had the same job the past 4 years (as well as an internship from summer 2015). I'm going to start applying to full-time positions fairly soon, so I need to update my resume accordingly.

My questions:
1. Should I remove any information about my high school?
2. Should I keep my earlier work positions on my resume, even if they are not directly applicable? I was thinking of removing the descriptions, but just keeping the titles and locations. Example positions: cashier or receptionist.
3. Unrelated to resumes, but more so for my career, I did not have an internship this summer, but did last summer. I have been working all summer in a tech position (including 3D printing, PCs, etc.) with my time, however. Is this going to negatively impact my potential for employment, or would my internship last summer and current job (which I'm continuing throughout the year) kind of make up for no internship this summer? I was considering applying for Fall 2016 internships, but I don't know if my school schedule will allot me the time necessary for such a position.
4. Any other tips/thoughts for applying to positions, or suggested things to add to my resume? I recently purchased a 3D printer for personal use which I plan to design and print my designs on, so I plan to add this to my resume as well.

Thanks!

I'm a senior in Computer Engineering at big state school in the midwest. My gpa is kinda low, 2.97, so close to 3.0 if that even matters. Reason being is I'm not in the major I should have declared from the get go, but it's nearly impossible to transfer into CS at my school. I've interned two summers in a row at a fortune 500 as a software developer. I'm also working on a side project with a friend that recommends elective classes to students.

I just finished my second internship at the fortune 500, but I just don't feel happy with it.

4xqtvx,2,2016-08-14,Need to escape my covert &amp; overt narcissistic parents. How can I successfully leave my parents’ home?,AdultNarcVic,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4xqtvx/need_to_escape_my_covert_overt_narcissistic/,"I will try to be as succinct &amp; clear as possible. I’m very upset right now.

ME: Depressed adult/early 40s/female/divorced many years ago (short marriage in 20s)/no children/no criminal record/no drugs/no alcohol/never finished college (completed 3 years)/introvert/had about 18 months of mental therapy around 2007-2009 which helped with flashbacks with sexual abuse around 5/6 babysitter’s sister who was 12-14 at the time. My mother never wanted to ever discuss the sexual abuse because she felt I blamed her and “there was nothing she could do now”. 



I was born in an abusive household in Ohio. Biological father owned a newspaper and writer. He routinely beat my mother and verbally abused her. He was often drunk. I remember these events. I remember when he beat my mother when she was pregnant with my sibling and put her out the house during the winter. I also remember my mother crying, upset and police coming to our house. Many years later in my late 20s I learned my biological father was mentally ill and had witnessed his mother being shot and killed by his father as a small boy. I know nothing else. 


My mother visits another state with my brother (2) and me (5/6) during the summer for a few weeks then we return to Ohio. My mother’s sisters resided in that southern state we visited. We moved during the school year to this southern state. My mother tells me at 6 or 7 that she is leaving my father. She divorced him. She is dating a man in a much older former military officer who eventually becomes my stepfather. They marry a little over a year after we left Ohio. I never got counseling. I suffered nightmares, flashbacks, conflicting feelings about leaving my abusive father, waiting for him to visit, confused about this new man in my mother’s life and the overwhelming feeling of never feeling safe. Always feelings incomplete and that harm would come my way.


Both parents (stepfather and biological mother) work as a team. If you have read Pete Walker’s books about CPTSD and narcissistic abuse then you know all the examples. If you have listened to any YouTube videos by Spartan Life Coach about parental narcissistic abuse then you know my pain-gas lighting, ambient abuse, never allowed to really express my feelings, no validation, weak mother with an inferiority complex who loved to project her failures on to me, stepfather pillar of the community highly educated and fabulous career etc... 


When I was not perfect in school, violin or sports I was not worthy. Once as a teenager I stopped wanting to be perfect then I rebelled by spending his money and not really focusing in life. Got married in early 20s lasted about 2 years. Not mature enough to get married. Parents were never there for me when I got divorced, the 2 times I was ever in the hospital etc.… In a nutshell my parents were never there for me emotionally and during certain periods of my life they helped support me financially. I was viewed as the anti-social person because I refrained from playing the pretentious façade of FAKE Episcopalian MORALITY with some of my mother’s relatives who are narcs themselves. At the time I couldn’t define it. As most victims of narcs we are brainwashed to feel we are the evil ones. Many times I found myself defending myself and NEVER HAVING MY PARENTS COME TO MY DEFENSE when these relatives were cruel, hateful and downright liars. There was always excuse or what did I do. 


Fast forward to the last 6-7 weeks. I have been unemployed for a little over a year. I lived off savings and was underemployed in crap jobs. When my savings nearly gone 6-7 weeks ago I moved from the big city located about 200 miles from where my parents live. It has been HELL living under their roof. I’m verbally abused in all the classic forms of narc abuse. I have used the Gray Rock method a few times. Not much success. I am given no privacy. They have done some really crass things to break me. 


For the most part I get interrogated as to why I am a failure and have no job and reminded of all the material things bestowed upon from day one of my mother’s marriage to my stepfather. Now I have always called him my father because I THOUGHT I WAS LEGALLY ADOPTED BY HIM AT THE AGE OF 11/12. Well another LIE by my parents. My sibling and I only GOT OUR NAMES LEGALLY CHANGED. 


So many lies. Oh I forgot to mention my sibling is clinically bipolar. YES, the baby who experienced the trauma of my mother getting beaten by his biological father in Ohio. I do feel the bipolar disorder in addition to my brother sometimes child-like naiveté is from the trauma in the womb. Although my brother has had successful periods of employment (off and on) throughout his life he had a nervous breakdown a few years ago. He is currently living with my parents. He is a man child now is LIKE A ZOMBIE ROBOT. It is depressing to see his regression and the brainwashing my parents continue to do. He lives to serve my parents and jumps to their every word. He will even change his opinion about a topic to appease them. It is scary. 


And I am the convenient scapegoat black sheep child when I tell my brother THAT HE SHOULD DISCUSS WHATEVER HE CHOOSES IN HIS THERAPY. I overheard my mother telling my brother not to discuss certain things in therapy. YES, very sad and evil. My brother goes to weekly therapy with mental health therapist interns for 30 minutes who probably have no idea what CPTSD is... My brother takes close to 15 meds some for his bipolar to his high blood pressure to his gird. My parents take loads of meds for their physical ailments. Luckily, for him he recently started a group therapy session with 4-6 people and a CTPSD volunteer therapist for 2 hours once a week. They won't permit siblings to participate in the same group. So I cannot join.

Ironically, I do not take any meds. I am a health freak. I am physically very healthy. I am just a fit as I was at 21. Thank God for small blessing. Mentally I am emotional wreck.

I have no car. 
I have not secured employment in the very small town my parents live in.
I have about 40 bucks to my name.
My mother pays for my two large storage units in the city I formerly lived.
The tiny bit of money I make doing surveys online pay for my 50 dollar cell phone bill. 


They do not even have UBER in this small town so I must depend on my nagging mother talk about how much she has sacrificed for me. Mind you my mother has not work a full-time job in over 40 years. She only work the gap year between her 2 marriages. But she is a liar and a revisionist. 
I do not have friends that can allow me to stay with them (in the large city). 


One cousin I stayed with for a few months of my unemployment is a narc like my parents.
I do have one confidente (my older cousin in another state who came from a similar family dynamics but he escaped in college and has lived a happy life. He was estranged from his narc parents up until 2 years ago (over 25 years) because his mother now has dementia and is preparing to enter an assisted living facility. So although he knows my parents and their narc methods I confide in him with a lot but not as frequently as I would like because he is dealing with his mother. I only talk to him once a week and only email him a few times a week. I don’t want to be a burden on him. 

The other day I secretly taped the verbal abuse of my father and mother. I sent this to my cousin and an old family friend. I have felt like my father will physically harm me. I do not curse or shout at him. I remain calm and attempt to answer his rapid-fire questions at dinner only to have him curse, interrupt, threaten and humiliate. My brainwashed zombie-robot younger sibling observes this thinking the heat is off him (when he has one of his frequent bipolar episodes) and that he is the golden child. I could write a book about all the lies and deceptions by my parents, an aunt and her stupid daughter told my brother about me. I realize I cannot begin to help my brother in any way until I help myself.

My parents want me to continue to fail so badly. My father has threatened to kick me out. I’m literally in a prison in a country club community. I don’t know how I can make my way. I’m not street smart. 
I realize that I will probably hurt myself if I continue to live in such a toxic situation.

I mean, it's the largest law firm in the city. And with that territory, comes a flurry of interns, both law students and undergrads. Some are preppy frat boys whose daddies are old buddies with the senior partners. Some are college girls with tight, sexy bodies, but you can’t seem to get past their shrill laughter.

So lots slip in between the cracks. And for awhile, I did, too.
But one day, a fellow senior partner made a crack to you. He mentioned how stressed he was, and made a crude reference to a few things he wanted a certain intern to do. Apparently she arranged a few things for a trial, and she was surprisingly competent, a rarity, even in this prestigious office.

And umf. Her body. But it was something else that drove his mind over the edge and into the gutter.

""She's the one with the lipstick,"" he mentions.

Its late one night, and it feels like all the senior partners are heading into trials or big negotiations. All of the interns are required to work — whether it be fetching coffee or redacting credit card numbers in trial notebooks.

You saunter into the break room to grab a fresh cup of coffee. You open the door softly, and I’m the only person in the room. Your eyes land directly on my ass. Curvy, and accented by a pencil skirt. My waist is narrow, and I can’t seem to reach the plate from the top shelf, even in my heels. My long dark hair is curled bouncing as I stretch. With an exhale of frustration I turn around, and you see a young intern, probably 21, with bright green eyes that widen as I notice you. I'm short, only five three, with high cheekbones and striking dark hair.

If it is not, I need a similar laptop. Things I do my computer:
1. Android Studio
2. Inkscape
3. 4-5 Ides like Eclipse, Visual Studio, Webstorm, etc
4. Unity Game Engine
5. Lots of web dev on chrome
6. Spotify/Netflix
7. Streaming hd vids
8. Taking good notes in class/recordings

I don't think I NEED touchscreen, but it has been useful. Battery life and portability are important, since I travel a lot. However, I used a Macbook pro for my internship, which was amazing, even though it was less portable than my windows machine.

Thanks in advance, and comment if you have further questions.

At the moment, I've gotten my CCNA and am planning on my next steps. The obvious path being getting the CCNP, &amp; later on VMware. However,  Im pretty interested in studying for the cloud computing certs (specifically AWS); watched a few videos on the services/mechanics of it, and it seems super interesting. 


Ideally after graduation, I'd like to move down south to the Bay Area (got family in SF and the weather there is perfect for me :p ) but am not sure how much pull i'll have with a degree &amp; some certs since Im Canadian. Im kind of hoping that someone with said certs &amp; some experience might be able to get a working visa, but im not sure how in demand the job market is in the states for networking or AWS knowledge. Getting the TN visa seems pretty straight forward; getting a company willing to go through that extra paper work to hire a Canuck over an American seems like the hard part. Just curious as to what others thought on the feasibility of me moving down south was.


Im currently interning at Blackberry (RIM), but also have the option to do an internship at Cisco in the future as well. Been learning a lot on the job at RIM, but Cisco seems like itll have more recognition to employers --- although i've heard from past interns that much of the work is Layer1 work (racking servers, cabling etc), so I kinda wanted some thoughts on whether having experience at a name such as cisco was worth it despite not learning as much.

I'm 6'0 and 138kgs at 23years old. 

I got on this sub 1.5years ago and something clicked. I was doing a 6month internship and I didn't have too much work to do. So I worked out twice a day, and I ate right. Didn't drink and ate within calories when I went out with friends. 

I lost 20kgs and I felt great. I looked better and I felt better. It took me 8months to lose that weight. 

However, since the past year I have been working at a consulting firm. Long hours, travel to a new place for 5days a week and staying in hotels with rich food all through. The stress itself put me over the edge. 

In 5months I gained back everything I lost and put on 8more kgs. 

I feel terrible now. I try to calorie count, and I stick to it during the day. I keep within 1500cal but the moment I have some time to myself, I overeat even if I'm not hungry. I eat till I'm sick. I eat till I hate myself. 

I go to the gym and I sit there, unmotivated to move. I curse myself and rail internally, but can't get myself to actually exercise. 

I can't even blame the work anymore because I learnt to deal with the stress. I don't feel stressed anymore. Outwardly, I'm an extremely happy and extroverted person who is very at ease with his body. I make jokes about myself all the time and fat jokes don't affect me. 

But my image issues are worsening. I don't meet friends anymore because I hate the way I look. I don't Skype with my girlfriend because I don't want her to see me. I constantly think about how easy it would be to just end it and not struggle to lose weight and fail again and again. 

I feel like just letting it go, loseit. I don't know what to do. 

Tldr : Unable to keep eh discipline to lose weight. Feeling terrible. "

This balance came up since my pay off quote had expired by the time I sent my cheque.

My question is whether it would be better to pay-off the amount and close the account? or keep it open until the next payment is required by my bank (Dec '16) since this might help my credit score.

I have no other debt, and have only one cc which is paid off on time.

Thanks to everyone that replied! Looks like that there no reason to have it open and it doesn't affect my credit score. So I'm going to send int he check today and have the loan paid off."

4xss4h,1,2016-08-15,How do I make friends in college?,Heraclitus94,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/4xss4h/how_do_i_make_friends_in_college/,"I am a 4th year student in college and I have no friends or connections at all at my university.

To give you a little background I've had a rough time in college to say the least. I'm a Computer Science major with a math minor. I started off living with another person in a dorm my freshmen year and we didn't get along that well. He smoked a lot of weed and drank and stuff and I didn't which caused some conflict between us. I didn't have any other friends my 1st year and was shy and stayed in my dorm most of the time, only leaving to get food.

My second year I moved into a dorm that was a single room and I've been in that room for up until now using a squatters right type of thing with my dorm contract. My second year is where shit really hit the fan, my grades sharply declined and I became depressed and it culminated in a suicide attempt and me ending up being checked into the ER. I still regret my decision to this day and wish I never did it because I know how much pain it still causes my family. I had to late withdraw from my spring classes because of my mental state

The third year didn't get much better. My fall semester I failed all my classes and got thrown on academic probation. I felt depressed as fuck again. I was able to pick myself up again Spring semester, but not by much. I barely passed all my classes and got off probation. Every assignment was a mountain to accomplish and every meeting with a TA or a Professor would always result in me crying and usually running off because I would be sobbing in front of other students and shit and it was awful. I'm still working on my issues with pills and therapy and I've been happier hanging out with old friends over the summer, but I dread going back to college because I don't know what to do.

I'm not in any clubs at my university. I've tried and looked for clubs, but nothing seemed to grasp my interest and whenever I thought about going somewhere I would chicken out and stay in my dorm room alone. I don't talk to anyone in any of my classes, they all have their groups of friends and are working together and talking and it's hard to introduce myself (especially if they've seen me crying at a TAs office hours).

I have horrible anxiety about my future too. Thanks to my mental breakdown and struggles I've wasted basically a year at college and driven myself into a hole of debt. I'm not going to graduate in 4 years which is humiliating since most of my friends managed to get the same degree I'm getting in 3 or 4 years and have high paying jobs. My GPA is completely shot which basically means I'll never get an internship anywhere and will hurt my future job prospects. Worst of all I'm really bad at programming. I get lost on core concepts and terms and just feel lost in class half the time. The textbooks they give us are dry as hell and it's hard to understand what the hell anything means.

I just really don't know what to do as a 4th year student. I'm not a freshman anymore which makes it awkward to introduce myself to anyone and I don't party really. I don't like to get drunk because they three times I've gotten drunk I've gotten into fights with people or made extremely inappropriate advances to women and it's embarrassing."

[I had this post some time back](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3vr2rh/a_new_job_offer_with_probation/) regarding my doubts with a new job offer and its weird probation (8 months) and 14% Bonus in total CTC / Pay.

Its been that time which I got my confirmation as permanent employee and it has been one heck of a ride.

However some points of note: 

* Whenever you are in a position when you are on probation or the likes, you will likely be treated as intern
* By intern, I mean, any night shifts or over-times or any L1 tasks would have to be done by basically you (which at once seems fine, just to learn the workings of workplace but for a continued stretch of 8 months becomes a bit tiring)
* That 14% of Salary bonus clause is only available on Financial year ends, so if I leave before Mar 31, there goes my 14% per month salary of each month over the time, in my case it would be 8 months. Get such stuff well sorted before moving to new job.
* Trust your gut feeling, if you feel something aint right, more often than not, its correct."

Продолжение,Pora_Sezhat,pora_valit,https://www.reddit.com/r/pora_valit/comments/4xtabe/образование_в_сша_vs_образование_в_снг_сравнение/,"Кстати, о семинарах. Опять же, сравнивая, как проходили семинары у меня в университете, в Украине, и как семинары проходили в американском университете. В украинском университете, я помню, надо было просто подготовить определённую тему, выйти, прочитать или рассказать, ставили оценку. В Америке это не так. Там, обычно, на семинарах преподаватель проводит интерактивную дискуссию. То есть, он спрашивает разных людей мнения по разным вопросам, или анализ каких-то определённых вещей, материала из учебника и т.д. Там нет такого, что вы просто встаёте, рассказываете тему и садитесь. Обычно, это проходит как дискуссия, более или менее интерактивно. Также не могу сказать про домашние задания, потому что меня часто спрашивают, сложно ли учиться в американском университете? Или многие говорят: «Вот я слышал, американцы, они же вроде как тупые, наверное, у них в университетах легко учиться, можно и с плохими оценками. Если у меня плохие оценки, в моём университете в СНГ, поступить туда легко». На самом деле, в американском университете учиться намного тяжелее, чем в университетах СНГ. И связано это не только с языком, который многие могут не так хорошо знать, как родной. Но и со спецификой учёбы. Во-первых, пары очень объёмные, намного объёмнее, чем наши. То есть у нас учились все, и вы, наверное, учитесь тоже, по три пары в день, 5 или 6 дней в неделю. В американском университете у меня, например, было три пары в неделю, но я училась намного больше, я проводила времени за подготовкой домашнего задания и всеми этими делами намного больше, чем когда я училась в Украине. 

Вначале мне казалось, что три предмета – это просто нечего делать. На самом деле, всё оказалось намного сложнее, потому что на каждый предмет мне задавали читать по 100 страниц каждую неделю. На некоторые предметы надо было писать письменные работы, по несколько письменных работ в семестр. И письменная работа в Америке – это тоже не письменная работа как у нас. То есть тут нужно реально написать самому работу, потому что преподаватели проверяют. У них есть специальные программы, и они проверяют по всему Интернету, по базам библиотек. Если вы что-то списали и не указали на источник, или даже если вы перефразировали и не указали на источник, они это тоже увидят. И это считается плагиатом. И за это вообще, на самом деле, могут исключить из университета. 

Может, если вы учитесь на бакалавра первый год, возможно, вас простят, вам просто сделают замечание, не примут эту работу, скажут переписать и т.д. Но если это уже более или менее старшие курсы, или магистратура, или PHD, не дай Бог, и вы у кого-то списали и не указали источник, или даже перефразировали и не указали источник, то последствия реально могут быть серьёзными. Исключают из американских университетов за плагиат, и это не шутка, на самом деле. Работы когда пишутся, они реально пишутся. Надо сесть, прочитать книги, написать, указать обязательно источники, если что-то берётся, какая-то информация из какой-то книги. То есть, это намного сложнее, это не как у нас – сел, скачал реферат в Интернете, или с книжки списал, или перефразировал – это тогда ты уже вообще гений, это уже, считай, как бы твоя работа. Нет, в Америке это абсолютно не так, там к этому очень серьёзно относятся. 

И ещё один момент, который, я думаю, важно сказать – это то, что вообще в американской системе образования очень важны оценки. То есть, в странах СНГ, в принципе, оценки не важны, это просто как престижность – у меня красный диплом. Это роли, в принципе, не играет при устройстве на работу или вообще при жизни. При поступлении в университет золотая медаль тоже большой роли не сыграет, если вы плохо сдадите экзамены, например, вступительные. В Америке GPA – средний балл, очень важен. Если у вас плохие оценки – это плохо. Как бы хорошо вы не знали предметы, какие бы у вас на резюме не были internships, стажировки, работы и т.д., плохой GPA – это уже такой восклицательный знак. И для того, если вы будете поступать в магистратуру, например, или если у вас в школе плохие оценки, вы поступаете в хороший университет на бакалавра – это плохо. Это не значит, что вам абсолютно ничего не светит, но это плохо. То есть, нужно обращать внимание всегда на оценки, и, опять же, иностранным студентам тяжелее, потому что на одни «5» учиться при всём желании тяжело, потому что те же работы писать – это намного тяжелее. 

В общем, как вывод, сравнивая американскую систему образования в высших учебных заведениях и систему образования СНГ, я считаю, что в Америке намного лучше образование дают в университетах.

I did the math and if I were to pay down the loan right now I'd really only save less than $150 in interest if I were to pay it down now as opposed to in May but I can't decide if it'd be worth it.

4xtn6a,5,2016-08-15,Part Time or Full Time MBA: The Internal Struggle,ImaBaby16,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4xtn6a/part_time_or_full_time_mba_the_internal_struggle/,"Hello!

So I know that this has probably been posted a lot on this subreddit, but I just really need an outside perspective on my situation. I will try to keep this as short as I can.

I currently am working for a company that I have worked for since I was out of college (6 years, 7 including internship). I started out as an intern in IT, hired after graduation as a system administrator, promoted to business analyst, then senior business analyst/PM, and was just recently promoted to a lead BA position on our global SAP implementation. 

During this time, I have become recognized as a top contributor to our department and the CIO has taken an interest in my future. In discussions with him and where I want you get to in life (pretty much his position or executive IT level position), an MBA is really the best choice.  Now he is a big proponent of a full time MBA and thinks it is the best choice for getting myself out there, networking, and just an overall better education (we talked about me leaving and even though it would hurt him from a staffing perspective, he wants the best for my career).

This was my plan and I have been studying for the GMAT ever since. Because of this, other people started to notice that I have been studying (study at lunch) and have given their opinions. The 2 biggest are my current boss (senior director, pretty much go to guy of the CIO) and another director I have known from the first day I worked here and have a great relationship with.

Both of them feel that part time is the way to go.  As for their reasoning they both said the same quote almost word for word ""when I'm looking at applicants for a job, degrees are a plus, but work experience tell me more about your ability as an employee."" 

Another added thing to consider is my company will pay for 100% of the expenses to get my MBA. 

So this ended up getting wordier than I like so I'll stop here. The question I have is based off of this information and where I would like to end up, is part time or full time the best option? Even though I do enjoy my job and atmosphere I do not see myself staying here my whole life.  I feel I'm already at the top of where I could advance without additional schooling or experience and would also like to live somewhere else.

Anyway, that's my situation. If there are any other details that would be needed please let me know and I can provide them.


EDIT: Thanks everyone for all the responses! It is really giving me good insight. One question I wanted to add (which might be a dumb one) is if I would go part time, would that hurt my relationship with the CIO? From all the discussions I've had with him he has always been nice and we have talked about not just professional but personal stuff as well (go to lunch monthly just to catch up). He has been a bit of a mentor to me and I wouldn't want to lose that relationship."
4xtw2d,0,2016-08-15,My girlfriend cheated on me with her ex,what_a_wonderful_day,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4xtw2d/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_with_her_ex/,"This is going to be a long one.

My name is, for the purposes of this story, Ian. My relationship with Elizabeth didn’t start in the most honorable of ways. I was still with my ex-girlfriend who treated me like shit, and she was new, and different, and I really liked her. We hung out a lot, we (finally) made out, and I decided I needed to break up with my ex-girlfriend. I did that, and it was a stressful few weeks while my ex’s friends threatened me, but I knew I made the right decision. I know I was a shitty person for cheating on my girlfriend, but that’s not what this story is about.

For a while, we hung out, and I wanted a relationship. She was more hesitant. We started talking in April or so, and we knew she was studying abroad from September to December. She wasn’t sure if she was ready for it.

She warned me about her and her past. She’s had a frightening relationship history. For reference, she’s a rising junior in college, and I’m a rising senior. She went to a sleepaway camp for many years as a pre-teen and teen. She associates many memories with that camp, and that’s where she met her first boyfriend, Carl. They started dating when she was 15. They had all of their firsts together, and they dated for about nine months or so. In that time period, she met Joe.

Joe and her were good friends for a long time. However, after a while, they got a little too close, and Elizabeth cheated on Carl with Joe. Elizabeth and Carl broke up for a while, but then got back together after a bit. That lasted only a few more months, and they broke up again. At this point, Elizabeth got together with Joe.

They lasted for a while, as far as I can tell. But then, the inevitable happened — she cheated on Joe with Carl. They broke up, and she got together with Carl again (this is the third time, for those of you keeping track at home). This didn’t last for a long time at all, and they eventually broke up.

At this point she started talking to Ike, _in addition to_ Carl and Joe. Ike is actually largely irrelevant to this story, other than one specific occurence. Elizabeth was the star to the musical at her high school. There were three showings of the show… and one of them came to each of the showings, without knowing about the other.

Once again, she got together with Carl. At this time, it was the middle of her senior year of high school, about two and a half years ago. She got word that Carl cheated on her and she went absolutely insane. She got drunk, drove to his house, egged his house (inside and out), and when he came home, slapped him and accidentally hit his car with her car. The police were called, she was arrested, and charged with assault, assault with a deadly weapon (the car), vandalism, criminal mischef, and trespassing. Eventually the assault charges were dropped, but she still had to pay a heavy fine.

Then she was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. This makes a lot of sense to me, honestly. All of her mood swings before hand, the rage she had when she heard Carl had cheated on her, everything. It is for this reason that I discount her actions before she started getting treatment. Obviously, this story raised a lot of red flags for me. But the fact she was at that point was undiagnosed bipolar makes it seem like a lot of those things weren’t really under her control.

Also after that, she has a remarkably normal dating life. I believe she hooked up with Joe that summer before her freshman year of college, and may have seen Ike, but by October of her freshman year, she was dating Nathan. They had a normal relationship (as far as I know) with no cheating (again, as far as I know) until he broke up with her in May of her freshman year.

The next year, she did the college thing of sleeping around and going on dates, but nothing went anywhere. Then, April of that year, she met me.

I knew about this when I wanted a relationship with her. I accepted that was her past, and I was confident that wouldn’t be her future. After some reluctance, after she visited me where I was doing my summer internship in early June, we were official.

June was a great month. We were in love with each other, and we wanted to see each other a lot. We had great sex, went on great dates, the whole nine yards.

Then, in July, something changed. She became withdrawn, and touchy, like she was afraid of intimacy. She wasn’t who she was the previous month.

At the time, I assumed it was a depressive swing of her bipolar disorder. But then, in the middle of July, she called me and told me about her main source of anxiety — Carl. She said she really regrets how things ended with Carl. She thinks about it every day, and it’s like a shadow over her life. I guess he tried to make amends — he came by her house in January on her birthday, but she turned him away. I guess he still thinks about her too.

I said that I understand why you’re feeling like this, and yes, you probably should talk to him. But after that, you need to be done. You can see him once, but never again. She agrees.

The following weekend, I visit her at a house that she and her family rents on the shore and she has friends stay over at, and from start to finish, she is cold and unloving. She doesn’t seem  to want me to be there, and is just not the same person as in June. I was there for 4 days, and it was weird and tense the whole time.

The next weekend, I visit her again. Once again, she’s cold and unfeeling. At this point, I know she’s holding something from me, and all I can think about is what she told me about Carl. She went to take a shower, and I did a shitty thing — I looked at her phone. This is what I found out:

- She thinks about him daily
- She went over his house last week
- At a party on Friday her friend kissed her (which was how she phrased it, not ""we kissed"" or ""I kissed""). She didn't want to tell me because she thought I would want the play by play (which is true). She said she felt more guilty about this than about Carl (which leads me to believe that something happened with them, but I'm not positive about this).
- At the party when she was drunk she was upset about me not wanting to go, and wanted to drunk text Carl ""I want sex"", but her friend told her no
- She felt restrained (by me presumably) at the party
- She wants to see him tomorrow

This should’ve been enough strikes for me to say something. However, a Chris Hardwick quote comes to mind:

&gt; I’m relationship colorblind: all I ever see are green flags.

Instead, I took the approach of letting her open up to me. I told her I was nervous about Carl and about her, and gave her every opportunity to say something. She never did.

At this point, things started to get better. She was less cold, at least over text. I then visited her (for the first time since her trip) last Thursday.

This is when everything went to shit.

I looked at her computer.

I had to do some digging, but I found the texts between her and her closest friend. This is what I found this time:

- She has slept with Carl twice, once the day after I left her house at the beach and once the day after I visited her again.
- She knew that this was going to happen when she visited him, even though she saw him with the intention of closure.
- She’s messaged him a lot.
- She’s wanted to be single for abroad, not to hook up with other people, but to “find herself”. I was originally planning on visiting her abroad, but she said that I shouldn’t a while ago.

At this point, we had another three days planned together. A bit of an aside about me. I’m a very analytical person — I need to have as much information as possible to make decisions in my life. I’m also way too nice and forgiving — I consider that my major character flaws. Not a bad thing, but terrible in situations like this.

I kept it to myself for the time being. It was tricky situation — Thursday and Friday we were together at her house, and then Friday night through Sunday mid-day she was at my family’s house at the shore, and I was driving her down there. There was really no way to bring up this conversation during this weekend — neither I nor her had an escape route if we broke up, so I wanted to keep it to myself. However if I left it, I wouldn’t be able to see her for a week, and it would kill me over the course of that week.

Well it turns out, she forced my hand. Saturday night, we were watching a movie, and she noticed that I was staring into space instead of watching the movie for about twenty minutes. After a lot of pressure, I told her what I found.

She didn’t deny it. She says she slept with him twice, and does not intend on seeing him again. She says she’s gone through the whole range of emotions (from guilt to sadness), and the texts with her friend does back up her claim.

&gt; I just feel like a terrible person
&gt;
&gt; And of course when I'm home it almost feels like a dream. Like I never saw Carl. I told my friends last night and they said in the end it's your choice and we love you and don't judge you but you should break up with Ian. And there is a pet of me that feels like I should but I also love him
&gt; 
&gt; I feel like I let myself down, Ian down, my parents. It's this big secret, this shitty thing I did. It's so rude and so selfish and I promised I would never do it again, not to Ian

And then:

&gt; Elizabeth: I am a terrible person and I'm just gonna go die now I don't deserve literally anything. I'm Satan
&gt; 
&gt; Friend: Lol then I'm satan too!!
&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth: I actually feel like the worst person in the world. Because I told myself not with Ian. I didn't fucking know Carl would try to talk to me. I didn't know that would happen. I wouldn't be in this fucking mess right now if it weren't for his message. God dammit. I've lived with cheating guilt before I can do it again but he's just so innocent like I feel bad even being with him
&gt; 
&gt; I legit don't deserve to live I am terrible and I don't know what pro
&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth: To do 
&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth: Something switched a few weeks ago and I've been really abnormally depressed and this is just making everything spin. I feel like I'm out of control, like I'm not with reality right now because if I was I wouldn't have done that
&gt; 
&gt; Friend: Omg stop
&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth: I literally don't deserve him or anyone else. I deserve nothing
&gt; 
&gt; Friend: You're not a bad person. It happens. I did it too. Stop saying you don't deserve anything. You do.
&gt; 
&gt; Friend: This doesn't make you a bad person
&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth: I just hate that Ian keeps saying like ""I'm never saying you would do that"" ""I'm not accusing you of anything"" ""you're not a bad person"" and I'm over here like just shut the fuck up
&gt; 
&gt; Friend: Just switch topic. Don't talk about that anymore
&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth: Yeah I'll do that now
&gt; 
&gt; Friend: Yeah you do not need to hear this rn
&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth: Like parents after you lie and say you didn't go to a party and drink in high school and they give you a speech on how good you are that you aren't like the others and aren't a bad teenager and deep down you're like well fuck, thanks for putting it that way mom
&gt; 
&gt; Friend: Elizabeth I am in the same boat. I did the same thing. You did it twice. I've done it 5 times this summer. And more before this summer. I know exactly how you feel

She does seem to genuinely regret it. We had a long conversation, it ended up with us (tentatively) being together. I told her she needs to rebuild my trust, like I did with her at the beginning of the relationship.

She goes abroad in about two weeks. I’m not going to be able to see her this week, so one more week after that. I need to decide what to do with her. I love her so much, despite what’s happened. I know the right thing to do would be to break up with her, but I find that that’s so hard. When we’re together it’s great, and we have such a great connection. But, she made this huge betrayal, and I’m not sure if I can trust her again, especially with her going abroad.

This is where I am right now. I need to decide what I want to do. Certainly staying together while she’s abroad is out of the question. It comes down to whether or not we take a break and try again in the spring, or break up for good. Honestly, taking a break is probably the best solution at this point. I’ve never been single in college, and that’s something I should experience. But I also care for her, and believe that she can be a good person. I will be able to take this semester to focus on myself (get fit, get therapy, do well in school).

It’s a whole shitty situation. But there were so many flags I missed along the way. I just can’t wait for it all to be behind me.

tl;dr: Got together with a girl with a cheating history, she missed her ex, cheated on me twice."
4xtxrt,7,2016-08-15,My [21M] girlfriend [20F] of two months cheated on me with her ex,what_a_wonderful_day,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xtxrt/my_21m_girlfriend_20f_of_two_months_cheated_on_me/,"This is going to be a long one.

My name is, for the purposes of this story, Ian. My relationship with Elizabeth didn’t start in the most honorable of ways. I was still with my ex-girlfriend who treated me like shit, and she was new, and different, and I really liked her. We hung out a lot, we (finally) made out, and I decided I needed to break up with my ex-girlfriend. I did that, and it was a stressful few weeks while my ex’s friends threatened me, but I knew I made the right decision. I know I was a shitty person for cheating on my girlfriend, but that’s not what this story is about.

For a while, we hung out, and I wanted a relationship. She was more hesitant. We started talking in April or so, and we knew she was studying abroad from September to December. She wasn’t sure if she was ready for it.

She warned me about her and her past. She’s had a frightening relationship history. For reference, she’s a rising junior in college, and I’m a rising senior. She went to a sleepaway camp for many years as a pre-teen and teen. She associates many memories with that camp, and that’s where she met her first boyfriend, Carl. They started dating when she was 15. They had all of their firsts together, and they dated for about nine months or so. In that time period, she met Joe.

Joe and her were good friends for a long time. However, after a while, they got a little too close, and Elizabeth cheated on Carl with Joe. Elizabeth and Carl broke up for a while, but then got back together after a bit. That lasted only a few more months, and they broke up again. At this point, Elizabeth got together with Joe.

They lasted for a while, as far as I can tell. But then, the inevitable happened — she cheated on Joe with Carl. They broke up, and she got together with Carl again (this is the third time, for those of you keeping track at home). This didn’t last for a long time at all, and they eventually broke up.

At this point she started talking to Ike, _in addition to_ Carl and Joe. Ike is actually largely irrelevant to this story, other than one specific occurence. Elizabeth was the star to the musical at her high school. There were three showings of the show… and one of them came to each of the showings, without knowing about the other.

4xu4ft,6,2016-08-15,Should I Continue Interviewing?,Nyleo_H,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4xu4ft/should_i_continue_interviewing/,"Hello. I just finished my summer internship at a big company (company A) and was offered a full-time position with them. The offer was for 72k/year. I will be graduating this December with a Bachelor's in Comp Sci. However, I had interned at another big company (company B) last year and had a much more pleasant experience. Before I knew I was getting an offer, I had reached out to company B to see if they would still be interested in me. They were and I will be interviewing with them this week. I'm confident I can pass the interview, but I know their starting salary is low (approx. 60k). Should I ask for 75k? Ultimately, I would not accept company B's offer if it was anything less than that. Is it even worth it to interview if there is a possibility that my offer will get shot down? I was going to use company A's offer as leverage. 

**Edit:** I also wanted to add that company A's starting date is late May, which will leave me unemployed for ~4.5 months. Company B's start date is January so I can start right away. If they refuse my offer of 75k, whose offer should I take?"
4xu4sq,11,2016-08-15,First Signs of Traffic....,petemyers23,juststart,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/4xu4sq/first_signs_of_traffic/,"What a ride guys. I have no clue where this is going, but this is fun, I’m pushing the envelope and getting [results](http://imgur.com/a/2Otpm).

I’ve built what amounts to a ‘Daily Prophet’ style news site and am actively challenging the media kingpins in a mid-sized market. There’s a catch though—it’s not a newspaper—it’s an Affiliated Marketing site.

This almost happened by accident, as I experimented with different ideas. The vast majority of my site is filled with newsy articles reporting on events in my niche. Of course, my spin on the news is always outrageous, the headline very clickable. I write about the city from a poor person’s perspective, hopefully providing an entertaining alternative to the shitty local newspaper.

I used to work at a newspaper in a much bigger city. I have a knack for writing authentic looking copy….this time though, I’ve thrown all journalistic credibility out the window and just started reporting on events of interest like a blogger. No care for pinpoint accuracy, or names, or sources….reporting things I hear without attribution….my best J.K. Rowling impression.

Is that ethical? I don’t give a f***. I’m trying to eat out here. I started this site with $10 in my pocket, sleeping on a friend’s couch, driving a 21 year old car. Making $24,000/yr as a content writer for the man.

I want this bad. Been writing like a crazed person from 8 to 5. I’ve been out every night after work, interacting with the community. Handing out business cards…using the phrase “There’s a new sheriff in town”.

Everybody hates the news media. Everywhere. I’m playing off those emotions….really just living and writing about it.

Going to concerts, restaurants, bars, writing on the local dating scene, making fun of local media coverage, saying things they won’t say. Joined a few intramural sports leagues, then began reporting on our games like a beat writer for our sports page.

I’ve sold a few ads in the form of reviews to local businesses. Attracted an investor I’ve titled “Publisher” who dropped $1,100 to cover some of my costs.

My friends and family see how much effort I’m giving this….so I’ve involved them in the process. Handed out titles you’d commonly see in a newsroom. 

Executive Editor, City Editor, News Editor, Bureau Reporter etc…..

They’re excited and helping me with editing, story suggestions, scoops, photographs….you name it…they’re working for “us”. Taking advice found in this thread, I’ve created various author personalities for bylines, although I’ve done 95% of the writing.

Where am I getting that other 5%? 

From the trolls!

Since the site appears to be an authentic newspaper, about 10-15 people have gone out of their way to rip us, shredding our slant on the news. This doesn’t hurt my feelings. I’ve been roasted over the coals for things I’ve written in major media markets. I have thick skin when it comes to criticism.

One of the more passionate trolls, was so enraged by my coverage of a local scandal, he wrote me a well thought out, 900 word rebuttal and begged me to publish it. 

We’re friends now. 

We’ve drawn the ire of a national marijuana advocate, who disagreed with one of my reviews and engaged with me publically on social media last night. Definitely helped traffic, that and I really scored with a headline.

One of the trolls published a vulnerability he spotted in my code in a comment section, then reversed his stance, apologized and helped me fix it. Yes, I’m an idiot, but you can’t get better without feedback, positive or negative.

Overall though, our feedback is positive, in that we’re getting people to talk. We’ve had several emails/IM’s from supporters who’ve said “Finally someone in town with some cojones!”

Over the weekend I beat every local media outlet with my coverage of two breaking news stories. I believe I’m better than the interns writing digital content for local news sites. 

I blew their coverage out of the water, tossed a click-bait headline on it and bam, I’ve got at least a chunk of their traffic. My readers even began sharing my story “@MEdiaOUtlet WHY AREN’T YOU SAYING MORE ABOUT THIS!?!?!”

It really is amusing.

Kinda a strange journey, where I’m monetizing with face-to-face sales, although I envisioned it being an Amazon Affiliate….which it still will be….when I figure that shit out. Writing is the easy part.

The focus from here is to start writing content that’s geared to monetize via Amazon, while continuing to meet with local business owners pushing them to buy reviews in my “newspaper”.

 Even though my layout is amateurish, I don’t have the first clue about graphic design OR coding….there’s still authenticity there because I can write.

I have a few ideas cooking, that’ll I’ll experiment with until one pops off. Not really worried about anything else except for writing at this point...which I'm going to go do right now.

Thank you everyone for the inspiration and guidance!

4xvcv8,7,2016-08-15,"Just looking for a place to talk about my stomach pain. Maybe someone can relate? 21M, two years of pain.",Rawzee,GERD,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/4xvcv8/just_looking_for_a_place_to_talk_about_my_stomach/,"Hello everybody. I've never been able to talk to anyone about my stomach condition really, so I hope this fits here. This might end up being a huge wall of text, but I think I'll feel better just getting everything out there. 

* Brief introduction - I'm 21, male, health conscious, no known allergies (getting retested soon), and I exercise regularly. For the last two years, I've suffered from horrible daily stomach pains, acid reflux/GERD, gas, and bloating. It never goes away, only fluctuates in intensity, constantly looming over me like a dark cloud of misery. I've tried so many things- prilosec (most effective for me), omeprazole, nexium, tagamet, tums, activated charcoal, pro-biotics, apple cider vinegar, aromatherapy with peppermint oils, no-sugar diets, low-carb diets, quitting coffee entirely (helped tremendously), lactose-free diets, eating smaller meals, chewing like an old man until my food is mush, multiple visits to the gastroenterologist/hospital... no matter what- always pain. Mornings are insufferable, lunches suck, dinner is impossible. Eating any sort of food has unfortunately lost it's appeal. I no longer crave ""good looking"" food like birthday cake or brownies because of the pain I anticipate from eating it. I've forgotten what it feels like to be normal, and it's awfully depressing knowing that my stomach has quite literally become the central focus of every activity I do. Everything revolves around the current state of my stomach, and I feel like it's taking over my life. This situation is an infuriating double-edged sword, since the root of my inability to do most things is my stomach, but I absolutely hate constantly explaining to people that it's my stomach restricting me from doing all these things I want to do. None of my friends can relate, which is understandable, but I often feel weak or flakey for staying out of something that I KNOW will further agitate my stomach. 

* It all started senior year of high school. I was 30 pounds lighter than I am now- and I'm still pretty lanky today. Being a 5'10, 145lb kid wasn't the worst thing ever, but becoming humorously large in the stomach after taking 3 fucking bites of food was. I would literally look 5 months pregnant, even if I ate a tiny amount of food. There were times that I'd eat one large bite, and have to take a deep breath through my nose and sit up in my chair because I could already feel my stomach inflating. My friend's will never stop reminding me of our before-college going away dinner, when I only ordered a small side of fried rice and nothing else because I physically couldn't down any more food, even though I hadn't eaten in hours. It became extremely frustrating having to feel the baby kicking in my stomach every time I go to eat, and thus sparked my loss of desire for food in general. It was too physically straining to get the amount of calories I needed. 

* However, the bloating was NOTHING compared to the pain I felt every morning. I would wake up with the most awful sour taste in my mouth and throat literally every single morning. Never was there a day where I woke up with a smile saying ""wow I feel great!"". Every morning brought pain, I had zero appetite to eat. I would manage to force down the blandest tasting food I could, it was the only thing I could manage without wanting to throw up. There were a few instances where I had to wake up, run to the bathroom, and throw up stomach bile on an otherwise completely empty stomach. I'm very grateful that this wasn't so common for me- I know there are some people that deal with this on a semi-regular basis, and it's really fucking painful and ruins your morning completely. Since then, I've found that prilosec is the most effective medication for preventing morning reflux for me, I just wish I knew sooner. Since then, I've learn to manage some of my symptoms, but only to a degree. There are still many things that I can't seem to change. 

* I can never recline comfortably in a chair or sofa, and have to explain to my friends that sitting forward/hunched over is 'more comfortable', when all I fucking want to do is recline without feeling an awful build up of pressure and pain in my stomach. The most ridiculous part is that any additional pressure on my stomach when I DO try to momentarily recline is comically amplified- feeling my shirt nestle on my stomach hurts it, I have to pitch a tent with my finger and my shirt over my stomach- and even then the pain persists. The abdominal pressure from many exercises aggravates my stomach, sometimes to the point I have to leave the gym with my head hanging low and my stomach in flames. The most frustrating thing is that the easiest of tasks become difficult if they involve any sort of movement. I can't fucking bend over to pick something off the ground, tie my shoes, or do anything that could contort my stomach without being reminded of my stomach pain. I'm currently completing an internship when I have to wear business-casual every day (shirt tucked in/belt/relatively tight clothing/sitting in a chair for many hours). I sit down at my desk, undo my pants' button, loosen my belt a notch, and pray that I don't forgot to button my pants when I'm asked to get up and do something, which is maybe 50% of the time. I've walked down the street many times (on super busy pedestrian-filled NYC streets, mind you) with my pants undone. Then I struggle to re-button my pants while walking down the street without looking like I just whipped it out and took a piss on the sidewalk (well, sometimes this one can be kind of funny... it's at the lower end of my list of stomach related worries). 

* One of the worst things about it is getting intimate. I constantly have to burp and hold in my fucking farts all the time, and boy oh boy does that make girls horny /s. I've become pretty good at disguising my burp as a turn-of-the-head stretch or whatever, but I know that most of the time they can hear it, even if they don't say ew. The worst part is, the quieter I try to release the burp, the more painful the acid burning feeling in my stomach gets- what a blessing. When the deed is done, and all I want to do is lie on my back with a girl under my arm, my stomach/worst enemy gives me the middle finger. Girl wants to lie with her arm over my stomach? I physically move her arm so it's resting on my chest and not my stomach, which is usually less comfortable for her. Lying on my back is excruciating as is, and having to mention that I have ""like this weird stomach pain that never goes away"" makes me feel weak, I just want to avoid talking about it... Needless to say, spooning is the only real comfortable position I can be in, as I get marginal pain relief by laying on my left side, but only if my stomach is completely empty. As such, even sex becomes noticeably less enjoyable due to all these stupid physical restrictions I have to follow. I've learned to cope to an extent. That acrobatic tumble where I romantically pull you close and flip you over so I'm not on my back? Cool right, she digs it, she's impressed, what she doesn't know is that if I didn't do that in T-minus 3 seconds, I would have burped in her face and fired up the dutch oven. 

* Well, that concludes my rant. Moving forward, I'm going to try and stick to a stricter food diet, and try to identify the most significant things that set off my stomach pain. I'm going to get retested for food allergies, and soon gluten intolerance. Any thoughts or tips or anything would be greatly appreciated. I hope someone got something out of reading this, may that be a relatable feeling or a piece of advice. Have a good day everybody."
4xvd58,6,2016-08-15,"First Car Shopping! Budget of Around 5K, Could Use some Help and Input",Goofy117,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/4xvd58/first_car_shopping_budget_of_around_5k_could_use/,"Hey all,

As the title says, I'm currently looking for my first car. I've got a budget of 5K, maybe a little more if the car is right.

A little bit about about myself: I just graduated college and I'm starting an internship in a couple of weeks that is paying me $12/hr. I was fortunate enough to be given a full scholarship and so I have no loans to pay off other than $50/month for some personal loans I took out through the state. No bills or anything either, as I'm living with my sister and she and her family have been gracious enough to let me stay rent-free for as along as I need to. Basically, any money that I make that isn't spent on paying off the car, the car's insurance, and my personal loan will be going straight into my savings for at least the rest of the year.

I actually do not have my license yet. I have my permit and I know how to operate a vehicle, I just need more time behind the wheel to get comfortable. I never had anyone have the time to teach me, even now, and so I'm thinking I could buy a car first and teach myself, go out for some drives around the neighborhood at night to minimize risks. Is this a good idea?

What I'm looking for:

* In terms of looks, something similar to either the Audi TT, Mitsubishi Eclipse, or Mitsubishi Lancer. I don't really mind if it is 2 or 4 door. I prefer automatic but I'm open to learning manual. The car would be mostly for commuting to and from work and occasional nights out.

* With monthly payments, I would prefer not to exceed $150 including insurance but, again, this is flexible if the car is right.

* I'm not a ""car person"" so I'm not sure what year would be a good cut off point. I've been told 10 years is the minimum so anything less that 2006 is a no go? I honestly do not know.

* Mileage as well. Anything above or around 200K is cause for hesitation, apparently, so I'm going with that.

* I don't know jack shit about the mechanical aspects of cars, like engines and gas mileage and all that. Help would be dope here :)

Here are some vehicles I've been looking at

* [2000 Audi TT, $6,500](http://www.carsoup.com/details/used/2000/Audi/TT-Quattro/63814985/?returl=L3ZlaGljbGUvcmVzdWx0cy5hc3B4P3ZlaGljbGV0eXBlaWQ9MSZtYWtlaWQ9NiZtb2RlbGlkPTIxNiZybWFrZWlkPTYmcmFkaXVzPTUwJmRvc29ydD1wcmljZV9kZXNjJm1heHByaWNlPTEwMDAw)

4xvdz0,2,2016-08-15,Months into a campaign and you lose a player,NerdsandStuff,rpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/4xvdz0/months_into_a_campaign_and_you_lose_a_player/,"TLDR: How have you handled losing party members in the past? Did your campaign keep chugging right along or did it falter and fizzle? If you brought in new blood did they help or hurt the campaign?

Hello!
For some context: We've been playing Star Wars EotE for about 3 months now, generally every weekend with schedules permitting. One of my players (I am the GM) is moving out of state for an internship for the next 6 months. While we're very excited for her, we're also losing an important member our of weekly game so even for her it was a bittersweet announcement.

Now I've been GMing for years now, generally on a weekly basis and because I've met most of them through college, after they've graduated most have moved out of town and that's been the biggest reason for me losing players. As groups get older together, life also gets busier which has been the other big reason as well.

Generally, I run campaigns for several months if not better part of a year (or longer) so whenever I find myself down a player our group runs into the same few scenarios every time. Either continue on without them, having a smaller but tighter RP experience. Try to replace them with someone new but this can result in someone coming into the middle of a grand narrative with little change to hit the ground running for some time. Additionally, without potentially knowing their RP style we've had both great and horrendous experiences with new blood at the table, so that can be harrowing mid campaign as well. We are unable to do online as their new schedule conflicts with any of our general available times.

On top of everything, we record and release our sessions/campaign on our YT channel, so for anyone who is a fan of the series, we'd be losing that person and (as we're new at this) we have no idea how that would effect our small but dedicated audience. In the past if we lost one or two members, we might just scrap the campaign (which always breaks my heart) and move onto something else we're all excited about but now that YT is involved we're not really keen on the idea as much.

This isn't the first time that this has happened, just the first time it's happened since I've joined a community like this and I was interested in seeing how other gaming groups take the loss of a dedicated player.

Thanks in advance for your input"
4xveyy,1,2016-08-15,Two offers - job vs internship?,jobvsintern,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/4xveyy/two_offers_job_vs_internship/,"Massive text warning!

Hey everyone, hoping to get some advice about two offers I just received. For background, I am based in Toronto and have no formal education or experience related to graphic design. It has just been something I've always had an interest in and worked on during my free time, and only recently took it seriously as a career prospect.


I've been lucky to receive two offers despite my lack of formal training and experience, but I would love to hear your thoughts and advice on which one to accept.


The first offer is a 4-month contract position as an in-house designer for $3,333 a month (equal to $40k a year), which is way more than I expected for someone with my background for an entry-level job. It was originally going to be for 12 months, but they didn't want to overestimate how long they would need me for and changed it to 4 to be safe. That said, they did mention that if they still needed me after 4 months (they said they probably would, they just can't promise it) they would most likely extend my contract or hire me as a full-time employee. My only concern is that I would be the only designer there - essentially the marketing department (where the marketing manager would be my boss) have no clue about design and have straight up told me I would mostly be using pre-designed templates. 


I'm worried I won't be able to learn or improve my design skills at all, which means I'll have barely anything to add to my portfolio. (This company is also in the private finance sector so besides it having a more corporate culture, I may not even be allowed to include the work I do for them on my portfolio at all for legal reasons.) In addition, I won't have anyone in the office to turn to if I'm stuck or need some professional input.


The second offer is a 3-month internship at a small digital marketing startup that seems really cool, has great company culture as most startups do, and overall a great place to learn. They do have a creative/design team so I would definitely be able to learn a lot and develop my skills. Over half their interns have been hired as full-time employees so there's definitely a good chance for growth and career development if I choose to take this. However, they would be paying me $700/month and while money isn't a huge deal-breaker for me as an entry level candidate, I can't help but think of the massive paycheck difference compared to the other offer.

If anyone could offer their insights or give some helpful advice, I would really appreciate it. (Sorry for the huge chunk of text!!!) 

Thanks everyone!"

Since sales positions seem to get the most negative attention, we want to make sure that the legitimacy of all sales job postings are verified. We've gone ahead and thrown the new rule up on the sidebar about sales positions, but the cut and dry is that sales&amp;marketing positions must be legitimate sales&amp;marketing: no multi-level marketing/pyramid schemes, no door-to-door/solicitation, and commission must be offered **on top of** a verifiable base rate. If a sales posting comes through that looks at all vague or iffy, one of the active moderators will be reaching out to you to ask some questions about the role to determine whether it's eligible for r/trianglejobs. We haven't had a visible problem here with the ""sneaky call center"" posts discussed in the r/jobs post mentioned above, but if that begins to emerge here, we will take steps to verify call center positions as well. However, for all future call center postings, it is mandatory for posters to disclose if a sales quota will be imposed on what otherwise looks like a support role.

Additionally, as per [the current Department of Labor laws surrounding internships](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm), unpaid internships will be screened to make sure they are eligible for r/trianglejobs.

Finally, a couple posts have been reported and removed lately for being ""work at home"" positions with companies that don't have a branch in the Triangle and do not require their employees to be in the Triangle. These posts are better suited for the wider audience at one of the general job boards (and usually DO fall into the sneaky call center category so they'd be removed regardless). 

Please let us know if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions. Thank you in advance!"

I am currently 15 years old (soph in HS) and I think that I want to pursue a career in either finance, CS or some other branch of electrical engineering. I have not taken any of the programming classes that my school offers due to the fact that my course-load is already quite demanding, (3 APs). Last year I took my first PLTW course (DDP) and passed with flying colors. Since my schedule does not allow me to take any engineering courses I was wondering if I should take a CompTIA certification (probably the IT Fundamentals or A+) just to throw it on my resume. My school district is extraordinarily competitive and I feel that it might give me a slight edge when either applying for an internship next year, or applying to college in 2 years. I am a talented kid (humble brag) and have gotten very good test scores in math and science. (Practice ACT 32 and PSAT 1480). I am also fairly tech savvy. (built a few computers, basic python, etc.) What do you guys think? Also if you do recommend I take the course, how long do you think preparation will be, and what exactly will it entail?

4xvpeg,45,2016-08-15,Why I cut off my mother part 2,hyenachild,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/4xvpeg/why_i_cut_off_my_mother_part_2/,"I wasn't sure when I'd finish this, but there's no day like today, right? See my previous posts for more background history. It got lengthy when I wrote the first post and it was emotionally difficult for me. 

I think the reason the mom portion of my story has been longer is that growing up, my dad's behavior was obviously ""bad"" and I labeled him the ""bad"" parent. My mom's issues were much more subtle, and it took me (and probably still is taking me) time to figure out how her behavior affected me.

One thing that I forgot to mention is both of my parents came from extreme childhood poverty. While my mother grew up she aspired to rise in class, and we ended up moving to a very waspy state/area after my parents got divorced. My mother embodies the wasp ideal of not talking about emotions. She was furious when I asked to see a school counselor in  high school (we needed permission slips signed,) and just asked what I had to talk to someone about?! Gee IDK, how you fucked me up?!

Alright, on to the event that led to the cut off. Some background. My mother was always very weird about my romantic relationships. I came out to her as bisexual in high school while we were gardening. We weren't close and I'm not sure why I decided to tell her, but being queer was a huge part of my identity. She stared at me and whispered, while no one was around, ""Why would you say that like it's some great secret?""

When I began dating a man in college, I asked her some basic question about sexual health (she's a nurse so why not?) Despite the fact that she isn't a practicing religious person she just acted like it was so disgusting. 

When I was hospitalized (written about in my post about my father,) I was very manic. I had been put on a med before entering the hospital, an anti-depressant. For some people, anti-depressants can make you become wildly manic. That happened to me. It was the only time in my life I was like this, but I wasn't sleeping, disgusted by food, dancing all the time, grandiose thoughts, thought I was Jesus, etc. During this break down I was pretty open with my mom about my sex life and she was disgusted.

After I broke up with that dude I started dating my current partner (now together for seven years.) One way or another my mom found out we were having sex and was extremely offended she wasn't alerted to this ... although she never wanted to know before?! I told her I had been really manic when I talked to her and as a nurse she should have some understanding why I had been so open ...

Well, my parents hate(d) my current partner. Why did my stepfather hate him? He has small gauged ears and a septum piercing. That's it! At the time he worked,  had an internship in a successful agency, and went to school full time. While all of my step relatives were allowed to invite over their significant others my stepfather continued to ban my partner from family events.

I'll admit when we started dating my partner wasn't a great boyfriend. He was young, immature, etc. But over time he really stepped up and supported me but my family just didn't care. Although his actions tainted somewhat, it was really the body modifications and beard that put them off. Seriously, he could have saved kittens and babies from a fire but his earrings were a no go!

Well, come Christmas time we had been together for almost a year. Due to my partner's own fucked up life he had nowhere to go for Christmas. How sad!

So I approached my stepdad and mom. It had been a year. Maybe they could allow him to stop by so he wouldn't be alone?!

My stepfather was LIVID, stating that was not an option. Christmas was family time (although all my cousins were allowed to bring little high school bfs/gfs.) We really started fighting. My stepdad is about 8 inches shorter than me (LOL) but he got up, got in my space, his face was red ... I thought he may have been on the verge of hitting me. Did my mother do anything to stop this? LOL no why would she stop her perfect husband?!

Well it didn't escalate to blows, although I believe I told him ""Just hit me!"" I would have loved to take it and call the cops on him. 

He eventually told me ""I wasn't invited to his family's Christmas anyway."" This pleased me greatly, two birds one stone - I didn't have to spend time with him and I got to be with my poor boyfriend!

This was two weeks or so before Christmas. Christmas Eve comes around. I don't remember doing anything special that year which was unusual for us. But it was about 11:30 and I was in my basement room on my computer (probably on reddit lol.) My mom had come home drunk from helping her friend prepare for Christmas dinner. My mother was rambling about how she was happy I'd be there for Christmas, etc, etc.

I was like ""UH, what?"" I told her my stepfather had kicked me out and I was banned from Christmas. I wouldn't be there. My mother started crying, saying I knew he didn't mean that, etc, etc. People just say things when they're mad! Really? He was in my face and screaming. I'm not sure she was even upset about me being gone - she was upset about her 'perfect' family looking fucked up in front of his family.

She wondered back upstairs and my stepfather barreled down the stairs, saying I had made my mother cry, I had 10 minutes to get my things and to get out. And so I did. 

I drove to my boyfriend's house. My mother tried calling or texting me the next day, but I was furious she didn't stand up to me or tell my stepdad to calm down. 

Days went by. I was commuting 45 minutes from his house to my shitty retail job which was close to my parent's house. One day I stopped by on lunch to get my stuff ... it was within days of my getting kicked out, maybe a week. THEY CHANGED THE LOCKS ON ME. 

Eventually I contacted my mother and told her I wanted my stuff and I didn't want to see either of them when I got it. She kept saying that wasn't an option.

I forgot to mention that I paid rent to stay at their house. So when they changed the locks on me it was ILLEGAL. I told my mother this and that I'd get the cops involved on a recorded line, and while she was spooked, she didn't back down. There was no written agreement so I knew there would be no point. 

I wasn't sure if I wanted to cut contact because the city my boyfriend lived in was EXPENSIVE, I couldn't keep that job when it was so close to my parent's house (my mother was calling/harassing me there,) I had to make up my mind. Would I give in to my stepdad's power play and play into another man's psycho games like I had to do with my father? Would I be a man's bitch or a bitch to the capitalist system? 

I picked the later. The last time I saw my mother she was crying and asking if she could help me pack, and if she wanted the odds and ends she had brought me at the grocery store to welcome me back home. She wouldn't acknowledge the gravity of the situaiton and her ~broken family.

She harassed me for a while saying I was just mentally ill (I wasn't, I've realized all my ""mental illness"" - depression, anxiety, is due to my fucked up family and lessened when I cut contact,) or high on drugs (LOL NEVER DID DRUGS IN MY LIFE AND SPENT THE MAJORITY OF MY ADULT LIFE NOT DRINKING TO AVOID BECOMING MY FATHER BUT OK.)

It has been almost 5 years since this incident. Every time she contacts me to try to reconnect she generally blames everything on me ... And she has never apologized once, not even in an attempt to get me to talk to her. She won't say she's sorry.

And that is why I'll never contact her again."

4xwg4t,1,2016-08-15,"Is this company run illegally, and what can be done about it?",throwawayforareasonk,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4xwg4t/is_this_company_run_illegally_and_what_can_be/,"Hi guys, I'm using a throwaway account for this, as I don't want to give too much away about myself considering what I'm about to disclose. I won't use any names, and will not refer to specific nationalities, as this might make it obvious which company I am referring to.

I'm based in the UK, and started interning as a copywriter for a specific online streaming platform late last year. The films they specialise in are all from one country. Most of their internships run for three months, but recently they have made the internships 6 months in duration. They take interns from all over Europe, as well as locals. All internships are unpaid.

As my time there progressed, it seemed that there were certain things that did not add up. For example, many of the interns had to beg for weeks for any travel compensation. Some were travelling in from over two hours away. I lived down the street, so I wasn't affected. However, when the company moved to a new location, I had to pay for travel. No compensation has been offered.

When my three months were almost up, I told the owner I needed to finish and find a paid job. He said he didn't want to lose me, so offered to pay me. He would ""speak with his accountant"" and get back to me. A week went by. Nothing. Another week. I asked if he had spoken to his accountant, and he said it would not be feasible to pay me more than 300GBP per month for full-time hours. Of course, that's a ridiculous amount for an adult living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. I said I would help out for one day a week while I looked for a job. He agreed.

I looked up some internship-related articles online. According to some sources, it is illegal for unpaid interns to do ""proper work"", and should instead do tasks that benefit the company on a small scale. However, this company is made up entirely of interns. The marketing team, the content writers, the admin, the video editors, everyone. They work their scheduled months, then are replaced by new recruits. The company is almost made up entirely of unpaid workers. 

I say almost, because there is one staff member who receives a salary of sorts. She works as a manager, and oversees the interns' work. For her 9-6, 5-6 days a week schedule, she is paid less than 15,000GBP a year through a PayPal account. Not through the bank.

Another thing I should mention is that this paid staff member recently suffered a nervous breakdown of sorts, no doubt frazzled by her stressful, low-paid job. She often took work home with her, and was required to do additional work on her days off. She took two weeks off to recover from her ordeal, and then found that she was paid less than half of her monthly wages because of her absence. When she confronted the founder about this, he tried to appeal to her emotions, saying that she ""made more than him"", as if he wanted her to feel sorry for him. He also pointed out that her position was ""self-employed"", and as such he did not need to pay her a regular salary for time taken off. To put it frankly, it sounds like manipulative bullshit.

There was another paid employee, who happened to come from the country the films were from. He worked in acquisitions, signing contracts with filmmakers. He was sent to work abroad in this country earlier in the year. Again, he was paid through PayPal. He regularly had to chase up his pay, and then found that he had not been paid at all for the previous month's work. Sick of all the bullshit, he quit the position.

Another detail - the company advertises its positions online under another foreign film organisation's name. This organisation happens to be a registered charity. It's a film festival company, and a separate organisation to the one the interns actually work for. I believe that this might be a way to cover the fact it's unpaid - if you can kid authorities that the interns are working for a charity company, you can wriggle out of the lack of compensation.

There are other details that I could add, but these are the main points. I feel like this company's founder is a bit of a manipulative scam artist, and taking advantage of people's desperation to boost their CVs. My question is - is this operation illegal, and if so, is there anyone who can be contacted about it? Would anyone even care enough to investigate?

TL;DR - is a shitty company run almost entirely by unpaid interns breaking the law, and what can be done?

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. 

My shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood floor. 

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. 

I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly. 

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn"" I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. 

My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee. 

_

You're going to put my in my place. Make me your bitch.

Who you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous standards I construct for the annual review, my secretary, tired of being thrown the most menial tasks, a young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me.

Or maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be the head of the company that just bought mine, giving me a new role in the company, or a competitor who seduces me into giving you control.

Will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut - spreading my legs to help close business deals.

Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was. 

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings.

Bondage, foot worship, and petplay are all things I'd love to include, but definitely optional if you have other ideas.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, most other things are welcome.

I am a permanent Canadian citizen and I was only temporarily in the US on a work visa for an internship. I handled my own US taxes but asked my family's accountant to file my Canadian return. I filled out the necessary paperwork to authorize him a my tax representative.

After everything was processed, I received a large US return (a couple thousand) and a Canadian return of ~$600. I paid a lot of taxes in so this seemed to make sense. On July 22, I receive notice that I'm being re-assessed. Well it actually said I'm being reviewed for non-business foreign taxes paid, but I'm pretty sure it's just a re-assessment.

The document I received said ""To support your claim for foreign tax credit, please provide the following information, as applicable:""... This was followed by an extremely convoluted bullet point list of 30+ items and sub-clauses spread over four pages. One item on this list was Form T2209, related to foreign income. As far as I know, this form was never filled out.

I emailed my accountant asking if he would be able to help me better understand what I was required to send to the CRA. He said sure, and then I asked about Form T2209. It was at this point that he completely stopped answering my calls or emails for three weeks. I also only had 30 days to provide all this documentation or the CRA would ""disallow the amount under review and I could have a balance owing"".

I was getting concerned since I couldn't reach my accountant, so I went to my local bank for help this weekend. They aren't tax experts, but a financial adviser looked over the list with me to see what I had to provide. He couldn't figure it out either. Between the two of us, we could only figure out about 4 things they wanted from me. One being Form T2209 filled out after the fact. **The financial adviser also told me that since I named my accountant as an authorized representative, he is likely liable for any amount owing should that be the result of the reassessment.**

---

Finally, today, the accountant answered my call. He said he'd ""look into it"" and would call me back. This evening I received an email saying he had provided the necessary information to the CRA. He also said this:

&gt;[Accountant's name] submitted your claim for US tax based the only information available to him at that time. You then got a personal return of $600 based on that information. But based on current information you should have personally owed about $350 which means that now you will most likely have to pay back the $600 refund CRA sent you plus the $350 you should have paid for approx. $950. But wait and see how much they actually reassess.

&gt;Not good news but reassessments happen all the time.
 
&gt;If you have questions, you can call [Accountant's name].

Yes this email was written in third person for some reason. And no, I did not provide him with any additional information except the letter from the CRA saying I was under review. Of course I tried calling him but I haven't been able to get through. I don't know what ""current information"" he is referring to, or what changed between now and the time of originally filing my return.

I haven't even seen my 2015 return or any forms he filled out the first time around, and he won't provide them to me. I'm waiting on an access code sent via mail from the CRA to view it online. 

This is a very stressful situation, and although I can afford to pay back nearly $1000, it would require me to sacrifice a big purchase I've been saving up for. Any help or clarification is greatly appreciated.

Only in its home country, Brazil, does the flavor list expand beyond the base lemon-lime flavor. Flavors such as crystal or cherry also exist. One of the interns here, /u/Just_like_my_wife, even stated “TIL cat piss comes in different flavors” on twitter after the story was brought to his attention. We here at *NCN* have done a taste test for you of the cherry flavor. Our personal review is that while it still marks its territory, the lemon-lime flavor is most definitely superior.

Back at the motel, she gets sad cause attention was elsewhere again and leaves crying. I suggest we let her soothe herself, and she'll come back.  My dad suggests I ""stop with the tough guy act,"" and chases after her.

Now I'm only 6 months in so my new attitude is going to seem like an act to the people that raised me.  I am assertive, more muscular, and get shit done now but also tend to be too aggressive.  Will this family dynamic change over the years as I improve and kill my ego? I am cutting contact to a minimum because I tend to revert or go Rambo when I'm around them and it fucks with my progress.  I don't want to have to cut them off forever but will if I have to.  My father allowing this behavior isn't my problem. However, I fucked up by telling them what I'm doing and DEERing here and there.

For reference, I'm 21 and taking things too quickly.

Edit: I think a better question would be once my value is high enough can I lead my family despite another man leading it the wrong way?

I know this is a more bizarre kink, so I don't expect to many bites, but if you enjoy prompts that center on beasts/aliens and such, large insertions, possibly tentacles, and other fun then you will really enjoy my prompts. They come in various settings and styles, and can do r34 possibly as well. I tend to RP in a more DM/cyoa style if that makes sense. Feel free to message me, I'm up for both chats and RPs. Just as a forewarning, I tend to not be able to be at my computer for long periods of time, so it might take me a little bit to get back to you, but even if this post is old feel free to reply! That said, I will give it an honest effort to reply in a timely manner. As always, happy DPPing everyone!

Kinks: Beast, large insertion, tentacle, heels, machines, overt plots, bimbo, probably more.

Limits: Extreme age play, anything bathroom related, violence/gore/vore, probably more.

PROMPTS:

Scifi Porn shoot: Set in a science fiction, aliens and interplanetary travel kind of universe (same as the ambassador prompt) the idea is that you would go into a porn shoot which focuses on a human female and one or various alien creatures. This idea can have a lot of variance, the typical aesthetic of not knowing it was a porn audition, maybe you did and didn’t realize it would be inter species (beast, tentacle, you pick), or maybe you are all for it and intentionally went to it, it is up to you.

The Land of Eroticia: Legends told of a seed that would fall from the heavens, opening a new age into the living world. It fell in a large, but struggling kingdom falling into economic ruin, but that changed with the emergence of the heaven said. This seed grew into a massive tree at the center of the kingdom, reaching far enough into the sky that its peak was obscured. For decades the tree grew, yielding many questions as to its nature. Eventually, several gates appeared at its base, and people could enter this strange new world. What awaited them was not what they expected. A land far larger than the outer tree, it was filled life, and magic alien to the mortal world around it. But something else was different about this world. People found their bodies changing, men and woman reaching extremes of their forms, and discovering new found sexual desires. Even the creatures possessed magical abilities and only exemplified this quality. Now, there are several settlements throughout it, some with the intention to gain territory, but many for trade to ship rare and magical good to the outside world. So what is your role in this world? Looking to make a name for yourself as an adventure? Business aficionado? Or another reason? This prompt is very inspired by Corruption of Champions, an over the top text rpg that features transformation and all kinds of overt sexy shenanigans.

(Temporarily retired) Primal Planet: Far in the universe aliens explore foreign worlds, and undergo their own scientific research on new worlds and to progress their scientific knowledge. One group often abducts humans, sending them to new planets to explore the surface. This is to make sure it is safe for their researchers, but also to test how the lifeforms and environment interact with outside beings. In this prompt you will be abducted, and sent to primal world filled with alien creatures that could have all forms of unique interactions with you. I often include a few things in this prompt, an aphrodisiac atmosphere, and mild transformation. This is usually just making you able to breath the new atmosphere, be more physical tough and able to handle more (you can imagine what you might need to handle more of…) (Temporarily retired)

Intergalactic Senate A more long term oriented RP, you will play the role of an ambassador of earth amidst an intergalactic senate. The RP will likely take place on a massive space station. This prompt does have some plot focus, but the sexual elements are there. The idea is that you must use you political knowledge and powers of persuasion to accomplish whatever goals you have. There are heavy behind the scenes, blackmail, all of the usual political fun, but in space, and with aliens.

Botanist: Deep in the amazon there is a flower known for its unique lore and properties. Considered the flower of sexuality to local indigenous populations, supposedly it increased the sexual drive and ability of every one whom came in contact with it. This flower has since been found by scientists, and is currently being tested to develop the new age of sexual aides. You will play either a scientist or even a new intern at the facility it is being examined at. Maybe a little after hours work yields interesting results and you volunteer to work late for science on a continual basis, becoming addicting to scent and sexual pervasions of the plant.

Temple of the Phalisians: Deep in the amazon lies the Temple of the Phalisians, a structure built by a culture known for their strange norms and rituals. Their men and woman pushed the extremes of both genders, woman known for buxom breasts and hips, and men known for muscular builds and being well endowed. You will be an archeologist/explorer in the temple, working your way through the many sexual puzzles and traps to achieve your goal! (Can feature insertions, tentacles, gangbangs, transformation, there is a lot that can happen in this RP!)

Alien abduction: It is suspected that we have been visited by foreign life forms before, and this time you happen to be the one abducted. This prompt really varies depending on the partner, as it can easily feature all manners of kinks. Maybe you wake up on a lab table, strapped down as they experiment on your fertile body, inserting instruments and transforming you. Maybe you wake up in a chamber, naked when some bizare alien creature/tentacle beast enters, forcing itself upon you. In the end, you will wake up back in your bed, wondering if it was just a dream, or if it actually happened.

(In a current longterm RP with) School of magic: Located deep in the mountains is the Mythra School of Magic, having existed for for nearly three centuries, it is known for producing some of the greatest magic wielders. The castle itself is built into the mountain side, which acts as both a location for most classes, the library as well as housing for the faculty, staff and students. Nearby the castle within its wall are the grounds, which host its gardens and athletic fields. Outside the walls lie the enchanted lakes and forests, which are known to hold all manner of magical beasts. Many students are guided through trips in the woods to edjucate them on non human creatures.
The school of Mythra is known for its wide array for magical classes, transformative (practiced in the gardens often on the statues), elemental, physical manipulation (practiced in the fields to height physical abilities in sporting events), are all examples of this. Nearly any subject can be studied at this school to an amazing depth. In this roleplay you could play a some individual at the school, subjected to the subtle pervasions of its subjects. Maybe it is the magical beasts, the tentacle plants/summons, the well endowed statues in teh garden, there are so many kinks that this promp can hit.

To be summarized: Super hero (wardrobe malfunctions, public sex with the monsters, etc). School of magic, teacher/student toys around with unknown summoning spells. Captured as a fantasy/scifi slave and forced into exhibiting sex shows. There is also a more generic fantasy world RP prompt not as ridiculous as the CoC inspired too. More to come!

All of these prompts are good to go, even the to be summarized prompts. You can also adjust and tinker with prompts as well, like changing the ambassador from a scifi to fantasy prompt, changing/adding kinks, things like that. Maybe you feel like using one of the settings making a sex slave kind of prompt, or simply a sexy adventure romp. I also have little variations on them all too, with similar kinks and feels, but different circumstances ;). We can also meld some prompts! Personally I enjoy mixing prompts and just creating new ones with my partners. Looking forward to hearing from you!"

I will be taking a Data Structures and Algorithms class this Fall and during my free time, I am using FreeCodeCamp to learn to code/build small projects. I am mostly looking for internship positions at startups, but will also apply to bigger companies.  I have a few questions:

1. When should I start applying for internships for Summer 2017? (My summer is usually from Late May - Early-Mid August).

2. Where would I be able to find applications for internship positions? (I have heard AngelList is good for startups, any other recommendations?)

3. How would I go in asking for an internship for Summer 2017? (or do most companies assume that applicants are applying for an internship for the upcoming summer, if not, how would I approach in saying that I am seeking an internship position for the summer?)

Thank you for the help!"

I have looked at the CustoMac Mini Deluxe from tonymacx86.com and came up with this:

Gigabyte GA-Z170N-WIFI, DIMM, DDR4-SDRAM

Intel Core i5-6600K 3,5 GHz (Skylake) pretested @ 4,8 GHz - tray

Samsung 850 EVO MZ-75E250 - Solid state drive - 250 GB - intern - 2.5""

I was thinking of using the PSU and RAM from my current computer. Would that be possible?
The important thing is that the Hackintosh is able to do light photo/video editing and also have WIFI capabilities.

4xyfka,59,2016-08-16,Story Time - Episode 3 - Wireless Mouse + Backup Exec = ???,IsaacJB1995,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4xyfka/story_time_episode_3_wireless_mouse_backup_exec/,"This story goes back to when I was an apprentice. We used to support many companies with a vast array of problems, whether it be something small like a password reset or even as far as hosting their website, and of course everything in between.

This one story begins on a regular day. Most of our contracts used old tape based backups and would simply have an admin intern swap the tapes each night before going home. However, one day the intern for a particular site was ill, so the Receptionist had to do it instead, She rang us up at about 4.30pm and asked how she did this. Now as an apprentice, I wasn't sure, so I asked my supervisor and he quickly showed me one we used to use years ago. I did a demonstration and I soon felt confident enough to talk her through it.

With Backup Exec, you load the tapes, perform an inventory so it reads the new tape that has been inserted and you leave the self-configured backup to run overnight. Sounds simple, right?

Well for this lady, it turned into a 3 HOUR phone call. That's right. Luckily the backup didn't start until about 10pm, but for something so simple, even by a user's perspective, that's bad.
Well the main reason it took so long was because of the following:

1. She was trying to plug a Wireless mouse into the computer for 30 minutes so she could use Backup Exec.

2. When she gave up and just used a nearby PS2 mouse (yes, this is an old story) , she then thought the wireless mouse was one of the tapes, so she tried inserting it into the reader.

3. After explaining that the tapes were on the shelf to her left as she walked in (several times), she eventually found a tape, however it was another previous day's tape. As those who have used Exec before, old tapes need to be manually wiped before reading new data, so obviously when she inserted it into the reader, it kept failing to read the blank data as data was already stored on it.

I asked her what date label was on the front and it clearly said the Tuesday (it was Thursday when we did this). I told her the blank tapes are next to the box of used tapes and she should use a blank tape. 

Eventually, she managed to insert the tape the right way round, I then decided to remote into the computer and performed an inventory and check everything over myself since she was clearly useless. I told her to go home as I could do the rest of the checks from this end.

Moral of the story is, as long as you're getting paid overtime, it doesn't matter how stupid the user is (probably a bad moral, but I couldn't think of a good one with a straight face)"
4xygzm,1,2016-08-16,40M4f - Misogyny and Sadism (Extreme),jameswatson777,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4xygzm/40m4f_misogyny_and_sadism_extreme/,"My name is James and I am a proud misogynist and sadist. So I can get pretty dark and dirty; I'm certainly not going to be shy in abusing you.

[This is my kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/v5UKoBS.png) ; I enjoy degrading and abusing cunts, mother/daughter incest, snuff, fake tits, and being an Alpha Male. I believe that cunts have no rights.

Some scene ideas:

1. Job Interview. I am well known writer and despite my misogyny I received an option to be interviewed for a job at a Feminist magazine. You would play the managing editor, a powerful businesswoman (perhaps even a lesbian), and you are fully aware that I am a misogynist; but your magazine has seen declining sales and you honestly believe that my writing would increase sales. But you have to convince me to join, doing everything you can from increasing my salary, giving me your own office, to offering up your body and those of your very young daughters (ages to be discussed). You increasingly degrade yourself, your employees, underage interns and family until I am the editor and your magazine is no longer feminist.

2. Muscle Humiliation. You are a bodybuilder, with powerful muscles in your arms and thighs. You got large breast implants to continue to show off your feminity, but you are also proud of what you have achieved at the gym. No men ever approach you. Until I come in, an Alpha Male, and just start abusing you and calling you names, squeezing your breasts and suggesting a new gym outfit. You are thoroughly humiliated and come to agree to each of my demands happily, even when I start getting violent.

3. Girls School. You are the Principal of a girls school. The new school year is about to start but you are concerned that your school has been doing terrible in both grades and athletics. You decide that presenting a new image of the school will help, and decide that who better to determine that new image than the man who just moved into the house across the street from the school. You soon realise that this man has his own ideas of how a girls school should look and behave.

4. Fall of a Celebrity. A famous feminist, like Emma Watson or Daisy Ridley, reduced to being a fuckslut. Daisy Ridley could be using social media to promote the latest Star Wars film, gets degraded by a Star Wars nerd, and invites him to the set to prove him wrong. Instead she ends up being his cunt slave."

Gave Russia a reset button which reset cold war

Lack of a coherent plan to address the Arab Spring 

Deteriorating relations with Israel Assessment of Bashar al-Assad (whom she labeled a “reformer”) 

Cluelessness that withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq would give the radicals a foothold 

Benghazi scandal 

Lack of bringing to justice the jihadists who killed our 4 Americans Victory lap on Osama bin Laden giving a false impression of al-Qaeda’s decimation 

Blindsiding the Israeli prime minister with a public declaration of U.S. policy on “1967 borders” Backing Hugo Chavez’s candidate in Honduras rather that the middle and business classes’ choice (who was also pro-American) 

Relaxation of Cuban sanctions followed by Alan Gross’s imprisonment 


Surprising Poland and the Czech Republic by pulling out anti-missile sites 


Embracing Hosni Mubarak (calling him a family friend) just when pressure was needed to prevent what ultimately became his overthrow 

The lack of a cogent approach to the Middle East Failing to take decisive action in Syria before jihadists poured into the country 

The decision to overthrow President Gaddafi in Libya Downplaying human rights, especially with China 


Failing to robustly support the Green Revolution Engagement of Iran and foot-dragging on sanctions, allowing Iran to reach the cusp of a nuclear weapons capability Announced “pivot” to Asia without carrying through 

Erased email server 

Clinton cash 


Maintaining the status quo with Pakistan 


However, it would just be easier to ask Hillary what her biggest accomplishment was as Secretary of State. She answered, “My accomplishments as Secretary of State? Well, I’m glad you asked! My proudest accomplishment in which I take the most pride, mostly because of the opposition it faced early on, you know… the remnants of prior situations and mindsets that were too narrowly focused in a manner whereby they may have overlooked the bigger picture and we didn’t do that and I’m proud of that. Very proud. I would say that’s a major accomplishment.” Being that I could find any major Hillary accomplishments myself, I could not make out a list of what she should place on her presidential resume. In summary, the people of the USA get get what they vote for.

I am curious if the Irish passport gives me legal right to work in the EU or just Ireland. And how I would go about looking for jobs abroad. Are there job boards? Or do I pick specific companies that I know have offices abroad? 

My degree focuses in a mix of tech and business. And I have had 4 years of work experience with 2 relevant internships at tech companies. My internships were focusing on data analysis and some experience writing SQL. I also only speak English though am open to learning a new language.

We went through everything together and were best friends for a long time. 

As we grew older our interests changed and we started to spend less time outside of school or training together. We now go to different universities in the same city and we see each other for training 2-3 times a week.

The thing is though, as of lately, I always end up feeling a bit worthless after we do something. He studies hard and has a good job, but my efforts always seem to pale in comparison to him. He never really seems to be happy for me and appreciate when good things happen to me, he only ever manages to see the bad side of things and make me feel bad anyway. I also study hard and had a really good internship that I should be proud of, but all that just seems like nothing. I usually are rather happy with myself but after we hang out for a bit I always feel like a loser. When we are around other friends, he always seems to be insulting me and make me feel bad (but that is of course just for fun he says). 

It has come so far that I don't really look forward to seeing him as I will feel bad afterwards. When I meet other friends I look forward to it and enjoy my time, but with him it always feels like I'm being yelled at like a child that can't do anything right. I always have to take the energy to think things through in order to be happy with my self. I just don't want to continue to use my time feeling sad instead of pursuing interests. 

Does he really want the best for me and just gives me constructive criticism or is this some sort of toxic friendship that I should cut off? 

I spend a lot of time thinking about this and I would like to know what you can tell me about the situation. 

Thanks,

UPDATE:
Had a talk with my friend today during lunch and explained the situation in pretty much the same way as I did. He said he only said those things in order to motivate me to do even better and was trying to be helpful.

He was sorry if he had gone a bit far, as he himself gets a lot of critique from parents and friends and was just trying to help me. 

We decided that I in the future will directly say when I think something hurts me more than helps me. 

Thanks for all the support, I would have never had the courage to talk things out with him otherwise!! "
4y05i0,100,2016-08-16,I failed you RBN. I'm so sorry.,Semper-Aethereum,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4y05i0/i_failed_you_rbn_im_so_sorry/,"Well. I should have listened. I should have listened to all your advice on separating my finances from my parents' bank accounts. Even though my Nrents said the bank accounts were for me to use, I should've listened to you, RBN, about what exactly that meant and why that is just a method of control.                      
I've posted on here before saying I wanted to buy and make my own computer using money I earned through my internship. When Is tarted planning this dilemma, I *correctly* predicted my parents wouldn't like the idea and wouldn't let me buy it. You all told me to make my own check account and siphon money to that account, and I then posted saying I would do it.             
Well, I had that opportunity Reddit. A month ago, I had the debit card to that account **in my hand**, ready to go. They would have never noticed where the extra $100 per week went; they would never have noticed the weekly $40 withdraw from ""my"" account (controlled by them); they would have never noticed the computer.             
But I failed you RBN. I failed to adhere to one of your core principles: that you must know that you Nparents are all about control and will never change, ever. You see, when I had that debit card in my hand, I had a thought: ""You know, maybe my parents will understand that I worked overtime for this computer. Maybe they won't judge me for this purchase. Maybe they will recognize that I've saved the majority of my income and that a little expense for a job well done is deserved. Maybe the days of total control are over.""               
I was wrong. I was **horrendously** wrong. Once that though came into my head, I felt horrible the entire day and I canceled the account the next week. And guess what just happened today: I talked to my parents openly about the computer.                           
Now, just a backstory:                                        
 * My NDad is unemployed. Has been since I started the internship. Makes the family budget to the extreme.                              
 * My Mom works 2 jobs (she's a school teacher who also does private lessons).                            
 * Both parents told me to save my money in ""My account"" (their account) so that college would be a breeze.                      
 * I paid for the first 2 years of college under a deal that my parents would pay for the next 2 years. No conditional funding was spoken of.                         
 * Both parents are the type of parent who loves to see their child succeed, even if at their own financial expense.                                      
 * I had stated that my Nrents **MAY USE MY INTERNSHIP INCOME TO OFFSET THE EXPENSES**. My Nrents had already put most of the money (including a stipend) into a short term CD.                                                 
 * I had helped my Nrents with everything they wanted. Both parents had stated I was ""more of a GC this summer than my GC brother had ever been in his life. That I had **'matured'** beyond belief.""                         
And now, when I tell me parents about how I want to spend ~$800 for a computer, guess what happens? They scream at me, call me ""disrespectful,"" fight me (NDad only, I held him down without being scratched). They said I ""didn't understand the family finances"" and that it was ""immature"" to try and spend ""$2000"" on a worthless piece of shit.                          
When I called them out of the lack of a link between the poor ""family financial situation"" and me paying an $800 purchase out of my total after-tax income of $15000, they said this:                      
&gt; ""If you purchase that computer, we will cut all college funding, and withdraw all of 'your money' from the bank account"".                   

That's when it hit me, RBN. You were right: they're not about fostering rewards for success. They're about control and manipulation. When social acceptance (calling me a ""GC"") didn't work, they went straight to threats. When we made a deal, **WITHOUT ANY CONDITIONS**, they really meant ""piss us off and we will fuck u over"". It is just so sad to see my parents like this, threatening financial abandon and denying me the right to pay something with my own money because their feelings are hurt and because they aren't earning income. I should've listened to you RBN, I should have listened.                           

Please RBN, with complete understanding of the consequences, try and separate yourself financially as quickly as possible. Your Nrents do not value your true desires. They value control and what they want you to become. They'll fund some things because thats what they want you to be, not because it is what you actually want. They will use finances like a blackmailing service if you try to do anything you want.                    
I just feel like ending it."
4y05v2,1,2016-08-16,Two offers - Should I take the full-time contract or do an internship?,jobvsintern,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4y05v2/two_offers_should_i_take_the_fulltime_contract_or/,"Massive text warning!

Hey everyone, hoping to get some advice about two offers I just received. For background, I am based in Toronto and have no formal education or experience related to graphic design. It has just been something I've always had an interest in and worked on during my free time, and only recently took it seriously as a career prospect.


I've been lucky to receive two offers despite my lack of formal training and experience, but I would love to hear your thoughts and advice on which one to accept.


The first offer is a 4-month contract position as an in-house designer for $3,333 a month (equal to $40k a year), which is way more than I expected for someone with my background for an entry-level job. It was originally going to be for 12 months, but they didn't want to overestimate how long they would need me for and changed it to 4 to be safe. That said, they did mention that if they still needed me after 4 months (they said they probably would, they just can't promise it) they would most likely extend my contract or hire me as a full-time employee. My only concern is that I would be the only designer there - essentially the marketing department (where the marketing manager would be my boss) have no clue about design and have straight up told me I would mostly be using pre-designed templates. 


I'm worried I won't be able to learn or improve my design skills at all, which means I'll have barely anything to add to my portfolio. (This company is also in the private finance sector so besides it having a more corporate culture, I may not even be allowed to include the work I do for them on my portfolio at all for legal reasons.) In addition, I won't have anyone in the office to turn to if I'm stuck or need some professional input.


The second offer is a 3-month internship at a small digital marketing startup that seems really cool, has great company culture as most startups do, and overall a great place to learn. They do have a creative/design team so I would definitely be able to learn a lot and develop my skills. Over half their interns have been hired as full-time employees so there's definitely a good chance for growth and career development if I choose to take this. However, they would be paying me $700/month and while money isn't a huge deal-breaker for me as an entry level candidate, I can't help but think of the massive paycheck difference compared to the other offer.

If anyone could offer their insights or give some helpful advice, I would really appreciate it. (Sorry for the huge chunk of text!!!) 

Thanks everyone!"
4y0fmu,2,2016-08-16,"Simply Put, Human Indignity: I was fired for having the worst migraine of my life.",Ooniversidad,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4y0fmu/simply_put_human_indignity_i_was_fired_for_having/,"Almost a year ago, I was interviewing for a 70k salary job. COBOL database administrator with State Farm in Richardson, Tx. I had never seen such a brilliant city as Richardson. I drove around after the interview trying and failing to see a bad part of town. I could move here with my girlfriend, we would have a stunning apartment. My life would change for the better drastically.

I failed out my final, graduating semester after a psychotic break. I tried to do correspondence courses for three classes, but couldn't get in touch with the professors after the first few attempts to meet up.

I've had 6 jobs in 8 months. Terminated because my car broke down and it was an hour away. Got the car fixed, got another job an hour away and I couldn't afford to pay for the gas. Got a telemarketing job, got fired when I yelled at a guy who was screaming at me for 3 solid minutes and called me retarded for stuttering, one of my greatest insecurities. Got an internship with a property management company, the scummiest in town but it was $10 40hrs a week. They let me go with no warning when I got sick and made sure to ask permission and get a doctor's note before I called in. That one hurt, because I had been offered a permanent spot. It wasn't 70k, but it would change my life. I could go back to school and get my life on track.

I was unemployed for a month before I went to a temp agency and they set me up at another call center, starting at 6am to 230. I haven't had 8 hours of sleep in 2 weeks because I'm having trouble adjusting. Yesterday, I had a headache so I took some Ibuprophen. It got worse, I tried to stick it out but eventually I felt like vomitting. I went to the bathroom several times and retched but couldn't summon anything out. I held the phone 5 inches from my ear because it hurt so bad to hear the person on the other line, and I could hardly function. I asked to go to lunch early, and the supervisor on the floor, M, said I should call the sick line if I can't make it back in. I did, and tried to go to the dr for a note, but I had $11 to my name and a $25 copay was required before services are rendered. I'm so lucky to have insurance through my parents, and even then I couldn't get in.

Today, I showed up and another supervisor, K, asked for a doctor's note. I said I didn't get one, explained the situation, and as I understood it, I could clock in if I got one. So, I asked my parents to put $20 in my account and went in. The doctor gave me a note for today and yesterday. I showed up and presented it to K, she said I needed that note before I showed up this morning and that I was fired. I went cold. I knew these people were shitty, but really? I was so angry. I threw my training binder at the wall and she followed me out, threatening to call the cops and recording me on her phone.

I went to the temp agency and requested another job, because I had to do something, but that was an hour ago and I haven't stopped crying since.

It's not that this incident was terrible, it's that there has been a string of incidents that make me think that I haven't met a decent person in a year. Maybe I was naiive, I was certainly privileged. My parents worked salary, and when they were sick or just didn't want to come it, they called in sick. When something was seriously wrong, they didn't weigh money over a hospital visit. I had no idea that these were things I would worry about, and I wouldn't have ever known if my life had gone differently. I'm glad to know, I want to understand people and do anything to help, do anything to keep from becoming an uppity white bitch glaring at service workers.

I'm tired of this. My parents are tired, and disappointed. I probably won't even tell them I got fired, because they'll say if I could have gotten fired for being sick, I shouldn't have told anyone I was sick.

I am so desperate to change where I am, but in 6 different tries, I haven't come up with anything more than disappointment. I am drowning in debt, and it's getting to the point that I just can't borrow more money. I have two credit cards past due along with a Firestone card with a $400 bill that I can't even think about paying. $30k in student loans. I haven't seen a dentist in a year, and three fillings have fallen out since. I've had to make do with over the counter filling putty. And now, no job.

Is there something innately wrong with me, or are people just this shitty? I've seriously been wondering if I even have the capability to survive in this world, or if I am simply broken and irreparable."

I've just been looking at about the ""great"" level here. Is that about the budget and power level of everything that would confidently play these games and high graphics settings? (And maybe let me finally try playing the likes of skyrim or something?)

I don't really have a budget in mind, but I'm still a student and even with my internship money I'll talk with my parents about an appropriate budget. This is incredibly early in the process, just trying to get a headstart for conversations and more detailed searches. "
4y0j1w,1,2016-08-16,Should our roommates still pay some portion of utilities if they are gone for a semester?,pickausernamepicka,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4y0j1w/should_our_roommates_still_pay_some_portion_of/,"So four of us just moved into a house this month (4 bed, 2 bath), and our lease runs until next August.  Two of the roommates will be gone for internships next semester but will be back by May and will likely come back for several weekends through the semester.  So the question is:  should those two be obligated to pay some portion of utilities/cable/internet while they are away?

Their argument is essentially:  we shouldn't have to pay for what we're not using.  (I will note that I'm not in town yet, so we haven't had a solid back and forth.  And I don't know if there's more to their argument than that.)


Our points:

* there are still base charges that would have to be paid even if all of us were gone
* AC takes up a large portion of the electricity bill, and it's not like we could shut off air to their rooms
* even if we could, AC still goes to common areas like the living room and kitchen.  It isn't fair to ask two people to pay for the AC of a four person house
* the AC bill will be relatively equal regardless of whether there are four or just one of us staying in the house
* we wouldn't have signed up for the more expensive cable/internet package we have now had we known that half of the house didn't plan on paying for it in the spring

I agree that they shouldn't have to pay for water, gas, or most of electricity, but to me it comes down to the fact that two people shouldn't be responsible for the entirety of a four person house.  If we hypothetically pay $400 a month in utilities; it wouldn't drop all the way to $200 when two roommates are gone.  I don't think it's fair to ask us to pay significantly more per month while they're away.


I have a few potential solutions I've thought about already (haven't proposed them yet though):

* determine our average monthly bill - anything over that we pay, anything under that comes out of their portion rather than splitting equally
* we agree on some percentage split of the utilities bill.  Normally we would each pay 25%, but while they're away maybe we each pay 35% (70%) and they each pay 15% (30%)
* they don't pay for the usage parts of the bill but still pay for the baseline charges and some agreed upon amount for AC

Should they have to throw in for utilities while away in the first place?  And if so, which solution do you think is most fair?  And do you have any other potential solutions?

Thanks for your help!

(I will say that I realize we should have had this discussion prior to signing a lease.  Oh well, I'll know better in the future now.)"

Do I need an attitude adjustment?,Barunna_Ulfrbani,RedditForGrownups,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/4y0x17/how_do_you_reconcile_the_need_for_employment_with/,"I'm sure you get these kind of topics and questions a lot, but I'm struggling right now with my current career path and the realization that I really don't like a lot of what I'm doing.

Some background: I graduated college in May of this year, and I've been working in my second internship now for 3 months. I work in HR technically, but this summer I've been doing a myriad of philanthropic event coordinating, communications, and the occasional reporting task. While I've enjoyed my job, I've learned 1) that I have a bad habit of overworking myself and not putting down work to, say, go home, and 2) that I desperately need to have more time outside of work than an 8 to 5:30 job with an hour commute each way will let me have. I hit the point where I would go home exhausted at the end of a work day because I'd exerted so much brainpower all day, and I couldn't work up the motivation to even cook a proper dinner. I've eaten ground beef, rice, and broccoli for a while because it's all I have the energy to prepare that also feeds me what I need. Also, while I used to get along well with my supervisor, lately she's been micromanaging and inadvertently making me feel like I am not good at my job, or making me look bad because she changes her mind after I do something and I have to go back and redact my earlier words. It's been stressful, and I don't know how to tackle that, so I wind up keeping frustrations bottled up rather than say the wrong thing to the wrong people. 

In addition to this, I am:
Getting married in 3 weeks (and thus planning my wedding)
Working on small tasks to fix up our new home
Helping my parents with their new house
Seeking a job, but not wholeheartedly, for after this internship ends (I don't know what to look for and my energy is gone.)

There is a lot of transition in my life. I do not know how much of my frustration and stress is caused by this and how much is caused by my job. All I know is that I broke down about a week ago because I hated something my boss did, and because I felt no connection to my fiance anymore as we haven't had time to spend together lately. 

I hate being out of the house for 10 to 11 hours of the day. I hate doing a job that is ultimately pointless, and really my dream day-to-day life would include being a stay at home parent, having a part time job or volunteering thing, and having time to foster my relationships with my family and fiance, and eventually friends if I could be in one place long enough to make them. But we don't want kids for a while, and we want to be financially wise and prepare for that time in our life. And anyway, I don't want to stay home right now. I just don't want to be occupied, and exhausted by that occupation, for so long during the week that I can't enjoy my time outside of work. I hate it, but my current situation makes me question if there is something wrong with me, like am I weak for not being able to hold down a life and a job, do I just need an attitude adjustment, and am i ever actually going to be happy to have a job?

Tl;Dr: how do I reconcile my need for personal time with my need for employment? How did you find balance and peace in your work life?"

It was an older(non-retina) model, but had 512 GB SSD. It was my first time working with a Mac, but I was really surprised by how much I liked working on it. Homebrew was very useful, the hardware was incredible, didn't have to deal with annoying updates, and development was very enjoyable. 

Now that my Windows machine is kinda broken, I was thinking whether i should switch to a Mac. Thing is, I cannot afford a very expensive high end mac. Might be able to afford an Air though. Although I have done dev work on a mac, I have not worked with android studio there, nor have I worked with anything like Unity. Would these run well on a Macbook Air? Are there any more difficulties in developing on a mac?

I'm not sure if this is the wrong forum to ask this question, but I figured I should ask this question where most developers gather."

I checked the FAQ and searched for this question, and couldn't find an answer so I decided to post. I'm planning on applying to internships for Summer 2017, but searching at the moment is just bringing up opportunities for this summer (too late) or fall internships.

I just recieved a verbal internship offer from one of the Big 4 for the Financial Due Diligence group for next summer. I just had a few questions:

What can I expect from interning with this group compared to an audit internship? Does an internship in FDD usually lead to a FT offer like audit and tax? 

And I'm currently in a MAcc program on the audit track. Should I just stick with the audit track or switch to general? Biggest difference is that with audit you have to take a couple more audit classes, whereas the general track lets you take some more business grad electives. I'm not sure if the extra audit classes will be helpful or not if I end up working FT in FDD.

Thanks!"

My Dad just came into my room, and told me how he was boasting about me to his boss. About how I got a 3.9 this summer semester, and how I'm taking a bunch of harder classed this fall, and my efforts to raise my GPA to a 3.5. 

I guess that they're in need of female engineering majors for their internship program. The dude that's in charge of the program also graduated from the university that I went to. There's a very high chance that if I applied for this internship, I would get in.

But here's why I'm so hesitant to take this opportunity: 

I don't want a fucking 9 - 5. I'm not studying CS for the money. I'm in on it because I love computers, and one day I want to be a computer scientists. I want to be able to work for a university or something, actually contributing to the CS field. 

I always joked about how sad working a 9-5 would be, like becoming a programming monkey for some insurance company and being completely dead on the inside. Guess what kind of company it is!

Even worse, I would end up living at home with my parents. They moved to a different part of my city a year ago, and I don't have any friends here. Whenever I visit, I don't leave my room. Over my entire month long winter break, I think I went outside on my own accord 3 times, and that was so I could get food alone. I'm also not super close with my parents. My dad's kinda a dick, and he just remarried to my stepmom a year ago. She's nicer, but due to her associations with my dad, I tend to keep my distance,

I also really fucking hate the city I live in. It's a suburban hell, where every street and neighborhood looks exactly like the last one. Public transpiration is also shit, and I don't drive because it's kinda terrifying. The only reason commuting wouldn't be an issue is because I would be driving into the office with my dad

I don't want to be stuck in a city that I hate where I don't have any friends, living with my parents that are practically strangers.  I would be dependent on my Dad for transpiration, which could turn into a clusterfuck pretty quickly.

I want to spend next summer at my university doing research. Hell, I could be a code-monkey there as well, but I love my school so it would't feel like I'm wasting my life away. I have friends there. It's a beautiful town surrounded by hills, and actual history, and brick buildings. But there's a lot of uncertainty if I'll be able to actually find a job or research position. Most of them to towards grad students, and I can't just end up spending the summer doing absolutely nothing with my life.

I hate this so fucking much."

I have about a 2.6 GPA in my major program (2.8 cumulative GPA). I have been working as a student assistant in web services for a little over two years where I spend 95% of the time copying and pasting html content. I have no other internship experience. I have a couple projects I worked on but nothing I think is worth mentioning to future employers. I even think my current job is not really worth mentioning...    

I would like to make a fully functioning game or Android app by next fall for my capstone project, but I find it intimidating despite how much I should know by now. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the aspects of computer science, but most of the time I have a hard time understanding it that I lose motivation in continuing.

Feel free to add anything that I missed or got wrong because I can't watch every episode.

If you've been following Reckful and Mitch for a while and just want the parts from last night and today, skip down to ""Climax."" If you want some background, read on:

**Enter Mira**

We'll skip Mira's beginnings on Twitch because that's a whole other story with Reynad, but we'll come in at the point where Mira acts like a Twitch streamer groupie and always hangs out with other streamers.

So Mira and Reckful do a stream together, and he's kind of jokingly flirting with her, and she's doing that ""I'm flirting by coyly rejecting you"" - it's not really serious, but both of them could walk away from it thinking the other one is into them because they're used to other people being into them. They play some Hearthstone, Reckful throws some cash around. It's a little awkward but nothing important happens.

Then Mira starts hanging out with Mitch and he really likes her. Reynad comes back into the show to tell Mitch he does not get along with Mira because she's crazy in a Russian way. Mira and Reynad fight on stream, and Mitch wants them to be friends but it's not happening. Reynad leaves the stream telling Mitch he'll put up with Mira because he wants to stay friends with Mitch, but she's too batshit for him to pretend to be friends with her. Mira thinks Reynad is egotistical and playing the victim. But again, whole other story.

Reckful, Mitch, and Mira stream some more together and hang out, do some Pokemon Go. Mitch and Mira start dating for real, and people walk in on some awkward blowjob moments.

**The Tension Grows**

Reckful goes to visit Blue because she's unhappy with her internship and he tells Mitch he's going, but Reckful asks him to keep it private because Reckful does not want his chat to hate Blue. Reckful claims he offered to stay after finding out it was Mitch's birthday, but Mitch told him he didn't mind if he went. Later, Mitch tells his stream Reckful abandoned him on his birthday and left to visit his parents or something. Later on stream he brings up Reckful's disappearance again, asking another streamer if Reckful is with them, or who he's with. Together, with a tweet from Blue about meeting a friend, chat figures out Reckful went to meet Blue. Mitch claims it was all a joke, but Reckful resents how Mitch made him look bad. Reckful also thought it made Mitch seem fake; not only did Mitch claim to be abandoned when Reckful offered to stay, but Mitch also pretended not to know where Reckful was. Reckful realized Mitch could be putting on an act for his stream, which Reckful personally dislikes in streamers.

Reckful starts to dislike Mira because of her strange relationship with Mitch and because he thinks she's fake. She would do things like plan how she would behave on stream to get more viewers, and Mitch was really into Mira so it seemed like he was losing himself in the relationship. While they're at Reckful's house, Reckful feels like Mira splits the group in two, with her and Mitch separated from the others. Overall Reckful doesn't think she's a good influence on Mitch. Mira doesn't think Reckful (and Texas) are a good influence on Mitch. Mira wants Mitch to go back with her to Maryland.

Eventually it broils over into Twitter. Reckful goes ham on Mira because he thinks she's lying about her resume, and Mira bites back because she thinks he's bitter because she rejected him on that awkward cash stream. He says she's only after money and attention, she says girls are only into him because of his money. Back and forth, back and forth. Reckful may or may not be afraid of Mitch leaving with her.

Mitch goes on stream and says he hates that both of him put him in an awkward position and he refuses to comment on it publicly, instead making them repair it off stream. Mira says she can use Reckful's outburst to get him banned from Twitch, but Mitch asks her not to and she backs off.

At some point off stream, Mitch decides he and Mira are finished and he's not moving with her. Mira leaves Texas. Mitch tells Reckful he's done with her. Reckful told him it was okay if he still wanted to see Mira, but Mitch affirmed he was really done with her. Reckful suspects Mitch may be brainwashed by other streamers to think no one in Texas is his friend, but the two hash it out and have a friendly stream together - [minus one awkward phone call from Mira where Mitch impersonates a banshee](https://clips.twitch.tv/watchmeblink1/ColorfulBeaverBrokeBack) - but then they go back to friendly streaming.

**Climax**

Last night Mira flew down to Texas and Mitch met with her in private. Toez saw Mitch's car and a purse in it, and after snooping around the area saw them having dinner together. Toez texts Reckful. [Reckful flips out on stream, but doesn't say anything to chat.](https://www.twitch.tv/reckful/v/83827386?t=5h17m40s) Toez confronts Mitch and Mira. Mitch asks Toez to delete the texts from Reckful's phone because he wants to tell Reckful he's back with Mira - he wants it to come from himself. While Mitch is in the bathroom, Mira tells Toez that Mitch is hers. 

Reckful does some thinking and realizes he doesn't want to be friends with someone who lies to his face. After hearing Forsen say Mitch was playing the fool to mess with Reckful, Reckful goes back and finds the stream where Mitch told/implied to chat that Reckful had secretly gone off to be with Blue. Reckful used to believe it was an accident, but now believes it might have been on purpose.

Today, Reckful says he's done with Mitch and being friends with streamers. Mitch tells his own viewers that he thinks Reckful is blowing it out of proportion and put Mitch in an awkward spot after the Twitter feud. He didn't want to tell Reckful he was seeing Mira because he wasn't sure how Reckful would take it. Reckful is surprised to hear this, as he told Mitch he would be okay if Mitch was upfront about it, the way Reckful was upfront about Blue. Mitch later claimed Mira's visit was unplanned and he didn't have much time to think about it, and overall he was emotionally confused.

Mitch and Reckful have a phone call on stream. Reckful reiterates he feels lied to and he can't trust Mitch. Mitch tells him he would never intentionally hurt Reckful like that and any misunderstanding was a joke, that he didn't lie to Reckful because he only withheld the truth from him. Mitch says Reckful put him in an awkward spot because he knew Reckful hated his girlfriend, and he hated how his best friend publicly insulted his girlfriend. They both argue the other one is a bad friend because of the above. 

They also get into an argument about Blue, where Mitch claims Reckful going off with Blue was similar to Mitch going off with Mira. Reckful denies it's similar, saying he always told Mitch about Blue. Reckful accuses Mitch of ruining Blue's life by accidentally mentioning the $30,000 car he gave Blue, but Mitch argues if anyone ruined Blue's life it was Reckful. Reckful steers the conversation away from Blue and they talk about the Mira drama some more, but nothing is really resolved. Mitch still feels like Reckful is blowing things out of proportion and Reckful still feels like Mitch betrayed him with Blue and Mira.

Mitch hangs up to get on a plane. Reckful says he's done."
4y2pzq,18,2016-08-16,Chapter 1 - getting to know you [f/m],room101s,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4y2pzq/chapter_1_getting_to_know_you_fm/,"Those eyes. Those beautiful, curious, searching hazel eyes looked at me from across the pillow. Andalucía shook her head, and smiled a smile that made my limbic system go into overdrive. “Damn, George” she said, in that heart-melting accent. “Damn”. I had to pinch myself to believe I was lying next to her in her little rented flat, her tousled hair not detracting from that elixir of life she exuded, her firm and perfect breasts rising with her deep breathing after the most pleasurable experience of my life up til that point. Who knew such a perfect girl could exist out there? I wasn’t prepared for the hold that this gorgeous young Aussie was going to have over me for the foreseeable future.

It all started innocently enough. Working in my profession, you get to meet a lot of people in and around the workplace. Doctors, nurses, therapists, clerical staff, patients, the world and their grandchildren flow through hospitals day in and day out. I had only been in healthcare a few years, but I had somehow made it to a level that I could be asked to go help out in emergency situations out of hours, so whenever I did a late shift or a night shift, I’d be on the resuscitation team as a helping hand. Lucy and I had worked on the same ward for a few weeks before we actually got around to meeting. She was a physiotherapist, dealing with getting trauma patients back to a sense of physical health and wellbeing from which they could start to live independently again after whichever ailment had struck them; I was in my second year as an intern, assigned to the team to cover basic problems and do the jobs that seniors didn’t want (nor need) to do. 

I like to think there had been a spark from the very first time our eyes had met; it was a sunny November morning, and the weekly team briefing was underway. I noticed this very pretty young therapist in a white polo shirt and navy combat trousers sitting opposite me in the meeting room, as the sun shone through the window onto her and highlighted her high cheekbones, slim figure, and caring, smiling face. I remember craning to look at her ID badge to sneak a glimpse of what her name might be, and failing. She impressed me, I recall, because despite her youthful looks she really had the bigger picture in mind for the patients she was looking after, and wasn’t afraid to speak her mind when colleagues suggested or asked for things she didn’t agree with. Our eyes met across the room – I couldn’t help but smile shyly and immediately look away from those bright globes beneath her sparkling glasses. 
Concentrate, damnit! 
I didn’t know if she smiled too – I was too shy to look back. Meeting over, we went our separate ways, I had some jobs left over from the morning rounds so headed for the notes trolley. A few minutes passed, and I noted she was heading my way! I flashed a smile at her – she smiled back; my heart skipped. 
Head down, look busy!
“Hi!” said that by now familiar, friendly voice, full of energy.
Gulp. She was talking to ME? That was one for the books. I was delighted! Perhaps overenthusiastically, I replied with a similar greeting, and rapidly explained how, embarrassingly, I had no idea what her name was. “Andalucía” she said. Rare, I thought to myself, but somehow sweet, fitting what I knew of her personality. Apparently her parents had always liked the name, having visited that region of Spain many years ago. I said I’d make an effort to remember that name, how it was really a lovely name indeed – and instantly realised how corny I was sounding. She reassured me, laughing a really appreciative laugh, the type that you can get addicted to very easily, and pointed out that a person’s name is the sound they are most attuned to and most like to hear. I admitted I had never thought of it that way. We chatted a bit, but as is always the case in hospitals, they are the world of unfinished conversations, and work pressures pulled us apart before we really got started. I decided to myself, however, that this serendipitous meet would by no means be the last, and the next time we collided on the ward a mutual decision for an after-work coffee was made into a plan.

Ah, those formative days. Once, twice, thrice, coffees and hot chocolates after work, over a period of many weeks. It was a perfect “getting to know you”; with a darker side, admittedly. I found out that Andalucía (her friends back home called her Lucy) was in the middle of a deep dispute with Donald, her long-distance boyfriend out in South Africa, who was a career-driven civil engineer. They had talked about her moving to join him out there, but there just wasn’t the same demand for her specialism out there versus his, and this was a huge hurdle. I myself was in a bit of a turmoil, relationship-wise, having been in a long-term relationship for nearly three years with Sarah, a counsellor, one month my senior. Despite cohabiting and being very close to each other’s families, there was some undertone of dissatisfaction and a feeling of being trapped. 

Maybe it was pushing it too far from the beginning, maybe it was fate, but Lucy and I sought ever increasing solace in each other and confided more and more in each other. It brought us closer together. We first hugged after coffee number four; I had wanted to hold her close for the last two encounters but respectfully we’d kept on opposite sides of the coffee table, until then. We were talking about her future, her relationship, her career and the pressures to stay abroad, stay away from Donald, move with him, move back home; and she welled up. Not crocodile tears, but welled up, trying to hide her shame of being emotional. I couldn’t stand it any longer, and simply reached out and held her hand across the table, and stupidly asked for permission to sit aside her and give her a hug! Of course, she said yes. 

I don’t know when it started to happen, but one morning I was driving into work and realised that only one sound was running through my mind. Lucy. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy. I shook it off, incredulous. It can’t possibly be…

Fast-forward to the end of month pay-day party. Sarah and I went, and chatted with many of my colleagues who were there for free drinks and a debrief after another hard month’s graft; I had been very sneaky and suggested that Lucy come along too, though not by my invitation of course, and hadn’t expected her to come along at all. So it was much to my surprise and indeed, somewhat to my horror that she was suddenly there at the door! If my heart had skipped a beat the first time she talked to me, it was in my mouth now! I caught a scathing sideways glance from Sarah; I guess I couldn’t hide my body language. Lucy was looking amazing. Her slim figure, though she was only 5”2’, was complemented perfectly by a beautiful grey dress. Her shoulder-length golden hair was in a bob, something I hadn’t seen before due to ponytails being the norm at work, and she’d ditched glasses for contact lenses. She looked fantastic, the dress highlighted her figure nicely. For the first time I realised she was actually quite athletic, moreso than me, I judged, and very pretty. She waved at me and bounded over, and before I knew it we were in a quick hug, before introductions had to take place. Sarah was wary. I couldn’t blame her. 

Lucy and I didn’t spend much time talking in the early parts of the gathering; we each had our own friends to hang out with, but as the evening wore down I headed upstairs to find the restroom and there she was, waiting by the rooftop terrace door. Our eyes locked, lingered. My mouth opened slightly, smiling at her. I went over to her. She flung her arms around me, taking me totally by surprise. “Hey”, she said into my ear. “You OK?”. I nodded, nervously, “I am now”. I sighed. I could feel her breath against my ear. How I wanted more than this hug. I could feel her firm body pressed up against mine for what felt like a lifetime; I didn’t know whether I should or not, but I savoured every texture, every bump, every motion, wanting it to last forever. I didn’t know how she felt about me up til then. I hadn’t dared tell her I liked her, I hadn’t dared consider the truth myself. But now here we were, alone on a rooftop threshold, and locked in a loose embrace. Her arms still around my shoulders, I let my hands wander a bit. Down her back, feeling that material clinging to her figure as she whispered “it’s good to see you” in my ear. I wanted to kiss her there and then, to look into her intoxicating eyes and tell her everything. But I didn’t, I didn’t dare. I remember feeling her side as my hands gently caressed her, and I thought how wonderful she felt to touch. It was all over too soon though, as someone approached the door, and suddenly Lucy was gone, out into the night air, to find the friend she’d arrived with…"

I have been working at another job before, during, and after this internship. However, I believe the accounting internship probably has stronger bullet points and is more relevant to my resume than my current work. This is not to say that my current work is not very relevant, I just think that the internship is a little stronger.

Linked below are my resume as well as the section that I have come up with for my accounting internship, and any suggestions as to where to put this experience would be greatly appreciated. Also, any criticism of any parts of my resume, be they bullet points, layout, etc. would be greatly appreciated!

4y2u03,35,2016-08-16,Full-time offer frustration,Microsoftee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4y2u03/fulltime_offer_frustration/,"Hi, I was hoping to get some advice on a return offer I received recently. 

I interned at Microsoft this summer and received a full-time offer. Microsoft gives interns a two week deadline for these offers unless you attend a school that ""requires"" companies to follow NACE recruiting guidelines. This gives some interns until November 30th to decide (see: https://beam.stanford.edu/about-us/guidelines). A surprising amount of schools have this policy. My school simply ""recommends"" that companies follow them so I am only given two weeks.

This is the definition of an exploding offer and I've spoken with my recruiter many times about getting it extended. Microsoft recruiting will not budge, saying that ""we start recruiting right away and need to know our numbers come fall so we aren't recruiting for positions that do not exist"". This seems reasonable until you remember all of the interns that get special treatment because of the school they attend. For me, I live on the east side of the US, and two weeks to decide if I want to make a cross-country move to Seattle is too short for such a big decision. 

I worked really hard this summer so my manager is completely open to giving me more time to decide. She has expressed how much they want me to come back and has requested that I be given a longer deadline, but HR turned her down as well. 

I really enjoyed my time there. The people were awesome and my team was great. My hesitation to join is that the work did not interest me and it is very far from home. Because of this, I wanted to explore other companies and the possibility of someplace else being an even better fit. I don't want to make a decision I'll regret in a month, but recruiting is denying me that.

Any advice?"

I have been paying attention in every class, though, and am maintaining a 3.3 GPA.

My dad (network engineer) asked me a bunch of questions relating to IT, and I couldn't give him a solid response to any of them.  This truly opened my eyes to the fact that employers in this field do not care about your degree nearly as much as they care about actual knowledge. 

Do you fellas have any ideas as to where I can really start to ""learn"" computer engineering?  I've built a computer, and that's about as far as I go.  Thanks in advance, guys.

I'm worried about not being able to find a job when I graduate next year due to a lack of experience. I'm starting my last year of college next week. I have one internship (manufacturing) under my belt, but it isn't all that related to my major (electrical engineering, emphasis in power systems). You'd think that electrical engineering has a ton of opportunities, but it really doesn't. I've been turned down from 6-7 internships in the past couple of months, 4 of which I've interviewed for, two of those were at the same company (different departments). I can't seem to find a common thread among them as to why I was turned down, other than a lack of experience (Catch 22 anyone?).

I'm still completely dependent on my parents. It's extremely embarrassing at my age (21). This has caused me to become very self conscious; I feel like everyone's judging me for not having a job. My girlfriend is very supportive and, for the time being, doesn't seem to mind my financial situation.

I would kind of like to change my major to computer science, but I just can't afford another ~2 years of school. I could learn independently, but that doesn't hold the same credibility as a degree.

I guess I just need some coping advice. I would ask for tips for landing a job but I don't think this is the right subreddit for that. I have days where I feel like I can do anything, and that everything will work out eventually. Then I have days where I can't focus on anything except the fact that I'm behind my peers. Everyone will be coming back to school fresh off of their internships, except me, and I'm terrified how I will be perceived by my classmates.

Anyway, thanks for reading my vent"

I've been working as a project manager for a fairly large project at a very large company and I'd just like to start by saying I've had absolutely no prior experience. When I applied for the job, I thought it was initially more tech related, coding, etc. But it seemed like they were running out of project managers and put me on a semi-large project that was a month behind schedule as the IT PM.

Now I was able to get the project through a couple of stages, but ultimately won't make go-live date due to several factors out of my control and just the sheer complexity of the project. Things such as countless vacations from my team, developer, business manager, etc, they all went on vacation practically leaving me alone to do alot of the requirements and also just the complexity of the technicals. The enterprise architect even has trouble finding a solution, and my program manager somehow expects me to be able to solve it (???). 

We're at the stage where we will now start development, but I was able to get the project through stages such as initial design and requirements and now I am going to hand it off to my manager in 2 days but he's now berating me about why things did not happen or why things happened the way it did. I tried explaining that people went on vacations, things were complex and no one was there to help me understand what to do very well but it doesn't seem like he understands the difficulties I had to face alone for this project. Constant no replies, etc, etc. He wasn't involved in the project until his manager told him to take over (and his manager is the current program manager for the project). 

He made me feel extremely shitty about myself even though I was able to take the project out of the gutter and get it all the way to development. But just unfortunate that peoples schedules didn't cohere but I was still to blame for the delays and why I didn't forsee these. I admit it was hard for me to navigate through nearly half my team being on vacation and just how complex it was, so I apologized to him and said it was something i now learned the hard way. He just seemed to brush it off and told me how its not ok to do this and that and now to learn from that. 

I just had a terrible experience receiving almost no help project managing a very complex project as an intern, yet other interns here were able to proudly say what they've done on their own projects which were substantially more simple than mine. It just makes me feel shitty and worthless. I've learned so much, but i feel as though there expectations of me, I just could not meet even though I tried my best. 

 I don't think I'll get a good evaluation, but I don't plan on working in this company again, would this somehow affect my future internship options or even possibly after graduation a job at other companies? I definitely do want to put this on my resume, but it makes me feel uneasy knowing I might get a bad evaluation and other companies would dig deep down."
4y3lxb,3,2016-08-16,How should I feel about this?,itcando,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4y3lxb/how_should_i_feel_about_this/,"On a beginning note, I would say am relatively inexperienced in relationships. I have been with both girls and guys, I have only really had sex with guys. And all of the guys I have been with were just hookups that I found on grindr, so for me they never went further than being one-timers. I didn't make it more than that and neither did they, so there were no other feelings other than mutual benefit of getting laid. But now I think that is no longer the case and it is making feel nothing other than sadness.

*As warning this is going to long... If you don't want to read this, there is a TLDR at the bottom.*

&amp;nbsp;


But to give some back story. I meet this guy a couple of months ago at the internship I am working at currently. ( The internship was only for a few months since I have to go back to school in the fall.) At first, were didn’t really talk all that much, but if we did it was mostly in passing since we had different responsibilities and we sat a completely different places since I was new to work. As the month went on, due to a lot of shifting because of politics at the job, people leaving and being hired. Eventually he was moved right next to me (because of politics). We started talking more because we had nothing better to do with ourselves (we still got work done of course) but it was done mostly in order to pass time, and partly because he is a social butterfly who loves talking. Because of that, I started learning more and more about him and we got to know each better. 

&amp;nbsp;

A couple weeks went by and I eventually let him know that I had feelings for him since I knew I did have much time left before I had to leave for school. The day after we arranged to meet up to and hangout for the day. But since I live with family, we meet at his house and things gotten a little bit closer between us and it became a lot more sexual. The next day, we went another date with friends and afterwards we had sex.

&amp;nbsp;

However, the next day at work he started giving me the virtual cold shoulder as if something was very wrong and he need to distance himself from me. I know we had to keep things professional since we work at the same place but still, I did not expect that. I didn’t really start realizing something was wrong until he also stopped replying to the text I was sending him. And after getting frustrated with him for not responding, I texted him asking if I had got the wrong idea about the relationship we had and asked him to explain what our relationship meant to him. And as expected, he did not text me back, so I had asked him about it at work. He told me that he saw the text, but his roommate were hounding him for more information as to why I was staying so late at his apartment (his roommate’s mom works were we work at and they have loose lips), so he lied and told them that I just needed somewhere to stay for the weekend. So then he suggested that we just remain friends for now in order to not create problems at work for him and with my family. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now I did expect this, I knew am leaving soon and I want to keep my personal business away from my family since if one person knows everyone knows. But it didn’t cease to make me sad and somewhat depressed for the rest of the day. Since I had really wanted to be with him and that I was really, really enjoying me time with him. So fast forward to now, I’m leaving in the next few days and I don’t really want to leave. Because I feel like at the rate thing are going, when I leave he is going to move on with his life, and I’m just going to be stuck depressed and emotionally regressed, hopeful of what it could have been.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So my question to you guys is: should I move on with my life by essentially cutting all contact with him to reduce my pain or should I keep in contact with him in hopes that eventually we might meet up again in the future that might not happen?  Is there any in between? Although would also like to point out, he doesn’t really respond to my text, but he is willing to strike up a long, deep conversation in person as long as I am willing to facilitate the conversation. In the same way we talked before we had sex. Which is confusing me even more because I don’t know if he seriously wants this to continue or if he doesn’t. What do you guys think?

&amp;nbsp;

*TLDR: I meet a guy at work. Over the months I got to know him better. Eventually we had sex but afterwards he stops responding to my text because of work, my family, and the lack of time before I leave. But his is still giving me mix messages. And now I am sad and confused as to what I should do now at this point.

I have used python in the past for data manipulation and analysis at my 2nd and 3rd year internships. Fortunately, the data I have worked with at my internships was simple to gather(retrieved it from a database) and was well-formatted. Unfortunately, data on cricket will be difficult to retrieve and probably even more difficult to process.

**Project**: I want to write a program which should help me gather data on cricket and then analyze the data. My current source for the data is [data](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html!). The problem with this source of data is that if I want to retrieve stats, I have to manually enter the filters I need to retrieve the stats I want. What I have noticed is that the url changes as soon as I add or remove a filter. An example of a search is the following url: http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;orderby=start;page=2;spanmin1=15+Mar+2005;spanval1=span;team=7;template=results;type=team;view=innings
and so my approach is as follows:


**Solution**:
I will create a class for searching, call it StatsGuruSearch. The class will be initialized through the filters I need for a particular search. I can then define a search function which will take the base url, concatenates the filters I require and return a pandas dataframe with the statistics I require. I believe I can do this through the pandas.read_html() function. 

In any event, that is what I am thinking. Furthermore, I am wondering if this is a good approach the solve the problem I have? Are there any libraries I should be aware of that could make this an easier problem to solve? All input is highly appreciated!"

Every link will be required to have flair, similar to /r/askscience. 

This will make it easier to sort by the categories that interest you. Please provide some feedback regarding the proposed flair categories, color schemes, and your thoughts on whether this will be an improvement. The following is an initial list of categories:

* Case Study
* Startup Help
* How Do I ?
* Operations
* Internship Offers
* Best Practices
* How to Grow
* Feedback Please
* AMA
* Tools
* Investments
* Investor Wanted
* Other

Here's the color scheme http://imgur.com/a/3zza3 (which was borrowed from /r/askscience). Similarly we will have filterable tags on the sidebar, so you could display only certain categories. 

If you have thoughts on user flair, in addition to post flair, please provide those as well. I have tagged some of the top posts with flair to make it more apparent what it would look like. 

Also credit /u/BigSlowTarget for leading this effort.

Update 8/19/2016:

So so far it looks like the community:

* Doesn't support mandatory flair.
* Doesn't like the color schemes.
* Consensus is that there are too many categories.

I will be updating the flair to have 1 black and white color [Done]. 
We will not require flair on new posts. 
We will see how we can consolidate the list (for optional flair).

Intended Major: Computer Science

Academics:

ACT: plan to take

Coursework: AP Physics 1, AP Computer Science AB, Honors geometry, honors alg2, honors pre calc, and next semester, AP Lit, AP Stats, 1 unknown AP class.


Extracurriculars: 3 years varsity tennis, 3 years NHS member, 1.5 - 2 years paid software development internship at local company, ~40 hrs volunteering at local art museum (going to get some more hours in this year too).


School: UW Madison is my top choice, I think my application gives me a decent chance, but I can't help but feeling I'm teetering on the edge.  I do have legacy application or whatever it's called (Dad did undergrad at madison and Grandpa is a retired UW professor) if that makes any difference.

Failing UW Madison, I'm also interested in UW Seattle and maybe UBC but I haven't looked into that one too much.

Question: would you guys recommend that I do regular decision or would early action be good to go for?  I'm pretty excited to apply so I'm really tempted to go EA, but I feel like taking one more semester where I really kick it down for the last stretch would give my application a good boost (particularly in the GPA area).  If I do apply for EA and I get deferred and have to reapply at the RD deadline, does that hurt my chances more than if I just did RD?

Hate to sound like a petty teenager but that is what it has come down to. I am 20 years old (female) going to university, living in Illinois. I am moving in with my boyfriends house and need advice on how I should go about it. I have a couple questions, would appreciate it if I got everyone's input. 

How do I go about making his mom my legal guardian.
Can his mom sign me as a dependent on her taxes if she will be provided most of the income regarding housing and food expenses.
In Illinois, what is the age one must be to declare themselves financially independent. (Will need this for university)
Any advice on running away in general and how to be financially independent. 

This is very sudden and have never thought myself to ever be in this situation. Nonetheless, making a reddit post on running away. I appreciate any of your advice. I am a novice when it comes to finances so please throw anything you have at me. 

Thank you all very much. 

Update: Thank you all for the great advice. Many of you gave some really good feedback. As of now I have set up an appointment with the campus advocacy group to discuss my case and hopefully may qualify so there can be some negotiation with financial aid and housing. For now I have decided to stay with my parents despite the conflicts at home. I realize that if I were to move out I would take a big financial hit as my only source of income comes from internships I take over the summer (income: &lt; $5000). Time to be frugal as hell. There is also always the option of taking out loans to pay off schooling since I am provided a substantial amount of financial aid from FAFSA. 

I'm grateful to those that pointed out and reminded me that I am an adult, not a child. This is all very new and scary to me since I have been dependent to my parents all my life.

My boyfriend talked to his parents about the situation and for now we agree that it is best to lay low in hopes that my parents will calm down while I gain time to make more income. 

I believe that despite the circumstances I can get through this. I have been blessed with the support from many people. Thanks to everyone's advice I think I have some course of action to follow now. Hopefully, within the next year I can move out full fledged with a decent financial plan set.

4y4geb,0,2016-08-17,Gut feeling or going crazy #relationship #depression #girlfriend,McCoy17,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4y4geb/gut_feeling_or_going_crazy_relationship/,"This is going to be a long post. And it is going to be a little convoluted as my thoughts these days are. I apologize for the long post

I am 30+ now. I am discussing 2 cases of my gut feelings first and then I am posting my current situation. I usually trust my gut feeling. I know the times when it has been right but I may have been wrong many times too.


**Case #1**
I had my first girlfriend when I was 16. We were together for 2 years before we broke up. She was the most desired girl in our school. She was beautiful and the most proper girl. She was one of our teacher’s daughter. There were many guys who liked her. One of my best friends was in love with her too (that love that happens at 16). He was my best friend and I did not have any problems with his feelings for my girlfriend. We were good kids. Towards the end of the second year, I started feeling something strange. My girlfriend did not act weird but I somehow knew something was up #gutFeeling.


I took my time and did not jump on any conclusions. I observed the situation for a while. One time my gf mentioned something like she was obsessed with  knowing more about my best friend. And then one night, I was at my best friend’s place who lived like a block away from girl friend’s house. I strategically asked him what was going on. He told me that he and my gf had been talking over the phone for hours for a while. And she asked him not to tell me about it. I guessed the reason could be that I would get jealous. (But I was cool enough for 2 years with my best friend being in love with my gf).
They were not sleeping together. They were not having any thing intimate. But their conversations behind my back for hours… I could not comprehend that. So I talked to my gf and asked coolly what was going on. She admitted that she asked my best friend not to disclose this to me that they were talking that much over the phone. After that, we took a break from our relationship and ended up breaking up.


My reason for the break up was that my trust was broken. Even though, they did not do anything wrong, but the way they did it, seemed wrong to me. I was fine knowing my best friend was in love with my gf and I was cool with that; they could have told me that they were talking over the phone. Point #1 - my gut feeling told me that something was up and it was.



**Case #2**
Fast forward - 
My second long-term relationship which lasted for 2 years too, when I was 28. Between high school and now, I had short-term relationships but nothing serious. So we were having dinner at a place and my now gf’s 2 friends were sitting next to us. They were a part of some fraternity together at school. Something seemed off. After the dinner, while walking home, I asked her what was the deal with one of the guys. He looked a bit turned off or weird. She got a little scared. She was very sweet. She told me honestly that she had slept with that guy - one night stand. It was a torture for me in the coming weeks and months thinking about that. We broke up around an year after that because of many other reasons. 
Point #2 - my gut feeling told me that something was up that night

Then I was dating some girls during last 2-3 years. Most of them lasted from a few weeks to a month or so. Yes, I have some commitment problems but I think some things that happened in my life play a role in that.


**Current situation:**
6 months ago, I met this girl. And in about a month and a half we became bf and gf. 4 months were really great. She is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. We were looking at some pictures and she told me about this guy that was her best friend. let;s call my gf - Melanie, her best friend Josh and one of her girl best friend - Katie. All the pictures had 3 of them. Melanie (gf), Josh(the guy) and Katie. 
And she told me that people in her cohort/course at one time thought that Josh and my gf were going on together (interested in each other or in relationship - not sure)
I did not think about it twice. Because I myself had 2 female friends who I would hang out the whole time and people thought I had something with them.

*Location - Some birthday party * - So this guy, Josh, started seeing a girl in their cohort/class only. It is Josh’s gf’s bday My girlfriend invites me to the party and I meet many of her friends. Me and Josh have small conversation there. Everything good.

*Another party* my gf invited me to which I could not go to.

*Another party* - this time at Katie’s bf’s place.. Here this girl comes who is now Josh’s gf. Josh did not come to the party. We are playing card games and these 3 girls (my gf, Josh’s gf, katie) are talking about Josh. Josh’s gf says something and my gf says something like “oh.. isn’t he (Josh) so cute?”. My gf said this in a tone that did not seem right. And Josh’s gf got a little uncomfortable. But I was like obviously my gf Melanie has been Josh’s best friend for 2 years now and this Josh’s gf is pretty new. So my gf is kind of territorial. But she seemed like a different person, just for a second. 
I let this go because my gf is really sweet.  


*Graduation*… she just finished her master’s program. I go to the graduation. I meet my gf’s family. They are nice people. Josh has been to their place once. My gf took Josh and Katie once to her place which is 4 hours away. My gf and her mom are really fond of Josh which I don’t have problems with but the way they were treating him there.. I don’t know.


Now she is to move back to her hometown for an internship. So I help her pack up stuff and move to storage. After the storage was stuff done, I ask her about Josh while driving. If they were together or liked each other. She is a bit cautious and says that there were never any feelings like that. I asked her if her parents mentioned that her and Josh should get together. She said “may be”
This conversation did not sound very convincing. But she never lies.


She drives back the next day. We miss each other. Now Josh has a party planned. My gf wants to come. She has moved back to her town and wants to drive 4 hours for a 2 hour party. At this point, I am starting to be a little suspicious.


Her car breaks down. She does not have much money but she is ready to rent the car for a day and come to the party. I am not invited. Turns out he invited just my gf, katie and another friend who was in the group project. My gf did not even mention if i was invited or not. When I ask her if she would stay the night at my place after the party, she is like “i don’t know.. let me figure out the car scenario”


She is a bit reluctant. Obviously I get drunk and i tell her that I would really like if she comes over. She does come over and stays the night. I ask her about the party and she said it went fine. I asked who all came. She told me it was a family party. Only herself and other girl from their class was there. And what about Katie? My gf says she did not come. She is not that close to Josh. 
Katie lives in the same city and she did not go to the party. My gf drove 4 hours to be at Josh’s party. Until now I thought all 3 of them were pretty close and now I am learning that Katie is not that close to Josh.


Everything is cool except that now all these pieces are coming together. 

First of all - She is the sweetest. She never lies. Not even a small lie. But why am i not trusting her?


After that weekend, I was getting sick to my stomach. My gut feeling was telling me something is up. My best guess was  that she liked him in the beginning and they ended up being friends. I do not have any problems with that if she was interested in someone or slept with someone (except one night stands.. sorry.. I am that kind of a guy who has problem with that) but to me seemed like she kind of still likes him in a way and admires him. It seemed the same as my first gf when i was 17 liked my best friend.


I still would not have that much problem but the guy.. Josh has internship in her city. After she completes her 3 months and move to my city, Josh is going to her city and stay for 3 months with her family. If she still likes her in some way other than a friend and her family likes him too, i would have a problem with that. And he is going to stay in the room where she is staying and where I stay with her when I go. which kind of freaks me out. I don’t know if I ll be able to sleep in that bed again.


So after the Josh’s party weekend, I started getting sick to my stomach. I could not sleep. I was like a zombie at work for 10 days. People know me as a guy who is always talking and chatting and happy but now they were coming and asking what was wrong with me.


I could not take it anymore. I called her and  talk about Josh. I knew this was not the right approach if I wanted to get to the bottom of the matter but i was so sick that I was going crazy. My stomach was churning and I was getting sick so much. She said that I was sabotaging stuff by imagining things. The way she handled the conversation was very mature and I realized things were fine and nothing was wrong. 


But every now and then that feeling comes. All those scenes keep playing in front of my eyes. I can’t shake the feeling off. I know something is wrong but what do i do. What if there is nothing wrong and I am imagining stuff?


Disclaimer - I have depression too but until now I had not seen any therapist. 

This was the last straw. I have seen 3 different therapists in the last 2 months. 


Am I imagining stuff because I am depressed or is my gut feeling right? 
I don’t have any problems with her past but if she still has something for him.. I would not like that. I would rather walk away. Also, the guy staying at her place for 3 months kind of keeps bothering me.

My whole life has changed in the last 3 months. I feel like I am going crazy. I am happy when I am with her over the weekends but the weekdays are hell. My work is suffering too.

* Does she really have something for him? How do i find that? because I have already talked to her about this once and it was a tough conversation. I don’t want to be seen as an insecure guy (may be I am but for some solid reasons). Also, my gut feeling is strong. And looking at the last 2 cases and many other non-relationship instances, I really trust my gut feeling. But how do i find out? I feel like I can’t live with or without her. I have not been happy in months. I am more depressed than ever and considering taking SSRIs and seeing multiple therapists
* Am I really an insecure bastard who is depressed and imagining things? Am I crazy? 

I know most of you guys will say, chill and be happy for what you have got. But trust me, when I can’t sleep and my mind can’t stop thinking and I am exhausted all the time. And the depression becomes too much that I get suicidal thoughts all the time and I cry. Am I really crazy?


On one hand, I love this girl so much and I could not have asked for more. On the other hand, I feel like I am going crazy because of this relationship.
And because of this, my depression is getting real bad. And she knows about and still loves me.

I am not sure what to do.

Thank you for reading such a long post. I apologize.

I'm currently doing a PhD thesis in computer science and applied mathematics. I started almost a year and a half ago and I now want to quit.

Before that I worked in a private company after my master's final year internship for a bit more than two years and left because I wanted to discover what research was about from the inside and also because I thought a PhD would be a nice way to find a job out of France where I now work.

The pros are mainly my great working conditions: a brand new computer, a not-that-small room to work in, people to talk to about anything (work or not) and no one to care if I decide to come late or leave early.
The cons are the really low pay compare to my previous job (I needed to ask money to my family in order to pay the rent), my close-to-absolute disinterest to the state of the art (I really don't like to read clear or obscure papers), three of my four supervisors that only agree on the fact that they disagree and the fact that I now know that we'll never have enough data to prove that our work worth the time and energy implied in the researches.
Every single presentation or meeting keeps me away from sleep and I event dream of this work almost every night.

Hoping to get an MA down the line as well, any advice there too?",NickFortuna,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4y4ru8/whats_the_best_way_to_find_a_job_in_the/,"Tl;dr: I have to leave home and lose my financial support by the end of November. I'm 23 and just about to finish my final college thesis in the Philippines. My goal is to get an MA related to development or Sociology, hopefully at a good western university. I was born in the US and have citizenship, but grew up in the Philippines and don't have much in the way of connections there, but I want to know if my best option might be to look there for work. Specific questions at the end of this post.

Long version: So after some recent family troubles, my parents and I agreed that it's best for me to move out of home, and they're cutting off financial support too. I'm not sure on the specifics of that but I'll just assume the worst and plan for no support at all. I'm 23, which might seem late to some of you, but it's actually pretty early here. People in the Philippines might not move out of home until they get married and some can rely on financial support for a while.

I kind of built my expectations around getting support. I want an MA related to development or Sociology or something like that, and was planning until after the MA to prioritize work that's more oriented towards others and looks good on a cv rather than something that necessarily pays well right away. I come from a top university here (Ateneo de Manila), but it's still from the Philippines, and I have dead average grades (about 2.7 out of 4). As far as I'm aware, I need good work experience (among other things) to make up for that if I want to get in to a good program abroad.

I realize that having a plan like that is a luxury and I'd be lying if I said that maintaining my privileged lifestyle isn't a motivator for me here, which I'm not too happy with. But if it helps, just think of it as me trying to do the best I can with the resources I have, in pursuit of my goals that I don't want to give up on, and hopefully motivated by a genuine concern for helping make the world a better place. 

I'm a US citizen but grew up in the Philippines. I have no idea how student loans there work, or what the job market is like. I've got some friends and family there, but no one in my field. I don't know if looking for work there or here is the better option for me. I'll be looking for work here, as well, though.

At the moment, I've got a potential internship lined up from before all this happened, at the office of the vice president which I know will work wonders for my growth and network, but there's not too much money in the job either, even for the people I know working there full time. I don't even know if it'll be a paid internship, since that wasn't my concern in inquiring about it at the time. Beyond that, if it even pushes through, I have no specific plans yet.

I decided late in college that what I wanted to do in life was some kind of development work, so I took development studies as a second degree after my first in business management, and pushed my self to a fifth year of undergraduate studies for it. I fell behind in that fifth year, failed to finish my thesis on time, and am now in my sixth, working on just finishing my thesis, which should be done by around September. Falling behind, along with some family problems at home, got me to seek out professional counseling, and then a psychiatrist, which led to me getting diagnosed with ADHD and getting the appropriate medicine/coping strategies for working with that. Each of those things were a massive help, both to my family situation and my academic performance, and things got better for a while, but here I am, with my parents wanting me out and a lot of emotional volatility all around.

I recognize that in the grand scheme of things, my situation's not that rough. I've got a degree with a second one incoming despite all my screw-ups, I grew up with my country's elites as schoolmates and friends so I was pretty much handed a great network through no merit of my own, and I had the space to focus on extra curricular work in college instead of worrying about earning for my tuition. But I'll put aside my pride and say I know I can still fuck this up. This sudden change in my situation throws a wrench in all my plans, so I'll take all the help that I can get.

Sorry if that's all a bit long and melodramatic, writing this up has also been a bit of a venting experience for me, but here are the key things I need advice on:

-finding work in the US

-financial considerations with moving to and living in the US

-saving up and paying for for an MA degree

-maximizing my chances of getting some sort of scholarship for an MA degree

Along the way, I'll have to worry about rent, food, transportation, utilities, medication for my ADHD, and hopefully have enough left over for some leisure.

I originally posted this on r/personalfinance and a mod suggested this sub might be a better fit. Seems about right to me but I'm not a regular here, so just let me know if this isn't the best place and I'll cooperate :)"
4y523n,206,2016-08-17,My (30M) in-laws are guilt-tripping my wife (28F) to financially support them and it can't continue,inlawdramarama21,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4y523n/my_30m_inlaws_are_guilttripping_my_wife_28f_to/,"Sorry for the throwaway, my wife knows my reddit account and though she doesn't come on here often, I can't have this in my history...

So, some background; My wife (28F) is the eldest of four children (25F, 21F, 19M) of a family who have been largely financially dependent on her for the last 8 years. Her parents have moved out of the country to start a trucking business in the country of their birth. We got married last November after 1.5 years of dating and she moved out of the 2-bedroom flat with her siblings to come live with me, closer to the city (3 bedroom house). 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Her parents have never been fantastically good with money and she's had to help provide with rent and bills for the longest time (the dad isn't great with the mom and isn't a go-getting breadwinner, which is another layer for another day). We've just completed buying the 3-bedroom house I've been renting and in addition to paying this mortgage, we would like to think about starting a family in less than two years time so I want to step up our financial planning...which has been poor/non-existent up until now. Since we got married in November and she moved out of the 2 bedroom flat, my wife had still been paying the bills (water, gas, internet, cable) and contributing to the rent of the flat her siblings live in. By ""contributing"" I mean not paying it all as her 25F sister is working and her parents try chipping in when they could, but the bulk is still from her. To be honest, I buried my head in the sand a little bit with regards to details as it caused us many arguments and I loved my wife more than I cared about the money.   
&amp;nbsp;


The 19M brother is in college and has two years left. The 21F sister has moved away to the same country as her parents to do work experience with a big law firm and hopes to come back later in September. She doesn't yet have a job lined up for when she comes back and wasn't making a lot of money as an intern. The 25F sister has a main passion for acting but hasn't been close to realizing that dream yet and works as an administrator in a tech company. She's not making fantastic money at the moment. She is also chronically bad with money even though she eats out at restaurants quite frequently and has a fancy ipad on an expensive contract. Anyway, my wife and I both make decent money (upwards of $52k/year each) and my wife has just started a job that's now paying a bit more, but we don't lead an extravagant life. Our wedding was expensive and we have college debts to pay and live in an expensive city which means we are just about comfortable. My wife and I used to argue A LOT about bills and money as I always stressed it wasn't sensible us paying rent+bills on two places and I was scared about how long this behavior would go on for. We went to counselling and worked through our challenges (I had behavior to correct, /r/relationships helped me before) and all together, we got through it, have been a better husband/wife and she ultimately let her family know there were going to be changes.   

&amp;nbsp;

About 4 weeks ago, she let her family know she could no longer help out 100% and the guilt tripping has slowly started. The rent contract on the old 2-bedroom flat was expiring and my wife said she was not putting herself on the new contract or helping pay for bills as much etc. The funny thing is given our financial position and the reality of the situation, we almost would certainly have to still help them out but I got her to realize that she had to start letting her siblings start taking initiative and start letting them accept responsibility...and live lifestyles that matched their reality.
  
&amp;nbsp;


The current flat contract ends in middle of September. Her two sisters are unlikely to pass the financial assessment from the rental company to secure the new contract and almost certainly will have to find somewhere else to live. They haven't started this process yet. We are even open to them staying with us for a while, but I think pride will get in the way and they won't want to. My wife spoke to her 25F sister to encourage her that she and the 21F sister had to start thinking properly about what to do and the 25F sister blew up in my wife's face and told my wife to sort this out...and that it wasn't her (25F) responsibility. This is really stressing out my wife who isn't a fan of confrontation and I'm worried she'll begin to feel guilty and make promises about helping them out when we can't sustainability keep living like that. 
  
&amp;nbsp;
R/Relationships How do I support my wife in this situation? What kind of things and approaches do you think will work with her family who have a small sense of entitlement and lack of forward financial planning to deal with these things. I saw this stuff coming a mile away and my wife and I would get into fights whenever I bought it up and she wanted to ignore it. We no longer can and my wife is starting to stand up to it. But after the 25F sister blew up in my wife's face and rejected responsibility. The mother has now called my wife and whilst I'm not entirely sure what conversation took place, I know the guilting is only going to ramp up. What do I do?!?
  
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;



**Update 1:** Thanks for all the responses. I took many of the good points and my wife and I have spoken about this a couple of times since. The first time I spoke to her, I thought it went really well and she got that she was doing the right thing and she listened to me. She spoke to her mother who asked her to be sensitive to 25F and let her get used to the changes. My wife slowly began to realise the best thing to do would be to not say anything any further and let her sister(s) sort it out by herself even if it meant the agreement expired and she was being kicked out. Progress! ....or so I thought... Later that evening, we were really close together lying down and her 21F sister messaged her. Now, I overheard a conversation earlier in the week where 21F sister said she has maxed her overdraft limit and my wife advised her to get into a payment arrangement with the bank. That was a phone conversation, this was now a text following up... My wife opened the message and because we were so close (and we're generally open with our phones) I could see... it basically said ""As you know I'm on overdraft and need to make $50 minimum payment to maintain overdraft credit... Can you please send me $50 so I can pay the first one"". My wife replied straight away with a thumbs up, we didn't talk about it before she sent the message. I didn't say anything there and then.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
Later that evening, I bought up the fact I could be the fall-guy and she could tell her family I was the one saying ""no"" to things... and she said no, that would make things worse. Her reasoning was that her family feel shame for having to ask her, and they know we discuss everything anyway, so there's no point of explicitly saying I have an input in the decision as saying so would inflame the situation. I argued otherwise, but she kept begging me to trust her judgement. I spoke about boundaries and how she was putting the pride of her family above the status of us as a unit. She didn't agree and said they are transitioning to understanding she's separate from their househole and I should be patient with everything. I told her my beef with the 21F sister $50 agreement was that it wasn't a small one off payment, which we agreed we never really have to tell the other person about, but that she's now entered into a vague contract with her sister. She gets she needs to be harder but shes asked me to trust her judgement. I'm even more confused about how to go about things now. 
  
&amp;nbsp;

  **tl;dr**: Wife has helped her siblings (25F, 21F, 19M) with bills and rent for the last 2 years. Since we moved in together and got married Nov 2015, she still has and it's caused arguments.

4y5kl2,0,2016-08-17,Me [23M] with my GF [28F] of ~8 months having serious conflict after discussing partner count,4nn1h1l4tor,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4y5kl2/me_23m_with_my_gf_28f_of_8_months_having_serious/,"Quick background: My gf and I got together last year at a party of a mutual friend which ended with her taking me home with her. She was still in a relationship with her long time boyfriend at the time which I only found out once we were at her house. We have met before that and have been extremely attracted to each other ever since. She is currently doing an internship in another European country - we have managed to see each other somewhat regularly but she is very unhappy with her current situation as she is missing home, friends, her dog etc.

Things were going great for the most part and we were planning on moving in together after her internship. She will be back in October. Last weekend we both met for her sister's birthday in another town in my country. As we played a drinking game, the topic of former partners came up to which her (younger sister, just turned 22) responded something along the lines of ""People probably should not know that about me"".

Long story short: That got me thinking. I later told my gf that I was wondering about her count (which we had talked about before briefly but not too detailed). She said she would tell me if i really wanted to know so she told me that she had been with 10 people before me, 5 of which were ONS.

Now, do not get me wrong. These numbers are not necessarily a big deal per sé. I know that they are not particularly high. What bothers me about it are a few things:

1. She has lied about it before. Not straightup lied, but she simply could not provide a number last time (while I could, with mine being 10/11 including her which I told her instantly and which is true). She was thinking about it for a while and said something along the lines of ""14-18, I do not remember, it has been a while, you know I am older than you...."". Now, this is confusing once again. With a number still relatively low (I would not consider 18 ""low"" anymore, but whatever), wouldn't one know that number without having to think too much about it, especially if that number has not changed for a while (as she has been in a longer relationship)? It feels like she now ultimately lied to me, especially considering how it matches my own count.

2. She said that I should put these numbers into perspective, given that it has been over 10 years. While that is theoretically true, of those ten years she spent 7 in her last relationship (with a guy on whom she had cheated a few years ago and now again with me, but that is an entirely different topic and in theory a red flag I should be aware of). That leaves a time window of 3 years for the rest of those numbers. Still not high for some people, but am I in the right here to rationalize it that way? Do those years count when you are not actually ""on the market""?

3. I have never had ONS as I have close to no sexual desire in the middle of the night after drinking/dancing. I guess I am somewhat jealous of the guys that she had slept with ""back in the days"". I am feeling extremely conflicted about that.

If someone had asked me about my take on the topic a year ago I would have said ""double digits is too high"" and ""if you cannot/do not remember your count at all, it is too high"". I am currently wondering if I made a mistake and whether I should have just taken the red flags and run away last year.

My biggest concern now is, however, that now SHE feels insulted/hurt that I would think about her that way. Because I told her that the higher the partner count, the worse. It is nothing that is attractive to me. It is nothing that makes me feel ""wow, she is experienced, good for her/us!"". Because having had 5 ONS simply do not give you any valuable experience in the bedroom. That aside....what do? I do not want her to feel hurt. I do not want her to think I would label her a ""slut"" because I have never used that word or any other derogatory wording, yet she feels offended by me telling her that it is something that is ""on my mind"" and that leads to me having ""images"" in my head (I know some details of her past encounters). I have told her why it is problematic and what is unattractive about it to me (on another night, we were out clubbing and a guy was trying to flirt with her to which she ""gave in"" for a few minutes - 5 minutes later he approached me at the bar and whispered ""your girl is lots of fun in the restroom"" - this is just one of 2-3 occasions like that).

I don't know what to do. Reddit, help, please?

Well It's now August and the ONLY job offer I got was for a Non-profit company that paid 27k and was the most terribly depressing work I have ever done. I did that for two weeks and I went back to Grooming Dogs. (Which is what I have been doing for the past 4-ish years)

I want to move, but I am helping take care of my grandma. My family lost their home/ walked away from it and moved to West Virginia where they planned to retire. (Beautiful 1890's Victorian Home on 33 acres, so I don't blame them.)

Anyways, I run her rental properties and schedule the caregivers that go over to her house, and I also go over there and help out when I can. I went back to Grooming Full Time. I can make about 30k there, plus tips but it's not what I want to do forever. I feel like I could be doing something better. This may sound egotistical, but I think I am intelligent enough that I could be doing something BETTER. I work with a bunch of morons who hardly have a high school education and some days I feel stupid just from being around some of these girls.

**How do I calculate the pressure inside the pipe at a given point?** I want to know what the pressure is, say, halfway through the line or at a point a few feet before the eductor. I know the length (1000 ft) and diameter of the pipe, the elevation difference between the top of the tank where the chemical is stored and the eductor, the viscosity, temperature, and density of the fluid and its flowrate through the pipe. I have tried using Bernoulli's Equation using the known changes in elevation and head losses I calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach eq. and the flowrate, but I get pressures close to (or even below) perfect vacuum, which doesn't seem right as liquid eductors shouldn't be able to pull vacuums that high.

I'm a student that recently started an internship and have just been notified that I would be getting a permanent job offer starting next month. 

My current visa is through my university which I have just completed studies for my BSc with which would end on November 20th. 

My university's visa department has stated that in order to be able to transfer my visa to an employer I would need to have a valid passport of a minimum of 6 months in order to be able to do it, but my passport ends on December 20th. 

The issue I have is that I went to my embassy which is Egyptian and they have stated I cannot renew my passport right now due to a military obligation and that I need to wait out a year from December in order to be able to renew (this is due to my age which is 28 and I would turn 29 which is the year I would have to update my military status). The embassy said that due to strict military rules they would not be able to extend my passport until I turn 30 which is when my military obligation is dropped (even though I have a medical condition that would pardon me from the military). 

What I want to know is that, is it possible under some circumstance for my employer to transfer my visa to them with a passport that currently has 3 months validity on it. I have read online and asked friends that might be possible, even though my university has stated it wont be possible. 

I also wanted to find out, if my only resort is to stay in the UAE without renewing my visa for 11 months. Would I be able to renew the visa once I can renew my passport? I know that I need to pay a fine for overstaying in the UAE beyond my visa's expiration. But I want to make sure that once I pay the fine, would I be able to resume living here and work? 

I really appreciate all advice on this matter and any help

I'll try to keep it short.

My BF and I have been together for a year and a half now. I love him so much, he's one of my best friends and we tell each other everything. He's handsome, kind, funny, all of it, we really have a solid foundation here. Just a side thing, but we also have awesome sex, so that's great, but keep in mind for later.

We've had this recurring problem, however, where I feel he won't show enough affection or respond to my affection. Like, I've sent him letters, brought him food, that kind of stuff which he loves, but he doesn't exactly do that for me. That's fine, okay, maybe not everyone is into giving trinkets and stuff and I need to be mature and realize that. However, when we're apart (which we've had to be for the summer, living an hour away from each since I'm at an internship although we see each other twice a week), I feel like this is especially felt because he doesn't do what I'd really like to show his affection. Sure we'll call and text and he tells me he loves me, but he doesn't do letters or anything like that.

This blows up the most when I'll send him a dirty text or pic and he'll really like it but just respond with something like ""nice."" I feel like he used to be more excited about this stuff and flirt back when we first started dating... it kind of makes me feel unwanted when he responds always in such lackluster ways to these sexy things I try to do for him, but whenever I tell him that, he says he loves it and it makes him feel great, he just doesn't respond well. He'll eventually say he'll try to be flirty or whatever back (or even be spontaneous and do one of those things himself) but he never does, never even tries. 

We had another conversation about this last night and he said that maybe he's just not that kind of person. He said the only real solution he can think of is for me to just stop making those advances even though he likes them and to just deal with it. I feel like this isn't a good compromise and will just blow up on us if we do that.

When we're together, EVERYTHING is perfect, I feel wanted and we're both happy and he's so sweet. But we can't by physically together all the time :/ 

Does anyone have suggestions for what we could both do to remedy this? We love each other a lot but are having difficulty coming up with something, we really want to work this issue out. He felt bad for the ""deal with it"" compromise but said he felt lost for what else we could do.

The worst part is that I'm studying abroad for three months beginning in September so if we can't come up with a way for him and I to show affection from far away that seems more equal, I feel like everything will get worse.

In school, our class projects in any group I was in were always among the best in our class, and I saved most of the code.

Have had my resume reviewed by multiple people in a hiring manager position for software and IT jobs at very prestigious companies.  I mean guys that have been in the industry for years and are considered experts and high up at their respective companies.  I also made a professional LinkedIn profile that was reviewed by them as well, listing all of my skills and work experience, personal and school project descriptions.  They said my resume should be competitive and I should have no trouble finding a job.  But here I am.  

I'm keeping a spreadsheet of all the places I've applied, date of when, job title, a job description and what languages it used, any contact info received, last follow up, etc.   So far, since May, I have applied to about 100 positions at various companies and places around the area.  I don't feel like that is too many, or too few.  I usually do about 2-3 per day, but make a cover letter and tailor my resume to the specific position, and spend the time to research positions I actually have a good chance of getting.  Government jobs, small companies, medium companies, large companies, software companies, non-software companies, academia, and just regular old corporate programming jobs.  Web development, desktop development, and now even QA and application support type of roles.  Even roles that pay very low compared to the average for the area, at undesirable companies that get 2 stars on Glassdoor.  Contract, contract-to-hire, and full time.  Just anything to get my foot in the door.  Not limiting myself to any one industry or only targeting ""name brand"" companies.  Not being picky at all.  

My question is, how and where else should I be looking for jobs?  How should I be finding companies that are hiring?  It feels like I'm not looking in the right places. "

I'm interested in high performance computing, but since CUDA is Nvidia's product, I was wondering how much of what I learn could be transferred to other more open things like OpenCL or any other framework not developed and used by 1 company.

Example, if I know OOP concepts in C++, I can apply them to other languages with ease. Is this the case with CUDA, or is it not worth it to learn CUDA?

When a leading party is threatened to lose voters to an uprising smaller party, they often support another, even smaller party with a very similar manifesto, just so the uprising party will lose voters to them, and so they ultimately still win. 

We've all seen this happen, and it's a very dirty, but legal practice...

.

So, now that Microsoft seems to further and further abandon their mobile OS, I was thinking, what if the same thing happened here.

Apple and Google secretly supportet Microsoft, so they would make a competitor to BlackBerry, just so people would buy their phones instead - and both (MS and BB) would lose in the end and Google and Apple would succeed

All signs point in that direction.

*MS never bothered to actually promote their phones
*When they did, they always said they were ""bussiness oriented""
*their Dev team must consist of a handfull interns, the way how slow and sloppy the development goes on
*They more and more limit app-developers
*MS now (After BBOS10 is pretty much dead too) makes more and better apps for iOS and Android than for their own mobile OS
*Next thing we know, both - W10M and BBOS10 will be completely gone, only leaving iPhones and Androids

I just can't help it - something smells fishy here"

4y7ez2,0,2016-08-17,(PH) [22] I want to make my dreams come true... and it inevitably needs money.,InquisitiveLasagna,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4y7ez2/ph_22_i_want_to_make_my_dreams_come_true_and_it/,"This is my very first time posting (I've been a lurker prior to this), so please pardon me for any mistakes I might make regarding posting.

&amp;nbsp;


I have recently graduated from university with a Computer Science degree. Ever since my university days, I have dreamed of having a big birthday celebration when I turn 25. To this day, that dream has never left that mind. I reckon that my celebration would require somewhere around $~~20K~~3K or even less ~~(but I am guessing this is a huge overestimate).~~
&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT: I have reduced the celebration's budget to be half of my original estimate. I might be even needing less than this, so I hope this will clarify things. I apologize if the original number has surprised you guys.**
&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT2: The budget is still negotiable. I am willing to celebrate without having to spend a humongous amount, but I would very much like to push through with the celebration.**

&amp;nbsp;

So this is where I'm stuck - I have so little cash, and the fact that the clock is ticking is scaring me. I have no idea on how to tackle this goal.

&amp;nbsp;

Please take into consideration that I am struggling with depression (I'm on medication, so I am somewhat keeping it at bay), and it is difficult for me to get in contact with the outside world.

&amp;nbsp;

I just experienced my very first (and only) job rejection around a month ago or so. I am still taking it real bad, although I do my very best not to let the bitterness consume me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I asked my interviewer regarding the other possible options that I can take. He suggested that I go freelance and build a portfolio, to which I have heeded.

&amp;nbsp;

~~Since I figured that I am in no condition to work a 9-5 job, and that my parents are not pressuring me into entering the work force immediately, I am sharpening my skills (such as game development, a touch of web development), and I am also minding my hobbies (piano, violin, art) to keep me well-rounded, and in hopes that they may evolve (as per my shrink's words).~~
&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT 3: I have sent out online applications and will continue with walk-in applications next week. If they fail, I won't stop there. In the event, or off-chance, that I am told that I may be seriously lacking in skills, I will look for training or take another internship.**

&amp;nbsp;

So as you can see, I may seem like a jack-of-all-trades (I'd prefer generalist, though), but I tell you, there's just so much to learn about the world.

&amp;nbsp;

My only idea so far is to sell (via garage sale) my old stuff but that can only get me so far. I am also fairly educated in things like investing in stocks, but I primarily use my stocks for long term.

&amp;nbsp;

I know what I want, and I know my destination, but I do not know my itinerary.

&amp;nbsp;

Given my set of skills and current situation, how do I go about this big dream of mine? How can I turn these into ""assets""?

I graduated last December with a B.A. in economics from a pretty ok school, rankings wise. So during my job search, I've been pretty much stalking this one company for the past 2 (almost 3 months now) that I reallllllyyyyyyy want to work at (because I admire their mission, the service they provide, their innovation, company culture, they have extremely good reviews on glassdoor, etc.). I applied about two weeks ago for the data analyst position on their website, thinking that my cover and resume were pretty kick-ass at the time. Now, reading both of them over, they kind of seem mediocre to me now and I'm cringing but oh well, I can't do anything about that, already sent it in. I did make a point to express my enthusiasum and admiration (nothing too dramatic though) for the company in my cover letter so I'm kind of hoping I get some brownie points there.

Anyway, the point is, one of my old internship supervisors is connected with the CEO on LinkedIn, and someone who worked at the company I used to intern at now works at this company I want to work at (although I didn't speak to him much since we were in different departments, I'm fairly certain he would recognize me as we all met during the sales conferences. I've thought about cold-emailing him but I don't know if that's appropriate). 

So how can  or should I utilize my connections to get my foot in the door? I know for sure they are hiring, and I know it's kind of premature to do anything right now since it's only been two weeks. They did post a listing for another data-related position a few days ago but I'm not sure if I should apply for that as well with a better resume/cover letter? It's a small company, with less than 100 employees I think if that helps. And also, I share connections with several of the employees on LinkedIn as well.

What do you think? I really want to work here and don't want to screw up my chances. I know I shouldn't be too invested in one company and should broaden my horizons, but I really do think I might have a good shot here. I do have data-related experience to back it up and have been studying SQL, SAS, and Excel these past few months as well. 

I would appreciate any advice. "

Apologies if I've done something wrong with formatting this post or I'm in the wrong place.

Long story short, I graduated University a couple of weeks ago with a 1st, and for the last few months I have been working as a work from home intern as I transitioned from living at Uni to moving back home.

A few days ago I was called into the office and essentially offered a full time job, though there are a few caveats.

Essentially, though the role is a 9-5 position; I am technically a free lancer. I will be required to pay my own tax, and my wage slip will paid via invoice. I am in the process of finding out a little bit more information about what that means, but people tell me that it is relatively normal for some companies in the UK - so I'm not too worried.

It isn't an ideal situation at all, but I really enjoy working at the company and really wanted a job throughout my time interning.

My main issue is I simply don't know where to start with sorting out taxes. I'm only going to be earning 16k a year as it's my first job, but I want to ensure that I'm doing everything properly in terms of national insurance/tax's.

Does anyone have any advice as to what my best place to start is? I've joined towards the end of the month so I won't be getting paid for another 6 weeks anyway so that is why I'm not in a  massive rush quite yet.

Any help would be grand,
Thanks guys!

Refereeing Soccer - 4 Years  
Managing E-Mails/Invoices for my Dad’s Small Business - 2 years

They are hoarders, fleas, bugs and trash everywhere...",onlyyou9,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4y8d1z/should_i_drop_out_of_college_in_order_to_move_out/,"I am 21 years old right now.  I was left 4 year in state paid tuition by my grandfather when he died.

I have been raised by narcissistic parents who abused and neglected me my entire life.  It's a bit too much information to get into, but I'll try to give the highlights so people can understand where I'm coming from with this.  I was never raised as a child.  I literally had no parenting, no guidance... my parents never asked me about school, never talked to me about my interests or life.  They were never home... I literally mean that they were never home from when I was aged 10-18.  My dad was always out of town having affairs with women, my mom purchased an expensive property of land and had a horse stable built on it and she always stayed there.  My parents both have very high paying jobs but they spend their money like children... buying the expensive property to raise horses on, my dad spending thousands of dollars on plane tickets flying out to random cities meeting women online.

I was always home alone at our house, and it was quickly infested with fleas and bugs.  They had 5 dogs and 4 cats and never took care of them or washed them.  Child protective services attempted to remove me from my house when I was 16 but I cleaned the entire house good enough for it to pass an inspection because I was worried I would lose the money my grandfather left for me if I was taken out of their custody.  When I was 17, I got a part time job and got a GED.  I don't know how to describe how empty I feel... it's all catching up to me now.  I had no guidance or support or encouragement to pursue school, I got a minimum wage job when I was 17 and got a GED and for the past few years I have just been working a horrible minimum wage job and completing BS community college classes to feel like I am doing something?

I went to a doctor after a suicide attempt and they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and severe OCD.  My parents are in denial that I have either and are telling me I am making excuses for my failures by claiming I have mental illness.  I cant explain my childhood living situation or family dynamic without writing a 10 page essay, so it's really difficult for me to explain it all... but some other highlights are I have permanent organ damage after getting extremely sick and my parents refusing to take me to the doctor... I was viciously assaulted and given a concussion by a group of kids in my neighborhood because they thought I was gay... my parents' only reaction was to scream at me asking if I was gay, telling me that kids just don't pick on other kids and that if I am going around acting like a ""fag"" I can expect that?

I'm in the situation now where I am contemplating suicide every day.  It hurts seeing all of my classmates go on to study at universities, have their parents help them pay for rent, getting internships at companies through their college... all while am living in an abandoned house without any kind of family.  The OCD makes my life a disaster, the house is falling apart with fleas, black mold... it has not been cleaned or maintained since I was maybe 10 and I do not have the money to properly maintain this house since I am making minimum wage.

I want to drop out of college and cash in the prepaid education but I feel so guilty and horrible.  It will be a waste of money, I will only get around 20,000 tops if I cash it out.  But I have no interest in school... I don't even know how college works or what I want to study.  I can't describe this feeling but the OCD, bipolar, and negative atmosphere of living here makes it impossible for me to be motivated to take work or school seriously.  I'm extremely depressed and lost.  I have spent the past few years getting drunk and high all the time to escape and it's just caught up to me now.

I feel horrible giving up money I could use for a college education that many people would dream of.  I really think suicide is the only way out, I have no where to go and no one to talk to.  My parents collectively make 200,000 a year yet they spend it on expensive cars, expensive property and ridiculous vacations.  They are both severe alcoholics and drug addicts and I am literally treated like a pet.  My mom gets drunk often and tells me she is mentally ill and regrets having children because she is not the type of person who can raise a child and I am a burden on her which is why she never paid attention to me as a child and she had no idea how to help me succeed and how there's nothing left she can do for me

TLDR; should I give up a college education to move out of my parents' house, stop drinking alcohol and getting fucked up all the time, treat my mental illness?  it's mostly the OCD living in a house with black mold and fleas that makes me just get drunk and sleep all day...."

I'm coming to you all because as I proceed further along in school, no doubt a lot of other companies will be contacting me, and presuming I get multiple offers, I haven't really figured out *what* I want to do, so I'm unsure on how to narrow down what companies I should be focusing on."

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
15.6

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.**  I'll be using this for school-related stuff (some SQL) and gaming.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play?

I want good quality, maybe even business-grade which is why I'm considering the P50.

Im currently on shift 4 and i am feeling pretty useless. I had As through emt school, but this is just so much different.

My medic stands watch during the calls and tells me i am on my own, but i feel like im getting prompted too often, and i think my medic thinks im an idiot. I know the pt needs an iv, but i get so caught up in that i still havent even gotten baseline vitals. The calls that i get vitals right away, i even get them on a 3-lead, but medic tell me pt doesnt need any cardiac monitoring. He also tells me i need to make sure i get the pt demographics so im trying to get those down while the pt is still with me, but he says that delays the pt care.

He wants me to imrpove my multitasking, but i feel like i still have to actually think about what to do, as i havent developed the auto pilot mode the experienced guys seem to have.

Am i just worrying way too early? I know this job takes lots and lots of time, but im so used to knowing my shit in school that i feel super useless. Its just going to be me and one other partner in 2 weeks and im worried about being horrible at this job.

The thing i have going for me is that the pts typically love me and i always smile and ask how they are doing.

Tl;dr - im on my internship and i feel like i have no idea what im doing."

I know a co-op is a big time commitment, but I just wanted to know if its worth it or not. 

Also usually which one of the two is easier to get?

And I feel kinda weird asking this, but do people usually land co-ops/internships in Ohio itself or in some other state. Actually I would really like to move out of Ohio atleast for internships so that I can just have the experience of living in a new place on my own."

# Background info on Job

I've been at this job for 4 years in September, doing the exact same role with only a few minor added responsibilities that I've taken on myself.  I work 2nd shift by myself, and face social isolation from my coworkers, them talking badly about me behind my back, etc.  I send emails and never get a response, and face subtle judgment and criticism from my coworkers in passive and off-hand comments about what I do, or their perceived lack of me not doing anything at work.  My job is remote hands/feet for a co-lo customer, primarily break/fix, rack/stack, etc.  At one time, I had some minor sys admin roles but those have gone away since we merged with the current company two years ago.  I am responsible for helping to manage a portfolio of some facilities in other states, and that includes keeping track of outages, cleanup efforts, documentation, etc.

Besides the IT guys I work with, everyone else in the building has nothing but respect for me which they have vocalized on various occasions, and they will often defend me in front of the IT guys or otherwise let me know they're talking bad about me.  My manager is in another city two hours away, and I only see him a handful of times a year, so management structure is lacking, to say the least.  We have an on-site supervisor, but he always seems to condescend me when he talks to me, as if he doesn't think I'm smart enough to understand what he's talking about.

I am the only point of contact for supporting the legacy IT systems for badging, access control and security systems, and those systems are held together with sticks and bandages at this point.  I am sick and tired of supporting a broken system with no outside support, no vendor I can reach out to, no budget to make improvements -- just keep it working is the mentality.  This is a good resume padder and I've been the only person to figure out these systems, like how to print badges, etc, and have thoroughly documented everything, but I no longer wish to do this.

With all that being said, the job has no growth and no improvement.  I don't have another role I can grow into, and I have no idea about moving over to another job role horizontally.  The IT team is unique within the enterprise since IBM does **all** other IT work for us, so we're really unique and our positions only exist because we were merged into the organization.

# Pros/Cons of Current Job
* Pros: 
    * Benefits: 401(k) match, health insurance, life, dental, vision, disability (short &amp; long), tuition reimbursement ($5,000 per calendar year, tax-free)
    * Health credit of $700/year offsets cost of insurance to me, life is currently 3x salary benefit paid by company (taxable), and I pay for all others every paycheck.
    * Salary that is double the area average
    * 2nd shift means I can do school in the mornings, work in the evenings
    * Very, very low volume of tickets in the past few months means lots of downtime.
    * Short (~3mi) commute means my car is a 2012 with only 32,000 miles on it, despite driving all over the state, plus up to NYC, Philly, West Virginia, and North Carolina.
* Cons
    * No growth
    * No personal development outside of studying for certs during downtime (company offers a ""bonus"" for certs but doesn't reimburse)
    * Toxic interpersonal relationships with coworkers
    * No responsibilities, not viewed with respect by IT coworkers
    * Poor management, random knee-jerk policies implemented based on someones' mood at random times, passive-aggressive emails to address issues, lack of structure and **absolutely no personal accountability if someone messes up** (unless, of course, I make a mistake).
    * Yearly merit increases that are less than 2%.  Bonus helps, but still doesn't outweigh inflation.
    * Stagnant in job duties, no other responsibilities to take on despite asking multiple times, **can't use technical skills I've learned over the years**, **can't use skills I've learned in College**
    * I need a change.

With all the above said, I *potentially* have a job offer pending at Cisco, contingent on Graduation.  I went through a weed-out interview last year and he stated I was more knowledgeable than an intern, so they'd hire me on full-time at a near-entry-level position.  The job would involve moving to RTC in North Carolina, and I would ask for at least $60,000/year to justify the move down there, hopefully more like $65,000.  I know seniors that graduated this past May who work there and make between 60-70/year.

# Pros/Cons of Potential Job
* Pros:
    * More pay
    * Put my skills to work
    * Actually be challenged/stimulated by job functions
    * I can learn and grow within the networking field, which I've developed a passion for
    * New area, new people, new friends, change of scenery
    * Personal and professional networking and growth
    * Doing something I actually enjoy
    * New apartment = I can bring a puppy into my life
* Cons:
    * Moving away from friends, family and my nephew
    * New area means not many friends immediately, adjustment period
    * Unsure about probationary period of the job to make such a large move
    * Moving expense (plan to hire a truck and move in one fell swoop)
    * Potential cost of living expense, though I've done research and it should be commensurate with the increase in income.
    * I don't know what else.  This would be my first time moving away in pursuit of a job.

With alllllllll that being said, I'd like critique/comments/feedback/personal and life advice from the financial point of things.  I feel like I have a grip on things, I have enough money set aside to pay for all of my listed expenses for the 4-5 months that I'd be unemployed, etc.  What I didn't mention above is I would TA during classes and earn $8.50/hr, with at least 3-4 classes that I'd TA for at a time.  This past semester, TA'ing for 2 classes netted me $1,000 in fun money.  I'd also potentially work a part-time job if anything out of sheer boredom from sitting at home all the time.  I might also do computer repairs on the side to make money.

Thank you in advance for reading my wall of text, but also for any advice you can offer.  This is a huge change in my life and I'm consulting with people close to me, family and friends, and weighing all their opinions before pulling the trigger.  I **really** don't want to deal with my coworkers past December, if I have a choice."
4y9a5j,2,2016-08-17,Legal Advice For this Renting Predicament--Frustrated,yvnsky,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4y9a5j/legal_advice_for_this_renting/,"I moved to a new city for half a year for an internship so I needed temporary housing. I found a nice Catholic Housing Establishment with affordable rent. I was in saw a rush to settle in and get started on the first week of my internship that I never received my lease. The nice lady at the office said she would put it in my mailbox. Even though I knew that when a lease is signed, you should receive it right away, I thought to myself that I could trust a Catholic establishment that is there to help immigrants and students. I never had a problem until.... new management came. When I signed the lease (that I never received) with the first management company, I had first worked with an agent. I was told that in order to book a room there I needed to first go through the agent however, she would discount me my first month to make up the difference of what I had to pay the agent. I wrote her a check from the first discounted month and a month of security deposit. The establishment is a place for temporary guests--although it doesn't cap a maximum stay. THe lease stated that I would be paying ""month to month"" and to give them a two week notice before moving out so that they could grant me my security deposit before my leave. I was happy with the way of functioning and had no fears. I felt that I was saving and I was very happy. When the new management took over, I was told that I had underpaid in my first check. I had explained to her that my first month was discounted due to me working work the agent and that it was formality for me to work with her. She immediately told me that they no longer worked with the placement agency and told me that I would need to pay the difference back which I agreed to out of fear and not wanting to deal with conflict. It wasn't much so I agreed. She had a strange way of making you feel very uncomfortable. She also told me that no one in the building had given their last months rent , including me, and that I would need to provide that as well. I gave her a shocked look and told her that I would need to check my finances and that it was impossible for me to provide that right away. She told me that for now, she was ok with the difference that I owed and that she would be expecting the last month  at the start of the month on top of that month as well. I left. I realized later that she was also charging me a different rate for my room than what was agreed upon in the lease (that I never received). In the establishment's guidebook, my room was rated at 775, however, when working with the agent, she said it was 725. I didn't mind paying the difference because I felt lucky getting such nice rent but am realizing now that there are a lot of things wrong here.


1. I never received a formal lease--although I do have proof with the agent that I would be renting at the establishment and the contracted 725 a month. 
2. I was given a different rate by the new management that was higher. Which rate should I be paying? The one listed in the guidebook or the one I was originally quoted and signed for? 
3. The new management is threatening ""legal action"" saying that it is ""federal law"" that all paperwork is filled out--meaning a new lease delineating a specific amount of rent vs. the original temp housing policy of month to month--and providing ALSO a last month's amount, which was never asked of us in the first place and is never listed on their website that is linked to the Catholic charity. 


What would you suggest I do on all 3 accounts? How is it best to handle this? Should I:
a. give them what they want and fear that they will be very difficult to deal with when it comes to exiting--aka being tricky with the security deposit etc. 
b. pay what was originally intended and refuse to sign the new lease. Leave my last month without paying and have the security deposit take care of that (is that legal?) I am held to anything since I don't even have a lease? And if so, the original lease stands--only anything that my signature is on stands, correct? Can they truly throw me out if I don't sign this new lease? I would hate to be thrown out, that's would be very very unfavorable. 

Any advice or understanding you have on legal matters when it comes to rentals, I would truly appreciate. Thank you"
4y9bnr,2,2016-08-17,What to do in college without CS Skills?,AskWhyIMadeThisAccou,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4y9bnr/what_to_do_in_college_without_cs_skills/,"I just turned 18 and I'm starting college next week at a ""University of State"" school whose CS ranks a little above 100. Obviously not ideal but until this summer I had no idea what I wanted to do so I just picked the school that gave me the best scholarship offers. I'll probably never forgive myself for not going to UIUC on in-state tuition. Last month I started teaching myself python, html, and css to get a heard start in my intro CS classes, but other than that I've never done anything programming or dev related, but I'm really good at math and I can pick up these skills quickly.


That being said, what concrete steps should I take now to have a successful career later on? I feel too inexperienced to work on side projects of any significance or get an internship. Besides for the broad and ""Good GPA, network, internships, side project"" what should I be working on now? Basically, what do you wish you did as an 18 y/o or what would you do in my situation?"
4y9rf8,3,2016-08-17,"Need advice, maybe help crafting a future plan.",Waytoomuchrice,japanlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/4y9rf8/need_advice_maybe_help_crafting_a_future_plan/,"So, I came to Japan for 2.5 to 3 years when I was in the military. Married my wife, a Japanese national, and then we dicked around in Italy for another 2 years. Great time. We came back to live here here on a whim, so I had no real plans in place for living here. That said, we're doing fine. I make 2.5-3k a month for GI Bill payments and am going to school (on base) for a bachelors in BA which I hope to turn into a Masters. She makes about 1k from her on base job. So money is set, and I have the marriage visa so that isn't an issue either. 

Problem is, I have a 2-year deadline (roughly, more like 23 months) before the money dries up and we run into issues. With the aggressive saving we do, we can push that out to maybe 6 more months to a year. No kids, but we are going to have some soon as her biological clock is ticking, which will further deplete funds.

I took “Elementary Japanese” 1 and 2 on base, and did well, but I would still describe my speaking abilities as non-existent, really. I can get vegetables from the local store but I can't navigate a full conversation, formal or casual. I know I need to work on it, I at least recognize and know that (have Remembering the Kanji, one of the genki books and a flashcard app). What are your thoughts on this matter?

As for my military history, I was in the military law enforcement branch. I did some time as a 911 dispatcher/office clerk (3 years), so I have that going for me and I can probably pad the resume pretty well with that. I doubt they'll let me be a police officer here in Japan so it's not going to help as much as I would like it to.

I realize I bummed up by not crafting a plan before Japan but it took enough critical thinking and magic just to get here, get our HHG here, and get sustenance rolling in. After that, I have kind of just glided on the “college student” track but I feel like I should be doing more to prepare myself for entry into the (competitive, from what I hear) Japanese work force. I can get a job on base, but I'm not holding my breath for it as the pickings are slim and it'll really just require good luck to find something in my area. Relocating around Japan (while not desirable) is definitely still an option, both for Japanese/us base job markets. I went business admin for my major as it is (generally) a good catch all. Will it fly here?

What do you guys think? Moving back to the US is almost not an option, so what should I do here to prepare for the long run. I saw a post about internships and plan to check that out further, what about padding the resume? I have 8 years experience in the military, I can really stretch that into some crazy prior experience, but will it still be relevant years after the fact?

Should I work somewhere in the meantime? Would being an English teacher help me or hinder me?

Finally, what can I reasonably expect? You don't have to be light about it, I know I've made some errors, but at this point I just need guidance. What can I do to better my chances during this 2-year timeframe? It's worth mentioning I go to school at most two days a week, so I have plenty of free time to invest. I know, it's a sweet gig. 2 days of school for 3k a month, gonna miss it. 

So what are your thoughts?

I'm a rising junior studying finance and information systems and I just finished my first internship with one of the Big 4 doing IT Advisory. Although I am not planning on going back to that group next year, my campus recruiter told me they could look into other opportunities within the firm.

However, I am not planning on pursuing a CPA, so I am limited me to advisory roles... and even within advisory, I understand that certain things like Deal Advisory (which I believe would fall more along my interests) look for a CPA too.

Can anyone with experience working at a Big 4 without a CPA chime in about what you do, and maybe your educational background too? 

I enjoyed the work environment this summer and the people were great, so I want to look into other opportunities within the Big 4. Thank you!"

I was just curious if there were any skills or bases of knowledge that I could develop prior to starting my tax position? I know that the firm said that they would be providing some training, but I kind of wanted a leg up prior to starting. 

I have been watching some excel videos and am actively learning pivot tables, macros, and other keyboard shortcuts. Are there any other things that I could learn? 

Also as far as tax forms go, are there any that I should really get a strong feel for prior to starting? Most of my exposure was in individual tax and S Corps at an internship that I had, so I don't really know what to expose myself to. 

Any help would be appreciated, thank you! "

I switched major and was doing terrible in my previous one. 

This may be shallow but I want to work at a notable tech company, e.g. Microsoft/FB/Google/Amazon/Twitter/Apple/Nvidia/etc. I know definitely my GPA is not an issue to get a good job SOMEWHERE, but I really want to work at a notable tech company.

I heard some of these tech companies are not as strict, but I get the feeling that a lot of them still care. I'm guessing HR recruiters got to start somewhere, and GPA at the end of the day is an easy metric to start their hunt. 

Reading older post, one remedy is on my resume I can report both GPAs. But some companies require you to report one GPA through their application, and when they ask that I'm pretty sure they want cumulative. So if at that point they already written me off due to low GPA, they may not even get to my resume where I they can see I actually have decent major GPA and experience. :(

A bit more context, I had 4 software internships, 3 of them at notable aerospace companies. Also have a github with many small programs, scripts, and a few apps. 2 local hackatons, did not win. I think everything aside from my GPA is pretty stellar, and if I was invited to an interview I'm pretty confident I'll do well. But I need to know realistically if I'm going to get screwed by my cumulative GPA to a point of not even being invited to an interview.

If any of yall have experience or know anything, how's it like as a new grad with a low-ish cumulative GPA at a fancy tech company?

4yc2vi,7,2016-08-18,Is my marriage over?,eracolem,Marriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/4yc2vi/is_my_marriage_over/,"My wife and I have been married for 13 years and have two children, age 9 and 7. We both grew up in a very religious culture and about 7 years ago decided to leave. Within that culture, there were expectations that my wife stay home with the children and be a mom. I was going to grad school before we had children and encouraged her to do the same. She insisted on children while we were in grad school and I acquiesced after some time. But we could both see very early that she was unhappy being a SAHM. I encouraged her throughout to either work part time, go back to school, or start her career. After we left our church she decided to go back and get her PhD at the institution where I teach. 

Her going through grad school has been hell. The program itself is a bit messed up, but more fundamentally she has been saying for about 2 years now how much she regrets having children and getting married. For about a year now she's talked about leaving. To finish her PhD she needs to go on internship, away from the city we live in. She refused to talk about the process for years. I am fortunate enough to have a sabbatical this year and have some flexibility in where to go; however, I had a number of prestigious offers to spend the year at elite universities. As she began to list her preferences of cities to go to (there is a “match” program where she has some say in ranking of preferences, but she is ultimately matched by a system) we created a list of what our preferences would be. However, a week later she changed the order of the list without telling me and she matched to a city where I had no career options. I need to scramble and find somewhere to spend the year.

Finances have always been a major issue. I feel like a walking ATM—all the pressure to earn and support our family has fallen on my shoulders and I rarely have say in what things we buy. As I look around our house, I see that she has made nearly every spending decision for our last 13 years. Our budget always seems out of whack because her personal spending is always over her allotment. I regularly need to find alternative ways (e.g. consulting) to raise money to pay for these shortfalls. I have consistently sacrificed our shared savings goals that we make when budgeting because she would go and buy things.

She started seeing a therapist about six months ago. She told me that her biggest problem over the past 13 years is that she has not put her needs first. She told me that she’s starting to make decisions for what she wants, not what me or the kids want. I'm totally flabbergasted by this comment: I have always supported and encouraged her to do whatever she wants in her career, I have supported her in many of her hobbies throughout our marriage, I gave up a nice job so that her mother could come live with us at the end of grad school and while I started a new job, and I have given up many career opportunities because they simply didn't work for her and our family. She spends almost all our money and ignores our shared financial goals. We recommit to budgets every so often, which I adhere to and she simply ignores. She is an only child that has never learned to share. In fact, I have had multiple of her and my family members as well as friends approach me in the past concerned about her selfishness—either towards them or towards me.

This all came to a crescendo at the beginning of the summer when she said she no longer knows what marriage means to her and cannot commit to me long term. She feels like she missed too much of her life and blames our religious upbringing on all her problems. And she now blames me—she says I have been controlling and that she resents having to adjust her career to me and check in with me about finances and budget. She still becomes viscerally angry when talking about it. She feels oppressed. She openly talks about divorce and leaving me. She feels trapped by her obligations. I gave her back control of the budget (which she had done for 10 years but I took over last year); we decided that each of us would have a spending allotment of personal fun money of $300 per month. This seemed like a lot to me, but I wanted to be supportive, and to fulfill her needs of being more independent. I just didn’t wan to be the person that had to say “no.” But this summer she spent all of our savings (about $20k) going out with friends and shopping—sometimes I was invited sometimes it was girl’s night. She had to finish her dissertation this summer, but did nothing on it for the first two months. I ended up doing all of her statistics on her dissertation to help her though. She has a strong deadline coming up and now devotes maybe 3 hours a week to finishing; if she doesn’t finish we have more tuition to pay to enroll in additional credits.

I now have acute anxiety over everything. I take a number of medications to help. I began talking to a therapist and she suggests just getting though one day at a time; we’re both overloaded with stress and we shouldn’t make any major life decision in this state.  I obviously felt real hesitation about moving to our new city to finish her internship. But, I want to give the marriage a chance because I love her and I love our family. So about two weeks ago we moved 5 hours away to our new city, renting out our house in the old place. I’ve now had some time alone, away from work, to think about things.

So now I’ve moved to our internship city. But our bank accounts are depleted because of her summer of freedom, she has started a new job, and she will not complete her dissertation on time. I again feel the stress of having to find a way out. I decided that our current way of budgeting simply did not work and was not meeting my needs—I needed to start setting boundaries and be assertive. She openly admits to overspending in the past because she resents being dependent on me. So I have now proposed that we contribute to our joint family needs according to our earnings (which is 80% me and 20% her while on internship). However, this leaves her with much less spending money than me now because she makes so much less. She resents this heavily, but I’m trying to remain assertive in my needs here.

So last night we have a big conversation about this. This started a huge argument where she again relived to the oppression of our religious upbringing. She realizes that she made certain choices that have put her in this situation, but is so angry with the past. I expressed how I feel like a doormat, that she’s taking this out on me, and that I am committed to be more assertive and stand up for myself. I again express that I have always tried to support her—even when we were very religious I could see she wasn’t happy and encouraged her career. I want to support her in the future as well, but I also need to ensure my needs are met.

But she is unhappy and suffocated by me, our children (she loves them but hates being a mother), and all her stress. She says that she doesn’t want to leave our new city and return to our old one, and yet she cannot commit to me right now. I have made a tremendous sacrifice moving here for this year and I want our family to be together, but I cannot give up my career, with tenure in a job I love, in our old city, especially when I have no commitment from her. I feel like a made a huge mistake moving here—I feel like she no longer loves me (she says she does, but her actions are so destructive) and that she is making unreasonable requests from me with no guarantees of the future.

And the kids. They obviously know something is up. I love spending time with them and I love being a Dad. My wife is a good Mom, but she hates “momming.” As a result, I have pretty much taken over all the housework in addition to my full time job. She gets very frustrated at the kids and constantly badmouths and complains about them and their needs. I have told her many times that I am uncomfortable with this, that they hear these messages and it’s not good. It’s funny though, because she is the” fun one”, so I think she probably has a better relationship with them than I do.

In our old city she would not go into marriage counseling (originally her idea until I agreed) because she wanted to work on herself. She is now willing to go in the new city and as soon as our health insurance is settled we are planning to go.

I can’t fix her past oppression and I am not responsible for it (and she acknowledges this). Nor can I continue to pour my time, love, money, and energy into a relationship that she remains uncommitted to—she just doesn’t know if she wants to be married or not. I’m afraid for what this will mean for the kids, but I’m concerned about the influence of our current situation on the kids. I’ve committed to this new city for a year, but I already see that she really doesn’t want me here. I don’t know what to do now. Should I stick out the year and try and make it work in therapy? Should I ask her to find her own place here in the new city, while I stay with the kids? Should I move back to the old city? Should I just wait for her to make up her mind about what she wants?

4yc9it,10,2016-08-18,"What are our duties to Feminism, if any?",0vinq0,Femslib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Femslib/comments/4yc9it/what_are_our_duties_to_feminism_if_any/,"In our Women of STEM thread from a while back, /u/littlepersonparadox brought up a very interesting topic about feeling as though he was betraying feminism by transitioning from female to male, especially as someone in STEM. This reminded me of some of my own struggles in feeling like I am ""betraying"" feminism. I'm a woman in engineering and the only female engineer in my office. I love engineering, but I'm considering leaving and taking a position outside of engineering for external personal reasons. Although this option makes a lot of sense for me and my life goals, I can't help but feel guilty for being yet another woman to leave engineering. We had female interns this summer, and one of them told me she loved that I was sticking it out as the only female engineer. I feel almost like I'm betraying *her.*

I've also seen plenty of non-STEM feminists get *accused* of betraying feminism for choosing majors and careers that are traditionally feminine. For example, the ""why aren't all the gender studies majors choosing STEM if they care so much"" circlejerk we see on reddit. 

I'm sure others have felt something similar when their *personal choices* don't seem to emulate *all* the goals of feminism. 

So let's talk about this. Do we have a duty to feminism to lead by example? Should we be making personal sacrifices in order to pave the way for all the women who need our example? Or is this actually antithetical to the purpose of feminism? Would making these sacrifices actually fly in the face of feminism as we continue to make decisions based on social pressures rather than freely? Have you felt this pressure? How did you respond? Do you wish you responded differently? How do we continue to work toward equality if we choose *not* to lead by example?

Any other thoughts on the topic are welcome. "
4ycano,79,2016-08-18,How many people have been involved in the development of the Mars architecture?,NateDecker,spacex,https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/4ycano/how_many_people_have_been_involved_in_the/,"Elon is clearly excited about the Mars architecture reveal. He has been hinting about it for a long time and clearly is eager to spill the beans. However, he also clearly wants to save his thunder for the conference. In other words, this information is considered ""secret"".

With any secret, the likelihood of the secret being exposed increases as the number of people who are in on it increases. This means that the best chance Elon has of not having his surprise reveal ruined is to keep the information contained to a relatively small handful of people.

At the same time, the Mars colonialization architecture is a complicated and highly technical challenge. Although Elon is a brilliant guy and very technically minded, I doubt he would have the foolhardy overconfidence to try and develop this entire architecture in a vacuum by himself. He would rely on many people at SpaceX to inform the architecture and refine the details. The plan has to be feasible and somewhat bullet-proof when it is finally presented.

So we have two conflicting objectives: keep it secret, and get extra pairs of eyes on it.

It seems like the level of detail and maturity should be directly proportional to the number of people involved. If only a handful of people know about it, I expect it to be a high-level plan with more generalities. If a large number of people were involved, I expect it to have greater detail and specificity. Personally, I'm hoping for high fidelity in that architecture. I would love for SpaceX to release a ""white paper"" sort of thing shortly after the presentation kind of like what they did with the Hyperloop. I don't actually expect them to do that though because Hyperloop was a unique situation. I imagine the best we can hope for is for Elon to start talking about it and elaborating the plans more freely after the announcement. I imagine we'll be getting a steady trickle of new details from subsequent interviews as long as the interviewers have the presence of mind to ask intelligent questions and not just say things like, ""Why make rockets reusable?""

So there are a lot of different departments and subject matter experts that should be informing this architecture. Perhaps Elon could compartmentalize the information somewhat and limit the number of system engineers. What departments would be expected to provide input? Is it possible that some of the work has been contracted out?

**Edit:** Since I referenced it in the comments below, [here is a link](http://gawker.com/5164035/tesla-ceo-in-digital-witch-hunt) to the story about Elon trying to catch a leaker at Tesla. My point in referencing this is that you *can't* trust the NDA to protect you from leaks, even leaks that are damaging to the company (never mind ones in this case where it just steals thunder). Not only that, Elon has personal experience with it.

**Edit 2:** Thanks for your comments all. I'm honestly surprised with the majority opinion. Most people seem to feel like the majority of SpaceX (if not the entirety, excluding interns) is aware of and familiar with the MCT architecture. I would find this very surprising at the end of the day, but it's interesting that this is the majority opinion. I would make one more observation on this subject. I'm reminded of when Garrett Reismann gave a PowerPoint presentation on the progress of crew dragon. At the end of the conference call with the press, he went through a Q&amp;A session. Some of the questions were about Falcon Heavy and he was *decidedly* out of the loop on the subject. I think some of his answers were known by the community at the time to be incorrect. So even though he worked at SpaceX, he clearly didn't have much knowledge or information about Falcon Heavy because it was outside of the scope of his responsibility. I've felt the same way about some of the comments from Hans. He likewise seemed out of the loop on certain subjects. I agree with those of you who have emphasized that few people would know and that few people *should* know. I have worked for the government on classified work before. NDA's are probably the last line of defense when it comes to security. You hear it a lot in the government, but access to classified information is based on a ""need to know"". I doubt the entire 5000 employee SpaceX organization has a ""need to know"" about most of the Mars architecture at this point."

So I can get pretty dark and dirty; I'm certainly not going to be shy in abusing you.

[This is my kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/v5UKoBS.png) ; I enjoy degrading and abusing cunts, mother/daughter incest, snuff, fake tits, and being an Alpha Male. I believe that cunts have no rights.

Some scene ideas:

1. Job Interview. I am well known writer and despite my misogyny I received an option to be interviewed for a job at a Feminist magazine. You would play the managing editor, a powerful businesswoman (perhaps even a lesbian), and you are fully aware that I am a misogynist; but your magazine has seen declining sales and you honestly believe that my writing would increase sales. But you have to convince me to join, doing everything you can from increasing my salary, giving me your own office, to offering up your body and those of your very young daughters (ages to be discussed). You increasingly degrade yourself, your employees, underage interns and family until I am the editor and your magazine is no longer feminist.

2. Muscle Humiliation. You are a bodybuilder, with powerful muscles in your arms and thighs. You got large breast implants to continue to show off your feminity, but you are also proud of what you have achieved at the gym. No men ever approach you. Until I come in, an Alpha Male, and just start abusing you and calling you names, squeezing your breasts and suggesting a new gym outfit. You are thoroughly humiliated and come to agree to each of my demands happily, even when I start getting violent.

3. Girls School. You are the Principal of a girls school. The new school year is about to start but you are concerned that your school has been doing terrible in both grades and athletics. You decide that presenting a new image of the school will help, and decide that who better to determine that new image than the man who just moved into the house across the street from the school. You soon realise that this man has his own ideas of how a girls school should look and behave.

4. Fall of a Celebrity. A famous feminist, like Emma Watson or Daisy Ridley, reduced to being a fuckslut. Daisy Ridley could be using social media to promote the latest Star Wars film, gets degraded by a Star Wars nerd, and invites him to the set to prove him wrong. Instead she ends up being his cunt slave."

Here’s my resume :

Finished high school in France when i was 19, in 2008 (i was one year late, no biggie i guess)

2008-2010 : i had several jobs : assembling computers for gamers, working for an asset management company for a couple months, working for a wedding magazine

2010-2013 : bachelor degree

2013-2014 :took a year off, 4 months to travel in thailand (i had family there back then, and i wanted to travel a little), and some time to prepare for the BS's competitive exam when i went back to france.

September 2014-november 2016 : master’s degree in a good business school (at least in France. I had to prepare for weeks in a preparatory school), during which i had a 6 months internship in Bangkok, as a ""business analyst"", for a big company.

Now here’s the issue i have : I’m finishing my education this november, maybe december, and i’ll only get my degree next year. If i want to, i can take another internship until june 2017 (it’s called an « internship year » i believe) and it won’t change anything, i’ll receive my degree in 2017 anyways. What should i put in my resume if i finish my education at the end of the year, that i graduated in november/december 2016 right ? (a lot of people told me to do that) It doesn’t matter when i get the degree as long as i finish in time? And what about the option to make it a 3 year masters degree (with another internship), will employers be afraid of my age ? (if i finish my education in november, i’ll be 27 years old, but i’ll almost be 28 (born in the end of august) if i finish it in june 2017)

Honestly, do you think i’d be fine in both cases, 27 or 28 yo, since people can graduate with masters at 23 in France, just like in England i believe? (it’s not a majority though, but people tend to graduate early in France, 25 is probably the average with masters in business schools)

Thank you very much

nb : as you can see, i didn't have a job, apart from my 6 months internship since 2010 when i was a student, as i wanted to enjoy being a student (universities are almost free in France, although you have to pay for business schools)

At the time, this life changing decision was a no-brainer. I was happier with him than I ever had been. I loved him. We had the same ideals about how to raise our children and live our lives in general. We were a perfect pair. I knew even then that I’d never had that crazy passionate “it” thing for him. But I’d had more than enough drama in my life and what I really wanted for forever, he gave me. He was sincere, loving, stable, comfortable. He made me laugh. He kissed me every night before bed without fail. Collin was everything I wanted in life so I said yes. And 19 months later, we got married. 


Just over three years have passed since we said, “I do.” Everyone says the first year of marriage is the hardest. That wasn’t the case for Collin and me. We transitioned from dating, to engaged, to married uncommonly easily. Everything fit like a puzzle piece between us. And never for a single second have I regretted our time together or our marriage.


A few years ago I started to wonder if I was good enough for Collin. I was struggling through coming to terms with my bisexuality and feeling very tempted to cheat. I have never cheated on Collin but the thought that I would never again have another first kiss haunted me. I’ve always been 100% open and honest with Collin. It was a decision I made going into this relationship and one that I knew would be difficult but I really had no other choice. Lying and secrets and feelings kept private had ruined so many other relationships; mine and other people in my life. So I told Collin. Every step of the way, I told him how I was feeling. What I was thinking. 


Some of the things I struggled with were knowing that I would never get to move to another state or country because he wanted to stay within driving distance of his parents; knowing I would never have a real relationship with a woman; knowing I would never have that “it” thing again… that anxiety… the passion toward a lover that I hadn’t felt since I was a teenager. 


The next few years passed with a lot of conversations between the two of us surrounding these things. And also the things he felt he was missing out on as a result of our marriage. I wasn’t ready for kids but he wants them badly. He wants to move out of the city we live in but this is where my job is. He wants a house in the country with a back yard and a few more dogs. I can’t give him any of those things. Over the years every conversation has ended the same way… we’ll find a way to make it work because we love each other enough that the compromise has always been worth it. 


Over the past year, the nagging feeling that we might be making a mistake has grown stronger. We know we married too young. We both admit that openly and freely. We aren’t ashamed of it and we don’t regret anything about our lives over the past five+ years. We make each other happy, we never argue, we fit together. But the experiences we are missing out on as a result of this relationship are becoming a bigger thing than we ever imagined they would be. I passed up an internship living in Florida for 6 months, because we were together, we had a dog. I never studied abroad because it was too much money to spend when we were planning a wedding. He’s lived in a city he hates far away from his family and friends for four years to be near me. We wonder if we made a mistake. If maybe the positives don’t outweigh the negatives any more. And I wonder every day if not having that “it” thing, as we like to call it, is going to be bearable for the rest of my life. I wonder if I’ll wake up in my forties with teenaged children making noise in my kitchen with clattering cereal bowls and suddenly realize that I deprived myself of something that I will never be able to get back.


With all of that considered, the alternative terrifies me. Collin and I are good and we are happy. Am I really so selfish, so self-important that I would throw away an incredible marriage in exchange for a might-be. Would I really devalue my love for Collin, and Collin himself, so much that I could toss him aside in case something better came along? Get rid of him to travel a little more, to places I don’t even know would make me happy. The thought of it disgusts me. Most people never get what he and I have. Most people, even those in perfectly happy marriages, never had the chance to marry their very best friend. &amp; I know that this love I have for Collin will never go away. We have what it takes to make it to forever. The question I’m faced with now is, do we? Do we keep on going to forever? 


They say that the only thing in the world happier than a 3 legged dog is a 4 legged dog. Well, what if I trade in this life as a 3 legged dog and instead of finding a life as a 4 legged dog I find something much less. I don’t want to give up my perfectly happy life for something that might never happen. But I also feel sometimes that it is unfair to both of us to stay in this life knowing we are the 3 legged dog and that, if only we could find it, we’d both be better off with a fourth leg. 


I don’t know how I am supposed to make that decision.


  **TL;DR**: I am not passionately in love with my husband and never have been, although I do love him very much. We married very young and are now worried we’re holding each other back in life. Is that enough reason to divorce? Is the “passion” really all that important when it comes down to forever?

Two months ago I moved and we would have been doing long distance for 2-3 years. He kept saying how confident he was and how much he wanted this to work out. I was really stressed out over this and said things like I wanted to break up and how I don't see a future. I also said that if he wasnt sure about me after a year and half, long distance and seeing each other one day a month won't help either.

He kept saying how he saw a future to it. 

I was really stressed out over this past month and half with the new job (new intern at the hospital), not knowing anyone in a new city and the future to the relationship so I called him a lot in the middle of night crying. We also had communication problems and he said everything he did was not enough for me and all he is looking for is stability and no fighting. The past month we fought a lot over the fact that he chose to go to an acquaintance's wedding that he knows no one instead of coming to see me. That was my only day off for the month that he could have came. He admitted he messed up. But we fought so much that month over it . He came to visit and we had a great weekend. For some reason the next day, I had so many doubts of whether we could do this and I called him up saying how I may wanna break up or go on break. He got really angry. I apologized profusely and said that I am really stressed out with everything right now and how I really love him and truly believe in a future. I just need to come to my senses.

He said he needed some time to think. He broke up with me three weeks ago kept repeating  how ""he doesn't see a future to us"", and it came as a surprise. I always thought he would fight for it and he gave me so much reassurance. He said the problem is that we didn't have stability and all the fighting. I begged him. I gave him a few days to think about things then texted him why we should work. He kept responding with he doesn't see a future. He canceled his flight to come see me the next week. I offered to buy a last minute flight to go see him to work things through. He responded with he wouldn't want me to buy a flight just to see him and that he didn't want to give me false hope. I told him that we will go separate paths then. He kept saying how he wanted to be friends. That stung. I don't want to be friends.

I am a complete mess ever since the break up. He went from a caring person to someone completely cold. He contacted me a week after the breakup to return my things and saying again how he wanted to be friends. I said I will have my friend return things. A week ago he contacted me again asking me how things are. I didn't respond. He again messaged me to return my things and asked how I was. I couldn't handle it anymore. I told him ""I can't be friends with you right now. You will get your things"". He then said that he will be here if I ever want to be his friend. Good luck.

I'm so heartbroken. I'm doing the NC but I keep wanting to contact him. It sucks so much cause I thought for the longest time he saw so much hope and potential with the relationship and I was the one dragging along. I feel like the fighting really got to him to the point he doesn't see a future. But when he broke up with me, I genuinely did. And sadly, I still do. I truly believe that I am willing to put in the work to make it work. I really feel like our fights were due to immaturity and being stuck in a mode of thought...but he doesn't want to do it. He probably doesnt think the 2-3 years long distance is worth it.

So redditors, it sucks being stuck in this mentality where I think we have potential and he doesn't. I'm struggling with the NC. I really want to contact him and be angry for him giving up..but I know that won't do me any good.

So at this point, how do I move forward? Should I ever suggest meeting up with him in the future?"

4ydo6w,4,2016-08-18,Here's my experience comparing the Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot to Tesla's Autopilot.,FLDJF713,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/4ydo6w/heres_my_experience_comparing_the_mercedesbenz/,"Please visit my full blog post on Oppositelock for better text view and photos: [here](http://oppositelock.kinja.com/the-mercedes-benz-drive-pilot-on-a-2017-e-class-1785326021?rev=1471542248682#)

I was invited by The Drive’s Alex Roy to be witness to and help document the Drive Pilot system on the 2017 Mercedes-Benz E Class sedan.

Having previously driven Tesla’s Autopilot for only a few days, I knew off the bat that I wouldn’t be the expert in the car and I should rather use my unfamiliarity of autonomous driving to my advantage; I didn’t really have any preconceived notions of the Drive Pilot system regardless of what Roy had written.

From cobblestone roads in DUMBO to the highways on Long Island, the E Class was put through its paces and tested it in the most favorable conditions and throughout varying levels of difficult roadways and neighborhoods. All of the knobs were turned, dials twisted and buttons pressed; every setting was tested to truly rule out any incompetence from the inability to understand a system’s settings or preferences. 

And so the day began.

**Problem #1: The radar/camera system (DISTRONIC/Distance Pilot), if it can find a car, will follow that car off an exit or cut off others to keep the car in view**

We started out in SoHo just after 10 AM and made our way out to Red Hook in Brooklyn. Roy wanted to test and document the system for the entire journey.

ANY driver-assist system uses optical sensors to read lanes, radar/ultrasonic sensors to determine distance of things around the car, cameras to monitor distance as well, etc... A large majority of NYC has so many imperfections in the roads — especially fading/nonexistent lane painting – that it would make this test very hard to test some of the systems.

It seemed to follow the vehicles in front of us pretty well at times, but sometimes too well. It would lock onto a vehicle in front of us and follow its direction of travel, even if It meant drifting into other drivers’ lanes to keep pace with the truck in front of us.

According to page 165 of the user manual, it states: *If the system detects that there are no lane markings, it uses the vehicle ahead as a reference up to a speed of 80 mph.* Great, but what if that vehicle takes a detour, drives on the shoulder to avoid the horrors of the BQE, or is just a general asshole on the road? You’re now an accomplice by DISTRONIC proxy.

Often, the LCD dashboard display would indicate it lost sight of the 11” truck in front of us, even while stopped at a red light. Mercedes claims the 3D camera can see up to 70m away, with the 2D camera at 90m. It struggled at 2m sometimes. Other times, it kept a view of the vehicle in front to those distances easily.

Later, while driving on the BQE and stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, the system changed lanes and followed the van in front of us. However, the driver was going to an off-ramp but that wasn’t the route to take. That’s where the LKAS and LCA came into play.

 
**Problem #2: Lane Keep Assist (LKAS) &amp; Lane Change Assist (LCA)**

The lane-keep assist (LKAS) system seemed to do anything but keep our lane. Both the adaptive and standard settings were applied; neither seemed to yield somewhat safe results in my opinion. Straight road with well-paved markers? Sure, it does what it’s marketed to.

However, with a slight bend on the highway, the car halfway over into the lane to our right. No warnings. No beeps, chimes, dings or visual alerts warned us of any sort of issue. Had a vehicle been in the lane next to us, we would have certainly hit it.

The blindspot audible warnings only came on with the push of the turn signals. If the Merc was purposely drifted into someone’s lane or the LKAS did, the car either didn’t see or care about what was to the left or right of us. Or if it did, I certainly had no idea.

Lane Change Assist did seem to work as advertised in terms of function, no complaints here on my end. While the Drive Pilot system is engaged a push of the turn signal stalk and the car will scan the lane you’re looking to move to, determine it’s safe and make the change for you.

 
**Problem 3: DISTRONIC/Automatic Emergency Braking was a little late to the game**

Go to page 164 of the user manual for the car and you’ll find this: *Distance Pilot DISTRONIC does not react: to people or animals, to stationary obstacles in the road e.g. stopped or parked vehicles, to stationary obstacles on the road e.g. stopped or parked vehicles if conditions are not sufficient to enable detection.

AS A RESULT, DISTANCE PILOT DISTRONIC MAY NEITHER GIVE WARNINGS NOR INTERVENE IN SUCH SITUATIONS. Distance Pilot DISTRONIC cannot always clearly identify other road users and complex traffic situations. In these conditions, Distance PILOT DISTRONIC may: give an unnecessary warning and then brake the vehicle, neither give a warning nor intervene, accelerate or brake unexpectedly.*

This is all technical and legal writing to prepare you for the who-knows-what the car may do when you engage the systems. And the warnings are very accurate. It had no issue reading the BMW X6 at 70m in front of us on a bumpy highway.

But while traveling at the speed limit towards a red light with cars ahead, the Merc didn’t seem to care. No noises, no notification from the car that something was ahead. It finally started to brake before a human foot took the pedal further down.

Page 159 of the user manual states that the *system brakes your vehicle with up to 50% of the maximum possible braking power. If great deceleration performance is required, a visual and acoustic warning is given and you must intervene yourself.*

NOPE. No chimes, dings or visual alerts appeared during a time where an accident was imminent.


**Overview: Not worth the $10K+ for Drive Pilot**

There are no audible notifications to alert the driver of these changes. That’s not good. It’s a driver-assistance system, not a fully self-driving car (labeled as Level 4 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). But between the pulled advertising claiming a very similar experience and claims that it is just as good (if not better) than Tesla’s Autopilot, I just can’t write that it is.

These systems are marketed to make you a safer driver or at least to make the driving experience safer, relying a large part on driver skill. You could be Chris Harris and you still could get into an accident with Autopilot, Drive Pilot, Palm Pilot. These systems cannot account for OTHER drivers’ skills but can do their best to reduce any threat with the help of their owners. Or at least, that’s what their marketed to do.

Spend that money for the systems and take a defense driving course for the next 50+ years, hire an intern to answer your emails and texts for you while you drive or even hire a chauffeur for you at that point in price. 90% of the time, I was happier driving the great E Class as the sole driver.

**TL;DR: The Drive Pilot system made the drive more confusing, leaving the driver guessing a majority of the time whether or not the car was going to react to very clear situations in front of it. I felt safer with the systems disabled; driving with the system engaged added too many uncertainties. The only time it worked well was in crawling highway traffic with perfectly-paved lanes.**

*Disclaimer: This is my own independent review from a morning experience with Editor-at-Large Alex Roy of The Drive. This opinion does not represent the views of Roy, The Drive or anyone else but myself. The 2017 E-Class was provided by Mercedes-Benz as a result of one of his recent pieces comparing Tesla’s Autopilot to Mercedes-Benz’s Drive Pilot.*"

So, here's my dilemma. I am at Penn State (not main) doing a Information Sciences and Technology bachelor degree program. I will graduate in May, maybe.

My GPA is terrible. It was below a 2.0 and I finally got it past that. I'm not going to give the reasons why it happened; I don't want to make excuses.

Anyway, I need an internship to graduate. I'm worried for two reasons: 1) This isn't a traditional CS degree and 2) that's a terrible GPA.

Does anyone have any tips for making sure I get an internship besides 1) applying everywhere and 2) not putting my GPA on my resume?

Also, what about when I do graduate? I know many employers don't ask about GPA, but is there anything I can do to make myself look better?

I have one project that I feel is good enough for my resume that will be completed by the end of this year and I feel it's a fairly large project using a couple different technologies, but I'm worried that won't be enough.

Any tips?

Thanks all."

I'm currently a rising third year in UC Berkeley, majoring in Molecular Biology and Computer Science. 

I'm very concerned with my GPA in regards to grad school. Taking classes for both majors have made it hard for me to maintain high grades. I'm guessing that I'll be around a B+ to A- average, which is enough to make the minimum threshold but not enough to be very competitive. 

I've been working in a lab since my first year (and am starting a more independent project now); I briefly worked on a project in another lab that I'm still lightly involved in. I'm also TA-ing a CS course, and hoping to get an internship next summer. 

I guess my question is, what can I do to improve my chances of getting into graduate school (I have 2.5 more years of undergrad)? Would it be advisable to drop one of the majors to ensure higher grades? I'm also wondering if schools will take into account the slight GPA deflation in Berkeley. I'm looking to apply to a neurobiology program, although I hope to explore what CS research is like before I graduate.

I'd appreciate any advice I can get; thanks in advance for the help!"

I've always been a relatively sheltered and quiet kid, liked to stay inside, not too many friends, didn't go out at all, so I never really butted heads with my parents over anything. However, when college started, this all changed, and comments from others have lead me to believe that some of my family dynamics are far from normal.

Prior to college, I had never so much as seen a bottle of liquor, and as you can imagine, I was the staple sheltered college student who got too wild and drank and partied a little too much. I was a comp sci/business student at a reputable university, and my grades were fantastic. I also TA'd for other undergrad students, so I figured I was making a pretty good name for myself. I had also started dating a girl, Emily(F19) from a nearby university. I was quite happy and things were going well. Towards the end of the year, I started exploring weed and would regularly pick up for my friends so we could split it and save some money. It made me feel like I was cool and needed, so I never really stopped to consider the legal aspects of what I was doing. However, as you can imagine, I got caught in a not so pretty situation. Due to this, I ended up getting suspended from my university (instead of expelled as they found me to be incredibly forthcoming and vulnerable during my disciplinary hearing) and I recently found out that all my criminal charges would be dropped pre arraignment due to my regret and numerous glowing character recommendations.

When I arrived back home, things were less than stellar with my conservative, catholic parents. While my parents footed all of my lawyer bills and even came to court once with me, something that I was very grateful for, my mother was very quick to take personal offense at my actions. Instead of understanding that my actions were my own, and spurred on by my already diagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder (I don't wish to undermine my actions. I'm fully responsible for them, but I also realize that I was more prone to addiction due to a diagnosed condition), she said she couldn't believe that ""I would do this to her"" and how Emily was partially responsible. Emily, for reference, was not involved in this situation at all, and actively encouraged me against purchasing drugs for friends. However, she herself smokes in moderation (much less than I did), which my mother found out by invading my privacy, and apparently that was enough to blame her. Emily is also Chinese, which my mother does not support at all. She continuously said that ""Asian girls don't care about anyone but themselves and she just wants to get things out of you. For reference, Emily had began working much earlier than I had, and has already build up a respectable bank account. She quite often foots the bill on our dates, and NEVER has done anything that would lead any person to believe what my mother is saying. She's incredibly smart, polite, ambitious, and I have no doubts that she will be very successful in her field (education) due to her passion and empathy. My mother has been ""casually"" racist before, but this is much worse than I had ever seen from her. She attempts to limit the time I spend with Emily, and makes me feel guilty and shameful every time I want to spend time with her. I frequently have to lie and say that I'm visiting another friend, something which I feel very guilty about.

My parents went away for the week and left my at my grandmothers house, so I went out to visit Emily quite frequently, unbeknownst to them. However, little did I know that they were sending my grandfather to check on me several times a day to make sure that I was actually where I said I would be. This culminated into my phone dying for an hour while I was heading back home from Emily's city (30 minutes away), and turning my phone on to find 10 missed calls, threats of them returning from their vacation early, threats to take my phone away, promises to make sure I never see Emily again, threats to stop paying for my education, and much more. There are details that I'm leaving out that I can elaborate on, but Emily always feels uncomfortable and unwelcome around them. I'm working 3 jobs, I rarely go out much, and I'm actively trying to get an internship in computer science, but I don't know how much longer I can tolerate feeling shamed for not dating the girl that my mom ""picked for me"". 

I don't know if i'm just being an ungrateful son or if there's more at play here. There are a bunch of details I'm leaving out, as I can barely think right now, but I can answer any questions as they come up. I just want to feel like a normal person, and not a sheltered 13 year old anymore. It's hurting my relationships, my self esteem, and my mental health. I would love to move out and begin being responsible on my own, but I'm not ready to just take that on out of nowhere and I don't want to make any irrational decisions. I would love some advice if anyone has any. Sorry for the word vomit.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I don't like how things are going with my mother but I don't know how to make them change. It doesn't feel right to me."

##Rivals 

***

* [](#f/xavier) **Xavier Musketeers**

I am only versed in the recent history of this rivalry, but let me be clear: We. Fucking. Hate. Xavier. Things have been heated ever since the infamous [Water Fountain Game](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=293532086). Most of the Butler community views the Xavier team and fanbase with contempt, especially since the Xavier-Cincy brawl (when no one got suspended - looking at you Chirs Volde-Mack). Most recently, we've been having a good laugh about [JP Macura getting arrested](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2629154-jp-macura-arrested-latest-details-mugshot-and-comments) for flashing his junk to the cops. This rivalry is heavily one-sided in favor of Xavier, 37-18, but doesn't drown out the fire that is brought to every match up.

* [](#f/indiana) **Indiana Hoosiers**

Meh. Not really a rivalry, but IU simply does not have a case to claim ""Best Team in the State"" this century. Nor do Purdue or Notre Dame for that matter. This is more of a ""fuck off, big brother"" type deal. Our record in the [Crossroads Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossroads_Classic) shows as much.

* [](#f/marquette) **Marquette Golden Eagles**

Also not quite a rivalry, but ever since the [2012 Maui Invitational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5Q8Se7GurM) and joining the Big East, these games have had an air of excitement surrounding them. As far as I'm aware, there's no bad blood between our two teams, just plain old basketball. These are good games and Butler and Marquette fans alike should pay attention in the coming year. This could be the start of a purely skill-based rivalry.

***

##The Greats

***

**Greatest Games** 

* **[National Championship vs. [](#f/duke) 1 seed #3 Duke (2010)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzDZql2qExU&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL9WSsnpWNE8NLTj3BaxYcvFtQEdekKBNc)**

When I close my eyes, I can still see Hayward's shot. I swear it's going in. This time it will, I know it. For one day, we were all Butler Bulldogs. Yes, we lost this game. But that doesn't take away anything that the team did that year. We lost our final non-conference game and the team said, ""fuck this shit, let's run train on these bitches"" except the white boy Indiana equivalent. They went undefeated in Horizon League play. They swept the Conference Tournament. They beat four nationally ranked teams in a span of two weeks to reach the national championship, the smallest school to get there since Nova in 1985. Butler has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in this lost. They did more than any other team in that tournament.

* **[Elite Eight vs. [](#f/florida) 2 seed #13 Florida (2011)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdIt8o1vyrY)**

This was sweet, sweet revenge for knocking us out of the 2000 and 2007 Tournaments. We were down at the half. We were down halfway through the second half. Our Lord and Savior Brad Stevens calls on a rarely used frosh, Chrishawn Hopkins, and he knocks down a trey, to the delight of Gus Johnson. This sparks a rally that allows the Bulldogs to tie it up and send it to overtime. Who doesn't love OT in the NCAA Tournament? Butler gets the job done in OT to get to their second consecutive Final Four.

* **[Crossroads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvvE8_ZC4fI) [Classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmSNj2znNcw) vs. [](#f/indiana) #1 Indiana (2012)**

This was a nail-biter the whole 45 minutes of game time. Also this your 101 class on ""Scrub to Schollie"" taught by Alex Barlow, the walk-on guard who was granted a scholarship just days after hitting the game winner against the #1 team in the country. Butler's first ever victory against a #1 ranked team. Sweet satisfaction that lead to many social media posts of ""#1 in the country - #2 in the state.""
&gt;I would also like to take this time to point out a few glorious tidbits. IU's first ever basketball game in the 1900-01 season was a loss to Butler, 17-20. When Old Assembly Hall hosted its first basketball game on February 21, 1901, that too was a loss to Butler 20-24. The following season IU opened the season against, you guessed it, Butler, losing 15-17. Fourth time was the charm though, a 32-29 win. Thank you for your time.

&gt;P.S. Bet you won't show your faces in Hinkle any time soon...Scared?

* **[ESPN Gameday vs. [](#f/gonzaga) #8 Gonzaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp6LBdiX-0g)**

If you like college basketball, what more could you *conceivably* ask for in a game? Two high ranking mid-majors (at the time, I **will** fight you if you think Butler is a mid-major today) duking it out in one of the top 5 places in the country to see a basketball game. Dick Vitale having a stroke because of the finish. Can I just point out one thing? Roosevelt Jones, the dude who score the winning bucket, WAS NOT EVEN IN THE GAME WHEN BUTLER TRAVELED. **HE. WAS. NOT. IN. THE. GODDAMN. GAME.** BRAD STEVENS YOU ABSOLUTE GENIUS.

**Greatest Players:**

* **Ralph ""Bucksot"" O'Brien (1946-1950)** - I literally have no idea who this guy is at all, but his nickname was Buckshot and that's dope. Last Butler player to be drafted to the NBA before Gordon Hayward in 2010.

* **Bobby Plump (1954-1958)** - the man who made [The Milan Miracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Milan_High_School_basketball_team) happen which inspired everyone's favorite non-Space Jam basketball movie, Hoosiers.

* **Joel Cornette (1999-2003)** - Thousand point scorer. 700+ rebounds. Helped to lead Butler into national prominence at the turn of the century. This dude grew 3-4 inches between his freshman and sophomore years. How bout that? By the way, do you like [put-back dunks for wins over IU? Joel did](https://twitter.com/DaveFurst/status/765660338989694976)He passed away recently at the too young age of 35. He will be missed.

* **Darnell Archey (1999-2003)** - Ever wonder how many consecutive free throws someone made in college basketball? Well the record is 85, and Archey owns it. His streak lasted from February 15, 2001 until January 18, 2003.

* **Matt Howard (2007-2011)** - the poster child of [picking noses](http://imgur.com/a/NyCIt), [terrible mustaches](http://imgur.com/a/c9j3e), and [bloody faces](http://imgur.com/a/hvcJk). Oh also the #4 scorer in school history. Key player on both runner-up teams in 2010 and 2011.

* **Gordon Hayward (2008-2010)** - The tennis player and professional gamer who also does some basketball related activities from time to time.

* **Shelvin Mack (2008-2011)** - A lights-out shooter and the #13 all time scorer at Butler, Mack was instrumental in getting the team back to the National Championship in 2011. Now he's getting the band back together in Utah as a teammate of Gordan Hayward on the Jazz.

* **Andrew Smith (2009-2013)** - Thanks to the amazing tournament runs of 2010 and 2011, you all know how Andrew was as a player. And thanks to his incredibly strong widow, Samantha, you all know how Andrew was as a human being. I want to personally thank this subreddit for the outpouring of support for Andrew and the Butler community during those troubling times.

* I'm going to leave off **Roosevelt Jones** and **Kellen Dunham** for the time being since they are still pretty fresh in our minds. But don't get me wrong, they are two of the greatest players in the history of Butler University.

**Greatest Coaches**

* **Harlan Page (1920-1926) 100-30** Before there was any sort of real national tournament, Page led the Bulldogs to the 1924 AAU National Championship. (SO THERE. We did it!)

* **Tony Hinkle (1926-1942, 1945-1970) 559-395** This dude coached Butler for 41 years, not including the time he took a break to GO FIGHT IN WORLD WAR II GOT DAMN. Oh, he also INVENTED the orange basketball. You're welcome. And one more tiny detail,  THEY NAMED THE DAMN FIELDHOUSE AFTER HIM WHILE HE WAS STILL COACHING THERE. Literally a living legend at the time.

* **Barry Collier (1989-2000) 196-132** The man who almost single-handedly saved Butler Basketball. Many people don't know this, but the year before Collier took over, Butler was considering dropping to D3 or even cancelling the program. Barry said ""Fuck that shit"" and wrote a 40 page thesis on how he was going to rebuild the program and institute what he learned under Tony Hinkle - what we know today as [The Butler Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butler_Way) - and threw it at the University President's head yelling, ""GIMME"" (I may be paraphrasing those events, though the 40 page thesis is true).

* **Thad Matta (2000-2001) 24-8** Hired Brad Stevens.

* **Todd Lickliter (2001-2007) 131-61** Coached Butler to its first Sweet Sixteen in program history. Promoted Brad Stevens to full time assistant coach. Made Iowa a laughing stock for 3 years.

* **[Brad Stevens](http://i.imgur.com/PTxVeNj.jpg) (2007-2013) 166-49** Find me a better Xs and Os coach in the sport right now and I'll kiss you on the mouth. A rock on the sideline to both players and fans alike. He coached the hell out of those Cinderella teams in 2010 and 2011. On July 3rd, 2013, the world ended as the Boston Celtics stole him from us (though I'm a fan of them now by default). To no one's (in college basketball) surprise, he took a shit roster in the Celtics and started winning games. Danny Ainge panicked and traded off the rest of the team leaving Stevens with little more than some old guys, some bench players, and [a mop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Olynyk). This turned into a [completely different situation](http://imgur.com/a/884MP), and in his second year made it to the playoffs with some slightly better scrubs. I digress, this is college basketball's subreddit.

##Traditions

***

I'm not really aware of any particular traditions around Butler Basketball so here are some throwaways.

* Many Dawg Pound members eat Chick-fil-A sandwiches before games and have brief mental breakdowns when Butler plays on a Sunday.

* One fun annual tradition is destroying Purdue and sometimes IU in the Crossroads Classic.

*** 

*Campus and Surrounding Area*

***

**City Population**: 853,173 (2015 est.)

**City Skyline**: [Indianapolis, Indiana](http://imgur.com/a/iWAPI). Also, did your city's fanciest hotel [cover itself with a giant NCAA Tournament Bracket?](http://imgur.com/a/8Equa) Didn't think so.

**Iconic Campus Buildings** - 

[Holcomb Observatory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/HolcombObservatory.JPG), home of the largest telescope in Indiana.

[Irwin Library](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Irwin_Library_Butler_Univ.jpg), designed by the same person who designed the World Trade Center's Twin Towers.

[Hinkle Fieldhouse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Hinkle.png), again because ain't she a beauty?

**Local Dining**

* [Scotty's Dawghouse](http://www.scottysbrewhouse.com/locations/locations/scotty-s-dawghouse/) is the newest and (heavily biased) best eatery that is little more than a hop, skip, and a jump [away from Hinkle.](http://imgur.com/a/8ezBI) View from the patio I took a few months ago. Scotty's is a Indiana chain that can be found all over Indy.

* The many restaurants and bars of [Broad Ripple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Ripple_Village,_Indianapolis) and Downtown Indy (both a 5-10 minute drive from campus)

* NOT Butler Dining. It's better than it was 6 years ago, but it's still bad.

***

**Famous Alumni** 

Other than basketball related people and a bunch of people I've never heard of, Butler has a couple other relatively famous Alumni, and one whopper of a graduate.

* [Ed Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Carpenter_(racing_driver) - IndyCar driver

* [Pat Neshek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Neshek) - MLB relief pitcher

* Last but not least, and the reason Butler is always near the top of those annual lists of ""The Worst Graudates of the NCAA Tournament Teams,"" [Jim Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones) of the infamous Jonestown Cult mass murder-suicide.

***

##Random Trivia

***

* Butler has yet to beat Villanova since joining the Big East, causing these games to be some of the best we play every year.

* Butler has one of the top 3 dance programs in the country. We're talking Julliard level here, if not better. 

* Butler's Lacy School of Business is #1 in the country for internships. They *require* you to have 2 internships to graduate.

* I made a half court shot at a game and won a tv.

***

##What Is and What is to Come

***

Butler's current head coach is Chris Holtmann (2 N's - don't forget). He took over on an interim basis in 2014 and was named full time head coach in January of 2015. He has done a stellar job guiding this team through a rough patch following the departure of Brad Stevens. Holtmann has taken Butler to two consecutive NCAA tournaments, winning a game each time. Under his tutelage, we have seen the flourishing Kellen Dunham and Roosevelt Jones, the growth of Andrew Chrabascz, and the rising stars in Kelan Martin and Tyler Wideman. One thing that Coach Holtmann is doing at Butler that is radically different from the days of yore is casting a WIDE and public net for recruiting. In the past, it seemed like few people knew about the recruits until they committed. Now, all of the coaches are hitting the recruiting trail extremely hard and as a result, Butler has been making the final cuts of a lot of top notch players. Here's to hoping we land them all!

4ye1iy,5,2016-08-18,Want to get a job in the bay area after graduating but i go to a terrible unknown state school in CA. How much will this hurt me?,olxew99,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ye1iy/want_to_get_a_job_in_the_bay_area_after/,"I live in the bay area but i go to a completely mediocre and unknown California State University here in CA. I am entering my 3rd year at this school and will be looking for internships this summer as it will be my last summer before graduating so its my last chance to get an internship. I have none up to this point.

I want to return home to the bay area after graduating but i feel like i wont get a job here. The competition is insane in the bay area. Nearly every CS person wants to come here because it is the tech capital so there are tons of people from all over the world fighting for these jobs.

How much is having a bad school on my resume going to hurt me when i apply for these bay area jobs? Will being a local applicant help me out in any way? For example, the other day i saw a VMWare software engineering internship that required students to be pursuing a degree from a top tier university. 

My GPA is not great so if i want to transfer i could only get in to an average out of state school but would at least be more well known. Something like University of Nevada Reno, University of Arizona, Arizona State University. Would it be worth paying out of state tuition for these schools if they at least give me a more well known school name?

My goal after graduation is to just find a decent job here in the bay area. Decent job as in market rate salary and preferable a nice work environment. Is it possible? Or are my opportunities going to be limited because of my bad school name?

Thanks guys."
4yelt7,48,2016-08-18,[NeedAdvice] How to lose my own sense of self entitlement and find out logically what I want,WewLadderino,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/4yelt7/needadvice_how_to_lose_my_own_sense_of_self/,"So for the past years I've always thought I have figured out what I want in life, but I think I have just subtly been lying to myself.

To give you some context: After graduating high school in my country (Germany) I enrolled into a CS program at a university. My favorite subject in school was maths and I have been programming on-and-off for some time, so it seemed like a logical choice. I had a very smug attitude towards most of my (then) 17 or 18 year old friends who basically had no idea what they wanted to become and needed time to ""figure things out"".

But the truth is: I know I want to be a programmer but I have no idea in what field. In the past 2 and half years (out of a 3+2 year degree) I basically weaseled my way through anything challenging. I took the required classes, got decent-enough grades, but never did anything outside of school other than working at a really mediocre job which I only keep because the work is easy enough I can get it done in half the time while my boss doesn't care and I get the full salary (basically slightly better than minimum wage).

There are probably a billion different ways you can go in CS: application or web programming, graphics programming, systems/embedded programming, network programming, physical simulation stuff, robotics, machine learning and god knows what else

Now, I'm not asking you to choose my career path for me, because I don't think you want to or can. But I'd like to ask for advice about one particular thing:

I have a very smug attitude and a sense of self-entitlement that I HAVE TO and WILL end up in some high-quality very (mentally) demanding job, because - I don't really know why. Internally I justify it this way:

- I just keep telling myself that if I ""end up"" as a web developer or IT guy that I will be replacable, working below my ""standards"" and might as well be a taxi driver (no offence).

- Somebody HAS to do the ""hard stuff"", like find new machine learning algorithms, and if it's not me - who else?

- Some kind of peer pressure: You always tend to see other students do impressive things in certain classes, getting internships at high-profile companies, but ignore probably the ""regular"" crowd

- If I become such a ""plebeian"" programmer, I'm just taking ""the easy way out"", I'm ""missing out"" on opportunities (probably those are essentially just ways of telling myself I'm a ""special snowflake"" who deserves better)

Now I have not really figured out that I have followed this negative and stupid mindset for years until recently. I have been writing my first (out of two) thesis, and I chose a very sophisticated and hard topic in the medical computing field for the aforementioned reasons.
I suck at it. My advisor is really nice and helps me out with a lot of points and eventually, looking at it long enough, I get it. And I will probably finish my thesis with a mediocre grade. But it has dawned me that I *just don't like it*. The super high level maths (I'm not bad at calculus and stuff, but if I have to research something and the primary application for this turns out to be ""advanced quantum physics"" my toenails begin to shift upwards). The hours and hours and hours of looking at literature and then being explained things like you're a 6 year old anyway. I don't find joy in this. It makes me feel like I don't belong where I am now.

Yes, eventually it works out. But is this worth my time? Is it worth my sanity? Or should I just give up the sense of self-entitlement and resort to something ""easier"". But then immediately my inner voice kicks in ""you're a coward"", ""you could do better"" etc. Then my other voice ""web development can also be hard, don't be an entitled prick"" kicks in, I become confused and resort to doing nothing at all (probably the worst of choices).

Thank you to anyone who finished reading this confusing post and I hope you can share some insight with me.

I wish you all the best."

Hopefully this helps the reddit world. 


#1. Give her Space. 

This is super important. Can't stress this enough. Bonnie Raitt said/sang it best. ""I can't make you love me, if you don't."" It's easy to think that maybe if you could have done/said the right things, you might change her mind or rethink what she's doing. Attractive thought, but not practical. All you can do is make your initial case- then let her compile the data and come to a conclusion. You don't want someone to love you because you convinced them, anyway. You want them to come back because they can't imagine their life without you. Only they can come to this conclusion. How do you help them make a decision? By giving them space to think. The best way by far that's worked for me or any friend I've ever talked to is- go no contact. 

It sucks, and it's hard, but it's by far the most effective way. One- it actually makes the girl realize what life is like without your support. She doesn't have you to fall back on for everything. Two- it will make her wonder what you're up to and what you've got going on that's causing you not to talk to her. Three- it's the respectful thing to do. If a girl wants to end things- then do the initial protest, if that doesn't work, give her what she wants. This shows that you are trying to work with her needs not against them (are sensitive to what she's going through, cuz this is tough on her as well)- also shows that you don't think you know what's best for her (even if you do). No one wants to be told what to do regarding a huge life decision. They want to come up with the idea on their own. 

I'd recommend going no contact for at least 3-4 weeks. Don't ever reach out to her. If she texts or calls you. Respond respectively- but don't allude to you wanting her back or anything regarding the relationship. Keep it light. If she eventually wants you back- she's gonna be BLOWING UP your phone (because she'll be worried she scared you away for good). At that point, you can ease back into things- but take it SUPER SLOW. 

After 3-4 weeks of no contact. Check up on her. Don't mention the relationship. Don't try to sell yourself. Just open the lines of dialogue. You'll be able to tell right away if she's open to it or not. If things are the same or worse- then go another 3-4 weeks and repeat the process until either A) she doesn't answer. Or isn't trying to contact/see you. Then it's time to move on. B) She's really interested in seeing/contacting you. Once again- take it super slow if this happens. You don't want to appear too eager. After all, she needs to regain your trust because you don't want to be with someone who might leave you at any moment. In my experience, usually there's not much variation between A) and B). It's pretty polarized. 

#2 Get something positive going in a different aspect of your life

After a breakup it feels like everything sucks and nothing is good. That's totally normal. How do you counteract that? Make an improvement somewhere else. Here's a few aspects of your life you can optimize. The purpose of this is- if the girl asks her friends or sees you in the future- you want your life to have been better than when she left. It's imperative. If she looks at you and sees you're the same or worse off- GAME OVER. 

1- Hit the gym hard! 

Exercise releases endorphins and makes you happy. It keeps your mind off the big picture and puts you in the NOW. This really helps during a breakup. Not only will you feel better- YOU'LL LOOK BETTER. Eating healthy also helps. Skip the fast food and 4am burritos. Carbs and processed food are like poison to your body and drag you down. What you put in, is what you'll get out. 

2- Get a haircut or some new clothes- 

A fresh cut, shave, and a little new style is clutch in this situation. A subtle change in your routine will do wonders. If you feel like you look great, you'll feel more confident. A breakup can really shake things up, so anything you can do to keep your self esteem high is awesome. Plus, if she's stalking you on social media, she'll see you looking fly and you aren't scrubbing out in shame- but embracing life. 

3- Work on your mental/spiritual health- 

We've got the body covered, time to focus on the mind. Read/watch something for pleasure, and something for self actualization/spiritual purposes. Entertainment will keep your mind off the bad vibes, and meditation/praying will clear the noise. You want to come out of this breakup a better man than when you entered it. Knowledge and spirituality will help you on that path. Imagine you're leveling up a character in a video game. More XP the better! Get that body and mind healthy and in tune. Take a lot of time to think about what you really want in life- and what's important to you. Is having a good job more important than having a lot of free time? Is travel important? What do you want out of a partner (besides physical attributes)? What can you do to put yourself on the best mental path to reaching your goals? Is there anything you fear? If so, then why? How can you edge out that fear? etc. 

4- Work on your school/career path- 

Make an improvement here. Go for a new sales goal at work. Take an extra class. Sign up for study abroad. Take an internship. Start opening doors for yourself in other areas after one closes. There's nothing more attractive to a partner than a person who knows what they want and has the guts and determination to get them there. Take this time to lay out some short term and long term life goals. A smart person once told me:

""There's two big questions you need to ask yourself in your lifetime: What am I going to with my life, and who do I want to come with me? ... If you get those in the wrong order- you're in trouble."" 

I've learned that the hard way. 

#3- Hang out with friends and family. 

A lot of people have your back and will be there for you. Don't take this for granted. Spend time with your support system. Have some laughs and smiles. Try to enjoy the little things. Apply all the time you used to spend with your S.O. to your friends and family. Some of the most deep and profound conversations happen after a breakup. It's definitely the silver lining to the cloud. Also, your network usually mentions you to all their cute friends, and soon- you've got some dates lined up (for when you're ready). 

#4- Take some time to reflect on the relationship and how you can learn from it

Don't obsess over the ""why"". People are usually careful about revealing their true intentions when they do the dumping. You might never find out exactly what happened. But that's not important. What's important is realizing what worked and what didn't work in the relationship. What did you argue about, and why. What REALLY caused you to feel the way you did about her. What really caused you to not get along sometimes. Were you insecure, jealous, angry about certain things? If so, why? One of the hardest things in life is to look at yourself honestly. People are generally afraid of what they might see. Ironically, this is one of the only ways to improve. Making yourself a better person should always be a constant goal. Do it for yourself. One of the most satisfying things in life is to be completely comfortable in your own skin. Also, the more you love yourself, the more love you'll have to give to someone else. Girls are really good at sniffing out inner turmoil. It worries them if you have an issue and you refuse to address it (not saying you do, of course, but it's helpful to know). Breakups are really great learning experiences. More than anything, you can figure out what traits/values/attributes you want in a partner and think will be successful when meshed with you. 

#5- Have some fun-

Get out there and experience some stuff. Go for a hike, join a rec-leauge sports team, go to a concert, go on a trip, dance with a cute girl. These are the things you remember in the end. When I look back on my life, I remember the fun times, not the girl I was with at the time. Don't put life on pause. Embrace it. Let life and all that happens work for you- don't try to fight it. 


Some final thoughts/mantras that helped me. 

Finding a good partner isn't about finding a perfect girl: it's about finding a girl who's perfect for you. 

Life gives you what you need. Trust in that. In some way you might have needed this. Either for her or you to be better for each other or for someone else.

One thing to look forward to- YOU GET TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN! Either with her or with someone else. That's a great feeling and you get to experience it again. It's one of the best things life has to offer and it's in your future! 

There's a worse kind of loneliness than actually being alone- it's being lonely when you're with someone. I feel bad for people who are married or in a long term relationship that is passionless and dead but are too scared to break it off because of family/friends/religion/unknown. That's the WORSE kind of heartache of all. Be grateful you aren't here and still have your life ahead of you. The day I broke up with my SO of 3 years, an uber driver in LA told me he's slept on the couch for five years because his wife tried to leave him and set up a new life romantically (and organizing his assets) with his brother when he had CANCER (he's healthy and in remission now). Because they were super religious and concerned about what their community/family would say, they remained together after he survived the cancer. Now he's stuck with a woman who would drop him at the first sign of trouble- and she hates him for surviving and making a fool out of her. ON THE COUCH FOR FIVE YEARS! No way. That won't be me, that won't be you. Why? Cuz we've been through a thing or two- learned from mistakes and hardships- and will come out knowing who to align our lives with. 

Lastly, know that each passing second (yes, even the ones that passed while you read this) brings you further away from the pain of the breakup and closer to LOVE. Either with her or some new super awesome chick. Every second that goes by is your life getting a little closer to your soulmate. Lovely thought. Keeps you going now and then. "
4yeoo4,0,2016-08-18,Buying half of a marketing agency,GreyWormWood,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/4yeoo4/buying_half_of_a_marketing_agency/,"
I need some advice on an opportunity and I may be too close to the whole situation to analyze all of my options objectively. I might also xpost to /r/advertising.

Sorry in advance for my really, really long post.

As far back as I can remember, I've always known that I wanted to be on the creative side of advertising. Because of this, I was able to start very young and I've always thought of my job as an extension of my education. I got my first Advertising internship at 16 and I was doing freelance work for local businesses before I was out of high school. By the time I started on my BFA, I had a part time job at a small 5 person boutique agency (I was basically one step above intern). I went to school nights and got real world experience while earning my degree. 

I've been working at this same small marketing agency (located in the North East, US) for the last 20 years - I went from Assistant Art Director to Art Director, then Senior Art Director and I'm now Associate Creative Director / VP. I know it's uncommon for someone to be at one place that long (and probably not the best thing for my career), but I've managed to find a place that provided me with the environment to create some really good work. It's never been about money for me - I love what I do. If I can do great work, pay my bills and have some money left over for drinks on the weekend - I'm happy. 

Also, working at a smaller place afforded me the opportunity learn about all aspects of the Agency. Strategy, Concepts, Media planning, Account Services, Print Production, Digital Marketing, TV, Radio, Front End Drupal (and Wordpress) Development, Copywriting (headlines and subheads), Art Direction, SEO, you name it. 

The Creative Director of this small agency (let's call him Joe) was formally a Creative guy at a big agency in NYC (for about 15-20 years) so all of our work is based on strategy and disciplines that he learned 40-50 years. Joe opened the business 25 years ago with his partner (let's call him Bill). Over the past 25 years, we've managed to find a niche in Healthcare, Banking, B2B and Insurance. We've survived a few recessions by cutting their salary (sometimes reducing their salaries to Zero for 6 months at a time). They did what they had to do to keep the Agency alive. Over the years, I've helped integrate things like Web, Digital Marketing, Social Media and SEO into our product offerings and we've done OK. 

A few years ago, Joe and Bill started having issues. Constant bickering led to animosity and although their personal relationship is in the toilet, they still maintain a somewhat descent business relationship for the sake of the Agency. 

The CD (Joe) is retiring next year and is looking to sell his half of the business. As part of his original partnership agreement with Bill, Bill has right of first refusal. Joe put together a buyout offer for Bill last year, and Bill didn't like the terms so he told Joe to go fly a kite. Their contract stated that if Bill didn't want to buy it, Joe can sell to someone else. However, Bill has to approve the buyer - and approve the terms of the sale (even though he's not the buyer). 

So, Joe approached me to see if I would be interested in buying him out. He said that he is going to give me a great deal given our relationship (but I'm not sure I know what a great deal should look like - it's not like a car where you can look up the value of a car based on mileage and condition). I'm in the process of finding a lawyer, and an independent accountant to review the books. I want to make sure that the deal we make is a solid business decision and not one based on my emotional connection to the Agency. If we come to an agreement, Joe will talk to Bill about it.

My intention is to figure out how much money is left for Salaries &amp; Profit after our bills and liabilities are taken care of - I believe they call this EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization). I'm not sure if this should include the partners salaries in this or not - I'm going to assume that our salaries are not part of the equation. If I then multiply this by 3x, I should come out with a number that should be close to the value of the company. I think. 

**Here's some Corporate background info:**

We are an S-Corp. Average annual billing is about 1.5m a year. Joe will be sending me the last 3 years of tax returns, general ledger for 2016 and outlook for 2017. I need to figure out how much of this billing is media, expenses and overhead and how much is left for salaries and profit. Right now, Joe and Bill are taking a salary of 60k a year and at the end of this year, Joe is projecting that the agency will have about 40k left over after expenses. 

Joe intends to withdraw half of the money left in the bank when he leaves at the end of the year. Since we usually keep any overage in the bank for (Jan/Feb) operating expenses, we’ll have a shortfall of about 20k. He’s also expecting to keep half of the revenue from invoices sent out before Dec 31, 2016 (minus expenses). I'll probably have to kick in 20k for operating costs. 

**BUYOUT OFFER**  

Joe wants $1,600 a month ($19,200 a year) for 5 years ($96k buyout can be paid up front or over several years). We’ll need to come to an agreement and sign a payout contract. Contract will stipulate that if business fails before the 5 year period, I’m NOT liable for the remaining balance. Because of this stipulation, I want to keep monthly payments low and extend the payment period as much as possible. Joe is open to a longer term that would allow for a lower monthly payment. We didn’t discuss if that would mean a higher total buyout. I would imagine that it would. 

*My main concern is making sure I can keep my current salary (about $85k + Bonuses) so I can pay Joe (as well as my mortgage) and build some income for our rainy day operating fund.* 

**My notes (and questions):** 

1. I'm going to see if he's willing to base the monthly payment on a percentage of my income as opposed to a set dollar amount. Alternatively, he might be open to a graduated payment ($900 monthly in Year1, $1000 monthly in Year2, etc.). That might ensure a greater chance of success – especially within the first few months (as we await new income to replenish our operating fund). In general clients will take a few months to pay (some 90 days) and it could be a while before we see some 2017 income. 

2. What is the buyout number usually based on?  We’ve lost a few big clients last year so this year’s income isn’t what it should be. I’ve asked for 3 years of tax returns and the quick books summary for 2016 P/L and a projection of 2017 income (which I can also figure out based on 2016 breakdown). Since I’m involved in the business already, I can verify most of the 2017 projections. Should I ask for anything else?

3. If the company is no longer viable, I’m off the hook. But what constitutes a “viable” business? We can have clients and they're paying us, but that doesn’t always equal profitability. Also, what happens if I want to walk away and Bill doesn’t? 

4. Joe says that he’d want to include the following stipulation: if we change the name of the company, our deal is still intact (he still wants his monthly payment). What happens if this venture fails and I open my own company down the road? Also, would I be prohibited from doing freelance work for any existing clients if the new business fails? What about completely new clients that have nothing to do with this venture? These are all questions for my lawyer, but should I ask any other questions? 

5. In my discussions with Joe, he feels that because I'm on my wife's health insurance plan, I should be getting a monthly check to cover Bill’s health insurance. He feels that a true 50/50 partnership means that I'm entitled to receive the cost of those benefits. This amount would come out to $600 a month. I think this is going to be a sticking point with Bill – aside from that, this isn’t guaranteed money. What happens if Bill gets married and goes on his wife's health plan or if my wife loses her job and I can no longer be on her health insurance. Also, is this how it works in partnerships work if one of the partners doesn't take health insurance? I want to make sure that Joe isn’t just looking for ways to get paid, and this is in fact common practice. 

6. Joe said that the Agency needs to issue stock. He's not sure if stock has already been issued, but he said that his lawyer will be able order it. Also, Joe mentioned that Bill and I have to create our own partnership contract – apart from whatever Joe and I arrange with our lawyers. I would imagine that the stock that Joe issues is for our current Agency. If Bill and I have to draw up paperwork for our NEW partnership, then wouldn’t that eliminate the need for stock in the current S-Corp?

7. Joe said he will make himself available to pitch in and for new business presentations after he retires at a rate of $200 an hour. This seems crazy to me. Is it unreasonable to ask to come to all new business meetings for free since his monthly check is contingent on our success?

8. I think that during the transition period (and at least until our current clients feel comfortable with Joe's retirement), we need to keep the name / letterhead / website / logos intact. We can then transition into the new entity and brand ourselves just as we would suggest of any of our clients. Is there any downside to keeping everything as is for a year or two?

9. The Agency is in desperate need of hardware and software upgrades. Our Adobe platform will need to be changed to a subscription based model, which will add to our monthly operating costs. We might be able to forgo our hardware upgrade for another year or two.

10. Currently Joe handles 75 percent of our billing, invoicing and other administrative tasks. I'm sure many of these tasks can be automated and I know there are programs designed specifically for small businesses to help with time sheets, billing, invoicing, etc. It's probably not wise to tackle that until the dust settles next year. But I have no idea where to start. Any recommendations? 

11. I have a superb credit score (over 830). Will this partnership (and any liabilities that come with it) have any negative impact on my credit rating or are the partners insulated because the S-Corp is it's own entity? 

12. Is my monthly payment to Joe pretax since it’s a business expense? Can I deduct this cost from my personal income taxes?

13. Can I collect unemployment as long as I don’t draw a salary? 

14. If I walk away from this deal – what are my obligations and responsibilities to the Agency? Can I legally go after our existing clients and start my own company? 

15. Bill initially rejected Joe’s buyout offer. I'm sure he's figured out by now that I'm the next logical person to ask. Since he still technically has the right to first refusal, he might be trying to get a better deal (knowing that Joe will give me better terms) - Especially since Bill has to review and approve Joe’s offer to me (according to Joe's lawyer).

16. I’m now 38. I believe that with my current skill set, experience and portfolio, I'll be just fine. But, I have no idea what kind of environment is waiting for me. From what I hear, it's tough out there - especially for a 40 year old.  

If you made it this far, thanks for reading!

I'm 22 years old and I just started grad school to get my masters of accountancy. A little bit of background: I've never really known what I wanted to do in life, so when I was in college, I took some accounting courses and decided to major in accounting and finance. I interned at a firm for two summers and enjoyed it because the people were great, but I didn't really enjoy the work at all. At the end of the second internship, I ended up accepting a job offer that I would take once I finished grad school. Towards the end of my undergrad, I realized that I was just doing accounting because it was pretty easy for me, and not because I had any passion for the work. I had somewhat of a breakdown over the summer because I really have no desire to get my CPA and work in public accounting. I feel like I've just been taking the easy road because I'm afraid of failing or being a disappointment. After talking to my parents, they were eventually supportive of me foregoing grad school and trying something different as long as I had a plan. I spent a few weeks trying to figure out my options, but everything seemed so risky compared to my current path, so I decided to just bite the bullet and start grad school anyways. Unfortunately, I still feel terrible about my decision and it's making it hard for me to motivate myself to work hard in my classes AND try and figure out other career paths that I can take. Everyone in my classes knows that they want to be in accounting and I feel so out of place, but I just don't know what else to do. 

So I guess my question is, have any of you gone through something like this? And if you have any suggestions for potential career paths or general life advice, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Note: I've started a free computer science course, and so far it's really interesting, but I don't know how viable a career in something like software development is for me at this point since I don't know much about it or whether I'm even good at it. "

4yewvs,1,2016-08-18,Just need to get this out,sadnessthegirl,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4yewvs/just_need_to_get_this_out/,"I made this account just to have a moment to spill everything I am feeling and thinking is wrong with me. 

I am pretty sure I am depressed. My mom has depression and anxiety and I always knew it was a risk. A couple years ago I went to therapy at my college because I thought I was depressed. I ended up just focusing on dealing with some more specific issues with things in my family but once I was able to work through that, I generally thought I was okay and not depressed, just ill equipped to handle difficult situations. 

I met my current partner and he was such a positive influence on me. He helped me overcome a lot of bad habits and I began to handle situations a lot better. Things were going really well for a while as he kept me accountable to do things that were healthy for me - like exercise, eating healthy at home, making sure all my coursework got completed, etc. I was so grateful for his love and support. 

I ended up getting an internship in a city far from him or my family one summer. I lived in an sublet apartment that ended up having mice. I quickly found out that I am phobically afraid of mice and I became incredibly anxious. I also had very loud upstairs neighbors. I ended spending every evening plagued with anxiety over the mice, unable to sleep from the anxiety and noise of my upstairs neighbors, and feeling intensely lonely from being so far away from home. I also wasn't living in the safest city or neighborhood which made my anxiety shoot through the roof. My roommate was also never home so every night I was alone in this apartment listening to mice scurry. I would only fall asleep once my body reached a point of exhaustion. 

Once I got out of that place and was headed back to school for my last quarter, I was so grateful and relieved and thought everything would be okay now. I moved into a really nice studio apartment. But, no roommates. I was always alone and my bf lived an hour and a half away from me. I ended developing feelings of deep emptiness and sadness. Moving to a new place didn't help much. 

Over summer I started binging food in order to get through the anxiety, a practice that continued even though I was in a completely safe and nice place. I would eat until I couldn't move and felt sick to my stomach. 

I began developing an ache in my chest. I even went to the doctor about it and had a test run and my heart was completely fine. He told me it must be stress. It was alarming to physically feel the weight and depth of my sadness and emptiness. 

I started to not go to class and do homework. This has never been me. I always did well in school and would only miss a class here and there. I had three classes that quarter and maybe went to a handful. Thankfully I was able to scrape by and pass by getting the homework done and help from friends. 

I would just lay in bed for days and eat. I would cry. Cry so much. 

But, I would be fine or act fine around others. I know how I need to be in front of people and how to not act depressed. I don't know if anyone in my life would actually think I was depressed if I actually am. On weekends when I was with my bf, we would have a great time and it would be like the other five days of my week weren't full of misery. 

I still binge eat often and have gained a lot of weight. All my clothes are tight but I can't seem to stop. When I am alone, the immense weight of my misery consumes me and all I want to do is escape. Either with food or TV usually. 

Sometimes at work I can barely get by doing the bare minimum. I have entire work days doing nothing and just pretending to work at my computer. 

My bf and I now live in the same city. When we are together, I make good choices because I know he can see everything I do and I don't want him to know how difficult simple things are for me and how miserable I might feel. I now always want him around because when he isn't, I don't sleep, I binge eat, and I lay in bed. With him, I get up early, keep the house clean, wake up early, do things I enjoy, etc. When he is gone, I literally do not have the motivation or will to do anything. 

The fact that I might be depressed hit me because the other day I felt relatively ""normal."" I felt so odd to not feel the giant boulder in my chest that I walk around with everyday. I prayed that God gave me more days like this.

But last night, the sadness washed over me again and I stayed up until 2 watching Netflix because I didn't want to try to sleep because I would be alone with my thoughts. I didn't want the next day to start either because I would have to go to work and function like my insides weren't dying inside. 

I brought up with my bf once that I thought I might be depressed, somewhat casually. And he sincerely thinks I'm not, and that I still just struggle with dealing with hard situations or have a hard time focusing. That if I just practice and try harder, all my problems would be fixed. He'll occasionally bring up how different I am and how much I've improved. He doesn't know that it's just because I know how to act and I know what he needs to see. The feelings, the deep sadness, and aching pain and misery I feel are still very much real no matter how I act on the outside. Even if I can pull myself together enough to make good decisions on the outside, my insides are in agonizing pain. 

I'll come on this thread periodically just to read about others who can relate to the pain. Just to not feel so isolated by it. 

I've never said any of this out loud and I never plan to tell anyone how I am actually feeling and what I am going through. But I just needed a minute to say all of it and hopefully to people who will understand.

I'm pretty close to finishing the thing enough to put it to one side for a while as I have designed it and prepared what to put in it. I was just wondering whether or not it's something that companies actually like to see or not and whether it will provide me with an advantage over others when seeking to get an internship during university and getting a graduate job afterwards.

4yfc69,4,2016-08-18,Switching firms for a promotion [advice],throwawayfuccboi2333,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4yfc69/switching_firms_for_a_promotion_advice/,"Hi - using a throwaway. Looking for some advice for those who have done something similar. 

I am currently in IT audit and do some data analytics for a Big 4. I just completed my first year and have a 4 month internship on top of that, so total tenure is 1 year 4 months. 

It is normal for people in my group to be promoted at the 2 year mark. I just got word from my performance review that I will not be promoted, but my performance was exceptional, but they want to see if I can maintain it. Thought this was BS and kind of unfair as they hired 2 really incompetent seniors who I frequently train from industry. I don't really think its fair that you are promoted based on your age rather than my performance. 

Anyways, I am looking to move to a bigger city and threw a resume out there for a Senior position at another big 4 in a similar role, given that I was basically doing senior work 6 months in.

I've gotten an offer with a big pay bump, senior title, and get to move to a bigger city. I have a compensation discussion with my partner in a bit, and I am wondering how I bring this up without pissing everyone off. We lose a lot of internal talent to this particular city via internal transfers and new hires who take an offer to the bigger city, so they will pretty much hate me if I do that and go to another firm, especially in a period where we are kind of understaffed due to people leaving. 

TLDR 
- Didn't get promoted after 1 year but thought I should, but know its not normal to be promoted this fast and hard to make business case
- Other B4 offered me promotion, $$, new location 
- How do I not piss everyone the fuck off"

Currently, I have a 3.5 overall gpa but my upper division Computer Science GPA is alot lower (3.25). What would be a more optimal choice for me straight out of school: Getting a Masters at a 2nd or 3rd tier school or going into industry right away? I have completed 2 very successful internships so I'm pretty certain that I can find a high paying job right out of school. However, how much more value would an MS in CS be, especially one from a 2nd or 3rd tier school since my GPA most likely isn't good enough for top MS programs? Also, will not having an MS put me at a much greater risk of unemployment few years down the line, if and when the tech bubble bursts, outsourcing, or any other reason?"
4yfenv,1,2016-08-18,I need your opinions on a career change into IT,aymekae,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4yfenv/i_need_your_opinions_on_a_career_change_into_it/,"I'm a 31 year old female, married with 1 child, and I have a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I've always been drawn to technology, and literally spend most of my waking hours on a computer. I was valedictorian of my high school, and graduated cum laude from college. However, most of college and early adulthood I dealt with undiagnosed depression and anxiety, and I think it has stifled my career. 
I've spent the past 9 years as a bookkeeper for a law firm, a budget support specialist for NASA, and now an office coordinator for an engineering program. I've loved and hated all my jobs. Now that I am treated for my medical conditions, I am bored and work holds no challenge for me. I have no real career path as a glorified administrative support specialist, and I hate that I make $34k a year with no real prospects to increase that, even after years of experience. Living in California, I haven't gone back to school because public universities don't accept post-bacc students, and I can't afford private options. However, I am about to move to St. George, UT, which has several computer science/information technology degrees at Dixie State University. I might even become employed there, in which tuition is waived. Even if not, we have enough in savings to cover the costs of getting a second Bachelor's degree (except for the lost wages if I go back full-time, so I'd be hoping to get a paid internship).

All that said... I'm trying to narrow down my focus based on my talents, personality, and temperament, but it's hard to make those decisions having never been trained in IT. I'm hoping I can tell you a little about myself, and you can offer some pros and cons for different IT positions.

My Myers Briggs Type Indicator is very strongly ISTJ. Here is a brief description:

ISTJs respect facts. They hold a tremendous store of data within themselves, gathered through their Sensing function. STJs often work for long periods, devoting their energy to tasks that they see as important to fulfilling a goal. They prefer to work alone but can work well in teams when the situation demands it. ISTJs are capable, logical, reasonable, and effective individuals with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peaceful living.

I also have the following top 5 talents (as assessed by Gallup's Strengths Finder):

* Harmony - People exceptionally talented in the Harmony theme look for consensus. They don’t enjoy conflict; rather, they seek areas of agreement.
* Analytical - People exceptionally talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They
have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect a situation.
* Discipline - People exceptionally talented in the Discipline theme enjoy routine and structure. Their world is best described by the order they create.
* Input - People exceptionally talented in the Input theme have a craving to know more. Often they like to collect and archive all kinds of information.
* Consistency - People exceptionally talented in the Consistency theme are keenly aware of the need to
treat people the same. They try to treat everyone with equality by setting up clear rules and adhering to them.

Basically, I prefer to work alone, but can work well with others. Too much people time drains my energy. I like to minimize conflict and work with drama-free people who don't waste lots of time with small talk. I'm an itinerant rule-follower; I prefer lists, structure, and logic. I like to work with details and organize complex data, especially when it comes to identifying and solving problems. (In my jobs, I liked tracking down billing issues and solving or explaining them, identifying Excel errors, making lists/databases consistent and error-free, etc.) I'd rather work for someone than be the boss, or be my own boss, but I don't mind being in charge of a project or supervising a few people as long as I have the resources to do the job well. I would love to telecommute some or all of the time.

I think I might do well as a programmer. Are there other IT jobs I might be well-suited for? Thanks in advance for your time."
4yfesg,3,2016-08-18,Intern that failed out of school before starting the position.,Liar_Liar_Intern,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/4yfesg/intern_that_failed_out_of_school_before_starting/,"Alright, I am a 21 year old who has been working as an Intern with nameless mid size company for the last two months. Internship lasts 6. I went through the interview process and was accepted last fall to be one of three interns for this summer through December. It's a very competitive position, myself and three others were chosen out of 120 others from my school alone. I know someone that works there as well which very likely helped; but I still aced all the interviews and had a great ""click"" with everyone that was part of the process. 

So, I accepted the position last fall but ended up failing all my classes that fall due to anxiety and depression. As it stands I'm 3 years through the degree and have 2 to go. The company has no idea I'm not in school anymore, my parents don't, my girlfriend doesn't, no one. I failed out once before because of depression and anxiety but was able to reapply myself to school and get back in, only to fail for the same reasons. I neglected to get help because I thought I could manage it better this time, and by the time I knew it was too late I was too depressed and afraid to ask for help. 

When people ask where I go to school I still tell them the college, and that I have some time left. Because I've taken many of the core classes, I've been able to do really well thus far and no one has questioned my abilities the slightest. My internship is set up so that I go to a different department every 2 weeks, getting loads of experience in every aspect of the manufacturing of our products. Very few people will have the level of knowledge I will have of every part of the production process by the time I'm through, making myself a valuable investment in the company's eyes.

Though I know you're all going to tell me to tell the company as soon as possible, the reasons I haven't so far: I've been just as successful as anyone could expect through my internship so far, needing little guidance on almost all tasks. I will have and already have more knowledge than most people who work at the company about all our processes, ensuring I won't be outed for lack of capability. As I said above, I accepted the position last October. It has been 9 months and they haven't found out yet, and this company has extremely strong and close ties with my college. It seems unlikely to me that they will find out if they haven't already. 

I am looking for advice on what will be best for my long term future. The way I see it, I certainly stand a good chance to get away with it, land a full time job (i have standing offers from two departments so far) and simply never have it known that I failed out of school. Medium risk, high reward. If I make it known now, when I've had months to tell them before I even started, I'll probably just be fired. 

Yes, I know it's unfair as fuck to everyone else, and I'm a terrible person for all of this. Thank you "

4yfoop,1,2016-08-18,"Can't decide between a couple situations, advice requested!",StaticX27,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4yfoop/cant_decide_between_a_couple_situations_advice/,"So, presently, I'm a 32 year old high school teacher in Japan making around 50k / year (USD).  I decided to quit my job and move back to the US.  Last month, I proposed to my girlfriend, she's leaving in September for a 1 year internship (likely won't go anywhere professionally, she's just doing it for fun).  I am debt free right now, though I've got preorder in for a Tesla Model 3, which will put me back into debt.

Coming back to the US, I'm looking at getting into project management or business interpretation (Japanese).  By the numbers, I'll probably be making somewhere around $60k / year to start.  I have around $250k invested in the stock market right now in fairly stable investments (not a lot of movement, it's been stagnant for awhile).  By the time I move back to the states, I should have something around $20k in cash savings, which I'll be using to purchase vital things like a (junker) car until I get my Tesla, phone, and sustain myself until I find a job (note, I am looking prior to moving back to the states, I am preparing for a month or two of unemployment though).  On the job front, I'm pretty confident I'll be able to find a job without difficulty, given that I already have a few options available to me.

My question is where to go next.  Given my skill set and language background, Texas and most west coast major cities are going to be ultimately where main job markets are going to be.  I can likely move back to Los Angeles with my parents, but from a personal point, I'm not entirely sure I'll be able to stand living with my parents again.  Not that they're bad people or anything, but I've lived on my own for the past 7 years, it's a hard adjustment to go back in with them.  I'm not really interested in renting anymore, as I'm at the point where I want/need to start building my own equity.  Moving back to Los Angeles, or really any major city on the west coast is unfeasible at this point, given the cost of homes.  Texas, I likely can afford without too much issue.

My ultimate goal is for my fiancee and I to get into house flipping / renting, aiming for around 3 million (in today's money, adjust for inflation over time) by the time I'm in my 50's, at which point, get an apartment building and live off of the rent, at a ROI of around 3-5% (conservatively, I haven't checked the market much in the states, but in Japan, this type of return is fairly easy).  My parents are currently profiting around 20-40k per house at a time.  As capital builds, I want to start doing 2-3 houses at a time, 4 times a year, yielding an additional 300k / year, over the course of 18 years, subtracting for things along the way like children, our own house, etc, should get pretty close to the numbers I'm shooting for.  Of course, a lot of this is speculation, seeing as how there are things like availability of property, etc.  However, being able to function both in America and Japan should help assay some of those minuses.  There are other prospects I'm looking into, but I don't have enough details on those to really factor them into my long term plans (yet).

Basically, if I move back to Los Angeles, I'll likely have an easier time finding a job, but I'll be back living with my parents for what will likely be another 5 to 10 years while I build up capital to buy my first house.  My fiancee will be able to work with my parents (who are currently sustaining themselves via house flipping, though they are still hobbyists) to learn the trade and start building capital that we can then use to purchase our forever house, multiple properties, etc, while I work on advancing my career, which is mostly just there to build capital to feed back into investments, not to mention providing stability to our lifestyle.

The second option is to move to a city that is more affordable to buy a house, have her learn the trade there (without parental support), and start building equity right away into our future.  I'll still likely be earning my salary and working with my wife in house flipping until we can afford to move back to Los Angeles (Ultimately, my extended family is from here, I do want to live near them as the end goal).  On moving back to LA, turn the house I was living in into a rental property (or sell it, whichever yields the best profit), and continue flipping and working until we reach the above mentioned 3 million.

TL;DR: Can't decide if I want to move to a cheaper city with more personal freedom or moving back in with my parents to meet my financial goals."

* The Brevile Smart Grinder really isn't a good match for the espresso machine
* I am a college student on a slight budget... (then again I do have a bit of ""love myself"" money from my internship this summer)


I am wondering if anyone would consider this a ""too good to pass up deal"" and I should just grab it up and regret it later (lol).

It's my first time posting in here, and well, the past few days I, or rather we, have an issue. I'm sorry if this is not the appropriate place to post this

As a background, I'm a foreign student (Been here for 2 years) and currently doing internship. My girlfriend however, is a local. She's a year younger than me and 1 year my junior.

First off, my girlfriend is the type who zones out often. She'll walk and walk, but sometimes not aware of her surroundings, like when a friend said hi, or smiled at her, she might not notice it until it's late. There have been a few occurences of this, and I think yesterday was the moment where she was walking around school talking to her friend while she saw another person from previous semester's class (according to her, he was talking to his friend as well), and when they're nearing her, she said he turned into looking serious. She assumes that he's angry about her because when she looked back he still looks kinda angry.

Thing is, the only thing they did together was them being a project mate together, including 2 more other people. As far as I know, she put a massive amount of effort on the project as well. So in that case alone, I don't think she deserved to be hated at all, if any, it's maybe because she only forgot to say hi to the guy.

Anyway, at lunch I texted her saying that it's not her fault, and if he has any issues, maybe he's discussing with his friend a very very serious topic, and because of the strain on the mind the 'game face' is up. I told her not to worry, that it's just a common thing and that people won't have grudge on you just because of one simple thing. Lastly, I told her that there's too many variables on one's mind that can cause one to look serious, and if she wants people to always say hi, I would love it to help her to learn to be more aware of surroundings and always say hi to everyone she knows (I used to have anxiety when I moved here, but I finally beat it by doing this. I found that actually people aren't so bad, and I really want her to see this as well)

Anyway, I thought that the crisis was averted since the rest of the day she only updated me about her school and her event (She's actually active in our student council). But later at night she texted me again, wondering whether people are really bullying her using subtle social tactics so that even if she speaks out, people won't believe her and that I will just continue siding with 'them' even though they purposefully make her feel bad. I'm... at a loss. She may be in a student council, but she doesn't even command that high of a position to be required for political coup or anything. Plus, the people she said 'hating' on her isn't even an active member in her council. It's just some other student who happen to be in same course as her, and took the same module at one point in time. 

For now, fortunately, I managed to shift the topic to something else. But when she discuss about it again (and surely she will), what should I say? Also, what should I do and is there any way to help her out of this? Please, /r/anxiety, help me

4yg8df,37,2016-08-18,Sweet Elizabeth.,ByThePowerOfMetalNya,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4yg8df/sweet_elizabeth/,"I used to work in a nursing home for the mentally disturbed and the elderly. What I am about to tell you is the reason why I quit my job.

When I first came into the home it was relatively small and quiet. There were four staff members including myself. There were the head nurse, Lana, the intern nurse Lizzie and Joshley the janitor. Joshley was not exactly qualified to take care of the patients, but he had been around longer than any of us, so he knew the ropes pretty well. Hell, I learned most of the things I needed to know from him.

The ward I worked at only housed three people at the time. 

One of the patients was a sweet, blind lady called Ms Bentham. When I first spoke to her I noticed that mentally she was still fine, but her blindness in combination with her age had sadly rendered her incapable of taking care of herself. She was great fun to hang out with. To other visitors she was always polite and friendly, but when I was around she would tell the raunchiest jokes and jokingly yell things at me like “where is my bloody coffee, you twat?!”

 She told the most amazing stories about far journeys she had gone on with her children and grandchildren and about how she used to be a grandmaster of chess. I jokingly responded that she’d probably still whoop my arse despite her inability to see. She immediately sprung up from her chair and grinningly said: “You’re on.” And lo and behold, I was right. She beat me three times in a row. She could feel which pieces were which and she only needed to touch all of the pieces once at the start of the game and after that she just remembered where everything was. I would call out my move, then she would call out hers and I would move the piece for her. I even cheated the third time, just to see if she would notice. “Knight to B3,” I said. “Check.” “You’re lying, you sneaky bastard. Your knight was on H7 three turns ago and it hasn’t moved since, so I couldn’t have gotten to B3 even if God had wanted it to.”


Then there was Mr Worrick. He was a grey-haired, cleanly-shaven old man who wore small, round glasses that were pressed tightly onto his crooked nose. He suffered from dementia and was almost always sitting quietly in his room or in his wheelchair rubbing his thin hands together. He was very shy and every time someone approached him he would immediately stop rubbing his hands and fold his arms across his chest. He was nice enough to me though. He hardly ever spoke a word to the others but I would still get the occasional “thank you, dear” after giving him his meal or his tea. Nurse Lana said he must have been a soldier because his quivering hands were a clear indication of PTSD. I could not imagine how damaged he really was behind that sheepish look of his. 

Finally there was Whisky. Whisky was a 2 metre tall behemoth of a man with hands as big as spades and a jawline big and heavy enough to crush walnuts with. His real name was Harold Burns, but he was called Whisky because that was the only word that was left in his vocabulary. He had taken to alcoholism after his son had passed away under mysterious circumstances at the age of three and the grief and copious amounts of whisky had taken their toll on his brain. Whisky always frightened Lizzie and me a bit. He was really loud and cranky and would unexpectedly yell “WHISKY! WHISKY!” every time we walked by. A glass of his favourite brand would usually calm him down for a few hours. The doctors strongly advised against pouring more alcohol into his old body, but we figured it was the last shred of enjoyment he was getting out of his short time on this Earth. Sometimes we’d tell him he’d had enough booze for the day and then he would get really upset. He’d start shouting more erratically and he’d occasionally lash out or throw a punch at us when we got too close. Lizzie and I were uncomfortable going near him but Nurse Lana did not seem to mind his temper. She’d just put her arms in her sides and sternly tell him: “Now Harold Burns! That’s no way to treat a lady, is it?” Miraculously that would usually settle him down. He even seemed somewhat intimidated by her.

Things usually ran like clockwork under Nurse Lana’s watch. Technically I had the proper qualifications to run the ward together with Lizzie without Lana’s supervision, but her advice, confidence and her Whisky-compelling powers made me feel more at ease during my shifts.  I could handle things pretty well on my own, but as is to be expected with mentally unstable folk like these sometimes the patients would act out more violently than usual.

This one instance when Nurse Lana wasn’t around due to illness, I ran the ward together with Lizzie and some greatly appreciated assistance from Joshley. Whisky was being really obnoxious that day. He was constantly walking up to me and nudging me with his elbow. He would jerk Lizzie’s and Mr Worrick’s arms and blurt out shouts very franticly. He’d even make his hand into a fist and would make stabbing motions towards Mr Worrick. Whisky’s behaviour really seemed bother Mr Worrick but he seemed more annoyed than concerned. Mr Worrick kept staring at Whisky with a very stern frown and with his arms tightly folded across his chest.

It was just after lunchtime, so Ms Bentham had to take her medications. I went to grab her prescribed pills in the medicine cabinet and I left Lizzie alone with the patients for a short moment. I was rifling through the cabinet when I heard Lizzie exclaim a loud, panicked yelp, followed by a clattering noise. I rushed back into the dining room to find Whisky and Mr Worrick on the floor and Lizzie bent over clutching her ankle.  I asked her what had happened and she said that she felt Mr Worrick’s wheelchair bump into her foot and then all of the sudden it tipped over and Mr Worrick and Whisky were both flat on the floor.

Whisky was furiously pointing at Mr Worrick and kept yelling “WHISKY! WHISKY! WHISKY!”  Mr Worrick was none too pleased with what had just transpired, and yelled all sorts of profanities at Whisky. “DEMON! SPAWN OF SATAN! HOW DARE YOU LAY FINGERS ON ME! POOR ME!” he shouted. Whisky got even more frustrated and kept pointing and waving his hands at him. I was trying to get Whisky to settle down when I noticed the bloodstain on Mr Worrick’s side. The poor sod had probably cut himself on his wheelchair when he fell over. My calmness turned into anger and I reprimanded Whisky for pushing over Mr Worrick. “That is no way of treating your fellow patients, is it now, Harold Burns?!” Whisky looked at me with a startled look on his face, then sat on the floor and started crying. ‘’Whi...whisky…whisky…whi…sky…sky” he sobbed all while continuously pointing at Mr Worrick. 

Meanwhile Lizzie had managed to get Mr Worrick to settle down and had gotten him back into his wheelchair. “Are you alright, Elizabeth?” Ms Bentham asked. She must have had heard Lizzie’s scream when Mr Worrick’s wheelchair crashed into her. “Yeah I’m fine. My ankle is only a bit bruised.” All of the sudden Mr Worrick started thrashing about in an attempt to break free from Lizzie’s grip. “Let me go, you harlot! I don’t know you! You cannot trick me! You’re not real! NOT REAL!” 

Lizzie could not restrain him any longer and quickly jumped backwards to avoid getting hit by Mr Worrick’s flailing arms. I tried to hold him down but he was deceptively strong and he pushed me to the floor with minimal effort. I quickly called over Joshley and asked him to restrain Mr Worrick and get him patched up. Mr Worrick was no match for big ole Joshley and once he realised this he stopped resisting and fell back into his chair with a defeated and displeased look on his face. “C’mon Mr Worrick! Let’s get you fixed up and then poor some nice hot coffee into ya!” Joshley said. He quickly wheeled Mr Worrick out of the room and Lizzie and I picked up Whisky from the floor and set him down on the sofa. Lizzie quickly poured him a drink and pressed it into his big, shaking hands. ”How’s your ankle?” I asked her.  “It will probably get a bit swollen but I think it’ll be fine. I’m more worried about the patients.” Lizzie said. “I just can’t wrap my head around it. Why did Whisky act so strangely today? He’s never laid a finger on any of the other patients and all of the sudden he decides to pester Worrick and even push him over.” It baffled me as well, but what baffled me even more was that I had never in my time at this ward heard Mr Worrick speak a single word to another patient before, let alone shout curses at them.

That night everything gave the impression like the incident had never happened. Mr Worrick and Whisky were sitting side by side at the dinner table eagerly devouring their mash. Mr Worrick even grabbed Whisky’s hand at one point. Whisky was sort of startled at first, but almost immediately settled down and smiled at Mr Worrick as if he was trying to say ‘it’s okay’.

After dinner we put the patients to bed. I was in a bit of a rush, so after I had tucked in Ms Bentham and Whisky I asked Lizzie to see to Mr Worrick and then lock up the ward. We had called Nurse Lana after the incident and she had offered to take the night shift so that we could shake of the stress a bit. The patients would be alone for an hour at most between Lizzie locking up and Nurse Lana returning for her shift, so it was safe enough to leave the patients alone for a bit. I was already cycling home when I noticed that I had left my purse at the nurses’ office. I did not want to wait another hour for Nurse Lana to return so I sped back in the hopes to find Lizzie still there. When I arrived at the ward I noticed that all the lights had already been turned off. However, the door was not locked. “That’s odd.” I thought to myself. “Did Lizzie forget to lock it after turning off the lights? Or could she still be here?”

I stepped into the hallway and called out Lizzie’s name. No response. I called again. This time I heard not too far in front of me. It was a very faint mumbling noise. “HELLO?” I shouted. “Who is there?” The mumbling stopped but it made place for something violently banging on the floor. I flicked on the lights and was met with a horrible sight. 

Ms Bentham was sitting a few feet in front of me down the hallway. She sat in a pool of blood with streams of blood dripping down from her mouth. Next to her lay…her tongue. Someone had cut out her tongue. I rushed over to her and grabbed her hand. “It’s okay Ms Bentham! I’m here now. Who did this to you?” She put her fingers on the palm of my hand and spelled one word: “WORRICK.”

I turned my head towards Mr Worrick’s room and noticed that the door was ajar. I slowly inched to the door and hesitatingly pushed it open. Mr Worrick was sitting in his wheelchair in the corner of the room. Next to him lay Lizzie’s dead body. Her throat had been slit nearly down to the bone. Mr Worrick looked at me and sighed with relief: “There you are, my sweet. I was afraid you had left me forever.” 

“What are you talking about? Why did you kill Lizzie?” I asked.

“SHE WAS A LYING WHORE! She lied about who she was! She was not my Elizabeth, and she damn well knew it. But still she wore the name. Every day she pranced about with your name on her chest! And she acknowledged it too! That blind bitch! She kept calling her by your name! So I cut out her lying tongue…for you, my sweet!”

“I am not your sweet! Leave me alone!”

“Don’t be daft, my darling. You look just as beautiful as I remember. Now let us be together forever. I even brought you your favourite red dress.” Mr Worrick reached out next to him and pulled up Lizzie’s blood-soaked scrubs from the floor and started wheeling towards me. 

I slowly backed away. “Don’t come near me, Mr Worrick. I am sorry to do this, but I have to call the police. You cannot stay here. Not after what you have done.”

“No no no no no NO! Don’t you see? I made sure nobody would disturb us. We could finally be together again. Just the two of us, without any of these loons interfering. I wouldn’t want the police to ruin our moment.” he sighed. “Come, embrace me, my sweet!”

My adrenaline was rushing and in a split second decision I pushed him over, wheelchair and all. He fell on the floor and looked at me with murder in his eyes. 

“Don’t you walk away from me, you cheating whore! I will HAVE YOU!”

Then I noticed what was in his other hand: a shiv. That was what he had been hiding in those shaking hands of his. He had been sharpening that shiv all this time. He had been planning this…
He started crawling towards me, dragging a trail of Lizzie’s blood behind him. Luckily he was much slower than I was and I was able to quickly bolt towards the door and slam it shut behind me. I called the cops and Mr Worrick was subdued and taken away not long after. 

After he had been taken away and I had made sure that Ms Bentham and Whisky were in good hands, I went into Mr Worrick’s room to find out what else he’d been up to. I walked up to his nightstand and began rifling through the drawers. Nothing interesting to be found. Then I noticed the photograph on his nightstand. It was a photograph of…me! Or so it seemed at first glance. The photograph was very faded and obviously too old to be a picture of me, but the woman in the photograph looked exactly like me. She was wearing a bright red dress and at the bottom of the picture frame there was an engraving: 
“Sweet Elizabeth Worrick, 1929 – 1991”

I interned with them during school, then got offered a job. I have almost 1.5 years of development experience. When I leave it will be 2 years. But most of that experience comes from being an intern while still in school.

I've learned an incredible amount while working there. Ive done full stack development, learned a significant amount of linux, learned server configuration, played with different code repositories, worked under more senior developers in the same codebase, lead a project that consisted of gathering requirements, doing mockups, software architecture and implementation. Theres so much I had to learn because we lacked the resources.

My only concern is that I will be considered a sloppy candidate becsuse I worked at a startup. There are some hacky pieces of code I am ashamed of implementing, but needed to push a solution asap.

In 4 months I want to leave and work for a bigger company doing greater things. My question is, what should would companies expect of someone who graduated half a year ago?"
4ygnsi,7,2016-08-18,Natural talent vs hardworking,michaelconnery1985,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ygnsi/natural_talent_vs_hardworking/,"I'd like to gather some of this sub's thoughts on what you guys feel about the difference between someone who is naturally gifted (in this case for CS/programming) and average people who got good through sheer hard work.

To me, I can tell a pretty much big difference. I look at LinkedIn profiles of upper years from my school and it's easy to tell those who started out average and maybe got slightly better later on and the ones who are naturally gifted. Multiple internships at tech companies, contribute to open source projects - you know what I'm talking about. The difference is clear as day.

As someone who is painfully average (never programmed before college, don't have outstanding grades) a little part of me feels sad not being able to excel like the rest of them. Maybe it's because a part of me wants to be the best at what I do, maybe it's self-pride, maybe it's jealousy - who knows. I work hard in school but there's a ceiling that I will never be able to break through and I am fully aware of that. I'm not comparing with others, just making a general observation and stating facts. I'm slow in programming, sorely average in most of my academics, and most of the time need to put in double the effort to get somewhere slightly above average.

It's no secret that there are brilliant programmers and for some of them it comes naturally to them, whereas for the others not so much. How do I break out of this negative thinking? It's true that probably only the top 10% are as smart as I described, but as much as a part of me says just do the best I can, another part of me wants to be in that 'top 10%' as well, even though it's virtually impossible for me to do so. 

Thoughts?

4ygo4n,16,2016-08-18,Would anyone be interested in a mobile programming/mobile development student org?,nickfhs,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/4ygo4n/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_mobile/,"I'm finishing up my second iOS mobile development internship this summer and have been thinking that it would be fun to start an organization centered around mobile software development (iOS/Android) at UCSD.

FSAE builds a racecar all year. There's a solar car team on campus that builds a solar powered car all year. Let's build mobile applications with a mobile development organization. This organization could have a similar approach where everyone works on a single, or multiple, project(s) over the course of the school year. In addition, we could hold office hours for those wanting to learn more about mobile software development or hold some presentations every now and then talking about specific aspects of mobile product development on both iOS &amp; Android.

I understand that many CSE students have to take 110 which is similar, however, CSE 110 1) restricts students going for mobile products to Android, 2) has to be a UCSD-focused project, &amp; 3) is mostly for CSE/ECE students whereas if we did a single (or multiple) small-mid sized projects, we could take advantage of students in other departments that would be interested in say, UI design, for example.

I'm open to suggestions, comments, and those that would want to learn more about possibly starting something like this! Thanks!"

This is my first actual post so please bear with me regarding my formatting and thread selection. 

Lately, my life has been difficult.  As a 6th year graduate student (I will be a pharmacist in less than a year), I am more than capable of dealing with difficult problems.  Lately, life has thrown me some problems that are both entirely out of my control and incredibly difficult to deal with. 

In a time span of days, I have had a grade-school friend die of a heroin overdose and have also discovered that my father is currently heavily addicted to opiates.

Although I wasn't close with this friend as an adult, I had known him very closely until I was about 18 years old (I am now 23).  I will be attending his funeral in a few days.  I had no idea that he had a heroin problem until his death hit me in the face yesterday.  

Up to this point in time, I have managed to handle plenty of difficulties between my work, school, home, and social life.  Right now I feel like I'm drowning.  My mom is an absolute mess and can't handle what's happening with my father.  I'm almost a pharmacist yet I can't help my own father because he just won't listen to my advice.  I'm taking the death of my friend as a sign that my father is very close to meeting the same end (he is 60 years old with other chronic health problems, my friend was 22). 
 
Additionally, I start a new rotation soon, which means that not only do I have to prove myself as a professional, I also have to balance all of these problems simultaneously while still being competitive.  Very soon, I will be working 60-70 hours per week as well as juggling these problems. 

During my rotations, I have to work 40 hours a week, and pay tuition to attend these rotations. I have an internship and a catering side job to make money to support myself while on rotation. 

Somebody needs help.  I don't know if it's me or my father, but nobody in my family knows what to do right now. 

Thanks for whatever advice you can give, god bless. "
4yhd2e,2,2016-08-19,[24F] I'm worried that my boyfriend [23M] has serious motivational issues.,confused6171,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4yhd2e/24f_im_worried_that_my_boyfriend_23m_has_serious/,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.

Me and my boyfriend of almost 2 years, Mike, have always had a great relationship. When I met him he was without a job, but he explained it as a transitional period so I didn't think much of it. I myself am unemployed, but that is because I am disabled and have been drawing disability for a while now. If I weren't in full-body constant pain, I would be out there working my butt off. I have a college degree and had every intention of going into that field (accounting) but after college was in a car accident and am now in a wheelchair without the use of my legs. 

I'm a fiercely independent person, though. I pride myself on being able to do just about anything. 

Mike still lives with his parents, which I don't hold against him. He's young and a lot of people our age are moving back home because of the economy and all. The problem is that he doesn't seem like he cares to try and change his situation at all. 

Mike is a musician (he plays the drums and he's really good) and he has kinda idealistic views about being a musician professionally. He no-doubt has the talent to become famous, but the band's he plays for aren't very good and none of them really put any effort into promoting. I've been to a bunch of his shows, but because none of them even bother to TRY to promote there's always like 5 people at them, so they end up never getting paid. His main band has recently started driving to a place 4 hours away to play shows and they don't even get paid... So they're paying for all that gas to play a show for ""exposure"", but playing for 10 people isn't going to get them much exposure. 

In the 2 years we've been together, he's had 4 different jobs, all of them part-time, and none of them for longer than a few months. He had an opportunity to do what he really wants (sound engineering) as an intern at a nearby studio. He completely threw that opportunity away and burned all of those bridges. 

He's always been very quick to complain about work and people in positions of authority over him. I thought maybe he just didn't put any effort into his jobs because they weren't what he really wanted to be doing. But he recently got a second opportunity in the music industry (a job which I actually found for him) and he AGAIN burned those bridges and stopped showing up for work. This is very troubling to me. I knew he hadn't held a job for longer than a few months, but I thought when he had the chance to work in his field that he'd actually really try and do well. That is not the case.

I love him SO much. He's the only person I've met since getting in my wheelchair that honestly only sees me when he looks at me, he doesn't see my chair. That's so rare to find, let me tell you. He's an amazing boyfriend and he's really good to me. 

I thought maybe he had amotivational syndrome because he is a weed smoker. Up until recently, I would just let him smoke my weed because he could never afford his own. I've since stopped letting him smoke mine by switching to a tincture, which helps my pain more anyway. I thought maybe with him no longer smoking that he'd get his act together, but it's been about 6 months and that hasn't happened at all. 

He just recently got a part-time job, working the lunch rush at a local Chinese food place. When he told me he got a job I was SO excited, only to have that excitement dashed a bit when I found out he's only working about 10 hours a week, minimum wage. 

Id love to be able to go do things. At first, we would go on dates to concerts and dinner and such and I would just always pay (which is difficult because I'm on a very limited income) but I've since stopped paying because I can't always be the one who pays for us. He knows id love to be able to do things more, but he has absolutely no discipline when it comes to work. He's constantly complaining about how annoying it is that his boss makes him conform to a dress code, which is ridiculous because that's so normal for a restaurant. He says ""if they want me to care about what color my shoes are they should pay me more than minimum wage.""

I just am really worried that he has an incredibly messed up view of how the world works. I guess his parents never really made him work for anything growing up, and he still thinks that it's okay to skate by without ever expending effort. I know working is hard and frustrating, but he seriously wines about it so much it's just ridiculous. 

Now, I'm in no hurry to get married. But, before I could ever even CONSIDER marrying Mike, he'd have to have a complete overhaul in his life. 

He doesn't seem to understand how much it costs to live. His dad is talking about selling the house in a year or so, and I know that when he does that Mike will have a rude awakening in having to pay rent, for food, utilities, all the bills he doesn't even think about now. He says he wants to use this year he has to really pursue music. I don't want to poo on his dreams, but, we live in the middle of nowhere, not exactly music capital USA. His band's practice like every other week and they all have jobs, they aren't expecting this to turn into anything, but he, naively, thinks that they're just one gig away from hitting it big. (This will never happen. I hate to say that but I'm a huge music fan myself so I know good music when I hear it. The lead singer is just off putting and has a horrible voice. There's no chance they'll make it big from the middle of the Midwest, where nobody lives.)

What do I do? I've tried to motivate him and get him excited about making music so he'll five head-first into it, but he spends most of his time playing League of Legends and watching Netflix. 

I also don't feel like it's my place to try to point out how unrealistic he is about his dream of playing music. I don't want to squash his dreams, but honestly he needs to make money. He eats most of his meals over at my apartment, and I really just can't afford to feed us both. I can barely afford to feed myself and my dog. 

How do I encourage him to want to work harder? And to get a job that will actually be something he can live off of? I really love him but the stress of worrying about this has really been taking a toll on me, to the point where I'm so worried about his ability to cope that I can never get in the mood to be intimate anymore. 

What do, Reddit?

TL;DR: boyfriend has unrealistic dreams of hitting it big as a rockstar, lives at home and works 10 hours a week at a minimum wage job. He needs to be able to support himself, how do I help him figure that out without being the bitch who crapped all over his dreams of stardom? "

Here’s my resume :

Finished high school in France when i was 19, in 2008 (i was one year late, no biggie i guess)

2008-2010 : i had several jobs : assembling computers for gamers, working for an asset management company for a couple months, working for a wedding magazine

2010-2013 : bachelor degree

2013-2014 :took a year off, 4 months to travel in thailand (i had family there back then, and i wanted to travel a little), and some time to prepare for the BS's competitive exam when i went back to france.

September 2014-november 2016 : master’s degree in a good business school (at least in France. I had to prepare for weeks in a preparatory school), during which i had a 6 months internship in Bangkok, as a ""business analyst"", for a big company.

Now here’s the issue i have : I’m finishing my education this november, maybe december, and i’ll only get my degree next year. If i want to, i can take another internship until june 2017 (it’s called an « internship year » i believe) and it won’t change anything, i’ll receive my degree in 2017 anyway (and i'll be a 2017 ""promotion"" student. What should i put in my resume if i finish my education at the end of the year, that i graduated in november/december 2016 right ? (a lot of people told me to do that) It doesn’t matter when i get the degree as long as i finish in time? And what about the option to make it a 3 year masters degree (with another internship), will employers be afraid of my age ? (if i finish my education in november, i’ll be 27 years old, but i’ll almost be 28 (born in the end of august) if i finish it in june 2017)

Honestly, do you think i’d be fine in both cases, 27 or 28 yo, since people can graduate with masters at 23 in France, just like in England i believe? (it’s not a majority though, but people tend to graduate early in France, 25 is probably the average with masters in business schools)

Thank you very much

nb : as you can see, i didn't have a job, apart from my 6 months internship since 2010 when i was a student, as i wanted to enjoy being a student (universities are almost free in France, although you have to pay for business schools)

4yi8b1,3,2016-08-19,Worried I may not be competitive enough for pathology/immunology PhD programs,tripping_right_now,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/4yi8b1/worried_i_may_not_be_competitive_enough_for/,"**TLDR: Recent Med Lab Science graduate worried about competitive application for this cycle. Good GPA, unknown GRE scores, great LORs and SOPs/Research Statement. Worried that the type of person and work that I am is incompatible with the PhD lifestyle. My dream career involves teaching undergraduate students or becoming a science editor/grant editor. Research interests include parasitology, allergies, and IgE-mediated disease states.**

I graduated this May from the University of Vermont’s Medical Laboratory Science program. I passed my board exams and am an American Society of Clinical Pathology certified Medical Laboratory Scientist. I currently work at a monoclonal antibody production company where I began as an intern 2.5 years ago (I’m an employee now).
 
As the application cycle for this year approaches, frankly I’m terrified that I’m not a competitive enough candidate for PhD programs. I knew early on during my undergrad years that a hospital-based lab tech job was not for me; I have planned for many years to pursue a PhD with the end-goal of being an academic professor/lecturer someday, or a professional editor/grant writer.
 
I feel very passionately about learning more, developing my laboratory skills, and asking the important questions. I know grad school is not undergrad 2.0; I am mentally prepared to take on graduate school as a profession and learn how to become an independent researcher and academic. But lately, so much self-doubt has been setting in…
 
My professors in undergrad have encouraged me to apply to top-tier schools: Stanford, UNC-Chapel Hill, Georgetown. I do not believe my application is good enough for these schools, nor do I want to attend institutions like these. I am more interested in the following schools: U Washington, UC Boulder, UC Denver, Dartmouth, UVM, UNH, U Michigan. 
 
My undergrad GPA was a 3.54. I only got 3 C’s in college, all in chemistry/organic chemistry courses. I got A’s in all of my major specific courses (Immunology, Pathology, Microbiology, Genetics, Parasitology, Hematology, etc.)
 
I have not taken the GREs yet; I am scheduled for October 1st. I did poorly on the SAT and very well on the ACT in high school. I’m going to assume my GRE scores will be average (155V/155Q/5W).
 
I will have fantastic LORs for my application and a very strong SOP/Research Statement. I am a strong writer and have been told I am very capable at conveying scientific information to an audience. Additionally, I am a decent public speaker and perform well in interviews.
 
I’m just so worried that I’m not qualified enough for these graduate programs… The average GRE scores/GPA for accepted students at almost all of these programs are 158V/158Q and 3.8, respectively.
 
I also worry that what I want out of life is incompatible with the PhD I want to pursue…for example, I would like to settle down in a rural area (not a city person). I want to get married and have a child in the next 5 to 10 years. I don’t know if I can compromise traveling the country and living in locations I dislike just to get the job. And I have a SO that I am beginning to plan my life with, and I worry so much about our relationship and going long-distance.
I have also learned (basically after reading this sub so much) that the way I like to operate in a lab doesn’t seem to be the way academic labs are run. For example, I’ll put in significantly more week-work hours if it means I don’t have to work the weekend. I am a very team-based worker and enjoy consulting other employees for help/wit questions. I worry that the kind of worker I want to be is incompatible with the realities of being a PhD student.
 
I am very capable in a laboratory setting and feel confident in my lab skills. A short list of my skills includes: tissue culture, mouse handling/immunizations/euthanasia, PCR, basic gene sequencing, various ELISAs, protein purification, antibody isotyping. 
 
The research I have performed at my lab revolves around the various binding epitopes on coagulation factors that our antibodies bind to and determining whether our antibodies bind to the zymogen or the activated factor. On a personal level, I am highly interested in parasitology and mechanisms of eosinophilia that encompass various helminth infections; I am also interested in the overlap between IgE-mediated allergic reactions and how these may be similar to/different from IgE responses during parasitic infections. Unfortunately I have yet to find a single lab on my list of schools that studies parasitology or allergies.

Any honest opinions about how competitive my application is?"

To quickly rethread on the setting, $Corp is a healthcare and care home for mentally impaired or disabled, it is run by a small IT crew who are the last light in the endless sea of darkness that is the end users. For 10.000 years the immortal Empe- whoops I got carried away there.     
     

**Our cast for this case are:**    
**$me: Drinker of coffee, hater of all.**    
**$TMLD: Nice guy who led us into battle (work) for roughly 6 months before running away screaming.**    
**$OLD: Guy who was assigned to me during my internship way, way back (T-minus 4 months before his retirement).**    
**$CTK: Caretaker for the clients in this particular story.**    
**$Client: Troubled youth with drug and mental problems, also a fish lover.**     
    

*For those who missed the last two tales, I had been getting tickets since the day I started at $Corp from a specific care home about a specific thing.*     
“$CTK: Can you send an engineer, $Client’s Playstation 3 (PS3) doesn’t work with online games, he needs to play online!”    
*Well, if your any self-respecting monkey in IT (disclaimer, I am not racist towards monkeys, unless it’s the poo flinging type) you’ll wonder what you’re supposed to do with this followed shortly thereafter by a rereading of company policy and or consulting your co-workers on the matter.*     

*Turned out we had jack all in place for something like this and the system administrators and network administrators simply glared me out of the room upon even asking them if there had been a precedence before.  So of to the plastteel and rockcrete cage I went to talk with $TMLD.*    

    

&gt;$me: $TMLD, can you spare a moment?    
&gt;$TMLD: Sure $techk, whats wrong?    
&gt;$me: Well you see I have this ticket…    


*To cut it short it boiled down us both agreeing we shouldn’t really be doing this and that we should politely decline them. Read, we both figured it wasn’t our problem or our divisions and that the caretaker should simply contact the provider for the clients internet (care homes had two networks, company and a private one for their clients).*    

*So as a good wrench wielding simian I went ahead and let $CTK know we wouldn’t be cooperating.     
He replied within 2 minutes tops. The response from a general end user was between hours and days on average so this was a wee bit weird. So I reply back stating that our team leader said no so in a nutshell go take a hike.     
His reply was interesting.*    


&gt;$CTK: You don’t understand $Client NEEDS to play online! He NEEDS to!!    


*I politely told him “no” again and closed the ticket (I wasn’t about to start playing a game of pong with him).*    

*A few days passed when $OLD walks up to my desk.*    
&gt;$OLD: Hey $techk, you play videogames right?    
&gt;$me: Yeah, why?     
&gt;$OLD: Well we need to go to #Location tomorrow, something about a pay station 3    


*A feeling of dread assaults you, what do you do… I cast FIST into the darkness!*    


&gt;$me: would this happen to be where $Client is housed at #location under $CTK?    
&gt;$OLD: Actually it is, how do you know that?    
&gt;$me: $TMLD and I had a talk about this a while ago, he agreed not to do anything with it.     
&gt;$OLD: Yeah well the board demanded we’d go there, something about client satisfaction and making sure their stay is pleasurable.    
&gt;$me: So $CTK simply pressured upstream, I don’t know what’s so special about $Client or his goddamn PS3 but I’ll come with.    
&gt;$OLD: Me neither, but a job’s a job eh, I can tell you more sailor stories!    
&gt;$me: Just give me the Emperors mercy now and get it over with.    


*The day passed, morning came, as did the 2 hour drive and sailor stories… the stuff that goes on around a boat will forever be engraved in my little squishy hard drive.*  
*At #Location we find a small little studio, about the same as you would shove a few college students in, big enough for them to move, sleep, eat. But not big enough to live in with more than a single person without violating personal space.*  


&gt;$OLD: Be careful around here, this is where $corp stores the loonies they can’t manage in regular homes.  
&gt;$me: gee thanks for the warning after I came all the way here…  


*As we move towards the studio we can smell a rancid smell, the type you get after a fish truck is left out hanging for weeks on end without proper cooling with plenty of fish still inside (don’t ask why I know how that smells, I’ve done weird shit for money during my education).*  
*We both look at one another but all $OLD does is shrug and mention a comment about his grandmothers mattress. We ring, tap the glass and sit there for a bit when $client (or what I hoped was him) opened the door.*  


&gt;$Client: You two the computer blokes?     
&gt;$OLD: We’re from $corp’s IT department yes, we’ve come to take a look at your pay station.    
&gt;$Client: Great… well, walk on in, don’t mind the mess.     


*Disclaimer, I am not the neatest person on this plant nor do I have anything akin to a cleaning fetish but right then, right there, I could of killed him.*    
*Piles of clothes everywhere, boxes of food are scattered all over, it looks like a bomb went off filled with everything a college student might do within a whole year.*     


&gt;$me: So we came here to look at your PS3, what’s wrong with it exactly?    
&gt;$Client: It dun wanna connect to CoD with online, I need to play cause I’m gonna be a MLG pro    


*He didn’t say M L G or Major League Gamer or anything akin, no he said EHM ELH GEE, for the record whitest person I have ever seen. Yes I realize this isn’t fair as he has behavior issue and probably some mental handicap, sue me I’m mean too sometimes.*     


*an eyetwitch later*  


&gt;$me: Old please go check the patch box and the ADSL line, I’ll look from the front end of things, $Client, could you open a window?    
&gt;$Client: You saying my place smells?    
&gt;$OLD: not if you like fish, you a fisherman son?    
&gt;$Client: Nah mang, I only like CoD, only fish for me     


*another eye is now twitching*    


&gt;$me: $OLD please just go check upstairs.    


*So after some grumping I’m left alone with $Client whom begins to talk about call of duty. I don’t care for the franchise myself, each their own off course but we all know that one guy who does that (talk about his hobby non stop without even pausing to check if you're remotely interested I mean) and how cringe worthy it can be.*    
*Meanwhile I’ve checked the most logical things, cables are in, LED is blinking, device is not set to any weird mode or IP as far as I could tell.*    


&gt;$me: $OLD, you good up there?    
&gt;$OLD: Everything looks fine, ADSL is up and running, no weird port configs or anything.. box was open though, is the client side fine? I only have two connections up here.    
&gt;$Client: I didn’t touch nothing in that box!    
&gt;$me: …    


*Cue my Phoenix Rights style “HOLD IT!!” glare*    


&gt;$Client: What are you looking at me for like that, I didn’t do anything, I swear!    


*Too late Mr. I will turn this place upside down now, I walk upstairs, back downstairs and have a look around the room.*    


&gt;$Me: $OLD, why are there 2 RJ45’s running down if $Client only has one device?    
&gt;$OLD: That is weird, want to trace it?    


*Way ahead of you at this point, cable goes straight down then into the staircase (the two studio’s we’re connected in the middle with a singular staircase with a washer and a small rack upstairs on the makeshift attic). From there it goes into the wall and ends up in $Clients room…*     


&gt;$Me: What’s under the mattress $Client?     
&gt;$Client: Nothing, don’t touch it!    
&gt;$Me: Why is there an RJ45 going in there    
&gt;$Client: A what?!    
&gt;$Me: An internet cable.     
&gt;$Client: … stuff, nothing that’s messing with my PS3!    


*I’m fed up, I regretted this later (mostly cause I washed my hands 10+ times as still I felt dirty) but I lifted the mattress (the sticky, greasy probably filled with things that will get me shadowbanned for simply mentioning it) and there was a Linksys router and a NAS hidden in between layers of filth, dirty mags and weed.*    


&gt;$Client: Don’t take my stuff, please don’t tell them!    
&gt;$OLD: You’re in trouble son    
&gt;$Client: *swearing incomprehensible*     
&gt;$me: Why in Dorn’s name is there a Linksys router here…    
&gt;$Client: My friend said I needed it for CoD man, I swear!    
&gt;$OLD: I thought you didn’t do fishing!    


*I explained the CoD thing later to $OLD, even now he still doesn’t quite get it but that’s fine, he’s retired for a few years now and we sip coffee on occasion laughing about cases like these.*    

*Turned out that the Client was told by a ‘friend’ that in order to play playstation 3 online you need to modify certain settings in your ports (or at least when you’re having issues) same with watching stuff of a NAS.*    

*Now the Client didn’t know how to operate a Cisco switch (nor did he have the passwords) And he sure as hell couldn’t make heads or tails of the ADSL box so he figured “hey if I add a device in between then surely it’ll work!” So he pestered $CTK into buying him a Linksys box and then proceeded to pester him every single day to the breaking point to have an IT guy come over to fix it.*    

*For whatever reason he decided to hide the stuff in between his stash of other illegal stuff (well illegal on the premise at least) and to tell us there was nothing there. Upon removing the Linksys and NAS (we plugged that in for him directly into the Switch upstairs*    

*He got later moved over to the (then) newly build high level security facility for $Corp so that they could keep a better eye on him.*    
*$CTK got reprimanded and then send on leave, he needed to destress and yelling at a scared and burnt out person isn’t going to do anyone any good.*    
    
    
**Extra:**    
*Timeskip to about two years ago, a few months before I left $Corp.*    
*I arrive at the facility and check in at the gate security, am led to the caretaker for one of the homes and told of the issue. “A hard to manage client has a mediabox that has died, he mentioned before he has had PS3 issues with us”.*     
*No, it simply can’t be, the universe is not that mean.*    
*Turned out, it is.*    
*Also turned out he was up to his old tricks only this time with a mediabox.*    


&gt;$Client: Ain’t you?    
&gt;$Me: what did you plug in this time    
&gt;$Client: Nothing..    
&gt;$Me: Spare me 10 minutes of my day please    


*Out comes another router, I unhook it, hook up his mediabox to an empty outlet, patch it, put it in the proper VLAN and it runs fine.*    


&gt;$Client: Erm, thanks.    
&gt;$Me: Ask them to “patch” an outlet for you next time you want crap and seriously consider changing that mattress…

I'm a student and I am about to start my fourth and final year of university.

In my third year of uni I went abroad for an internship for half a year and met a great girl while staying there. Unfortunately I had to come back to my own country to continue my studies. We remained a couple. She came to my country to spend our holiday together and we had a great time. She has since moved to the US and will be studying there for 2 years and will remain there to work afterwards. We both decided we want to try to build a life in America together.

That's it for backstory, now to my dilemma.
I need to do one more internship before I'm done with my study, so I figured I would try finding something in America. I found numerous companies that offer services to find a suitable internship and housing in the US. Thing is, it costs money and I'm a student. Furthermore, I need to pay for a visa and flight tickets. The estimated total amounts to €3400. I've applied for a part time job and I can eventually borrow some money from my family. I can gather the money and go and be there for around half a year, but I am not sure if it is wise to do. Going there to do an internship at a company might be a good way to get a foothold in the USA, a way to come back after receiving my degree. However, this option costs a lot of money and gives very little certainties. Furthermore there's no guarantee I would get to do an internship at a company anywhere near to my girl, which also weighs on this decision.

Alternatively, I can decide to stay here for the remainder of my studies, and save up as much as I can and try to go to the US when I finish my studies. Doing so allows me to remain to work part-time while I am doing a (paid) internship in my own country. I have no idea how difficult it is to find employment in the US, especially for someone who has just graduated, doesn't have a whole lot of work experience and is not based in the U.S. to begin with.. 

I'm uncertain which way to go might be the best, perhaps some entirely different way that I have not thought of. And yes, I know I am naive.

tl;dr:
Want to move to the USA to be with gf and find employment there, don't know how.

Any advice or resources I can use are very much appreciated.
Thanks for the help. "

I worked at a university this summer doing a research fellowship. I worked with several grad students conducting experiments, and when I finished collecting data I analyzed it and put it all together for the grad student I was working for. When this was all done I was able to present this data at the company that was sponsoring the research fellowship, and I received good feedback there.

The problem is, I never had a great relationship with my grad student or the professor who oversaw the lab. I wrote a report for the professor, but when I sent it to the grad student for review, he told me not to bother sending it to the professor. I am now 2 weeks out of the program and soon will be heading back to school. I'll be applying for internships this fall and I was looking for advice on what to do about this experience. I think I will still put it on my resume, but I don't know if I should even bother asking the professor/grad student for a reference. How do you all think I should handle this? Do you think it is worth asking for the reference, and do how would you explain the whole thing to a potential employer?

We are now set up to fail and I figure I have six months to a year to prepare. 

My co-workers and superiors are all pleased with my work, but I also know that technical interviews are a thing, and I am terrified of them. I have only one year of experience and I have never had a really tough interview experience, but I am good on the job.

Right now I work in DevOps but I would like to push more towards development. I picked up [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) and while parts of it make me feel less anxious, the questions scare the crap out of me.

I managed to get an A average in my math courses through school, but only because of Khan Academy and lots of time and effort. The very first question in the above book was finding the difference in angles on clock hands, and I wouldn't be able to negotiate that question without google, let alone be able to come up with an algorithm, or get it correct, without a good chunk of time.

What can I do to prepare? Which of the interview sites are the best? Should I be spending a lot of time on my math skills? I know a lot of it is about how you think (which I am confident in, I know I write good code), but what if I don't have the skills to create the algorithm in the first place because I don't know the steps in the first place?

4yk1s6,2,2016-08-19,"I [24/F] moved across the country with my boyfriend [24/F] of 5 years, thought life would be great, but we fight more than we ever have before. Where do I go from here?",mfe0323,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4yk1s6/i_24f_moved_across_the_country_with_my_boyfriend/,"My boyfriend and I met the summer before freshman year of college. We really hit it off and I'd never met someone who made me feel the way that he did. We're from the same hometown, have similar interests, and have always been there for each other through thick and thin. We did everything together and even through his depression later in college, we stuck by each other not only as boyfriend and girlfriend, but as confidants, emotional support systems, and just plain best friends.


Our relationship was solid and after 4 years of undergrad, we and our two dogs moved in together for graduate school. It was great! We rarely fought and enjoyed living together even more than we expected.


Graduate school was like a comfortable bubble for him. He is introverted and only needs two people- his best friend and myself. I, on the other hand, fall more in the middle between introverted and extroverted. I enjoy spending time with only him and time by myself reading, running, etc., but I also love meeting diverse people and trying new things. This difference in our personalities was never an issue though because in graduate school we were both too busy for anything outside of school.


In grad school we went to classes, came home, walked the dogs, worked out, made dinner, then did homework and went to bed. We would go out to bars together on the weekends, but normally just the two of us, or a small group of people. So, in this graduate school bubble with just the two of us, everything was great.


Sure we had a few minor fights, but at the time I didn't see a pattern emerging. Looking back, I now realize that all the fights we had were centered around when I wanted to do something without him. One (more extreme) example: I love music. I work in the arts and culture industry so music is a huge part of my life. My best friend and I wanted to go to a music festival. I wanted my boyfriend to come with us, he likes music and my best friend could care less if he came with us. We weren't planning on camping there, we weren't planning on staying till 2AM, nothing crazy, just go to see some of my all-time favorite artists play. I don't do party drugs- I do drink- but other than a few crazy college nights, am the reliable friend in my friend group.


When I told my boyfriend that we wanted to go just for the day on Saturday and Sunday, he freaked out. He immediately said he didn't want to go and thought it was insane that I would even think about going to something like that. I calmly explained it was just like us going to a concert, but of course acknowledged with a slightly crazier atmosphere. He wouldn't budge- he wouldn't come with us, but he wouldn't 'let me' go without him and threatened our relationship if I decided to go without him.


I understood his perspective. Crazy things happen at music festivals. But at the same time, if I don't do drugs and my friend and I were going to leave before it got too late, was it really that crazy? What it seemed to come down to was the fact that he didn't trust me not to get wasted and something bad happen. So, I passed on the opportunity to see 5 of my favorite artists of all time with my best friend to not make him upset.


Since we were still in grad school and didn't have much time for outside activities, things returned to normal after this. However, then came an amazing internship opportunity for me across the country. For three months I lived on the West coast while he was back East. Things were great, we talked on the phone daily and if anything, it made us closer having to be apart for a short amount of time. The rub was that whenever I did anything after work- went to happy hour with friends (girls), or went to a work related event/party, he would lose it. He would yell at me for ""probably getting wasted"" when I'd had two beers, or assume I was staying out late drinking when I would be hanging out with other interns. He was relentless and if I didn't text him back within a few minutes it would set him off even more. This greatly impacted my ability to enjoy myself during social gatherings because I constantly had my face in my phone trying to calm him down (which never worked).


Fast forward to current day. We currently live together on the West Coast. He has an amazing job as a data analyst working from home, and I work at an amazing nonprofit arts center (pretty much a dream job).


Part of my job involves meeting high profile donors and artists and attending cocktail parties and various events. These events are not all the time, at MAXIMUM, one or two nights a week during our busiest time. As you probably have guessed, these events have become a major issue in my relationship with my boyfriend.
When I go to the events, I will drink one or two glasses of wine. I'm not about to get a DUI or kill myself driving on curvy mountain roads, so out of self-preservation, I simply do not drive drunk. Well, if I come home and my boyfriend can smell the least bit of alcohol on me, he thinks I'm drunk. When I say I'm not, he just thinks I'm lying to cover it up.


Or at these events, if I say I should be done at 8PM and the event goes until 9PM, he thinks I've been lying to him about the event- and if I lied about the time he then jumps to ""what else have you been lying about?""


He goes into an anxious spiral worrying about what I'm doing, how much I'm drinking, who I'm hanging out with, and why I would rather be there instead of at home with him. Again- this severely impacts my ability to enjoy myself at these events and at points I probably seem downright rude while I'm texting in the corner by myself and ignoring my friends and other guests.


No matter what I tell him at these events, he thinks I'm lying. He doesn't trust me, even though through 5 years, I have never cheated on him, don't drive drunk, and have never lied about an event I was going to.


The things he seems to get the most mad about are things often out of my control- I have to attend a work event and he gets mad, the party runs long and he gets mad, I simply enjoy the event and he gets mad, I don't text him within 5 minutes and he gets mad.
These issues never surfaced in the past because I never had the opportunities that I do now. I get to meet fascinating people in my field and truly enjoy spending time conversing with artists from all over the country. I invite my boyfriend to meet them with me, but 98% of the time he's not interested.


I understand that he works from home and when I don't come home that means he's alone. However, if he refuses to join me at these events, and doesn't try to make friends to hang out with, what am I supposed to do? I would understand if I were gone four nights out of the week, but one night, MAYBE two?


I'm excited about these events and meeting new people, but my boyfriend always thinks the worst when I'm away from him and in social settings. He has nothing to worry about and I tell him that, but nothing calms him down. I can't turn down the opportunities I get purely to make him happy- it wouldn't make him happy to know I'm miserable at home when I could be enjoying myself at an event. Yet he refuses to come and be a part of my work life.


I don't want to break up- we live together, he's my best friend and I love his family, but when I look to the future and what I want from life, I'm scared these fights are going to get worse? If we've been together 5 years without any infidelity or things to worry about, what else can I do to gain his trust?


Just yesterday I mentioned wanting to go to Los Angeles for about the 5th time and when he said he didn't really want to go, I brought up my friend and I going together as an alternative. Just the thought of me going to LA without him sent him close to freak out mode and he stated, ""I would not trust you and XX in LA"" and that ""there is no way you are going to LA with XX"". XX, (my friend), by the way, does not even drink.


I'm all for being a good girlfriend, but I refuse to let a man tell me what I can and cannot do, especially when I have never done anything wrong. Likewise, what's wrong with wanting to experience life? Meeting people and doing things? How can I make this better? Or can I?


________________________________________
tl;dr: After 5 years together my boyfriend (who I love) is becoming more controlling and it's negatively affecting my social life and opportunity to make friends. What do I do?

4ykg4h,15,2016-08-19,I am so sorry Rob. I didn't forget,Throwaway74832324332,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4ykg4h/i_am_so_sorry_rob_i_didnt_forget/,"(A little background) All the way back in high school (I am entering my senior year of college now) I had a friend named Rob. Him and I went to a fairly reputable public school and lived in a well-to-do county in my state. My parents were divorced and I lived, with my sister, at my mom's house and would go to my dads house every other week (they literally lived a 3 minutes drive each other so this wasn't bad). My dad remarried (and now I have a step brother and half brother, both of whom I love and consider my brothers), but my mom did (and still is) remained single. She lived in a very nice neighborhood, but in a less wealthy section of it. She worked hard at her job and made enough to live there on her own and afford that house. 

(I'd say both of my parent's were upper middle class), but I did not have a car. My parents couldn't afford just give me a car like alot of my friend's parents did for them, again most of my friends from my area were fairly wealthy. I wasn't bitter; in fact, I am of the opinion one should not simply gift their children something as big as a card, but whatever. But the fact was that because I did not have a car, I could not get a job while in high school. This didn't bother my parents because I was an excellent student (I could pick up As even in classes like AP physics or AP calc with minimal effort), well liked, nice, and athletic. However, I had no income. 
What I would do would be to ask my mom or dad for like $40 every few weeks just to buy things like clothing or whatever (of course they always paid for my lunch at school). Anyway, my mom, being hispanic, is super close with her family. She visits her sister 3 hours away in DC fairly often. So she would sometimes do this on weekends where I was at my dads house, and I'd tell my dad I'd be going to a friends house for the weekend and just throw a party at my mom's. I recognize this sounds shitty, but I always had the intention of fully fixing anything that was broken or whatever... nothing was ever screwed up as people generally respected my home, despite how packed it got a few times. 

We are getting to Rob, bare with me. Back at that time when I had parties, I always wanted to provide my friend's with some alcohol. But the $40 every few weeks was never enough to buy sufficient alcohol, so I asked my friend Rob for some money to buy the alcohol. He would always give me like $20 to help out. He was the only kid to ever help out. He didn't even drink! (He wasn't straight edge; he'd smoke weed a lot, but just didn't like drinking). I remember he'd always say yes without hesitation. 

I found out, later (embarrassingly later, considering he was a good friend of mine), that he went to Philly after school nearly everyday, a 40 minute drive, to work a job to help support his single mom and sister. His mom had him when she was 19, and his dad was nowhere to be seen. So he worked everyday after school to help provide food and the like for his mom and his sister.

And this motherfucker gave me $20 every time I asked him! He was working an extra job to PROVIDE FOR HIS MOM as a 16 year old. My friends who had been gifted cars/gas/clothing/vacations/etc... by their parents never helped when I asked; now they totally were not obliged to, but just to put it in comparison. 
Rob never brought it up, never complained that that was ~3 hours of work for him to give me that money. He never told me. I happened to ask a closer friend of his where he went after school when he couldn't come eat dinner with us at a local pizza place and he told me what Rob did nearly everyday.

It seemed so inconsequential when I was asking. Not even a hint that it was an issue. But then I realized. And I felt so sorry. I was so sorry for asking you to pay for alcohol you didn't drink with money you really shouldn't have given me. And I never forgot. Not once.

I privately made the decision my senior year of high school that I would repay him, like 200 fold. Whenever I had enough money. I am now, like I said, entering my senior year of college and I am doing very well. Most people will leave college with debt. But I am leaving college having made money (talking like total $20k... massive scholarship + 3 summers of internships + 3 years of work during school) and graduating at the top of my class in chemical engineering. Rob, you're getting paid. I don't know how much longer it will take. Perhaps a year or two. But you have $5k+ coming your way. I know a monetary reward is not sufficient for such a genuinely selfless act that you repeatedly gave me, but its the best I could come up with. I have never forgotten.

TL;DR my friend who worked an extra job 40 minutes away in highschool to provide for his young single mother and sister gave me money for parties whenever I asked. I'm giving him a few thousand. Call it interest on the loans"

I hope that mods of all Spanish subreddits would copy-paste this in their Wiki. I will be doing this as well in my subs, when I'm back home.*

---

A few hours ago, I wanted to withdraw money from my account. Sadly, it didn't go as planned. 

I inserted my card (Maestro) and pressed *Idiomas* to change to English. The settings changed, but the screen told me I had to *insert my card*. However, I already did that. 

Do you speak Spanish, Valencian or Catalan? Well then you will have a much easier time. If you don't, well that sucks, but don't worry. With the help of this post I want to clearly instruct what you could do in this situation. 

---

If you are in Spain, you need to go to the *[Policía Nacional](http://www.policia.es/wap/index.php)* (National Police). There is a department called *SATE* ([Servicio de Atención al Turista Extranjero (ESP)](http://www.esmadrid.com/informacion-turistica/sate), [Foreign Tourist Assistance Service (ENG)](http://www.esmadrid.com/en/tourist-information/sate)). The person that helped me out spoke fluent Spanish, English and German. *Shoutout for the great help, Javier!*

The Madrid office for this is:
[Calle de Leganitos, 19](https://goo.gl/maps/79TXHbkwTjN2)

If you're not in Madrid, ask any police officer for such a location. 

---

**What exactly happens when the ATM doesn't give you back your card?**

The person that I talked to from my bank said that the card gets destroyed inside the ATM.

---

**Should I block that card through my bank?**

This is what I personally chose to do. My parents read online that there is a possibility that the card got scammed. Please, don't take risks.

---

**Do I need to show identification?**

Yes. You will need identification. I recommend carrying a copy. In most cases this will suffice. However, if you're going to the police when this happens, get the original one. Confirmed by an officer.

---

**How can I get money?**

This situation is unpleasant, but do not panic. What you should always have is at least a back up of €50.

Call your bank, they probably have an Emergency Hotline and consult with them.

If you're traveling alone, ask your friends/family to send you money through [Western Union](http://www.westernunion.nl/WUCOMWEB/staticMid.do?method=load&amp;countryCode=NL&amp;languageCode=nl&amp;pagename=HomePage). For example, your parents could send you a €100 from abroad. They will get a reference number that they need to send you, and then you can collect the money at any Western Union location in the world. You need to show the exact same reference number. It does cost money to transfer money, keep that in mind. 

***The sender needs to fill in your name as it is in your identification!***

---

**Should I contact Maestro/Visa/American-Express?**

This is what I did and I recommend it. The help desk will explain to you what happened and what you could do.

---

**Tips**

* Download the app of your bank, as then you will have your bank account number with you and then you can block the card. 
* Take your ID with you. 
* Police officers are not obliged to learn English. SATE will probably have someone that does. 
* Download Google Translate ([iOS](https://appsto.re/nl/kT-Ty.i) &amp; [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&amp;hl=nl)). Download your native language, as well as English and Spanish so you can use it without an Internet connection. 
* Do not use Bankia at Puerta deal Sol (Madrid). 

---

**Exact instructions**

* Get your phone and identification.
* Call the telephone number that is displayed on the ATM machine.
* Give the correct information.
* Follow their instructions.

*(If this doesn't work, because you can't understand them, do the following.)*

* Get your identification.
* Look up the nearest police station/SETA (ask officers if necessary)
* Consult with the person in the office. 
* Call your bank and disable the card (better safe than sorry).
* Ask your friends/parents to transfer money to you through Western Union
* Get a new bank card as soon as possible.

**Post Scriptum**

I was just about to purchase some souvenirs, but no I have no money at all, and tomorrow I'm flying to Portugal. :(

I should not me that this is the first time happening to me, and I'm here alone, still learning Spanish and am only 19 since last month. I don't do a lot of bank stuff. I may have made some mistakes in my doings, but at least it is solved. 

I hope any of you can learn from this! 

*Update*

This morning, I was able to get the money my parents transferred to me through Western Union, so I'll be fine. Luckily, I was able to get some of the souvenirs that I wanted. Guess that means I'll *have* to come back soon! ;)

I'm so glad I actively learned Spanish in school and during my internship in Barcelona. It opens up doors and opportunities.

We met and started dating when we were 18 and pretty inexperienced with sex, dating and love. We're both now 23 and have just moved from our home town in Australia to London, where my family is originally from. I have an internship here while my boyfriend will look for work. 

We're still flat hunting and hopping from airbnb to airbnb. It's a little stressful and isolating as neither of us know many people in the city. I'm making an effort to go out and do things, even if it is just buying dinner. 

Given our sexual inexperience and desire to make the most of our time here, my boyfriend suggested that we enter into an open relationship. This was surprising given that he's very insecure - something that has really affected our relationship. He covers his insecurities by putting down other people or acting too cocky and mean. 

Anyway, we agreed to the open relationship and he found someone and spent a night away. All was well.

I had an instant connection with the first guy who messaged me on Grindr. We met and I had one of the most romantic nights of my life. He showed me the sights of London and was sweet, funny and importantly, kind. 

I have always had doubts that my boyfriend and I were not 'meant for each other'. I want someone who is ambitious, active and kind. My bf is more the lie on the couch all day while I come home from work and then cook dinner type. I'm terrible at telling people no and hurting their feelings so have spent years trying to focus on my boyfriend's good qualities - and he does have them - rather than actually breaking up with him. But after the Grindr date I know that he's not the one for me. Not that Grindr boy is - he just opened my eyes. 

Here's my dilemma. We're new in London looking for a flat together. I don't think he's particularly happy right now but it would be cruel of me to take him across the world only to break up with him. 

Do I spend another year with him or pull the plug now before we sign a lease? He can afford flights back.

Any thoughts appreciated!!

Tldr: moved across the world with bf. Not sure if we are meant to be together."

Another is going to have to leave the company due to circumstances out of our control and his. We're hoping to hire someone before he leaves in mid-October so that the newbie can learn from him a bit before he's gone.

Most of our web stuff is in C#. We use the [NancyFx](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Introduction) framework, which is a slightly more flexible version of MVC than the traditional ASP.NET. We use a lot of [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) for templating and have recently started doing a lot of graphing and dashboards in [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery). We've been considering starting to use [KendoUI](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/), especially since I'm about to be the only web developer here and it will make it easier to build good-looking stuff faster. We also have a couple Drupal sites that we use for documentation and are considering selling our software to new types of clients, which is going to require a rewrite of our company website (platform/framework TBD). The database backend is SQL Server 2008, which I really love working with. Our core software is an old desktop application, basically an analyst-friendly database GUI, that allows clients to build and run queries, save them, update data in the database, etc. We're in the process of replacing that with a Rails application (mostly written by our sister company and shared with us through the parent company) and you could potentially help develop that as well.

Our company is full of smart, responsible people (I think there are around 18 of us at this point). Everyone has their own office, which makes it very easy to get in the zone and hammer out some code when you need to. Free snacks and coffee. Not as much ""fun"" culture as your typical start-up; most of our database engineers and account managers are married and have kids and people here tend to get their work done and go home at a reasonable hour. 

You would have a significant amount of freedom in terms of designing the software that you're building. No one here is a ""design expert"" by any means, so we do a lot of group discussion about what looks good or works well and what doesn't and use [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to share our ideas for how things could/should look. 

I personally really love working here. I was hired a year and a half ago as someone who could load data for new client implementations. I contributed to the C# console apps that we use to load data and eventually was given some web stuff to do. I now spend 90% of my time on web and am the only one here that understands about 50% of our software. We get paid hourly, everyone from the CTO on down to our summer intern. This sounds weird, but is actually awesome. It incentivizes the company to not overwork people, because we get time and a half on anything over 40 hours. On the odd weeks where I do put in extra hours, I get an automatic bonus for it. The company is pretty flexible about working from home if you have a decent reason to do so and it isn't hindering your work.

We're in Wakefield in the Edgewater corporate park. If you live in Cambridge/Somerville, it's about a half hour drive. Shoot me a resume or LinkedIn if you're interested or (if you're a recruiter) if you have any candidates that you think would be a good fit."

I like math, science, and being able to learn things that related to my own ability to learn quicker and faster. But I have a learning disability so a homework that takes someone 1-hour to do takes me 4-5 hours unless I have done something similar in the past. I also enjoy financial planning and stock watching, as well as reselling on ebay. 

I have built computers, troubleshooted information, built a website, modded games. I tend to break part consoles and repair them, then sell them. Though I do not know if I could finish the schooling and get a competitive engineering job while accounting seems more safe and secure (for outside hobbies).  

According to my research so far: 

Accounting Pros - 

* Ability to work in most cities 

* Everyone needs an accountant 

* Flexibility, high time off in non-peak hours 

* Can get any business job 

* Can start your own business 

* Large growth 

* Once you get public experience, your skill set will be in demand in almost any industry 

Accounting Cons -

* Long hours in public

* Dealing with business students 

* Not really ""passion-driven"" industry

* The work atmosphere can be more toxic 

* More credentials are needed (CAP, Masters). The schooling is less for education and more for work-related information. 

-------------------
Engineering Pros - 

* Ability to think, problem solve, and relate to the world

* Engineering students are usually some of the best and brightest to work with and they can push you to learn new things 

* Higher pay, lower hours are potentially easier to attain 

* Life long passion for learning if successful 

* Once you get a job, your skill set will be demanded in almost any organization unless you are put into a dead-end position 

Engineering Cons -

* Slow growth for entry level positions leaves many flooding into computer related fields 

* Dealing with engineering professors and risk failing, dealing with arrogant engineers

* Potentially low GPA metric means lower chances for scholarships, jobs, internships.

* A fear of failure and causing someone to die. Though they tend to compensate by over-estimating EVERYTHING from what I read. 

* The work atmosphere can be static without direction 

* Lots of self-study to keep up with technology

4yksx5,2,2016-08-19,"Currently senior student, want to (eventually) work short hours or in computational science/AI/... Any recommended career path?",IronSaviour,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4yksx5/currently_senior_student_want_to_eventually_work/,"First off, I'm located in Europe; I understand, that the job market/culture is different from the US here, but I believe that people and software development are similar in principle.

My current situation: I graduated in CS with no relevant work experience at the age of 25, because of health problems. I'm currently pursuing masters in CS (the curriculum is rather underwhelming though, and there are no opportunities to get involved either) and hope to graduate by the time I'm 27-28. I might get at least a short internship in the meantime (they're rather rare around here).

I believe I can get an average job after graduation and have an average career. The problem is: I don't really want to follow that path. I've recently asked myself, what I actually want to do in life, and two things popped up:

1. Work only as much as necessary to support myself, spare my health (low stress, minimum time spent sitting in an office) and focus on my (mostly intellectual) interests.
2. Find a fulfilling career in research: either CS (AI), or some other field, where I can apply CS. (Perhaps I should note, that I enjoy the academic environment for the most part.)

My current ""plan"" is to graduate, work in software development for a year or two, then try to get either another masters specialized in AI, or a degree in another field (presumably anything from non-molecular biology to social sciences)... I would try to get involved as much as possible and get my foot in the door. If I don't like it or fail, I can hopefully go back to software development and focus on working short hours/remotely. I'm not particularly worried about money at this point, because I'm single by choice, have a very frugal lifestyle and education is very cheap here (another masters would be under €1k total).

I wonder what kind of software development/technology I should seek initially. It's all information systems (Java/.NET), websites (PHP/front-end) or mobile apps, where I'll apply initially.

I'm unsure about a couple of possible pitfalls though:

* I've seen people mention, that senior-level jobs open possibilities for working less/remotely. However, the less I focus on a career in software development, (1) the less experience I'll have to actually get to the senior level (how long is it typically?) and (2) if I voluntarily stale at non-senior jobs for a long time, I suspect, that it might be seen as a red flag by some people.
* If I change my mind about starting a family (or anything expensive) later down the road, I'm not sure, if a sudden advance up the ladder will still be an option.
* I'm worried, that my interest in theory and all that jazz will wane, if I work in a common job for too long, and cognitive abilities usually slowly diminish with age.

Have I missed anything?

Thanks for reading; advice would be appreciated."
4yku3z,71,2016-08-19,Netflix and Chill until Q3 is over,Peeptrade,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4yku3z/netflix_and_chill_until_q3_is_over/,"On July 18th , Netflix ($NFLX) released its earnings report for Q2, and it is fair to say that it is quite disappointing. At its release after closing bell, its share price fell from $98.81 to $84.88 overnight. This is because investors lost trust in Netflix as a profitable stock. They cite Netflix’s un-grandfathering strategy and increasing competition as two main reasons behind Netflix’s inability to acquire new customers in Q2. 

**Why Netflix rallied**

From June 27th to July 18th, Netflix’s stocks rose by almost 16%, from $85.33 per share to $98.81 per share. This rally comes with the news of its partnership with Comcast, as well as the U.S. markets reaching record highs. It was a very bullish three weeks in the U.S. markets, and Netflix’s partnership announcement came at the right time. Netflix’s partnership is expected to reach 8 million Comcast X1 owners, a number which will increase significantly in Q3 and Q4. This news gave investors positive signs about Netflix’s potential growth, resulting in an increase in their stock price. However, I find this number to be uninformative for reasons I will state in a later section.

**A look into Q2 earnings report**

In Q2, Netflix grew by 1.7 million members and now possess over 83 million members. This is below its own forecast of 2.5 million new members, and last year’s Q2 net additions of 3.3 million. As for earnings, they ended Q2 with an operating income of $70 million and net income of $41 million, against a forecast of $47 million and $9 million respectively. This variance is largely due to lower-than-expected costs.

Even though they reported a higher-than-expected income, what concerns investors is Netflix’s failure to attract new customers. The gross additions were on target, but churn was unexpectedly higher in Q2.

Within the United States, its Q2 net additions were 0.16 million against a forecast of 0.50 million. Netflix expects to reach 60-90 million members domestically by 2020, and at their current pace, they would be lucky to reach 55 million. Domestically, Netflix currently stands at 47.13 million users. Assuming they continue at the same rate of 0.16 million per quarter, by the end of 2020, they will only have acquired 50.01 million customers.

As for global growth, net additions in Q2 were 1.5 million compared to its forecast of 2.0 million. Actual net additions fell significantly short of forecasts both domestically and internationally. Therefore, even a higher-than-expected earnings per share could not convince investors of its potential for growth.

**The Silver Lining**

As I mentioned in the first paragraph, the two main reasons behind investors’ bearish outlook is due to Netflix’s un-grandfathering strategy and increased competition. However, a closer analysis of the numbers will reveal that both of those reasons are unjustified.

According to Netflix’s letter to the investors, Netflix registered an unexpected uptick in churn rate in early April, which is coincident with the press coverage informing the public of Netflix’s plan to un-grandfather longer tenured members. However, the churn of members who were actually un-grandfathered was mild and matched Netflix’s own forecasts. This reveals that due to poor news reporting and miscommunication, many users thought that there would be an overall price increase.

As for the problem regarding increased competition, there is also a similar explanation. As Internet TV becomes increasingly popular, the number of subscription video on demand (SVOD) offerings also increases. In the U.S., there is Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access, Seeso, Hulu, YouTube Red, and many others. This translates to more competition for Netflix. However, as Netflix points out in their letter to the investors, “increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions rather than churn”.  Netflix’s churn rate in Canada is also evidence of this. They experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April, but there was no recent increase in SVOD competition. Coincidentally, they were also in the process of un-grandfathering in Canada during that time.

Since Netflix’s gross additions were on target, if Netflix is correct about the reasoning behind its higher-than-expected churn, Q2’s poor results is a minor hiccup that should pass.

**Reasons to Invest**

According to CEO Reed Hastings in a Q2 earnings interview, he revealed that the current three-tier pricing strategy in the U.S. is working very well ($7.99 SD, $9.99 HD, and $11.99 UHD) with new members. With this new pricing system, it will generate significantly more revenue for Netflix to create more original content. As proven through Netflix Originals such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, Netflix originals have been highly successful. This year, Netflix Originals are nominated for 54 Primetime Emmys, which is the third-most total nominations of any domestic network, only behind FX and HBO.

Netflix Originals will be crucial in Netflix’s future because aside from their first-mover advantage, their original series will help with customer retention in the face of increasing competition. Even though Netflix claims that competition was not a cause in Q2’s poor results, increasing SVOD competition will certainly be significant in the near future.

Bear in mind the market for Internet TV is still huge. Netflix predicts that in the coming decades, there will be nearly 1 billion pay TV subscribers who will migrate to Internet TV. Netflix already has partnerships with over 40 multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs) around the world, which will increase their market penetration in areas with partnerships. However, there is one thing to be wary of in terms of partnerships in the United States: Netflix already has a large user base within the United States. This means that there will be many supposedly “new” customers who are already Netflix customers. For example, many owners of Comcast X1 are customers of Netflix. Therefore, the reported reach of 8 million Comcast X1 owners is a meaningless number as many of the 8 million are already Netflix users. Even Hastings admitted in the earnings interview that the Comcast partnership will only have a “modest” impact on customer growth.

As for Netflix’s goal of reaching 60-90 million customers in the U.S., I have no doubt that they will succeed. Their most difficult work lies ahead in international development as they face massive competition, regulations, pricing differences, and piracy. However, they have made that their number one priority. They have already begun establishing the necessary channels such as creating original content and MVPD partnerships in each country to gain market penetration. In the long-term, Netflix should face multi-year growth in these new markets.

**Why wait until Q4?**

Netflix will face some temporary headwinds in the short-term. The Olympics will be in Q3, and according to CFO David Wells, the Olympics will affect global gross additions negatively. It will be a small and temporary impact, but it will be meaningful nonetheless. Q4 is also a better time to invest is because it signals the end of Netflix’s un-grandfathering process. If it persists into Q4, it should not be for long. If Q2 results are anything to go by, we can expect the Olympics and un-grandfathering to create uncertainty and a decrease in global gross additions. Therefore, I suggest waiting till Q4 to invest in Netflix.

I spent my first two years as a Help Desk Technician at my school, then in the spring of 2015 moved to a local company of about 400 as an IT intern. I worked there for a little over a year and was eventually titled: ""IT Professional"". I ended up leaving on good terms in the spring of 2016 to pursue a ""server engineering"" internship at a very large medical group near me. I wanted some change, and the opportunity to experience an enterprise environment. My summer internship is coming to a close, and I've definitely learned a lot, but now I'm faced with the decision of what I will do during the school year and beyond.

I've already spoken with my company where I worked as an ""IT Professional"". They've stated that I can come back and work there part time, but have no guarantees as to full time come graduation. A couple weeks ago, I noticed a posting for a network/systems administrator at another company near me. I've always wanted to work as a systems/net administrator, so I immediately applied, thinking I would be rejected, as I had not completed my degree quite yet. I was contacted, and asked to interview, with the notion that I would work part time during the school year, essentially ""merging"" myself into the job come graduation. One thing has led to another, and I believe I'll be officially offered the job next week. I would be starting off hourly, but paid fairly well, and then move to salary after graduation.


Soooo...any thoughts r/ItCareerQuestions?

I'm really leaning towards taking the latest job. I think it really suits my interests, and I believe I could work my way in and excel at the position.

Let me know your thoughts, and feel free to ask me additional questions!

Just wanted to get a general opinion from trusted people in this field. I just had my first phone screen out of my 70 applications. We talked about my experience briefly and by the end of it, she told me that my experience with Node (being only 1-2 years) isn't qualified for the Jr. Node developer position. She then offered a part-time internship role for much lower wage. Does this happen often? I really wanna catch a break and get my foot in the door in this field. Should I grab at this? I'm pretty low-confidence about my qualifications in general but this is a reeeaal bummer.. I was looking for something in the 55k-&gt;75k range but 25k is a big drop."
4yl28d,93,2016-08-19,"Our happy hour website for DC is now online, active, and nearly finished with our final beta. How can we make it better?",SomeGuyInDeutschland,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/4yl28d/our_happy_hour_website_for_dc_is_now_online/,"Hey everyone, Justin here! We took your feedback back in [May](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/4gpoyr/my_happy_hour_website_for_dc_is_now_online_and_in/), [January](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/406zwg/im_creating_a_happy_hour_map_for_dc_here_are_my/) and last [October](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3nlvf5/making_a_happy_hour_app_for_dc_what_do_you_think/) and made a ton of changes to the website. I'm proud to announce that the Happy Hour website my team and I have been building this past year is now fully online, active, and nearly finished with beta. You can now go to [www.VicePrice.co](http://www.viceprice.co) to start finding happy hours around the city.


I'm now proud to release our final beta for feedback and thoughts. 


Quick Q&amp;A:

**How do you keep data accurate?**

The info you see is what bars &amp; restaurants put on their websites. [Usually you can click [""Source of Info""](http://imgur.com/a/zN7CM) to see the direct URL used to pull Happy Hour info] 

We've set up an automated web scraper that runs once a month to keep info fresh. We have long term plans to measure how often venues update info and ensuring that inaccurate days are kept to near zero.


We also plan on emailing venue owners in the future so those without online info can still show happy hour info online

**How many Happy Hours are in DC?**

By our count, there are 553 happy hours total in DC. Of that 553, 240 have info online [which is what is shown on the website]


**Is this an app?**

Nope! We had to be scrappy so we're starting out as a website that's also mobile optimized. The best way to use VicePrice is on a desktop.


**What kind of filters do you have?**

The website automatically filters to the current day. You can filter it down further by hour to find your perfect happy hour.

**What Happy Hour do you recommend?**

It's Medaterra by Woodley Park Zoo Metro Station!
 

Details: 

All Day, Every Day Monday - Sunday [10:30am - 10:30pm]


Address: 

2614 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008


Drinks

$1 Frozen Margaritas [Lime, Peach, Strawberry, Raspberry
$2 Tequila Shot
$3 Miller Lite
$5 Martinis/Sangria


Food

$3 Spicy Wings with Fries
$5 Cheeseburgers with Fries


**Why isn't food included?**

We determined early on that we had to prioritize our time and resources to either drinks or food. Otherwise we'd end up missing both goals. I decided to stick with drinks because let's be honest, alcohol is what really makes this town somewhat function.


**Why did you included ABC neighborhood in XYZ neighborhood?**

Originally we had over 33 neighborhoods. We had to reduce that number if the map was to be usable. We're always looking for better name suggestions. [Don't worry, AdMo will never be used]


**Wait! I don't see my favorite place!**

Chances are they don't have happy hour info listed online yet. We email owners urging them to publish info to make sure their venues get as many people as possible. Feel free to let me know what you want to see online and I'll make sure it happens.


**I need to talk with you. What's your email?**

justin@viceprice.co


**Why did you make this?**

It's been crazy starting this project. Initially this began because of my frustrations having to update happy hour spreadsheets while as an intern on the Hill. I decided to leave the Hill and spend the next 10 months bringing together a team to make VicePrice a reality. Having had zero experience in either Tech or Startups, it was a hell of a climb. But I've learned more than I've ever could.


**Who's on the team?**

Here we are. [I'm the guy in the middle](http://imgur.com/a/YlPu7)


Feedback and thoughts are immensely appreciated! After all, this is for all of us :D

p.s. If you happen to know of a DC tech company that's hiring Technical Product Managers, I would love a heads up.

4yl2zf,74,2016-08-19,How I caught my friend's girlfriend cheating in the act. Kind of... (M/F) (college) (long),Iwillneverbeawizard,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/4yl2zf/how_i_caught_my_friends_girlfriend_cheating_in/,"Ok so a friend of mine has been dating this girl for a few years and I became pretty close friends with her as well during this time. However, over the last year or so their relationship has gotten strained. Friend (Tim) has been going through some things with his family and ended up lashing out against some other friends in our group. There were somethings about those guys that he didn't appreciate but his feelings heightened as he was going through more and more stress, and he ended up breaking off his friendship with them. I'm still friends with those guys, I just never hang out with Tim and the others together anymore. After breaking it off with those guys Tim pretty much only hung out with his girlfriend and I, and pretty much spent 99% of his time with his girlfriend. Like this was a pretty unhealthy amount of time together, says all of our friends. 

Tim's girlfriend (lets call her Erica) pretty much had to be his rock. Now Erica is the type of girl who takes pride in being known as a nice person. She would put so much thought into every action to make people think she was this innocent angel of a girl, but as we got to know her more and more we realized how fake she is. One person who didn't realize this, or at least he refused to believe that she wasn't an angel was Tim. 

Let's go into Erica's history a little bit. When we all first started college, Erica had a crush on one of Tim's friends (Chad). Chad was a jock-ish dude who was pretty smart, but if you didn't know him you'd think he was a typical ""Chad"" (hence the name in my story). Now Chad didn't really like Erica, but Erica really like him. She spent a lot of time with him and eventually met Tim through Chad. When Chad made it clear that he didn't want to go out with her she moved on to Tim. Tim never knew that Erica had a thing for Chad when he started going out with her. Erica actually really didn't like Tim when they first started dating. She broke up with him soon after and tried to go after Chad again, and then when she got rejected again she went back to Tim. Chad, not wanting to hurt Tim's feelings, never told him about this.

Tim and Erica date for a while and get really serious. A year or so later they decide to live together. A few days before Erica moved out of her place Tim was out of town visiting his family. Chad came over to help her pack everything since almost everyone else was back home anyways and this was back when they were still friends. After they finished a lot of the packing they call it a day and just chill with some drinks. After getting drunk Erica suggests that Chad stays over and they go to sleep in her bed. One thing leads to another and Erica and Chad end up fucking. Erica realizes her mistake and tells Tim a bs story about how Chad made a move on her and that she didn't reciprocate his advances, she told Chad to take the hit and convinced him by telling him how important Tim was to her and that he would be devastated to know the truth. 

Tim believed her and took it out on Chad, totally ruining that relationship.

A few months back Erica made an advance on me. I immediately tell Tim that his girlfriend is taking advantage of him but he doesn't believe me. Instead he tells Erica that I'm making up rumors about her. She tells all of our friends that I made advances on her and this starts to push Tim away from me. By now most of our friends realized that she's full of shit and take my side and try to tell Tim that he's being taken advantage of. He of course takes Erica's side over the friends he's alienated over the past.

Fast forward to last week. Tim is back home for the weekend, and Erica is on campus for an internship. I decide to go to a party Friday night and I see Erica there. She's kinda tipsy and I'm kinda tipsy and she's dressed slutty as hell. She takes my hand and pulls me into one of the bathrooms. This kinda gets me mad, and at the same time I'm kinda turned on, cuz, you  know, she's looking hot. She's a pretty small girl, 5'4""-ish, petite, and a blonde with face kinda like a mashup between Shakira and Cher Lloyd, except a more square face (http://www.morphthing.com/celebrity/94119842-Shakira-Cher-Lloyd). 

We start making out in the bathroom and I have this great idea on how I can finally get Tim to leave her. I'll just audio record this entire thing from my phone! As we're making out I take out my phone and say I got a text, I turn on the audio recorder and put it back in my pocket. 

We start ripping each other's clothes off and so far all she's doing is kissing and moaning, so she's not recognizable by voice. I start getting rough with her, when she gets completely naked I grab her neck and push her against the door and start biting her nipples and stick my fingers in her moistening vagina. She moans my name and tells me to keep going. I tell her that I'm going to need her to be a slut today. I grab her shoulders and push her down and take my pants off. She grabs my cock and says its big compared to Tim. (Great, now I can't really share this with our friends, but now I have her on audio saying Tim's name.) I tell her that if she wants my cock she's going to have to beg for it.  I rub my cock against her face as she tells me she needs it in her. I rest it on her lips and she starts sucking me off. Holy shit, Tim was in heaven. She starts licking and slobbering all over it for a few minutes then gets up and pulls me toward her, sandwiching her between the wall. We make out as she's rubbing my cock and I'm fingering her now soaking pussy. I lift her up and she rubs my head against her clit. She stopped kissing me and brought her lips right next to my ear and pressed my tip against her vagina. I pushed my head in and she gasps into my ear and I start making slow, deep strokes into her. Slowly I pick up speed and she starts getting really loud. I start to get pissed off and I put her down and turned her around onto the sink, now holding her mouth shut as I'm fucking her from behind. After a little bit of that we both start to cum. I pull out and tell her to get down, she takes my cock all the way into her mouth and started forcefully swallowing. That was too much for me to handle and I came as she started sucking at each burst of my load. 

We got all cleaned up and I left the party. I got my story together for Tim and will show him the audio I have of her later this weekend. He'll finally realize what a piece of shit his girlfriend is and hopefully reconcile with our old friend group, if that's not too much to ask. 

Plus it kinda felt good to hatefuck Erica and simultaneously take out some of my frustration with Tim.

TLDR: Fucked friend's cheating girlfriend and caught it on audio."

I accepted a job offer back in January. I studied information technology in college and graduated this month. I just started this job and, I'm beginning to think if this was a huge mistake. When I interviewed for this job it was made to seem that it would be focused more heavily on IT security and I would be able to do things like penetration testing and testing systems companies have. Instead, my job will be more focused on accounting looking at financial statements and only looking at high level details of the IT side of the company. This was not what I was hoping for in my job. Beyond that, I have been getting zero amount of training for what I will actually be doing. They have also given me no projects to work on for my first two weeks. So I have been just sitting at my desk pretending to work for eight hours. Finally, the culture is very boring. Most people do not talk to each other and just sit at their desks all day. At my internship, I enjoyed the job much better and the culture of that company. The only reason why I didn't pursue that was because of the pay which I am starting to now regret. So, is there any suggestions for me in my situation? I feel like I need to give the job a longer chance but at the same time I feel like I will be miserable at this job. Thanks for any help in advance!

4yl798,2,2016-08-19,Recent break up Me (27/M) she (26/F). This is kind of long story (SRY!). Did I handle this wrong and what should I do next?,Emccle7,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/4yl798/recent_break_up_me_27m_she_26f_this_is_kind_of/,"So this whole relationship starts with a dinner party in the summer of 2015. I met this girl (She's 26 and I'm 27). We hit it off over our obsession of Breaking Bad and laughing over the numerous amount of people who bought $2 wine to this party. As we started hanging out more she was offered a scholarship to Univ of Iowa for the MFA program they have. I have never done long distances before. But I was open to the idea because I liked the vibe of this girl and saw a future with her.

The idea of moving to Iowa City kind of popped up right around the time she was leaving Baton Rouge (Late June). At the time, I was working odd jobs and was kind of getting tired of the scene around here. So, I said ""I'm open to the idea of moving up there as a possibility. Soon after she left I got hired as fundraising/recruitment coordinator at a local hospital. Not exactly what I wanted to be doing right out of college. But it pays the bills and they promised to reimburse my masters degree once I work 6 mos. 

During the Fall things got more serious. Especially after she invited me to her best friends wedding in Tennessee. We also visited Atlanta for NYE where our first major argument went down. Basically while I was showering in our hotel room. She went through my phone and found messages from a female co-worker that she deemed to be inappropriate. I'll admit that the conversation could look sketchy to someone who is unfamiliar with my work environment. But nothing was going on with this chick and I. In my job, when you spend that much time with people on the road. You kind of have conversations that to the outside eyes may look a certain way when they are not. (This would be one of two times that she went into my phone without permission btw . During a Saint Pat's day party she went thru my phone and covered a text conversation from February 2015 and in her mind believes that it took place in 2016. She was pretty drunk and made massive scene. Which I don't even know how to explain)

Nevertheless, I started to really hunt for jobs in Iowa City and the surrounding areas . My SO started to look for apts in the area and soon found somewhere to live. I never experienced this before. But apparently finding rental space in Iowa City is a difficult move and people start figuring out things for the next fall way more quickly than when I attended LSU . Needless to say, we signed a lease and I was really hoping for an interview to pop up soon.

Basically the job prospects in Iowa City and the surrounding areas aren't exactly amazing now. I applied to 20-30 jobs that were similar or better than the one I have now. Many of them gave me the typical ""you lack experiences"" line. In that time I told my SO that moving to Iowa City in August looked like a uncertain situation. She would kind of brush my statements off and still act like I was moving there in August. One night (I believe in late May) I literally had to tell her point black that it would be wise to entertain the idea of a backup plan just in case August 1st didn't work out as planned.

Over the course of Summer16 I visited Iowa City three separate times (One time involved a mix of St.Louis for our anniversary). The first visit went fine until the night before I was going to drive back to BR. She said that we needed to talk about things. Basically she believed that I should quit my job in BR and move to Iowa City because it would be a fresh start and that I would eventually find something to do there. I openly told her that this would be a shaky plan because what happens if I don't find something and we are left with months of rent and bills to pay for. She responded with ""I can cover the financial situation for 2 or 3 months"". That entire deal seems like a red flag in my mind. In no way did I think that was a good idea. Basically she didn't like my answers and we ""broke up"" that night. I say it that way because roughly two weeks later we visited STL together for our anniversary and a concert.

Which brings me to the month of July. I thought things were slowly coming into place for her folks to help her out with her rent. That was proven to be wrong when she messaged me one day after asking ""What do you want to do about paying the rent?"". Personally I have no problem helping my significant other pay for some things. But asking someone to pay $460 a month (total amount is $960 a month with two cats) on a place they do not live is absurd to me. Along with the fact I have a car note and insurance to pay for.

Nevertheless, we got into a screaming match and she felt that I was ""throwing her under the bus"". I took some time over the weekend and decided that it was kind of **** up to leave her hanging for a full months rent with 15 days before her move in. So I took a part of my tax return and paid my portion of the rent. That's when her mood seemed to change and the she started to talk about ""Whether or not I was going to come up to Iowa City to help her move in?"". So I drove up to Iowa City and helped her move in. Like before, our ability to communicate face to face really isn't a problem. But the morning I was about to leave she asked ""Are we going to talk about things?"". We talked and I explained I was willing to help her. She responded with ""Well I don't really want your help because I don't want you to hold it over my head and make me feel like I should get on my knees and praise you for doing so"". Which I consider a slap in the face and kind of carried over to our last argument.

Basically a week after I visited her in IC. My best buddy asked me to go to a beach volleyball tournament in Destin FL. On that trip I didn't really communicate with her that often because I was playing in a tournament and slightly upset about her comments at the tail end of the Iowa trip. Saturday night after wrapping things up and having drinks with the group. I saw on her instagram that she took some selfie and a few of the comments by her undergrad friends kind of **** me off. So I sent a ""nice photo..."" comment to her. I really don't know why I said that to her. I do know that it was meant as a sarcastic jab in somewhat of dickish way. Anyways, that sparked her asking ""Why are you being mean?"", ""What did I do to you"" etc. 

I kind of blew her off the following Sunday. Mostly because I knew I was in the wrong for the comment. That Monday I apologized and on Tuesday I kind of explained why I was said what I said (which again, I admit was pretty **** stupid and **** to say). She then jumped to the conclusion that I was at the beach trying to sleep with other girls and that she really didn't care anymore. I called her and basically talked the conversation off the ledge because that wasn't what the trip was about whatsoever. Our conversations seemed to be getting back on track when the flooding in Louisiana started. Then the work week began and I swear it felt like a rollercoaster as far as communication goes. I didn't talk to her much on Monday until night time. Then on Tuesday I texted her and it was only when I mentioned ""Can we talk about our communication"" that she replied. Later that evening I knew she wasn't getting off her server shift until late. So I sent her a text saying that ""I know that things can't change overnight. But I feel like our communication is hot &amp; cold at times"". She responded back to me at midnight asking for a photo album back (Something she gave to me as anniversary present). I called her and it was fairly clear by her speech that she wasn't sober. By the end of our conversation, she made the comment ""That was a **** move on my part. You can keep the album"".

Which brings me the mother of all blow up breakups over the phone. Wednesday, I texted her ""Good morning"" and didn't receiver a text back until about noonish which stated ""At some point today we should talk about things"" followed by ""I wasn't sober and I didn't want to say what I needed to"". So I talked to her during my lunch break and it was basically started off with a yelling rant for about 30-40 mins. She basically said that for the first 7 months of our relationship she felt that she was doing something wrong. But that the incident in ATL changed how she felt about the situation because it was clear that I wasn't fully invested. Then the conversation floated over to how the only way that she would believe that I ""evolved and really wanted to be with her"". I'm going to attempt to give the cliffnotes: But she also went on to say that I caused her anxiety to spike/was the blame for her losing 20 lbs this year, That a guy at her new serving job followed his GF to Iowa City and now has an internship while he waits tables (She deems this as making it work and doing whatever it takes for the relationship. Finally she explained that at her orientation her colleagues kept asking her about how my move to Iowa was going? She replied with ""He isn't coming"" and they immediately said that it was horse **** that she was left with $900+ apt on her own. Furthermore it's clear that she has not spoken to her parents about being a cosigner or helping her with her rent. As she said ""Working four jobs and going to school will suck. But I just have to put on my big girl panties and do it because I can't trust you to be dependable"".

My main questions are this: How would you go about removing your name from a lease in this situation? I'm considering contacting my families attorney and seeing what he has to say. But who knows because it's a completely different state. Second, would you purge her from all forms of social media? This may sound like something a weak minded person would do. But I highly doubt that we will ever speak or see one another again. 

By no means was I perfect throughout this relationship. But I did see a future with her. "

4ymkhf,1,2016-08-19,a letter to myself for depression,bbwerfwef,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4ymkhf/a_letter_to_myself_for_depression/,"Dear me, who's afraid of living a life;
Hey, it's me! I'm your other me! We've been going through this life for 25 years! That's a long time ain't it? We're talking one on one here so don't expect a professional writing or something as it'll probably look like a letter written by a 5th grader. Here goes.
As depressing as this may sound,It seems that you've been living a false life....... Trying to always fill in people's expectation, forcing yourself to be a good person, forcing yourself to like something, ignoring your own desire and so on. I'm scared and you're scared. We might really die at this rate you know? I won't be talking about all those cliche stuff like, everything's gonna be alright! You can do it! You're not alone! These don't help, so let me just be honest with you.
Why don't we go few years back for the sake of nostalgia, although it's not really all that good. I remember the time when you were little. I've seen you covering that vixen sister even though she gave scars all over your arms, beat you, took advantage of you, lied to you and treated you like a trash. She might be thinking she has changed into a better person but she doesn't realize that the reason why nothing has been going on much is because you decided to avoid her; she's something else ain't she? Despite all her wrongdoings, due to your naive and gullible personality, you couldn't stop yourself from covering her. Same goes with others; you felt happy helping people out, but didn't realize how disgustingly selfish people really are and they took advantage of you multiple times for their own selfish means.You tried to change, I guess you did change but it's still in there I guess since this is how you are naturally. Anyways, she was a real piece of work I gotta tell ya. I mean she just pretends to be a nice girl in public that it made me want to vomit time to time. You know how she ended up majoring in nursing and failed multiple classes while changing schools? For fuck's sake, your parents couldn't take it anymore and they let her what she was good at; arts. She was quite good at drawing I gotta say, she even won small award one time although she didn't end up in first place. After she started majoring in art degree, she started getting good grades but you know, she barely did any shit. No internship, no job, no club or anything. During her final year you remember how she regretted not getting the internship and started getting all teary? At that time, I Definitely felt you getting enraged. Despite the fact that she was given a chance to do what she enjoys, she still fucked up. You started screaming inside and told yourself ""I would literally grab every single opportunity if I was given that chance, and this bitch actually fucked it all up? Why's a selfish and violent person like her getting all these opportunities?"". You were jealous, but at the same time, devastated.
Next your mom, she was a loving mother who worked hard for the sake of the family just like your dad, but she was a weak person. Of course I don't mean weak in general, look how hard she's worked! She's a good mother at least. She may have succeeded in feeding the family, but she failed in raising it. I know you've been always depressed, holding things in because you didn't want any breakup between family. You've always went to library because you didn't want to deal with your sister who abuses you and was scared to talk to your dad most of the time; we'll get to your dad in the next paragraph. You didn't want anything. Whenever your mom or dad tried to buy you new things, you always refused, well 90% of the time. You wanted to scream at them; you have time to buy me stuff, why don't you use this time to help fix the family relationship? You hated this part of your mother. ""Sorry"". Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. The apology, the simple word called ""sorry"" that came out of your mother's mouth countless number of times. How lazy you thought. This may be one of the part you got from your mother. Literally 30 minutes. She could spend just 30 minutes talking to your sister and setting her straight so she can knock it off with the abusing. Sorry. This is all came out of her mouth. I know, she's working hard, I do understand so you don't want to trouble her. But when your sister never changes no matter what you do as a brother, isn't it time for the parents to step in? What is this sorry? In her mind, does saying sorry supposed to be a solution? How many times did she say it? Sorry,Sorry,Sorry,Sorry,Sorry,Sorry,Sorry,Sorry,SorrySorry,Sorry........... If nothing changes after saying this same word so many times, should she realize that something's gotta change? I know, she's working hard, but no matter what, she's her kid for god's sake, it's the parent's job to discipline the kid. She knew you were suffering, avoiding her, depressed, going to library to avoid your family, staying in your friend's place during weekends cuz the library is closed and coming home late. You know the funny thing? They forcefully branded you as engineering genius, borned to do engineering...etc and made you major in engineering. You knew this was not your path. It's not about enjoying or hating something, it just wasn't for you but you held it in. You couldn't hold it in and even mentioned about seeing the counselor, and together with your dad, she says that everyone goes through that. How did you feel at that time? You were enraged weren't you? You've been having suicidal thoughts and depression over a decade, and this is her response. The moment she said that, it was instant regret right? It would've been better if you hadn't told her and act as if nothing has happened. Guess what she said after graduation; go to graduate school, for things like doctor, computer engineering...etc. How can she do this? Does you know how much you suffered during college? Barely going out, avoiding people, pretending to smile, forcing yourself to keep up with engineering, neglected your health one time and ended up in hospital, met mental counselor multiple times with no solution? How can she make that same mistake of forcing you into this profession? Yes, people assumed the STEM was supposed to be a lucrative path to take in terms of job prospect but this is too much. Does she think it'll work out if you just take it in and finish it until the end? What are you a machine? Don't you have feeling? You know what she also does? she uses the guilty victim move; she uses her position as mother/parents to make you feel guilty of making your own decision. I've seen so many kids committing suicide and hurting themselves going through depression? What makes her think none of this will happen to you? Also regarding about her telling you to keep living with you. Don't. Are you supposed to be mentally broken, then will she stop all this? She may be your parents, but this is your life. She doesn't have a right to trap you like this. Yes, you may have to help her out when she's having trouble physically but for now, you gotta make a choice. You should make some changes and make a definite decision.
And now, your dad. He was an engineer who worked at Hyundai back in Korea. Based on what your mom told you, he made shit loads of money, living a fulfilling life and providing for your family at the same time. However, everything when to shit due to complication with his brothers. It seems he ended up coming to America for you guys, or perhaps because of what happened with his job, don't know, doesn't matter now. As a father, he was probably, one of the hardest working guy I've ever seen. As a human being, he was hard to look at. He saw you as a liar. He was so simplistic when it comes to dealing with his kids. He's always judging you. If you forget to do something, or don't do something properly even ONCE, he instantly classifies you as a failure. No matter who does wrong, when it comes to you having argument with your sister, he ends up beating both of you. Some stupid shit was going on too. If he sees a tissue on the floor, or the staple is not refilled, he instantly blames you. When you didn't know how many questions were on SAT II, he said you didn't have the right to take it and called you a failure. Whenever, you brought information, he would call you liar just because he didn't believe it. He tries pick out every small thing and treats you like a piece of trash that at one point it feels like he's relieving his stress or something. You know where I'm going at right? He's been following this fucking pattern. He thinks of everything that come out of your mouth as nothing but excuses. How pathetic, and he says that he knows everything; how can someone who barely believes his own son claim that he knows him? You know even though you specifically told them you can't do engineering, your parents forced you to do it right? You thought of it as they were worried about you, respected their wish, and decided to carry on. But it was hard, depression kept going, the relationship with your family got stranger; you trembled and got anxious whenever your parents visited you in your dormitory as if they were strangers. You really must've wanted to get away from them huh? But the crazy thing with your dad is that when you told him that you wanted to change major during 2nd year, guess what he said? He said ""change what after coming this far?"" The tone of his voice indirectly told you that ""The hell are you trying to do all of sudden? You started this major, so you'll stick with it whether you like it or not"". Not a damn sympathy, even though they made you do it. Yes you chose to respect their wish, but man, that outright rejection. He didn't even want to hear your story assuming you were being lazy or something. He's the one who pushed him into this, so shouldn't he at least think about possibility? The alternative choice? Engineering major is lucrative, but it's not for everyone. You knew it wasn't for you and it was affecting your health both mentally and physically. Now look at you, you ended up graduating in 6 years, got so many D's and C's, 2.2 gpa, no internship, one part time casher job you did for 2 month back in 2011, a senior design project which you barely took any part other than writing the report as you honestly didn't have any engineering knowledge or experience and now look at you. Unemployed for 3 month, and I saw you in the verge of tears many times thinking how pathetic you've been until now. Although different, I'm you and I don't want you to suffer like this, you can't keep this up anymore. You need to change.
I've seen you getting stuck in this fantasy world time to time, wanting to escape reality. You wanted adventure. The excitement. The scene of those fictional characters saving people motivated you so much, until you came back to reality. You worried time to time thinking how you're already 25 and yet you're still thinking of stuff like this. Sometimes you thought about joining the military admiring the amazing fight scenes in movies, thought about joining fire department to become a firemen wanting to save people lives thinking that it was cool thing to do. How naive and pathetic you thought. I'm doing it for a wrong reason you thought. Music helped you out for a long time you know? You felt so emotional and thrilled depending on the types of music you've listened. You even bought a guitar, you enjoyed learning it, and even thought about being part of the band one day to share the joy of music with everyone. But you worried. You couldn’t stop worrying. How parents thought, how it won't make money to support them, how people would think, how it might not work out. You worried for years and you weren't able to play guitar, but listened to music to support your depression.
Fast-forward and now you're 25. Barely remembering how to play guitar, having given up. This imaginary obligation that keeps trapping you, it took away everything. You teared up time to time. You hated your life, your pathetic self, your passive self, your naivety, your gullible personality and pretty much everything about yourself. You lost motivation. You don't know which direction to take. You wish to once again experience the time when you were full of energy, expectation and passion back when you were not depressed. You wanted to die.
I know you're scared. Scared that if you get a low class job, people close to you will be disappointed. Scared that you'll get a job with low pay. Scared that nothing will go your way after doing something you like/dislike. But you need to stop and start. Stop forcing yourself trying to get into the field you can never excel in. Start getting to something you want to. I know, you've been limiting your choice due to the fear of your parents being disappointed and belittling you right? I know it's scary, you've been going through hell and depression. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be happy. Maybe you're misunderstanding something. Maybe you're just assuming your parent is forcing you into something. Maybe they're waiting for you to take your own action. Maybe they want to be convinced with a proper plan from you. Don't misunderstand, ain't no way am I saying that you were the wrong one. After all these shits they've done, ain't know way I'm gonna be on their side. I'm you and you're me. Start believing yourself and pave your way through with your own strength.
This has been quite a long letter huh? Time really flies. When was the last time I concentrated this long on something despite the fact that you were depressed? It's pretty simple. You had the desired to do this. Yeah it's no big deal but it's something you ""wanted"" to do at the moment right? Your fingers moved on their own and you didn't even realize you writing all this. You can do it. Know it. Don't let people tell you off. You're a strong kid, you were able to come so far.
Well, this should be good enough I think. I had fun reminiscing about our past. I just hope that you can make the change you need before it's too late. I hear about people unexpected losing their lives that we don't know when it's going to happen to us you know? Well, life sucked until now but, not bad idea to change things up a little right?
Good talking to ya,
take care."

4ympus,111,2016-08-19,"Me [26 F] with my fiance [29 M] 1.5 years, my parents are being very difficult regarding our wedding plans. What do we do?",wddingthroaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ympus/me_26_f_with_my_fiance_29_m_15_years_my_parents/,"It turned out to be a wall of text, but thank you all for reading and commenting. Minor details are changed for anonymity. 


   My fiance and I have quite an unique dating situation. Although we have not been dating for a very long time, we have known each other, and have been close friends, for 7+ years. We are compatible in almost every way, and I would say that the only thing that kept us from pursuing a relationship from the beginning was distance and timing. We met in university, but we were frequently in different countries for internships and grad school. 


   Only recently, our lives became more stable, and we decided to try dating seriously and exclusively. Needless to say, it is going exceedingly well despite being on opposite sides of the globe, and we are very much in love and devoted to each to each other. We Skype constantly and visit each other as often our careers permit. We have discussed marriage very soon after dating, since we believe it will strengthen our relationship, as well make it easier for me to move to his current country in the near future. Last week he proposed to me, and we are both very excited for our future together. Our wedding date is set for the some time next year. 


   Now my fiance and I are in a good place financially. We prefer to live simple lives and are frugal in our own ways. Neither of us like to spend money on frivolous things for show, though we do indulge in travelling and funding our hobbies. We are both relatively private people, and prefer to keep celebrations, birthdays, etc, very simple. Obviously our wedding plans will align with our philosophy. My engagement ring is very beautiful, and we purposely kept it inexpensive, and did not choose diamond. My wedding dress is a well made, knee-length dress around $100, and it is something I would love to wear again. His tailored dress shirt and pants are a little more expensive, though well made and can be worn again. We do not have makeup and hair sessions, limousines, expensive church and reception venue, etc. The only thing we splurged on is our wedding bands, as it is something we will have forever. 


   One other major reason to keep our wedding small is that we have friends and family all over the world. It would simply be impossible to invite everyone to gather in one place. Since we travel often anyway, we can meet them individually in our own time. Our friends are all very supportive of our decision, and we are very happy for their blessings. Another reason to keep the wedding celebration to a minimum is that we both believe that marriage is something private and intimate. We want our wedding to be a stress-free and relaxing experience. We plan to sign our wedding papers with just two witnesses, and then have a small, but lavish dinner with our closest family members. 


   Now, family. When my fiancee told his parents, they were very excited and supportive of us. They have graciously offered to contribute financially, and we have courteously declined. I hope I do not offend anyone, as it is our personal choice and opinion, but it is not because we could not afford a grand wedding, multiple wedding dresses, a giant diamond ring, etc, but that we have no interest in spending money on something we believe is just for show. I understand and respect that tradition is very important to some people, but for my fiance and I, love doesn't have a price tag, we do not wish to include people we have seen only once in our lives, and we do not want to spend large amounts of money on something that would ultimately be a source of stress and drama. Everyone was respectful and supportive, everyone, except for my parents. 


   I have never been close to my parents. Though I never really focused on it, but I do believe they are the stuff of r/raisedbynarcissists. Though they have immigrated to a Western country three decades ago, they refuse to let go of the worst of their cultural traditions. I am all for traditions, except when they propagate misogyny, close-mindedness, and disrespect. For the above reasons and other, I have developed a non-healthy, but self-protective way of dealing with my parents. I may seem like a doormat, but I tend to be someone who pick my battles, and remove myself from drama when necessary. I prefer to exert my precious energy on things I believe are worthwhile, my parents' petty drama not being one of them. I maintain a cordial relationship with them, because I am close to some of my aunts and uncles. 


   One of the things my parents love to do is to pretend to help me with something, usually with money, and then hold it against me, and use their ""goodwill"" to manipulate me. Another form of manipulation is their use of traditions. ""You have to do this because its part of our traditions."" As a result, I left home as early as possible, though on a good note, for school. I have been very happy ever since then. Though they have raised me in a well-to-do household, I did not take their offers of money. They love to call me ungrateful for it - the mental gymnastics required for their accusations is beyond my intellectual capacity. Their parenting used to bother me in my teenage years, but as I grew older, I find that I have less and less f*cks to give. 


   When I told my parents of my engagement and loose wedding plans over the phone, they got angry instead of happy. Here are some of their opinions about the matter, and my counter arguments. The conversation was exhausting. 

1) ""You will divorce, because in the future, he will want kids but you will be too old to have them."" My fiance and I are childfree. Sure, people change. Not likely between us, but hypothetical situations cannot dictate our decisions and happiness. And it sounds like they are purposely saying it to be hurtful. 

2) ""Of course his parents are happy they don't need to spend money. But they are not the ones giving their daughter away, they are receiving a free daughter. It is our loss if they don't contribute money to a big wedding. In fact they should be giving us some money, because traditions."" Um no. Nobody is giving nobody away, and nobody is giving anyone money. I have iterated and reiterated that money was never a problem. We are financially responsible for our wedding and we decide how we spend our money. The last point is just demonstrating greediness, you have no business asking for money you didn't earn. 

3) ""His parents should buy you two a home. If you don't ask them for it, it is your loss in the end anyway. When you divorce you will have nothing. I warned you."" No, his parents should spend their own money however they want. We can afford our own home, thank you very much. And this way of thinking is greedy and shameful. We absolutely despise people who think this way. And no, we don't plan to get a divorce. 

4) ""We are very angry and disappointed!!11! We are so disappointed in you."" At this point they are being unreasonable and sound very emotional. But I said that the things I have said are never meant to hurt them personally, and that I my decisions are not malicious, and that I did not understand why they are so emotional. 

5) ""We demand a big banquet! How else do we tell our friends that our daughter is getting married? Your dad has been dying to walk you down the aisle! If you can't pay for it, we will!"" Again, it has nothing to do with money. You can just tell them I'm married. I don't wish to incorporate people that I am not close with, and barely know. My fiance and I are not religious, so we don't see a point in a church wedding. 

6) ""Your future husband should be the one saying all this, it's so nontraditional for you to be telling us this!"" At this point I have no idea what tradition is anymore. What exactly is prescribed in tradition? They have never told me any of this as I was growing up, how to they expect I know things that I don't even know. Please draw us a list of traditions so we can examine it and take into considerations the items we see fit. 


   The conversation didn't go anywhere after that, but left me exhausted, frustrated, and confused. At this point, I'm not sure if I am being too harsh on my parents. I feel that I should include them into the wedding process, but on the other hand, I know they will see it as a victory and will push harder for what they want. However, I also know if I don't compromise, they will show up and ruin the main event for us, because they could not get what they want. I feel like a brat for complaining, but at the same time, my fiance and I are firm on our plan to keep the wedding small. If we cut them out of our wedding it would mean that we will not have a relationship. I don't know what to do. 


  
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My stubborn parents are being extremely difficult about our non-traditional wedding. Go through with our original plan anyway, compromise, or cut them out of our wedding/lives completely?"
4ymxka,1,2016-08-19,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4ymxka/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

I even interned as a medical assistant for a semester to get patient care experience because I wanted to see if I could get hired as an assistant for clinical trials. 

First, I tried applying to only clinical positions. No one called me. Then I started applying to everything. Lab tech jobs, research assistant, clinical assistant, everything, and I've only gotten one phone call and it was from across the country.

I thought I had a pretty decent resume and I thought it'd be easier to find a position but I'm having no luck at all. I posted my resume below if anyone wants to point out something glaringly obvious that's hurting me. Otherwise some helpful advice and tips would be very appreciated in this sad corner.


I turned all the names on the one publication I have so far to initials because privacy but I have another paper on the way where I'm first author but it's gonna be a few months before its done being reviewed.

4yn3v9,9,2016-08-19,Thinking about doing a masters program but not sure how much it will actually help me to reach my goals. Looking for some input.,blingblingscrackpipe,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/4yn3v9/thinking_about_doing_a_masters_program_but_not/,"I have a BSIT, but I have never worked in IT. I originally went to school industrial automation. In my senior year (I was going into the second semester of what would have been a 3 semester senior year) I ran out of money and chose to take the ""industry"" route of my program since it allowed for an entire semester internship. This meant getting paid and only having to pay for 1 class (messed up I had to pay to work...). My internship was 5 hours away from school and long story short they offered me a job as a controls engineer and a very competitive salary to stay. In my head everything would work out because out of the 6 classes I had left 3 were gen eds I had put off, 1 was continuing my internship and making a senior project out of it, one was a 300 level robotics lecture but it had previously been available at a satellite campus near me, and the other a 200 level that I found (or at least thought I found) a transfer equivalent at a nearby college. 

Long story less long, it all fell apart. The satellite campus closed a few months before this and to take that class as a transfer equivalent would put me under the required 300/400 level classes needed to be awarded my degree. So I ended up taking my 3 gen ed classes while pleading with the school to work with me with no luck. I thought about just going back, but giving up the money I was making to give more money to a school that wouldn't help me out (I know they didn't owe anything) when I needed it just didn't seem like a good idea. The degree was too specialized and I couldn't find a direct transfer, plus I realized over a year ago I really just wanted to be a programmer, so I started looking into starting up in CS. I ran into another snag where the college I was transferring from let me substitute classes like cultural diversity for diversity in education (an EDU class) and macro econ for psychology, all the colleges in my area weren't so flexible. I was looking at a full year (not including the semester I just took finishing humanities, communications, and sociology) of gen eds plus 2 years of CS core. It just didn't seem reasonable. I ended finding a school that took my credits by level and department rather than individual classes, but they didn't offer CS only IT. I figured it was good enough and I'd just get this damn bachelor's out of the way. 

So I knocked that out and got my piece of paper. I did well, graduated with a 3.8, but I'm 25 now and have been making over $80k (10-15K in OT) for a little over 2 years. There's not way I'm going to start an entry level IT job and take a 50% pay cut. However, I'm also over having my phone ring 24 hours a day to help someone navigate an HMI or robot teach pendant. 

So I'm back where I was two years ago. I want to learn CS, or more precisely I want to develop software. I'm considering starting up a Master's of Software and Information Systems program. I've had classes in Java, C, C++, Python, and a database management class where I went the extra mile and actually coded the database for our project even though it was just a theoretical project. I'm by no means particularly good at any of these languages, they felt more like intro to programming classes (with the exception of Java, that class was legit). I looked through the curriculum for the Software Engineering program and it looks like it is mostly theory. What I mean by this is I'm not confident I'm going to come out of this program with the technical skills gained from actually doing. 

I've been particularly drawn to the .NET framework but I'll admit I have not looked into a whole lot else. I considered The Odin Project but just like it's intended it seems from my point of view to be strictly web development. I liked that MVC could do web and app development, and that the Visual Studio and C# in it sets you up nicely for mobile app development with Xamarin. I don't really want to limit myslef to .NET, but as something to tackle that can cover desktop apps, web develpment, and mobile development it just seems like a good focus. 

I apologize for being so long winded and I'll get to the actual question.... 


I want to get the technical skills and knowledge to be able to code anything from desktop apps to web to mobile. Are any of these in particular the best way to go:

1) Pursue a Masters in Software Engineering without a CS foundation.
2) Get a second Bachelor's in CS now that I don't feel any pressure for not having my degree when I was so close.
3) Self teach/learn .NET or another framework. If option 3 any recommendations on a path to take. 

TL;DR
I have a BSIT with no IT experience. I have a beginners level knowledge of programming. Which of the following options above is recommended while taking into consideration my overall goal is to be able to do app and web development."
4yn4v8,18,2016-08-19,"OSF doc ""Countering State Capture"" is a guide to state capture",bananawhom,DNCleaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/DNCleaks/comments/4yn4v8/osf_doc_countering_state_capture_is_a_guide_to/,"From DCleaks.com, /2015pr/think tank fund countering state capture october 15 2015/ttf countering state capture prd 10.15.2015.pdf

I've tried to reproduce the report below for those who don't want to download the pdf. Had to cut the footnotes and several pages to fit.

Basically this document describes the problem of ""state capture"" and how the OSF plans to tackle it. They define state capture as ""the institutionalized particularistic influence of organized actors over policy formation and implementation, which negatively impacts the fundamentals of a democratic system, the logic of governance, social norms, and trust in public institutions.""

Those are all things the OSF does.

It's likely they assume the ends justify the means when they do it. The difference between them and states they target hinges on the label of ""particularistic."" I'm assuming they are using this in the sense of political particularism which is opposed to multicultural pluralism.

The amount of hypocrisy you read in this document will depend on if you think Soros is genuinely devoted to multiculturalism or uses such causes like the ""low-hanging fruit"" to affect change and open up markets and resources for himself and his allies. It should be an interesting read either way.

**Executive Summary**

In this portfolio TTF is pioneering demonstration projects countering state capture. State capture is the institutionalized particularistic influence of organized actors over policy formation and implementation, which negatively impacts the fundamentals of a democratic system, the logic of governance, social norms, and trust in public institutions. A captured state directly contradicts the idea of an open society. In this portfolio we have worked to support grantees countering state capture in a number of countries. At the same time, we have invested in improving conceptual clarity by identifying differences between state capture as a problem requiring a systemic approach and issues of transparency and accountability that could be tackled through anti-corruption measures. 

While we are only at the outset in terms of the conceptual work, through our portfolio we have gained experience that has enabled us to understand how to steer not only our grantee-partners to take a systemic approach, but also to inspire other donors1 to rethink their approach to the issue. The lessons we learned on supporting coalitions, on shaping the field of anti-corruption, accountability and good governance, and on selection of best instruments of support will help us adjust and integrate similar work of OSIFE into a single consolidated portfolio in 2016, based on TTF’s theory of change and conceptual groundwork.

**Introduction**

Building upon a legacy of support since November 2006, this work was reorganized into an independent portfolio in a follow-up to the TTF sub-board review on October 27, 2011.2 We further streamlined the portfolio during the process before the TTF strategy for 2014-17. In line with this strategy, we formed a fully separate portfolio, budget, and category of work, under the Level 3 program name of “2B Countering State Capture,” identical with the category of work “CTI002-THINK TANK FUND: Support demonstration projects [Countering State Capture].”  

**Theory of Change**

This portfolio is based on an assumption that a captured state—substantial, institutionalized, particularistic, self-interested influence or control of unrepresentative actors over public finances, policy formation and implementation—directly contradicts the idea of an open society. State capture is one of the most daunting issues in state reform and transition, a fundamental challenge for weak states and societies where the watchdog function of civil society is not yet fully developed. State capture negatively impacts the fundamentals of a democratic system, the logic of governance, social norms, and trust in public institutions.  While state capture is sometimes mistaken for grand corruption and conventional anti-corruption measures are therefore proposed to counter it, these address only the design of nominally independent state institutions, overlooking the structure of the political system and the prevailing value structure of societies. Countering state capture is not primarily anti-corruption work. 

While corruption may be one of the ways a captured state functions, it is not the only one or the most important, and this needs to be taken into account when designing an approach to tackling it. Too much emphasis on corruption can detract from real governance problems. Hungary provides a real-world example. While there is wide consensus that the grasp of the ruling government on public life and the extent of state capture is unprecedented, perception of corruption in Hungary in the past two years is at its lowest level since 1995, when Transparency International inaugurated the Corruption Perceptions Index.  

This observation is consistent with our own theory of change, where we argue that state capture as an organized system can in fact be one of the most effective means of reducing corruption. Corruption outside of the state capture context is essentially a pluralist exercise, with individuals and business paying a bribe in hopes of affecting the outcome, but without having full certainty over it. In a captured state the outcome is predetermined, regardless of whether the transaction involves corruption. If there is corruption in a captured state, it is mostly a streamlined, controlled, and organized tool assuring particularism of the ruling elites.  

**State Capture vs Anti-Corruption: Key Distinctions** 

This distinction between corruption and state capture is important in the remedies that it implies. We see corruption as a possible but not always necessary tool of organized particularism. Organizations using anticorruption lenses, especially watchdogs, tend to focus on individual cases and work on the basis of a theory of change that emphasizes the moral failure of the individual and the belief that more public information about the case will bring about the necessary policy change. Unfortunately we have not seen this theory deliver. The extent of corruption in CEE countries is widely known, and even when a surprise release of information happens, or the arrogance of captors crosses the threshold of public acceptance, it rarely leads to sustained public pressure for reform. 

For example, the Gorilla scandal in Slovakia in 2011 and the appointment in summer of 2013 of Delyan Peevski as head of the secret service in Bulgaria both led to mass protests and the firing of exposed individuals, but the public response in itself was not sufficient to achieve systemic change. When corruption is observed in a captured state, policies based on suppressing it (or its publicity) frequently result in a disproportionate emphasis on petty corruption, rather than delivering better governance and higher public trust in democracy. In Slovakia, for example, according to TI data 48% of corruption cases that made it to court were for bribes below €20 ($22) and only three percent for bribes over €5,000 ($5,586). Only five percent of all cases involved public governance (procurements, elections, subsidies), and not a single corruption case involving senior elected or government official made it to court.  

Because state capture is systemic, yet highly varied in form, countering it requires a different approach from fighting corruption in a functioning democracy. Policy-makers, practitioners, and concerned citizens who wish to address state capture must gain detailed, documented information about actual structures and processes that accompany it. When state captors enjoy full judicial impunity, exposing individual cases does not deliver policy improvements, but rather contributes to citizens’ disenchantment with democracy, leading to lower voter turnout and/or increased support for extremist political parties. The election of the radical neo-fascist Marian Kotleba in central Slovakia is an example of this dynamic.  

State capture is based on an opaque relationship between the captors of the state (principals) and their agents in elected or executive positions. Trying to pinpoint where state capture starts is akin to answering the proverbial chicken and egg question; nonetheless we see that financing of political parties is often the egg of state capture. Running a modern political campaign requires excessive amounts of cash.3 On the one hand this creates an insurmountable barrier to entry for potential new political parties outside the establishment, while on the other hand it allows established oligarchs (principals) to diversify their political portfolio and provide support to potential new entrants who offer fresh faces for the public to vote for. 

This is one of the explanations why political corruption in Hungary has been on the agenda of only non-mainstream parties such as LMP (Politics Can Be Different), and Jobbik.  Once the political party makes it into power, it needs to return the favor and pay back its debt. This happens in a number of ways, public procurement being perhaps the most common. Other ways include the placement of captors’ agents in important positions, from parliaments to regulatory authorities (where a clear overlap with regulatory capture, which is more common in Western Europe, appears), to the law enforcement and judiciary.4  

Ultimately, the paths of state capture can be traced along two dimensions: economic resources and political power, with the understanding that these are effectively two sides of the same coin. Political power generates economic resources, and those in turn can be exchanged into and reinforce political power.  Another important aspect where we can clearly discern the captured state is in the erosion of checks and balances, both formal and informal. The capture of watchdog institutions such as the media is a clear marker. Throughout Central and Eastern Europe we see the retreat of economic investors from media ownership, replaced by individuals alleged to be the “owners” or “godfathers” of the state. 
 
**Countering State Capture: An Agenda for Change**

State capture is as opaque and elusive as it is widespread and deeply rooted, and countering it requires policy reforms that may not favor the ruling elites. This can happen either by stealth, when captors do not realize that a policy concession will limit the scope of capture, or as a result of sustained public pressure under which even captured institutions go against the interests of their captors. Even after such an initial success, the challenge is keeping reformed institutions out of the captors’ orbit. In order to make gains permanent, civil society and anti-state capture coalitions need to ensure there is a critical mass of agencies that are not under state capture. It is only in the last phase, once the systemic nature of capture has been broken, that the traditional anti-corruption approach can be utilized and the countering state capture can give way to an accountability approach to countering corruption.  

Given the systemic nature of state capture, our hypothesis is that the most effective way of exerting public pressure to counter it is through cooperation and wide coalitions of concerned individuals, NGOs (including watchdogs and think tanks), businesses, and reform-minded politicians. While these coalitions are often able to reap tremendous emotional energy when the public learns of specific instances of state capture, unless they have policy researchers or think tanks involved and able to present workable policy reform recommendations, they often fail to devise feasible and achievable strategies for countering state capture.  We have decided to support specifically think tanks because we believe that coalitions to counter state capture will be ineffective without the intellectual muscle that research centers provide. 

Based on this theory of change, we have decided to test the hypothesis that think tanks are in a good position to identify the systemic vulnerabilities of the captured state, and devise policy proposals that intellectually support counter-state capture coalitions and help them pressure captured institutions to reform, focusing scarce energies and resources to where the potential for success is largest. Think tanks also have the skill-set to sit through endless technical meetings with ministries, tirelessly follow policy proposals, and push improvements one paragraph at a time, as we have seen with Frank Bold in the Czech Republic, or Via Iuris in Slovakia.  

**Scope of the Portfolio**

 The main approach we have employed to test this theory of change is funding demonstration projects. When choosing these projects, we had three priorities: 1) systematic analysis of state capture; 2) remedies to state capture either through development of policy responses or specific support to existing civic coalitions to devise and implement policy recommendations and strategic advocacy efforts; and 3) identifying and countering cross-border aspects of state capture.5  We have also provided support to networking and knowledge-exchange events for policy research and other civil society actors to analyze and discuss possible approaches to countering state capture. 

In order to promote the concept of countering state capture systemically, we have also shaped discourse by attending and speaking at conferences, as well as publishing and amplifying features of the demonstration projects we supported. Finally, we have convened new cross-border collaborations among think tanks and helped them in seeking external third-party funding, especially from the European Commission.  From 2012 to date,6 the size of this portfolio is $2,260,093. The portfolio includes 1) organizational project grants ($2,221,879); 2) networking and knowledge exchange activities consisting of two events supported by TTF ($28,598), and convening and support of consortia applying for external funding (no direct costs, cofunding of $50,000 is included in grants); and 3) shaping discourse through external publications both staffauthored and contracted ($9,616),7 and participation of TTF staff in external events. 

**Analysis of the Portfolio**

In order to illustrate the patterns in choices made, developments observed, and lessons learned, we focus our analysis on a country-case selection from five priority countries: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. We have also provided support to projects in Croatia, Slovenia, and Latvia that we consider “scouting” countries.  

**Criteria for Evaluating Success**

 Expecting that a single donor’s effort could liberate the state from its captors would be an ambitious proposition, which we never made. Our expectation for success in supporting these projects was rather in the extent to which they contributed to countering state capture efforts based on a number of factors. We did not conduct systematic evaluations of the extent of state capture in the individual countries, and so without having a solid baseline, in the current portfolio review we do not aim at quantifying the extent to which our funding contributed to decreasing state capture. The criteria for success we use are:  1) Public awareness of the systemic nature of the problem and presence in the public domain and knowledge of illustrative cases of state capture;  2) Existence of opportunity8 for countering state capture, in terms of existence, structure, and strength of (or possibility to create) synergic ecosystems of actors to push for systematic political reform, as well as in terms of existence of functional partnerships and coordinating actors;  4) Political opportunity to set and advance the counter-state-capture agenda (existence of pro-reform political elite, or at least absence of strong anti-reform veto-players);  5) Match between the policy opportunity present, and the contribution delivered by think tanks with our support. 

This could be in the immediate policy research contribution to the coalition, or in the form of preparing building blocks for future use in coalitions.  We measure success also through the relevance and timeliness of the intellectual contributions or research findings our grantees provided in each specific country.

Based on these criteria we are able to categorize both the countries and the individual projects supported. We see positive developments in the Czech Republic and Romania, followed by Slovakia. Developments in Bulgaria and Hungary are less hopeful, with Hungary being currently the most challenging case for pursuing this type of reform. The “scouting” countries are countries where we have seen the need coupled with emerging opportunities and have either attempted to provide support but the response was not sufficient (Slovenia, and Latvia few years ago), or where we are hoping to promote systemic governance reform but are too early in our efforts to evaluate impact (Croatia and Latvia after 2015). In terms of projects9 we have seen a spectrum ranging from full success, to missed chances, to contexts without opportunity.  

**Ranking the Cases**

A) Trailblazers and Example-setters We have observed success in terms of criteria of process and outcome in the Czech Republic, when our support to the Frank Bold Society10 contributed to countering state capture by building the knowledge base and awareness of the systemic nature of the problem, and to the emergence of a coalition and its healthy functioning and coordination. This paid off in action when grantees we supported were able to reach potential policymakers before the elections in 2013, which resulted in 166 out of the 200 deputies in the Chamber of Deputies signing a counter-state capture pledge consisting of adoption of nine specific anticorruption laws.11 In this case the match between the policy opportunity and the contribution think tanks delivered with our support was excellent.  The support we provided to Frank Bold delivered both the systematic analysis and the priority-setting, but the policy reform steps were advanced by one of the most inspiring counter-state capture coalitions in the region.12 “Reconstructing the State” at its peak was an unprecedented pledge campaign pushing for reform of the captured state in Czech Republic, combining active citizens, more than 20 civil society organizations, renowned experts, members of the business community, business chambers and associations, and reformminded politicians.  

The complexity of state capture requires choosing a good set of “core” issues. Ideally, these should start with relatively low-hanging fruit, so that the initial interest in a systemic approach can be rewarded within a reasonable time period. At the same time, they need to target vulnerable pivots of the captured state governance system. The “Reconstructing the State” campaign managed to identify these fulcrums in its clear goal pushing for adoption of the specific anti-corruption laws. The number of requests reflects the local conditions and the level of ambition of those proposing it.

The success of this campaign came about mainly because of the combination of opportunity that emerged in the Czech Republic and the intellectually rigorous contribution of a number of think tanks that worked with Frank Bold. The convening of the coalition took place with help from the US Embassy in Prague and Open Society Foundation Prague. Our support enabled Frank Bold not only to contribute to the design of the pledge including the nine laws,13 and rigorous policy research on specific policy recommendations, but also to coordinate forming and running the coalition. The case of Romania can also be seen as a success. The support we provided mainly to the Romanian Academic Society (RAS) contributed to their forming of a “Coalition for Clean Romania.” RAS and its president Alina Mungiu-Pippidi (OSIFE Board Member) have become one of the leaders in the European scene analyzing accountability, corruption, and state capture. 

While claiming that we are responsible for this would be farfetched, our support enabled RAS to contribute to the Clean Romania Coalition with important policy products and knowledge of the systemic nature of state capture in Romania. Unfortunately the ecosystem in Romania is much more fragmented and polarized, so we have not seen as wide cooperation as in the case of the Czech Republic. Nonetheless our support has enabled individual contributions in addition to RAS in the form of policy reform recommendations from the Association Institute for Public Policy, Median Research Centre (MRC), Expert Forum, and the Romanian Center for European Policies. In this way we have contributed to making the efforts at countering-state capture in Romania multi-polar. Even if full-scale collaboration among all actors does not yet seem possible, we see improved communication and limited coordination across the organizations on the most important subjects.  

B) Followers The success of the Czech coalition went “viral” and inspired organizations in other countries to at least think about systematic ways of countering state capture in their own countries. Two clear follow-up campaigns emerged in the region.  In Slovakia, SGI followed the example of “Reconstructing the State” closely, and designed a local equivalent in “The Good Candidates” (Správni Kandidáti). The pledges for individual candidates in Slovakia allowed for some flexibility (candidates did not have to sign up for all nine priorities). These pledges fell into three broader categories: procurement, public ownership, and provision of services;14 access to information, transparency, and improved communication;15 and the transparency of Council meetings.16  While we have had many successful individual projects in Slovakia, we have realized that a systematic approach to funding is needed. Therefore, simultaneously as we were discussing project support to Via Iuris for analysis of the system assuring impunity for captors of the state, we sought an independent local convener. The role of an independent convener that OSF Prague undertook in the Czech Republic could not have been implemented in Slovakia by the local OSF foundation, because of the difficult leadership transition and the different priorities of the previous executive director.  In order to provide for a local coordinator who would not have a conflict of interest either with the policy researchers or with the advocacy organizations, Andrej reached out to the Pontis Foundation, which had been running a corporate philanthropy operation “The Fund for Transparent Slovakia” that supported the very same organizations as we had within this portfolio. This meant Pontis was not perceived as a competitor, and at the same time had intimate knowledge of the organizations and their synergies and animosities. 

Thanks to the cooperation between Via Iuris and Pontis Foundation a coalition started to emerge. The coalition consists of four organizations: Via Iuris, SGI, the Pontis Foundation, and Let's Stop Corruption foundation. Transparency International Slovakia, Fair Play Alliance, and INEKO are not formally part of the coalition, but they have agreed to informally coordinate their actions and advocacy with it. We consider this an emerging success in Slovakia that we will be able to learn even more from, and will evaluate it after the parliamentary elections in early 2016. 
 
C) Missed Chances and Disappointments A major disappointment in this portfolio has been support to Transparency International Hungary (TI-HU). In 2013, after three years of excellent cooperation with the organization, we thought we had found a partner who could spearhead Hungarian counter-state capture efforts. We awarded them a three-year grant, one of the longest programmatic support grants TTF has awarded in the EU. Our expectation was that TI-HU would use our support to capitalize on their previous efforts, extend their funding base, and lead intellectually in the systematic countering of particularism and state capture in Hungary. 

Unfortunately, the executive director of the organization departed to join academia, and her replacement had a different vision and different qualities. The executive director’s departure was followed by the departure of a number of leading staff members and senior experts (two joined TI’s headquarters in Berlin). The organization lost its intellectual drive, leadership, and creativity.  All this became visible with a networking and knowledge-exchange event that we initially aimed to support through a hands-off grant in 2013. In the absence of leadership from TI-HU, TTF staff (Andrej) had to step in, design the agenda of the meeting, and even take a hands-on approach to managing the event itself. We managed to limit the damage from that particular event, but the three-year grant commitment remained. While TI-HU delivered according to the grant contract, the quality was mediocre. We considered rescinding the grant, but in the dire situation of Hungarian civil society and TI-HU due to the government’s policies we would have risked this being misunderstood, and could have added to the struggles of the civil society sector in Hungary. Thus we carried on, even if it meant additional staff time and delays in delivery during the first 18 months, after which project performance improved. This has been a significant lesson not only within this portfolio, reminding us that past performance is no guarantee of future success, especially if intellectual leadership depends disproportionately on a few individuals.  

Less a disappointment and more a missed opportunity was the original Hungarian coalition modeled on the Czech example, in this case called “At a Minimum” (‘Ez A minimum’). Unfortunately the pledge campaign with six groups of proposals17 failed to receive traction at the national level, mainly because what were called minimum requirements were presented vaguely yet extensively, and in a language that allowed the political majority to reject the reform proposal as being affiliated with the party opposition.18 Given that not only political representation is polarized according to political lines, but also civil society, an initiative coming from the left-liberal side of civil society without any representation from the center-right19 created an additional obstacle in reaching beyond the already persuaded. The organizations collaborating on the campaign (TI-HU, K-Monitor, Atlatszo.hu, and Political Capital) tried to revive it during the municipal elections following the example of Slovakia’s “Good Candidates,” and both make it less party-political and refocus it from the national to the municipal level, where more non-partisan candidates were running.

We provided support to these efforts in the form of four contracts to the founding organizations to monitor electoral irregularities and diagnose state capture at the municipal level. The wide(r) coalitions, including “At a Minimum” and the additional work on elections,20 have fostered better cooperation. But unlike in the Czech case they have not managed to reach beyond the opposition (left-wing and liberal) side of the civil society. While the results at the municipal level were somewhat more promising, with more constructive relations especially with politically non-aligned counsellors and mayors, overall the results of our support in Hungary remain mixed.  

A second major disappointment was in a contract we awarded to a journalist to cover a case of countering state capture in the Czech Republic through a number of different products that should have formed a package. The aim of the case study package was to allow organizations and individual stakeholders from other countries to learn from a specific experience in the Czech Republic, to assess the suitability of this approach, and possibly also to apply some of the tools and strategies to their national contexts.  The case study was to be written in a story-telling form and published in general interest media outlets. The sources of disappointment were two-fold: first, the contractor delivered the texts with significant delays; second, the organic placement of the articles did not proceed as expected, and he succeeded in having only one article published in Newsweek with a second article having been considered by Foreign Policy, which eventually went with a different article on the topic by different authors. Both of the texts were of good quality and written in a captivating manner. The multimedia material (interviews) was of acceptable quality, even if not in the form we expected (audio instead of video). Nonetheless, we had much higher hopes than what was delivered.  The lesson learned is that it is not feasible, or at least not likely, to hire a single provider to deliver multiple outputs (texts, data, and video). The second lesson is that having articles published in the international press is not something we can dictate, as the news cycle lives according to its own logic. Also it seems that the choice to hire a British journalist when targeting global audience was not the best, and we should have been more precise in our expectations for audience and geographic scope. The objective we had of spreading the news about the counter-state capture coalition was partly achieved, because international media covered the story of the Czech Republic even if we did not pay for those texts.21 

An academic unrelated to us produced a detailed case study. What we could have done instead is support a researcher (whether through contract, competition, or as a TTF intern) in compiling the story of the coalition in the form of a case study that could be taken on by those interested in learning or replicating. TTF staff writing Open Society Voices blogs in combination with attending events where potential followers already are, or where donors potentially interested in supporting this work congregate, was much more effective in reaching the right audience with the right message.22 

**Networking, Knowledge - sharing, and Experimenting**

 In addition to providing grants for projects, we have also supported the organization of two events.23 The first was the knowledge-sharing event held by TI-HU, which taught us a hard lesson in the importance of organizational assessment as described in detail in the section on disappointments above. The exploratory workshop was supposed to center on transparency of state-owned enterprises, providing an opportunity for  networking and capacity-building, as well as experience in research methodology and advocacy. Due in no small part to TI-HU’s management problems, however, attendance was low and the outputs were mediocre.  The second event we co-organized with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) and their Middle East Center as an inter-regional experience and knowledge-sharing meeting on state capture October 20-21, 2014 in Istanbul. 

We focused on two sets of transitional countries (Central and Southeastern Europe and several countries of the Middle East and North Africa). The selected countries were not resource-rich, but they shared the characteristics that state capture is prevalent, undermines government legitimacy, and poses major obstacles to state reform. This cooperation worked very well,24 with excellent follow-up and contribution to informing one of the seminal monographs on state capture and structural corruption, Sarah Chayes’ Thieves of State. As a consequence, we have noticed greater interest in structural work on analysis of and countering state capture particularly in Southeastern Europe. 

Additionally, we have observed more desire for methodological rigor, as reflected in higher-quality proposals since the meeting.  In addition to these formal events, we have also experimented with approaches to scouting for new partners and projects. In order to provide country-focus and increase responses to calls for proposals, TTF Staff organized in-country meetings with prospective applicants.25 Andrej organized a joint meeting with eight organizations in Slovakia (former and current grantees as well as three NGOs new to TTF) in late July 2014.26 It was surprising to realize that for some of these attending organizations, such a meeting was the first opportunity they had had to learn what others in their own country were doing. It was shocking to discover that we as an external donor know these organizations and their activities, in much greater depth than they do for each other. In early August 2014, Andrej organized a similar meeting with Hungarian organizations that had approached TTF and OSIFE with suggestions to work on a number of relevant issues. That meeting was followed by cooperation between four organizations during the municipal elections (assessed and processed under the rapid response procedures). In late August 2014, Andrej together with Sanjukta organized two group meetings for ten organizations during their visit to Bucharest.27 

The fact that we had to organize two separate meetings is illustrative of the organizational and personal animosities in Romania, even if the partial overlap signals potential for cooperation. We have also been active in showcasing the work of our grantees to the European Commission and fostering collaboration among several of our grantees to apply jointly for EC funding. We have built an informal but regular communication channel with DG Competition and DG Justice through which we showcase the work of our grantees and promote their expertise. When the European Commission announced a funding opportunity of up to EUR 6.2 million in November 2014 through its Directorate General for Migration and Home Affairs we convened a series of discussions that resulted in six separate consortia applying for the EU money.28  Of these six consortia, one of them received a grant of EUR 367,640 ($412,475),29 nearly equivalent to our annual grant budget within this portfolio (the 2015 budgeted amount for grants before internal reallocation was $440,000). The winning consortium is a brand-new grouping that clearly formed as a result of our convening. There are two lessons from this experience. First, the funding opportunities from the EU appear on extremely short notice, and are highly competitive. Second, we can contribute to successful applications for external funding through our convening power and staff-time commitment30 in ways that increase our impact beyond our budget. Finally, we have also spread the word about our work and approaches tested by our grantees through numerous speaking opportunities and publications, including OS Voices pieces and advocacy meetings with other donors. While not easy to precisely quantify the impact, we have contributed to shaping the systematic understanding of governance problems in Europe. 

We have noticed an increased (or revived) use of the state capture concept, both in academic publications but also among some think tanks and watchdog organizations that previously called all of their work anti-corruption.  

**Conclusions and Lessons learned**

During the development of this portfolio, we made a number of choices, some of which have proved right, and some of which we wish we had avoided. From these we have learned a number of lessons about our theory of change, our concept of state capture, and how a donor can and cannot support this work:  

**Conceptual Innovation: state capture vs. corruption**

Our work in this portfolio has shown the need for greater conceptual clarity. While the foundations have been laid, and the basic interest and understanding of the need for conceptualization of this work as systemic phenomenon is not questioned as much as it used to be, we continue to see a need for developing a robust conceptual framework.  

Particularism in governance and rent-seeking in public resource distribution are not illegal. It is therefore necessary to analyze state capture systemically, and understand how they differ from the conventional conception of corruption as an individual moral failure, and crime punishable under existing law.31 When dealing with state capture, focusing on accountability and anti-corruption is like battling the hydra: each time one of the heads is removed, another pops up. When transparency of state budgets became widespread, the unscrupulous principals of state capture adapted their modes of public resource extraction and focused on public procurement, PPPs, and state-owned companies.

 By refocusing the attention of organizations on understanding the issue not as the moral failure of an individual, or a criminal behavior, but as a governance design flaw in states, they are able to see when anti-corruption rhetoric is abused and the reform agenda hijacked by populists or even by captors themselves.  There is certainly more work still to be done in developing the conceptual framework, both intellectually and for practical purposes. 

Increasing knowledge of state capture in the public domain could lead to wider social support for counter-state capture coalition. But it also presents a challenge in form of potentially feeding antisystem populist political parties that attempt to adopt the anti-state capture agenda and feed anti-mainstream conspiracies. Pro forma reforms from mainly populist (and sometimes non-democratic) political forces are a new challenge. We see this unfolding in the Czech Republic and partly in Slovakia, but unfortunately, at this moment we do not have a satisfactory answer as to how our partners should cope with this challenge.  

The comparative event we convened in Istanbul helped us and our partners to better understand different iterations and forms of state capture. Thanks to these discussions we have witnessed progress in development of an analytical framework that provides interested parties with a set of questions to start understanding the scale and type of state capture they face. Especially from our more recent discussions and application submissions, we have noticed great demand for streamlining the analytical framework and establishing a shared methodology for comparing countries, but also a common ground to share experience.

In addition to our work, there are parallel conceptual developments, such as those spearheaded by Alina Mungiu Pippidi, or Sara Cheyes, but they have their own logics, which are not primarily policy-oriented.32 The need for more systematic mapping across countries, to assess both the extent of state capture and its dynamic across time and space nonetheless persists.  

**Collaboration**

 Our work thus far has shown the importance of collaboration. Once vulnerabilities in the system of state capture are identified, the most effective way of pushing systemic reform can be through a synergistic collaboration of different actors. To build and maintain a wide coalition of supporters, anti-state capture governance reform proposals must be presented in non-partisan language. Coalitions that push these proposals require a coordinating actor who is not perceived as competing with the individual members of the coalition.

Still unsure how I’ll include that in my app but it’s such a huge part of my life I need to fit it in some how. Take a look at my username and you’ll see how important it is to me. 
- Part time job: Earl of Sandwich, junior and senior year.

**Schools:** I’m all over the place, but mostly looking at smaller, liberal arts colleges. I honestly have very few preferences on location or size. I need help finding target schools. With my crap GPA I feel like every school is a reach, which is bad.

- Oberlin (visited in February, loved it)
- UMich Ann Arbor (visited in February)
- Middlebury 
- Swarthmore 
- Rice University
- George Washington University
- Ohio State
- UNR (visited in June)

**Questions**
Please help me find more match/target schools. Also should I ED to Oberlin? The inability to shop finances with ED scares me, as my family in no way could even come close to affording college if I don't get substantial financial aid. Thank you so much!"

Please and thank you!",BeaconInferno,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/4yni3r/chance_me_for_dickinson_university_of_richmond/,"Hello! I will be applying to these 5 schools along with a couple state schools (UOregon and Oregon State) and reaches. Before I go on and narrow down my reaches more, I would like an opinion on my chances for these schools. I think that I will get into these schools, and at the very least 3 of them. I would like to get feedback if that is an accurate assumption. I feel that come April I will likely be choosing between these school and through my research I can see myself going to all of them.


My information-
* GPA: 4.0uw, something really high weighted, I have taken the max amount of IB Classes I can. I am a Full IB student, there is Usually only 20/500 students who are each year.


* SAT- Around 1400 New Sat, retaking in October and December if needed. Chem and Math 2 in November


* Rank - 5/468. At my school, all people with an uw 4.0 GPA and met honor requirements are valedictorians. There are around 10 each year, I will probably be one of them. Honestly don't know if my school reports unweighted or weighted ranks because of this. We have 2 official transcripts with either one. I think I get to choose which one to send in, if I do I will send the rank 1 unweighted transcript.


**EC**: (Most of these are volunteering related, I put the number of documented volunteering hours next to it, none of the hours overlap)


* Sparrow Club -**President**- 100+ hours
This is a club that I am REALLY passionate about. It's a club where we fundraise for a different sick child each year. Last year it was for a girl who had the same cancer my mom died of. We raised $15,000 and I am immensely proud of that. Benefit concerts, craft fairs, basketball games ect. I know I don't have a fancy research position but I really take A LOT of pride in this because of the history with my mother. Before I became president we raised $3000 so there was a big difference when I took over. The club only had like 10 people and the old presidents just wanted to give up and disband, but I took over. There is around 100 members now.


* Library Council -**President**- 50+ Hours


* Japanese National Honor Society -**Vice President**- 60+ hours


* Science National Honor Society -**Co-founder, Secretary**- (only this year)


* Communications Intern- During my sophomore year for a company online


* Key Club -**Officer**- -**Divisional assistant**- (Both roles are at separate levels of the club, so I have them simultaneously) 170+ hours


* Tennis - JV 9-11, Varisty anticipated 12th


* NHS: 70+ hours. Started an Oregon Humane Society fundraiser empty can drive that earned ~$500

* Meals on Wheels: Volunteer for 3 years, 1-3 times each week in the summer and during the school year on some non-school days. I am also a **volunteer coordinator** there, I get people from my high school to volunteer- ~60 Hours

* Food Pantry: Help out once a week for an hour for 3 years at a local food pantry (In a church but not one I go to)

* Food Bank: 3-8 times a year for 4 years.

Some other Volunteer things like at a family homeless shelter, Library, Metal recycling, Beach Cleanup, PSO Childcare watching; but these things are not as consistent.

Busser at a Hotel summer before Junior year and during Junior year. Quit because it became too much of a commitment


Major: Neuroscience or Psychology with a Neuroscience concentration/minor. Also Pre-med


First Generation, Single parent house hold. (Mother died)


Also would like to add I was homeless Durring part of my freshmen year and will talk about that in my essay


Applying to most of my reaches through Questbridge


* Income: $12,000.
^So financial aid is an absolute necessity. I can take out up to $9,500 in federal loans (I know my dad will get denied Parent-Plus and no way will any Private loan company allow him to co-sign). I also can do Work-study and perhaps ~$3,000 in summer earnings. With this guideline, all of these schools Net price calculators make them doable. How much can I trust those though?


Because of the financial aid I need to make sure that I can get into more than 1 of them, I am pretty positive I will but I am worried. I need to be able to compare packages. Should I add more safety/matches? True safeties are so hard for me to find because of the finical aid aspect. My Current SAT is just a bit too low for most automatic full tuition (But we will see after October) and most of those schools are too big for my preferences. Syracuse is already pushing the size limit.


So please chance me! Also, I will be including reaches but that isn't what I want to focus on for this post.

This is a story from when I interned at *local computer store* or **$LCS** for short. I was there for a few weeks, and quit after a dispute over business practices emerged. This story is the reason I quit. No names will be named, instead they will be BigBoss (**$BB**), SweetOldLady (**$SOL**) and Me (**$DJ**).


We are at the end of the day, towards time for me to head home (**$BB** stays another 3 hours after I leave), when **$SOL** comes in with a laptop in a panic. I go to the services desk to see what the matter is.


&gt;**$SOL**: Can you help me? I was doing emails on my laptop and suddenly it says its going to install Windows 10!

*For reference, the laptop was at least 7 years old. As a rule of thumb at our store, we don't put Windows 10 on any laptop that has a Windows Vista or lower COA on it.*

&gt;**$DJ**: Sure, I can help you with that. It shouldn't be too long.

*I take her laptop over to the workbench. It's been left on, and the update has 6 minutes remaining. No sweat, just plug my USB in and run a tool. Before I can begin, enter* **$BB**, *stage left.*

&gt;**$BB** (quietly to me): Do the virus scans too and run sfc /scannow, so we can charge her $80.

&gt;**$DJ** (quitely back to **$BB**): But it's just windows 10, its as simple as deleting the update files and disabling it with that tool.

&gt;**$BB** (still quietly): Yes but just do it.


So I proceed to disable the Windows 10 update (in like 10 seconds mind you), and then (despite my objections) begin a virus scan and that sfc command. Neither were needed, but **$BB** proceeded to charge this eldery pensioner $80 for the virus scan etc. I couldn't look her in the face, I felt so bad.


I decided to quit the next day.


EDIT: Just to clarify, I did what I was told because I was an intern and this was my first job in I.T. I was still of the ""yes sir no sir 3 HDDs full sir"" mindset.

EDIT 2: sfs is sfc, duh. Thank you u/bezdancing, I got confused because there is a box of frozen chicken tenders called SFC in my freezer."
4yo86i,1,2016-08-20,First major project; any pointers on how to tackle it?,Statici,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/4yo86i/first_major_project_any_pointers_on_how_to_tackle/,"So here's the dealio: I have an internship where I have to take [this code](https://github.com/artiste-qb-net/quantum-fog) and add to it/rework it from an (apparently) java style to something more python-like so that others may employ it and use it for as many applications as possible.

The problem: While I have experience in java, C, HTTP, actionscript, python, R, matlab, octave, and a few other languages, that work was *extremely* limited...in total, throughout my overall 13+ years of coding, I may have written one or two thousand lines of code, none of which was used for more than a few specific things. I have no sense of how to structure good code, and my job right now is (essentially) to do just that. My sense of whether code is ""good"" or ""bad"" is pretty much nonexistent; in a few cases it's written in an obviously stupid way and I might be able to spot ways to improve it, but with this, it already looks fine to me...whereas to some of my friends, it is (stylishly) bad.

Could you guys maybe skim this code a bit, and point out what you think needs to be improved, from a very basic intuition side? I don't need you to like, do my job for me (lol) but right now I am reading everything from the discrete mathematics used in bayesian networks, to how the algorithms used in network inference function, to how python can be used in data analysis, and it is eating up a LOT of time. It would be great to start on things from the raw programming perspective (if there is a way to do that).

Oh...and if it's just the case that I need to spend time reading this code and writing other code until I get an idea of how to organize classes and functions in the best way for this project, then that's fine too...just seems like I'm missing some aspect that should make this easier."

EDIT: Thank you for all your answers! You are really helping me. I needed to see that having an enjoyable job can be possible. Sometimes I feel that trying to find it is a waste of time.

EDIT 2: After reviewing all your comments I feel encouraged again!!! THANK YOU /r/INTJ.

I'll write this for people who will be reading this post in the future, looking for advice like me. Many of you believe having a fulfilling job, one that makes me happy enough to go every day with energy, is possible! And some of you even have it now. So the most valuable advice for me is to try and try different jobs until I figure out what kind of job is made for someone like me. I'm also reading books like Managing Oneself by Peter Drucker or Mark Cuban's book which tell the same as you.

When my worry about my career started (months ago) I thought I should follow my hobbies, or maybe that by exploring what I like I would find my job informing myself on the internet and asking around. That seems not to be true. To find my job I need to experiment and it will take far more than I would like to. Because I don't have enough information yet. I have to learn what types of job I like, what types of people I work best, how well I can manage deadlines and stress, etc.

Also I read an advice about this topic from Hunter S. Thompson saying that the meaning of the job is more important than the tasks performed. Some of you have said that too. Is important to write this down also.

I'll complete my existing personal profile with things I'll learn from experimenting jobs, internships and projects and after a while I know I'll have enough information about myself to find my job!

I'm going to extend this summary and save it in my notes.

Thank you, this is a great community!!

4yp0to,0,2016-08-20,Small question regarding my internship contract,StepW,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4yp0to/small_question_regarding_my_internship_contract/,"Hey. As a preface, I'm a 21-year-old IT graduate in Malta, and apart from some very minor online freelance work, I've never had a job... until now. I just applied for a nine-month, paid, full-time internship (€300 a month, €500 a month after six months) to get some experience and a bit of financial help for my future master's course. I went for the interview, and they accepted me.

They told me during the interview what the salary would be, and I have it stated in writing in one of the emails I exchanged with them. However, I'm now taking a look at the contract they sent me before I start working this coming Monday, and in the contract it stipulates multiple times that the internship is *unpaid*.

I'm going to ask them if it was an oversight of some kind, but if it wasn't a mistake on their part then perhaps the reason the salary isn't mentioned in the contract is that they want to pay me off-the-book so they can avoid paying national insurance. This makes me a bit uncomfortable.

Is all this something I need to worry about as an intern? I'm extremely naive when it comes to this kind of stuff because this is my first proper job, and I would love some advice.

Thanks!"

&gt;A girl from another world searches for her father while eluding the monsters who enslaved her people. The novel combines gritty realism with a reimagining of mythology in a fast-paced adventure.

One award judge, ***Ink Me*** author **Richard Scrimger**, said of ***Children of the Spider***, ""I value surprise when I'm reading and that book genuinely surprised me a couple of times."" 

The book has now been published and **Kirkus** just gave it a starred review, singling out the main character in particular for praise: 

&gt;""Mayali navigates this new world with wit and moxie that make her an admirable protagonist. Brisk pacing and third-person chapters that alternate between the two Amerindian teens will have readers rooting for this duo and their allies--whoever they may really be.... With dialogue that deftly stays authentic while bridging the worlds of Guyana's colonial past and its modern state, this story is magical realism at its best.""

That said I'm aware that programming-based jobs have decent enough pay so that I won't have to worry about the total cost of applying to med school (several thousand dollars). Even though I don't have any industry internships (I've done research with heavy command line interface/programming usage) I think I can still use my projects and school rep to land a job somewhere.

main questions: while dealing with interviews for medical school how feasible is it to also balance your first job? (if anybody applied to any other grad/law/etc school I'm interested in hearing those experiences) I'll possibly be interviewing within the first three months of starting my job if that makes a difference.

Second: if interviewers ask me where do I see myself in five years, how do I respond? Also, should I specifically disclose that I'm planning on attending medical school the following year?

Third: would it be smart to disclose this with my employees as well?

Thanks for reading."

She is living in a small town nearby my city and studing here. When we met, she was taking care of her mother, who had cancer (she died in July). So far we have been very open and sincere with each other. We did not have any problems with talking on difficult topics and had great sex (but still learning our bodies). We share similar values, and are looking for the same things in the relationship. We also have similiar sense of humour and laugh a lot when we are together. Due to the distance we are meeting mainly during weekends. She prefers to visit me, though I have offered to visit her few times (she declined, told me that she prefers my city/home). She is at the moment after 1 year of new studies, having internship there, but thinking about moving to my city. As for our dates usual stuff - sushi, pubs, going for the walks etc. Once I cooked a dinner for her and prepared a bath for her, cause I wanted to prepare surprise romantic evening for her.

About 1,5 week ago things started to be a bit strange. We have planned together short vaction, she told me that she wont get any days off at her work. So I decided that i will spent my holidays taking care of the house and doing some renovations. We have met last Monday, had good time together, but as she was leaving, she told me that she had brought some my stuff to give it back, but she did not have courage to do so. Then I knew something is wrong. 

Rest of the week was quite hard - it felt that something was not right, but she avoided the topic when I wanted to discuss it. Finally yesterday we managed to talk about it. She told me that she feels that she is not good enough for me, because of my job, interests, knowledge are overwhelming her. She has issues with self-esteem, and we had similar talks before. Together we decided that it is time for us to define where we want to go with the relationship. I had some time for analysis, so I know that I would like to start to further develop our relationship, and I have told her this. Most of the time she was crying and saying that she is not sure and is afraid. For the whole talk I remained calm, have not ridiculed her arguments (the main was that she will hinder me from doing what I want). In the end she decided that she needs some time to think about us.

Today she was behaving for most of the time like nothing happend - we were flirting as always when texting. I offered to visit her today or tomorrow, however she asked me not to, because she is having a period. When I brought the topic of our relationship - we were in the same place as yesterday. She told me what scares her, and I have repeated my arguments. I have also added that constant thinking does not bring anything good, and we should stop being afraid and see how things will develop. Around evening I have suggested that maybe she would like to visit me tomorrow, and she replied that maybe she will, but for sure we will met on Tuesday. 

I do not plan to push this topic tomorrow, and I am considering to limit our contact only to setting up meeting on Tuesday. I am looking for an advice how to proceed to maintain our relationship.

  **tl;dr**: 
Been 2 months with GF with self-esteem issues. She is afraid of continueing our relationship and I want to develop it further - how should I proceed?"

4yr6pc,1,2016-08-20,'06 Camry XLE vs '10 Corolla LE,nugsandchugs,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/4yr6pc/06_camry_xle_vs_10_corolla_le/,"I was recently in an accident in which my car was totaled. Because I'm a senior in college, I need to get a car ASAP in order to get to and from work and school (which starts next week!). This will be my first big purchase, which I will be financing myself.

A couple things:

-The two biggest concerns for me are reliability/dependability and fuel efficiency. I'm tired of having shitty, beater cars and having things break constantly. I'm a senior in college and the place I intern at is ~40 miles from my house, so it's quite a drive.

-My price range is limited to what I can afford to pay monthly since I'm financing. I was at the dealership today, and after running my credit the estimate they gave me came out to about $200/month, or $170/month with $1000 down (@60 months). That's probably the most I'd be able to put down.

-I don't know how to drive a stick.


As the title states, the two cars I'm debating between are a '06 Camry XLE (89,338 miles, $8,691) and a '10 Corolla LE (72,448 miles, $8,991). There also was an '08 Corolla LE (67,118 , $6,991) that I originally was interested in, but there is a discrepancy on the carfax in which the mileage goes from 70k back down to 20k at a later date, which the dealer was unable to explain (odometer may have been messed with?). Nevertheless, I still checked the car out and it wouldn't even start in the lot... so needless to say I skipped out on that one. 

Both cars had only one owner. The Corolla has updates on the carfax for about every 3,000 miles, which is nice to know that the car was taken care of to a certain extent. On the other hand, the Camry has nothing between 0 and 60,000 miles. Now, that doesn't mean that the car wasn't taken care of, but it's not as comforting as the Corolla. After it hit 60,000 miles, the Camry has reports of oil changes and other maintenance every few thousand miles.

The Corolla is rated at 4/5 on Edmunds and 8.6/10 on KBB. The Camry is rated at 4.6/5 on Edmunds and 9.2/10 on KBB. Going off those ratings alone, I'd be more inclined to go with the Camry. However, going through the ratings it seems like it's common to see a few people having extremely bad experiences with either car. 

I only drove the Corolla because I didn't know about the Camry until I got home this afternoon, so I can't speak to the Camry's driveability, but the Corolla felt nice. The only thing I have to compare is my Chevy Metro, which was, let's face it, a piece of shit. You might be able to tell, but honestly I'm not overly concerned with the car's performance. As long as it runs and it's smooth.

The only major gripe I have between the two is that the Camry doesn't have an AUX input, only CD and tape. I listen to music A LOT, mainly using my phone via the AUX input with Spotify. Especially on my long drives to work. On my old car I used an FM transmitter, but those tend to be crap in terms of quality. I'm willing to sacrifice if the Camry is substantially better than the Corolla, but if it's a wash the AUX input would make my life way more enjoyable (if I'm being honest here).

There was a couple other cars that caught my eye at the dealership:

2015 Hyundai Elantra SE - 38k, $11,991

2015 Ford Focus SE - 35k, $12,991

2014 Kia Forte EX - 49k, $12,991

2013 Toyota Corolla LE - 13k, $13,495

They're pricey, but they're just a few in case someone suggests I look for something with lower mileage. 

Lastly, I applied for an auto loan (for which I'm awaiting approval) through my bank. If it gets approved I'll be able to get something essentially new. If I was to go down that route I'd probably go for a 2016 Honda Civic. That would offer the most reliability, but those payments would be tough to make. And I'm sure the insurance would cost a lot more. Though after this next semester I'll be able to work essentially full-time, so it's possible. The loan was something I applied for so I could get a feel for my options.

I appreciate any advice!

4yrhur,3,2016-08-20,Me [22 F] with my mom [50 F]: extreme argument over graduate school vs. job. How to deal?,jayzpole,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4yrhur/me_22_f_with_my_mom_50_f_extreme_argument_over/,"Hi Reddit...posted about these issues before...long post below:


Our current issue (in a long, long line of conflicts ever since my dad left three years ago) is that I am quitting my job to go to graduate school. This is a job at a well known corporation that she set me up with (she's a former employee, knew manager). I would not have gotten a position like this straight out of my undergrad were it not for her. I am very grateful for this, as I badly needed a job back in April to cover my expenses and help my family out.


Here's the deal. Before we even found out about the job opportunity, my plan was to start a masters this September. I didn't know about all of the details until a few weeks ago, and it turns out that I will receive more or less full funding through scholarships and TAships...which is great! I will also be traveling on the school's dime next year and will likely find a good internship for my placement. Needless to say, I'm very excited. While my long term goal is medicine, public health is also appealing and I think that I would be happy with a job in public health were medicine to fall through. Even though there are more graduates than jobs, I've always been fortunate with respect to job seeking, so hopefully the trend will continue after my MSc. Also, having a masters degree does give me a boost (albeit small) for medicine (pre-interview formulas), so it's all about maximizing my chances.


The job is cushy for a new graduate, with benefits and a mid-level full-time salary. These are all excellent things, but the field has nothing to do with health care proper...its purely logistical and administrative. I don't mind working here for the next year, but I'm a nerd at heart. Moreover, I'm not sure if I'd be so lucky with funding if I reapplied for the MSc. I've also gotten positive responses from potential internships (think well-known national health/security organizations), so I think it would be a shame if I missed out on these opportunities. In short, I've weighed the pros and cons and the MSc improves career chances in health care, is personally satisfying, directly contributes to my long-term goals, and lets me travel for free.


I have been really struggling with making a decision due to immense guilt. Not only do I feel terrible for being so last minute with the company because of how difficult this was to decide, but this situation is complicated because my mom's reputation is on the line. Even before I accepted the offer (I was desperate, and mom's goading didn't help), I knew that there was a good chance I'd go for the Masters. I cried for days and argued with my mom over accepting it, voicing my concerns. So, my mom was fully aware that it would probably come to this and, while she wasn't necessarily happy with the prospect of me working for only 3-4 months (the employers also think I'll be there for at least a year), she told me to try it out and see what happens, even if I would only stay for a short while. I've informed her of my academic successes over the course of the summer and she was not very receptive. We're in an uncomfortable financial situation due to the divorce, so my job has helped considerably. However, I've secured myself employment as a student so that I will still be able to contribute at least something.


So when I told my mother my plan, she was livid. Screaming, insulting my character, telling me I didn't love her, that I was dragging her name through the dirt, that I was embarrassing the family, that I would end up working for minimum wage after graduation because the Masters would be useless, that medicine is a pipe dream, that I'm cold and cruel, that I'm a liar and a traitor for not telling her earlier...etc. Basically, I do not have her approval and I am grounded (""no car privileges"") and cannot go anywhere freely. I mean, I could, but that would instigate another argument. 


She's in a lot of pain because of autoimmune issues and sleep apnea, and the strain of this divorce is not over. She's insecure, unhappy with herself and how her life has turned out, and has abandonment issues. I wish I could help her with her issues, but I'm at a loss. She's a good woman who has gone above and beyond for me. She has supported me financially, provided me with food a roof, love, and great guidance. When we're good...it's really good but when it's bad (which is at least once a week), it's awful. I haven't moved out because the plan was to do that after I got into medicine/sorted out a long-term career. I could move out as I now have the finances, but I don't want to leave on bad terms. I wanted this to be a decision we all agreed upon, but the frequency and intensity of these arguments is pushing me further away and may force me to pack up one day and leave. It got semi physical a few months ago (over carpet cleaning, no less), but I only I walked away with some scratches. And, no, she won't kick me out because of abandonment issues. We even had an argument that I would leave once I got this job and, lo and behold, I'm still here.


Anyway, I'm now suffering the silent treatment. I think she expects me to apologize. I'm wrong for postponing telling her (it's a very juvenile tactic on my part), but whenever I mentioned graduate school she would get angry, roll her eyes, or telling me how she's scared of talking about it...insinuating she knew what I would eventually choose. I feel terrible that I won't be contributing financially, but I'm making an effort to please everyone, including myself. It will be harder without my steady income, but we managed for the past three years without it and it has been getting easier. I'm worried that if I continue working that I will miss out on the opportunities I've worked so hard to get. I could be doing much worse in life, and I do not understand why she makes my decision out to be life-shattering. Sure, I'm not in medicine yet, but it is hardly hopeless when I was 1 point short last year and waitlisted elsewhere.


I am tired of being criticized, scolded, and verbally abused for either not washing the dishes within the five minutes I'm told, for being ""too"" quiet because I'm tired, for ""talking back"" when she's being unreasonable, for traveling to see my boyfriend once in a blue moon, and now for going back to school. She says that I've changed and that I'm the root of the problem. I probably have changed...I've grown up, but I cannot distinguish between genuine criticisms of myself and those I'm being manipulated into thinking. I cannot reason with her at all. I generally stay silent while she yells, unless she pushes me to the extreme and it becomes a screaming match. Broaching the topic while she's calm will immediately dissolve into conflict. It is not healthy for me to spend most of my day anticipating what mood she'll be in when I get home, so I don't know how to react or approach her. She knows this, but nothing changes. She admits that she nags too much, is often unfair, and that she's happy with my success, but it means nothing when we argue violently.

Am I wrong for choosing school over the job? Is the intensity of her anger justified? How do I approach her to resolve this?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Quitting job mom got me for graduate school because its better in long-term. She knew this would happen, and everyone agrees its good for me, but she is incredibly angry and its day 3 of silent treatment. How do I approach her/what are my next steps?"

I really, really want to get into the DirectX driver team, but it seems they're looking for people with 4 years experience (senior position). Is it a good idea if I apply for it anyways? I currently have 2 internships directly related to graphics API development and one internship in AAA game dev on my profile. I also have a 3D rendering app I've been working on which I use to learn DirectX.

I have a few friends who work there, but it seems they use some kind of referral system which requires a job ID, and since there's no non-senior opening listed for that team, there's no job ID :(

Should I contact the HR there and find out any non-senior openings in that team?

FWIW, this particular branch doesn't hire interns off-campus.

EDIT: Also wanted to mention that the office is located outside the USA, and I can't seem to find any new college grad listings for it. However they do a lot of on-campus recruitment every year, though."

4ys7f9,3,2016-08-20,Where should I [22 M] draw the line with [23 F]? Mindgames.,anergia247,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ys7f9/where_should_i_22_m_draw_the_line_with_23_f/,"Throwaway account. Apologies for the long post!

So I met this girl (I'm going to call her F) 5 years ago. We got along really well, flirted around a bit, and went on a few unofficial dates together. Nothing serious, just going for a walk together in the park, or visiting bookstores.

Nothing really happened between us then, and I moved on and dated someone. Lost contact with F during that time as my ex got quite jealous of any female friend I had. After my ex and I broke up, F and I started talking again and I started developing some feelings for her. However, she was dating someone at the time so nothing happened then.

We met up several times over the past few years (we've both moved to different countries), and each time I meet her, the feelings I had back then just come rushing back. However, the timing was never quite right. During the times when she admitted to having feelings for me, I had a girlfriend. And vice versa.

Fastforward to 2 months ago, I happened to be doing an internship near her. We were both single, and after a long discussion, decided to give it a shot together. 

We realised that our attraction to each other was pretty superficial. We didn't share any common interests: read different types of books, watched different types of movies / tv shows, and have very different hobbies. However, it felt good when we were together. And both of us enjoyed each others company. 

We never ended whatever relationship we had properly. Nor did we really define it in the first place...

Since I left to go back to my country for work, things have been getting complicated.

The first few weeks after I left, we were talking every single day over Skype. Just making small talk about our day etc. Soon after however, the things she would mention started to really confuse me.

One day she would be telling me about how she didn't want to be in any sort of relationship, and that she wanted to be independent. The next day she mentions how someone had hit on her. And the day after she tells me that people from her city think that we're dating. (I didn't know how to respond to that...)

And on top of all that, she books flights to visit me next month, and also asks if I would join her on one of her trips later this year.

Recently (past week), we've just been arguing a lot. Everything I seem to do or say seems to annoy her, yet she wouldn't tell me why. 

For instance, F made a comment on something I wrote in a schedule of her visit about a clash with my timetable. I rescheduled my appointment and marked her comment as resolved. I then get this message:

F: ""um RESOLVED??? resolved is supposed to be a mutual thing. just saying""
Me: ""erm its just a comment. im still planning it. so i marked it as resolved? rather than have the yellow highlights. could you not take everything so personally?""
F: ""...im just joking. maybe you're the one thats taking it personally?""

We haven't spoken since.

Honestly, I don't know what to do. Her flights are already booked and shes visiting next month. Part of me wants to argue back and confront her about the things she says, but another part of me is like ""Why should I even care so much? It's not like we're dating or anything. I have better things to do than to waste time arguing."" 

So as a result I just tend to not reply to messages like the ones above and try not to let it affect me.

I do feel like I have to make things clear before she comes to visit next month. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not, which is the main thing holding me back from messaging her back.

How should I approach this? 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Somewhere inbetween a ""friends"" and ""a bad LDR"" with a girl. One day she tries to make me jealous, the next she'll tell me about how she doesn't want to be in a relationship. Recently been arguing a lot, want to confront her but don't know if I'm overreacting. Also not sure if I should even bother with confronting her since we're not dating (why let it affect me so much?). But shes also visiting next month...

Edit: Put Dating as the flair because of ""unclear relationships""."

I was rejected for cs and majored in Physics for a year. Then I applied for a transfer to CS with Computer Engineering as a second choice. Again, rejected, so now I'm in computer engineering. 

I'm now discovering that CPE is all hardware and almost no software. Worse, I'm gradually realizing that it's possible to get a job without majoring in engineering. WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THIS?! I've always been told that STEM = employment, non-STEM = unemployment. I like programming, but if I had known that there was a market for Political Science majors, that's what I'd be doing!

But I can't really change course now. All my friends are tech people, and I've got a few promising opportunities for CS internships next summer. All my professional connections are USELESS if I want a government/legal job. I've got to slog through 3 more years of computer engineering so I can get into law school and do what I really want to.

And on top of it all, I don't even like the school I'm in. There's another school closer to home that has an excellent poli sci program AND a great CS program. The school I'm in now doesn't have any of the extra curriculars that I'm interested in."

4yt9lf,149,2016-08-21,Who's taking all of flipping patch cables?,BitCthulhu,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4yt9lf/whos_taking_all_of_flipping_patch_cables/,"What seems like a long time ago I was an intern for an IT department at a rather large public school.
This school had gone through a few changes; the biggest change was their new tech director who had risen to this position of power because the previous director left.
We will call him $Sup.
He didnt have degree and he didn't have certifications. Now, I know what you're thinking:

&gt; Bit, he could have had experience.

I never said this guy had experience. This guy couldnt tell you the difference between a loopback and APIPA address.

As I had found out through the course of my internship, this guy barely understood how to maintain a PC let alone a network.

This story begins about 5 months into my internship:

At least once for the past three weeks I came into work to find a ticket put in about some random computer in a lab or a classroom not being able connect to the network. Everytime it was in a different building (this school had 6 buildings). Of course I would go up to the building's switch closet (or the correct one because 2 of the buildings had multiple switch boxes) and a patch cable would be missing. 

One instance is weird. Three is a problem. Who would take the patch cables? Obviously it had to be someone with a key. Why would they take the patch cables? Each building had an office with a box full of ethernet cables. Only an idiot would just take one out of the switches.

I decided the best first step to take was to print out each ticket that was tied this mystery and created relationships between each ticket in our system. 

Next step was to let the boss man know whay was up.

I sent him an email with each ticket number and attached the notes. I wasn't looking to light a fire, I just wanted to let him know that someone was going around taking patch cables. 

A little later that week I finally saw $Sup. It was his nature to show up at random. I had not received a message back from him so I had no idea whether or not he had even looked at my message. My bad for not thinking to enable 'read receipts.' 

Also, while I was waiting for a reply from $Sup, another ticket was assigned to me to investigate why another computer suddenly lost network connectivity. This school had two levels of IT. Tier I, the people who actually worked at the school everyday for small stuff, and Tier II which was a team of people who I barely knew. 

I only knew a couple of the guys there. Some were willing to teach you and others just wanted to come in, fix things and leave. Either way they were all likeable guys. Tier II came in when something was beyond our knowledge. They also had access to the switch closets.

I decided to strike up a conversation with $Sup to see what the next step would be to prevent this issue from happening again.

**$Me** &gt; Hey, $Sup, so I don't know if you saw my email but some how patch cables are going missing from the switches.

**$Sup** &gt; What? 

**$Me** &gt; Yeah, I've had 4 tickets in the past 3 weeks with computers that didn't have network connectivity. Come to find out there was a patch cable missing in each case. Different building each time.

**$Sup** &gt; Do you know what days they happened on? 

**$Me** I made sure to send you a copy of each ticket with the date stamp on them.

He clicks through the email and each attachment quickly and looks up at me. 

**$Sup** &gt; These are all days that Tier II was here.

This didn't make sense because at this time we only had a couple tickets for Tier II in our system. Those issues were both at the same building and only one of the ""patch cable tickets"" had been at that building. 

**$Sup** &gt; Im going to let everyone know thats not how we do things here.

A few minutes later an email was sent out to everyone in tech about the incident. $Sup realized it was almost lunchtime and left in his usual fashion. 
One minute he was at his desk, the next minute I heard the havy thud of the tech room door and he was gone.

Fast forward to the next week, one of the Tier II techs ($TT) was in the office with me trying to figure out the mess that was the VoIP system that had been installed earlier that year (I will post that story another time).

**$TT** &gt; So what was that email about that $Sup sent out last week? Someone stealing patch cables?

**$Me** &gt; Yeah, I've had 4 tickets where computers suddently couldnt connect to the network and then I found out the patch cable was missing.

**$TT** &gt; Who takes patch cables?

**$Me** &gt; I have no idea.

I was silent for a minute. I really wanted to ask him about the issue but I  didn't want to make it into a big deal.

**$Me** &gt; So hows that ticket going for 'X building'?

**$TT** &gt; Still waiting on $Sup to give the go ahead on a few things. He doesn't like replying to emails.

**$Me** &gt; So you havent been to 'X building'?

**$TT** &gt; Why? I can't do anything. Im not gonna drive out there just to see whether or not $Sup wants me to start on that ticket.

I just left it at that. I have a hunch who it was buch I don't really have the proof. I know that I never had a ticket with that issue again.



TL;DR
Cat and mouse game to figure out who took the stupid patch cables. It was either $Sup or $TT but I never got complete closure on the issue. Im sure it was $Sup"

Tier 1 support agents (myself and one other person) were essentially tied down to a phone all day. We were responsible for phone support, remote support via TeamViewer, ticket entry, documentation, receptionist duties, getting yelled at by higher tiers because they changed procedures and didn't tell anyone else, etc. Some of our employees worked on-site for our clients. These employees would have a company issued laptop from both our company and our client. Sometimes our employees could not tell the difference between the two laptops, which resulted in the following tale. Since this incident occurred two years ago, I only recall a few exact quotes.

&gt;Me: It sounds like you're using a laptop issued by &lt;client name&gt;. Can you check on the bottom of the laptop and tell me if there is a &lt;client name&gt; sticker?

&gt;Coworker: Yes, there is a &lt;client name&gt; sticker.

&gt;Me: You'll have to contact &lt;client name&gt;'s IT department. I don't have access to their accounts to reset your password.

&gt;Me: Is there anything else I can do for you?

&gt;Coworker: No.

&gt;IT Intern: Hey, can you help me get into my system?

&gt;Me: &lt;gives IT intern an evil look and makes an idle threat involving a stabbing&gt;

Up to that point, I had never heard anyone refer to a laptop or desktop as their ""system."" Come to think of it, the only other time I remember hearing the generic term of ""system"" was a phishing attempt (caller hung up after I asked their name) while working at this same position. Maybe it's a regional thing, but I always try to be a bit more specific than that. 

TL;DR: Coworker refers to a client's laptop as her ""system,"" can't follow simple instructions, IT intern makes a joke after the call ends."

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

--------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also very much wanting to do a RP based off The Witcher.

I met her in college and we kept in contact after I graduated and dated shortly after. I am in grad school now and we live a few hours away. She is an awesome person and super enjoyable to be around. We have similar hobbies and I love her to death. When she visits for weekends we have an awesome time watching movies or going for walks around the nearby lake.

The only issue is that I am the only person she can talk to while at home. She lives in the middle of nowhere with only her brother. Her mother passed away about a month after we started dating (so about 4 months ago) and she never had a father. Since then, she has been in constant communication day and night.

At first I was completely OK with the situation. While heartbroken about the loss of her mother, I was happy that she was turning to me in her time of need. I love being there for her. I know she needs a shoulder to lean on during these hard times. I don't know what losing a parent is like I can't imagine how hard it must be for her at such a young age. For these reasons, it makes complete sense that she would want to talk so much and I am all for healthy communication to make a long-ish distance relationship work and I am all for supporting her when she needs me most.

Before we were dating, I would tell her that I was going to have a guys night and that I'd either text her later that night or the next morning. She would be totally fine with it. Post-dating, she gets extremely emotionally upset to the point of crying if I do not call her from ~5:00pm-12:00am *every single night.* If I try to hang up early she will become EXTREMELY depressed and talk about how lonely she is and how terrible her night will go if I hang up so I always end up just staying on the phone. If I don't call by 5:30pm, she is calling non-stop until I answer.

I tried having a guys night but she made me feel so incredibly guilty the entire night by constantly texting me about how lonely she was and how she has no one to talk with ect. I ended up cutting the night short to call her. I love her and I understand that she doesn't have a lot to do or have anyone to talk to besides her brother, but I still want at least a little bit of ""me-time"" before bed. I have an internship that lasts from 9:00am-5:00pm which is when she calls. I have not had virtually any time at all to myself for the last 3 months.

Alternatively, I would also like to have a day or so where I do nothing but be a dweeb and play video games for an unhealthy amount of time with the guys (being away from home in grad school, this is my only way to catch up with them. We spend most of the time talking instead of playing anyway). I used to do this semi-frequently as a means of staying in touch, but that has virtually vanished. I don't want to lose my other friendships by only talking to her every day.

So...am I wrong to want some time to myself each night or to want a day to to catch up with friends? I would like to have a healthy relationship with my girlfriend AND my friends if possible, but I feel like I am hurting her by talking to ANYONE else. Thoughts?

  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend calls 6-7 hours a night after the loss of her mom. I want some time to myself but I feel guilty and I am worried about my other friendships. Am I wrong to want space?"
4yu9kh,9,2016-08-21,"Need Advice, USMC Vet, Recent CS Grad",drewdinger,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4yu9kh/need_advice_usmc_vet_recent_cs_grad/,"Hey everyone sorry if this post is too long. I am a recent computer science graduate of Colorado University(July 2016). I served in the USMC as an enlisted 0651 Data Network Specialist, or a sysadmin in civilian terms, from 2009-2013. I am really uncertain about which direction to take now that I am a graduate and am looking for any advice you guys/gals have. Here is some background about me to help.

* My MOS training consisted of A+, Net+, Sec+, and CCNA Mods 1-3.
* I received a Secret clearance.
* I was deployed with an infantry unit and have had to set up WANs/LANs in various countries abroad, often by myself or in small groups (1-3 others).
* I did enjoy my job. I did not enjoy working for people that did not understand technology, as they often undervalued our service. 
* I wanted to get out and get a degree because of the above reason and to open up my career path options.
* I did very well in my CS classes, the only class I did not get a B+ or higher in was Principles of Programming Languages, I attribute this to the teaching style of the class.
* I went to college before the USMC and had to drop out because I was failing classes/not attending, and in general was not mature enough to finish school.
* My original GPA because of this was abysmal (1.9). 
* Fortunately I worked hard and I graduated from CU Boulder with a cumulative GPA of 3.25, and a 3.51 in CS.
* I had a paid internship for 2 of the 3 years I spent at CU. It was in a scientific lab that was run by the university.
* I left that internship 9 months before I graduated to focus on project building for my personal resume.
* I took advanced classes in Machine Learning and Human/User Centered Design.
* I should have networked more in college, I realize that was a mistake now, but it is difficult when you have a job, a wife, and bills to pay, as well as trying to enjoy college on the side. I shouldn't make excuses though.

I am now at a crossroads and I am feeling overwhelmed. I did enjoy programming, but am not even close to being a master of anything. Classes were taught in C++/Java, my internship worked in Python and a language called IDL (Interactive Data Language), and my projects used C# and JavaScript. I feel like I am not robust enough in any of these languages to pursue a career in them. I have not done any computer network work since i left the USMC, so i am quite rusty. I am put off by some of the people in the tech industry. I do not classify myself as a stereotypical ""programmer"" and I do not program in my free time; I like guns, sports, and the outdoors, yet it seems like most of the private sector companies I have tried to apply with want these types of ""super nerds"" or ""programming enthusiasts"" and that I should be devouring any type of tech news/knowledge in my free time to be able to compete with other candidates. 3/4th of my friends during college were veterans, that shared similar ideals and values that I did. My questions are-

* Would working for a government contractor be better than working for a private company if I wanted to find other like minded people?
* Am I selling myself short if I work for a government contractor/the government?
* Would I be pigeonholing myself if I worked gov/contracting, would it limit my future marketability?
* Am I wrong in thinking that I need to be a ""super coder"" to have any shot at a programming job in the private sector? 
* Are my experiences with systems administration to far in the past to qualify me for entry level positions in careers such as systems analysis or systems administration?
* My internship dealt with current satellite missions and the data they sent, should I be looking at aerospace companies for positions or is my experience irrelevant in that facet?
* Do I have too broad of a knowledge base? I always get the response that they have found someone more qualified. 
* Should I hone one of the skills I have picked up over the last 8 years? Is it too late now that I am graduated? How would I decide which skill to hone if not?

I just have not had a lot of success when applying for jobs and it is really getting to me. I feel like i have a ton of experience, I did decent enough in school, and I even qualify for the 5 point preference when applying for government jobs. Yet I still have been striking out. As I had mentioned 80% of the time I get the response that they have chosen someone more qualified. The other times are mistakes that i have made during the interview process, but I have identified those issues and they have not come up since they originally occurred. Thank you for reading, any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Are there any advanced or powerful front end or full stack projects that can push me to a level where I'm confident enough to start applying for intern roles?"

4yvfve,4,2016-08-21,Going from a chef to Software Development,hiya19922,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4yvfve/going_from_a_chef_to_software_development/,"Hello, kind people. So basically I'm a 24-year-old chef. I'm on a degree course in my second year(BSc Applied Computing degree. http://www.stir.ac.uk/undergraduate-study/course-information/courses-a-to-z/school-of-natural-sciences/applied-computing/)

So I have gained an HNC in Software Development (will gain an HND after the second year) and a vendor certificate. Plus most importantly I love what I'm learning. I absolutely love the whole debugging code and trying to get it to work. It makes it difficult to sometimes go into work, to be honest.

My question is I don't know if my current job has many transferable skills related to Software Development which actually scares me. Do you think this is so? Also, would you in my position try to leave the world of cheffing for a more techy job before looking for an internship/future Software job? (My only worry with this option is it's quite difficult to find any local jobs in admin/helpdesk work and I don't feel qualified at all for even the lowest tier of IT positions).

I'm going through local software companies and emailing them about the prospect of getting some work experience days at a few them. My course has a mandatory summer work experience between 3rd and 4th year but I thought it'd be good for me and my CV to get some before looking for internships. 

Plus over the next few months, I've made a detailed list of goals and aims when it comes to coding and that to try and build a little portfolio of programs. Also, I've booked an appointment at my universities careers centre to discuss my CV and gain their insight.

TLDR: Worried I have no skills anyone will want and at 24 it'll be a hard to slog to get those skills."

4yvz5x,0,2016-08-21,"EcoCAR 3 Recruiting: CS, ECE, CM, BA, and IE majors",belleambition,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/4yvz5x/ecocar_3_recruiting_cs_ece_cm_ba_and_ie_majors/,"EcoCAR 3 is a 4 year competition with 16 universities across North America that are aiming to build the most desirable, eco-friendly, hybrid Chevrolet Camaro. At the year 2 competition, the GT team was one of a few teams to get our car running! However, there is still plenty of work to do in Year 3 and we have open spots on our team. Over the next 10 months we will finish integrating vehicle components, refining our controls strategy, expanding work on a computer vision based ADAS, and much more. There is also a separate part of the competition aimed at educating the public about hybrid vehicles, managing social media, finding sponsors, and giving presentations to industry sponsors. At Georgia Tech, EcoCAR 3 is part of the Vertically Integrated Projects program; this means that team members actually get 1 or 2 class credits for their work. 


In order to continue our success into year 3, we are trying to fill roles in the following sub teams:

* **Electrical (ECE majors):** Responsible for all of the LV and HV wiring in the vehicle. In year 3, team members will be integrating our electric motor and wiring our energy storage system.
  
* **Modeling, Simulation and Controls (ECE, CS, and ME’s with interest in controls):** Responsible for developing and maintaining vehicle models in Simulink, developing test plans for controls code, writing controls code in Stateflow, and using dSPACE to perform Hardware-In-The-Loop testing.

* **Innovation and ADAS (CS and ECE):** Responsible for programming the NXP S32V processing board to recognize different aspects of the driving environment such as traffic signs or children playing the street. Responsible for developing code that for our Innovation Topic of Predictive Powertrain Control. Using information from the ADAS and the GPS data, we can predict different properties about the road and thus choose a more effective charging strategy to significantly increase MPG.

* **Project Management, Development, Communications (CM, BA, IE):** Responsible for maintaining the scope, schedule, and budget of the team, finding sponsorships, managing social media accounts, helping engineering teams develop presentations and reports, planning outreach events, etc.   


If the work sounds cool, but you are still unsure, here are some reasons (other than working on a Camaro with an awesome group of people) you should join the team:

1. Your experiences on the team will make you *EXTREMELY* desirable to employers. You will experience every step of the design process, gain problem solving skills and work with people of different majors. When you go to an interview, companies only want to hear about what you do with EcoCAR 3 and you will have more than enough to talk about.
2. We are sponsored by big companies like GM, Bosch, Mathworks, NXP, dSPACE, Siemens, etc. These companies specifically recruit EcoCAR 3 students. Plus, they provide us with top of the line software and hardware that you don’t normally learn in a classroom or at an internship.
3. You may have the opportunity to travel. We have multiple workshops/competition events a year, and they are throughout the country in places like Boston, Austin, Detroit, and Washington DC. 



**If you are interested in joining the team, you can apply here: http://tinyurl.com/ecocarsignup**


If you want to know more about the project, we will be having an **info session** on *Tuesday August 23rd 11am-12pm in Van Leer 457* and we will be at the VIP poster session later that day *4pm-5pm in the Klaus Atrium*. If you have questions, feel free to send me a message!

This guy in my class named Fred who is from Ethiopia was my friend and also my roommate during our final 2 years of med school, we had to share a place with other guy in our class so we could all be closer to the hospital during our internship. In 2015 my other roommate and i graduated, he didn't. I was awarded a scholarship to continue my studies for 3 more years. We all had to move out because we couldnt find another person to replace the other guy.
Fred owed me a lot of money during that month or so of moving out because his family was disappointed at the fact that he didn't graduate on time, so i paying for most of his expenses during the months of moving out. Now I have given him money before and he would also return it on  time so i wasn't worried when it became a lot of money. 
After a month of moving out i found a cheap one bedroom apartment because i didn't want no roommates and I was planning on going home for the summer, I saw him before i left to remind him how much money he owed me and he told me when i come back he would pay all of it back. 
I came back and a few weeks later i saw him and reminded him about the money. He thought he owed me half of what the amount really was, and I was shocked and explained to him how much it really was and how i kept reminding you before and he thought that he had given me some money before i left or something like that. Anyways we argued and there were some friends with us at the time and he finally agreed with witnesses present that he would pay me back the full amount.
Every chance i would get i would remind him over the phone or messaging to pay me back my money. He would always give me a sincere excuse and i would believe him. Now fast forward to the end of the year. He got his diploma and he left the country.
He managed to pay me back half of the original amount and when i found out he left I messaged him and was angrily speaking to him telling him why did you leave before paying me my full amount.
He got pissed at me! He got pissed at me?!? And was saying how he made a mistake that he shouldn't have even paid the half and that i owe him money because he paid me too much?!?
I was shocked and angry, why? because why didn't he say that to me when we were both in India together. 
I didn't want to talk to him no more and so i got in touch with his cousin who gradated a year ahead of us and i was friends with him. And I explained the whole situation to him and he told me he would convince him to pay me back, but of course fred told him that he wouldnt pay me back. 
After a while i realized it wasnt a whole lot of money and so i decided to contact him and ask him one more time to do the right thing and pay me back if not to just let it go. I spoke with him over the phone  and asked him one more time. The way he spoke to me was in a disrespectful way. He was calling me a liar for cheating him when i tried to explain how the money came about he would say show me the proof but i couldn't because we dealt in cash. Anyways after a while of talking i couldn't take it and so i let my anger take over me and I started cussing him off saying that I will be successful and you are a loser, stuff like that, and a few swear words. Finally i hanged up and he messaged me and said that he recorded me and that i insulted his mom and family, which i didn't (i think i did say MotherF*****). everything i said was directed at him.
He then threatened me saying how he will come back to that city and he will find me and ""ruin my life"" and ""wishing you were never born"".
Keep in mind that i am a scholarship student and in India fighting is not tolerated. And to make matters worse a week after the announcement of my scholarship last year, i got arrested doing something stupid and i was put on probation meaning that if they even hear my name in a negative way anywhere i will be kicked out, no questions asked. And Fred knows that.
I can easily take him but i don't want to fight and get kicked out of school for over a few hundred dollars. But he's coming back in Sept to study something i don't know but not in the same school as mine and I don't know what to do. I want to tell my teachers but i don't want them to think I'm a troublemaker who fights or do something stupid. 
What do i do?

4ywigo,1,2016-08-21,Car totaled on Friday. $3000 to spend.,nugsandchugs,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4ywigo/car_totaled_on_friday_3000_to_spend/,"My car was recently totaled and I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm entering my senior year of college, and I'm a little bit ahead of the curve so this fall will be my last ""true"" semester filled with classes. Next semester I'll have a class or two, so I'll be able to work almost full-time. I'm currently an intern at a place that is willing to work around my schedule, and I have a guaranteed position there if I choose to do so after graduation. 

I have about $4,000 saved up, but ~$1,000 will be going towards out-of-pocket tuition costs. Therefore I'm working with about $3,000 to put towards a car. I live at home with my parents and they charge me $150/month in rent. They said they might cut it down to $50 due to my accident and financial issues.

I intended to work during the semester a day or two a week, but now that I'm out of a car, I'm not sure what to do. It's about a 40 mile drive from my house to where I work.

The way I see it, I have a few options.

1.) Try to find a car in the $2000-2500 range. It's definitely possible, but in that price range I'll end up with something that is late 90's or early 00's with roughly 100k miles - not something reliable. This is what I chose to do for my last car. Every few months something was going wrong with it. If I go with this option I'll still be able to work during the semester. A conservative estimate for my net income if I chose to work during the semester is around $530/month.

2.) Finance a car now. With the money I have, I'd be able to make a decent down payment. Yesterday I went to a dealership and was looking at a 2010 Toyota Corolla with 72k miles for about $10,000 after taxes and fees. They ran my credit and said if I put $1,000 down, my monthly payment (60 months) would be around $170/month. Including a conservative estimate for insurance, I'd be spending close to $300/month for my auto expenses. Throw in gas and rent, my net income will be close to nothing.

3.) Go car-less for the time-being and wait to finance a car until next semester. If I wait until I'm working (practically) full-time in the spring, then I'll be able to afford a higher car payment, and hence get a much better car; most likely brand new. Getting a car for $10,000 with 72k miles is a good deal, but nonetheless cars with such high mileage, even Corollas, which are known to last over 200,000 miles, can run into problems. My father works at the university I attend, so I could carpool with him every day. If went with this option, I wouldn't work during the fall semester. This semester will be rough in terms of coursework, so the bonus here is that I'd be able to focus completely on coursework. My internship will not be jeopardized as it's part of a program that is a ""pathway"" to a full-time job there after graduation. A lot of students in this program only work during the holidays and summer. Of course it would suck not having a car for a few months, but I think that it's certainly doable.

The bottom line is that I need to figure something out, and I need to figure it out soon if I intend to work during the semester. I'm leaning more towards options #2 and #3, but as far as picking between the two it's about even in my mind. They both have pros and cons. Any help or advice is GREATLY appreciated!"
4ywldp,1,2016-08-21,IT work-study or LAN/WAN Internship?,altiar45,ccent,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccent/comments/4ywldp/it_workstudy_or_lanwan_internship/,"I have two options laid before me. I could go with a work study at my college that would put me in a basic IT help-desk role. It would be 25 to 30 hours a week. Or I could go with an internship under a LAN/WAN engineer with the county schools system tech support. My ultimate career goal is to become a network engineer so it seems obvious from that to go with the internship, but I am not sure if having an actual job looks better on a resume than a simple internship. 
  In addition, I already have a job that I am not willing to give up that gives about 18 hours a week. I could use the money from the work-study, but I am not in dire straits. The internship would likely have less hours. I am taking an 18 credit hours load of college classes. 
Any advise would be highly appreciated. If this is not the place for this question then I will gladly remove it. "

4ywtgk,260,2016-08-21,Is it just me or is the software engineering hiring game becoming...more and more toxic with each passing year?,csthrowaway_dinosaur,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ywtgk/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_software_engineering/,"I'm currently happily employed, but the last few recruiters and managers I've networked with have been extremely toxic and I've heard the same thing from friends. I'm curious to see if anyone here has experienced this.

For example, a recruiter recently saw my resume and asked me why I had so many internships on there. In a very rude and condescending tone. She actually called me a ""serial intern"" even though I pointed out that one of the internships turned into a full-time job until I relocated to California for another internship. (I was still in school when one internship turned into a full-time job, so I decided to explore California while I could still do so as an intern.)

I never expected that the hiring landscape would one day treat you with contempt because of ""too many"" internships. It's almost like she held them against me because I didn't turn each one into a permanent role.

I also had a hard time with a different recruiter who tried to bullshit me with the ""since it's your first job out of college"" card when he mentioned what pay range the company was looking for, even though I told him that one of the internships became a full-time job and that the internships themselves were high-quality experience.

Even more appalling was an experience I had with a VP of engineering at an up and coming start-up that was founded by some successful entrepreneurs. He was extremely rude when I went for a visit, and claimed he was being that way because he wanted ""to see if you're looking for easy money or if you're more interested in making a difference in the world."" No joke. He then went on to scoff at my previous work experience and to question my credentials, even though I pointed him to my references and publicly visible source code I've been working on.

So what's going on? Why are hiring managers and recruiters and even VPs of engineering seemingly on a rampage against people who ""have too many internships"" or who ""might want a lot of money instead of a chance to be excited about making a difference"" and all that bullshit? Why are my four internships (one for each year of college) held against me by some? Why do some sneer at my public source code?

Is it all just a cheap attempt to pretend like they don't want a candidate, so that they can possibly get talent for cheaper? Are there so many CS graduates these days that they can feel entitled to pick and choose and be downright abusive? 

I wasn't going to ask, but having been around the networking game for a couple of years now I wanted to see if anyone else has been experiencing this or if it's just the way I present myself. (I doubt it's my soft skills because I've had several pleasant experiences too. I'm just posting here about the increasingly frequent negative experiences)"
4ywtlx,141,2016-08-21,How realistic is this sub?,throwaway88107,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ywtlx/how_realistic_is_this_sub/,"So over the last year or so I became active on this sub, mostly just asking questions and browsing. I'm a junior, so I'm not qualified to hand out much advice.

During that time, this sub has caused me a lot of anxiety (my own fault, I shouldn't go searching for things to worry about). When I was still in school, it was because most here said you need internships and projects as an undergrad to get a job. I managed to get a good entry level job without either. That's not bragging (because it still scares the hell out of me to feel unqualified for my job), just my honest experience.

Then I read people saying stuff like ""if you can't answer FizzBuzz in 3 minutes flat, you're a terrible developer and should quit."" Now, FizzBuzz is obviously pretty damn easy, but from my early observations in this field, there are a lot of working developers who could answer this but would probably need more time than that to get a working answer with no mistakes.

Another example: People insisting that to get a job as a developer, you need to study Cracking the Code Interview and have a great understanding of algorithms. Again, I interviewed many times for relatively big companies, and had only one whiteboard interview. 

What I'm getting at here, is this question: Does this sub present an accurate view of the CS field for newbies that come here looking for advice and information? Or should this really be called r/big4careerquestions? Personally speaking, I've caused myself a lot of unnecessary stress reading threads here that were clearly not very relevant to the job search of an average developer."
4yx0d1,27,2016-08-21,"Is Mormon ""Seminary"" During Public School A Contributor To Utah's Teen Suicide Epidemic? Are Utah School Districts Exploiting Teens For ""Mormonism""? I Emailed Representatives At The 4 Largest Districts Regarding Alternatives To ""Seminary"". Only 1 Responded!",BringATwenty,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4yx0d1/is_mormon_seminary_during_public_school_a/,"Anti-LGBTQ Mormon ""seminary"" disguised as ""released time"" controls the culture in any Utah public school offering 9, 10,11 or 12 grade.  This affects well over 100,000 children in Utah public schools.  In Utah, suicide is the leading cause of death for Utahn's ages 10-24. The rate is double the national average and it is climbing.  

On September 10, 2015 the Salt Lake Tribune printed an article titled, [""As Utah Suicide Rates Climb, Experts Tell Educators To Watch For Signs Of Despair In Children""](http://www.sltrib.com/news/2935514-155/as-utah-suicide-rates-climb-experts)

About 10 days ago, with the school year starting soon, I emailed representatives at Utah's 4 largest public school districts to learn how the adults responsible for the public schools are responding to the epidemic.  I also tweeted the National PTA and the Utah PTA.  Regardless of various mission statements posted typically claiming something to the effect of how each child is important, these are the responses I received:

National PTA - NO RESPONSE.  Tweeted Saturday, August 13.

Utah PTA- NO RESPONSE.  Tweeted Saturday, August 13.

Jordan School District - NO RESPONSE. Emailed Superintendent, Dr. Patrice Johnson. Wednesday August 11th.  Here's an example of the typical, pandering-to-the-public-[""Welcome-Back-Message""](http://jordandistrict.org/2016/07/a-welcome-back-message-from-superintendent-johnson/) claiming to ""make a difference in the lives of 'Every Child, Every Day"".  Posted July 26th.  

Alpine School District - NO RESPONSE. Emailed Public Relations Admin David Stephenson Thursday, August 11.  

Provo School District - NO RESPONSE.  Emailed Caleb Price, Coordinator of Communications and Public Relations on Tuesday, August 10.  Wednesday, August 11 he replied ""Could you please give me more information about who you are writing this report for?""  I responded that it was an ""op-ed"" to be presented to several media outlets locally and nationally.  He did not reply back. 

Granite School District - RESPONDED WITHIN ONE DAY!  DETAILED ACTION PLAN IN PLACE!  I emailed Ben Horsley Wednesday August 10. Thursday August 11 he replied with this response: 

""Thanks for your concerns with respect to released time and the LGBTQ community. 
While I appreciate your advocacy and concerns related to this community, you seem to be under the impression that released time is simply a mormon program. While some students whose parents sign the release for “released time,” do attend LDS seminary, released time is actually a much broader program tied to internships, works study, study at home…whatever a parent may want to have their child released for. In fact, a significant portion of Granite students who sign up for released time, do not attend LDS seminary. 

Neither the district or the state mandates released time, or any curriculum associated with it. We do not provide transportation for released time activities. There is no approval or endorsement of those activities. As such, parents are currently welcome to have their child do (as you have suggested several topics) whatever they would like if they sign up for released time as long as it occurs off of school property. 

I wholeheartedly concur with your assessment that public school should be ""safe haven for personal, intellectual and social enrichment regardless of how they relate to LGBTQ, Mormonism, Judaism, Islam, Agnosticism, etc…” and I am not aware of any policy, program or practice that prevents this from occurring. 

With respect to teenage suicide, this is an ongoing concern not only for schools but for our community as a whole. 2 of our students tragically ended their lives last school year. There is insufficient information to determine their religious background or sexual identity (we are not permitted to track that private information) to correlate your claims. Regardless, we provide parents and students (and to the community as a whole) an abundant amount of programs and resources to help identify signs of suicide and work to prevent it from occurring. Additionally, teachers are required to fulfill annual training on suicide. 2 deaths is 2 too many and we are always open to identifying new ways that schools can help our students and families with this issue. 

Most recently and in conjunction with the state office of education, we have launched the SafeUT app for students who can chat with licensed counselors if they are feeling suicidal. 

If you would like more information on released time, I would suggest you reach out to the state board of education or your state legislators as these bodies have established guidelines and policies to allow parents the freedom to access some of the programs you have mentioned. Or you can always contact me again if I can be of any further assistance. 

Thanks again for your email and have a good day.""

While that response from Granite School District is encouraging, with only 1 response out of 4 I have to wonder if the other parties are quibbled from responding because they are Mormon?  How many more suicides are going to happen before these people acknowledge to themselves that this epidemic cannot be prayed away?  How can ""Mormonism"" expect to be respected as a Christian spirituality if it's leadership continues to refuse to respond when it could help immensely? 

Anti-LGBTQ Mormon ""Seminary"" disguised as ""Released Time"" cannot be allowed to control the culture in Utah's public schools any longer!  If ""Released Time"" is going to continue, each school needs to make sure each student and their caregivers are aware of ""Released Time"", the other options available and how to start their own ""Released Time"" groups.

I am having a hard time finding a footing in a career as a developer. Graduated with an Associate's Degree with a high GPA 3.7 w/ Honors, more then a few projects started/completed on GitHub, and I have one coop work term completed as a Test Analyst for a bank. Test Analyst was a QA/Tech Support role for stock traders/stock trader software. Also a weird half coop as a jr developer that I was terminated from I won't go into much detail, but this coincided on my last day of probation, and I completed a full-stack POS terminal (using C#, .NET, HTML/CSS, and JQuery) the day I was terminated and I can't put this on my resume because of being fired I feel or get a reference.  
I can't find a job to save my life currently. I have bought Cracking the Coding Interview and have read a good portion. Applying to about 5-10 jobs a day through my schools career site, indeed, Angel, TalentEgg, Glassdoor, and other various job boards, for entry level and internship roles. 

ANY ADVICE? I feel totally f*cked, even though I know I took a lot of steps in the right direction and excelled beyond a lot of class peers in terms of understanding concepts. I have been unemployed since that last jr software dev job which was almost 2 months ago now. What gives in this market, I am by no means a unicorn developer and I am not looking to work in a crazy unicorn start up, just looking for experience and a job.

My fear is that its because I don't have a degree and that I don't have any dev intern experience. No one gives ppl a chance these days?

INFO: Toronto based, good resume and cover letter, not desperate but finding this post-grad process insanely hard."
4yxa7c,2,2016-08-21,[X-Post from r/linguistics] Linguistic Experiments with iPads?,Buecherlaub,compling,https://www.reddit.com/r/compling/comments/4yxa7c/xpost_from_rlinguistics_linguistic_experiments/,"Hi!

Currently I'm doing an internship at an linguistic institute and they assigned me to a project about language acquisition, which is great!

The thing is, the team is thinking about a new method/experiment using an iPad, instead of more ""classic"" experiments using eye tracking or in-person experiments. I've already read some articles and papers about using iPads to collect data, but, and here's my problem, the team wants to create their own test.

This means that we have to or develop an iPad App for our experiment (which is more or less impossible, given that my team's and my coding abilities are quite limited) or we have to use an existing App and maybe modify it a little bit.

As I was searching the Internet for information I came across http://www.paradigmexperiments.com/index.html which seems perfect, the only thing is, that it is quite expensive and I still have to speak with the head of the team about the budget of the project.

My question now is if someone of you guys know any App we could use, or if anyone knows something like paradigm but a little less expensive?

Or if anyone has experience in using iPads as a experimental tool?

I would be happy about any information or help you could provide.

Thanks alot!

We have both moved on and both of us are dating someone new and are very happy with our current relationships. It wasn't a messy break up so we  still hang out with our mutual friend group and that worked out great at the beginning but I have been feeling more and more disconnected to them since they are closer to my ex than me. The situation got worst when  I recently reconnected with my best friend from high school and begin inviting her to hang outs because she knew them too. She have been getting closer to that friend group more and more while I have been getting disconnected more and more with them. What really brought me down was when I found out that she was going on vacation with them and they didn't even consider inviting me even though the vacation(where to go and the airbnb for it) was my idea. I basically plan the vacation; picking places we can go and the airbnb house. All that was missing was when we were going. I must admit, in our relationship I was usually the more shy and quiet one and I am usually busy with school work, internship, and studying; But I was free on the days that they were going. My current boyfriend told me to ignore them and just keep on working hard on my study and career but I still feel betrayed. This happened before and I got very suicidal and depressed from it since I felt all my friends left me at that moment. I was wondering if anyone can give me any advice on how to handle this? Thank you and sorry for the long post.

tldr: my ex and I both have mutual friends who we both hang out with but they have been getting more disconnected with me recently and now they are going on vacation without inviting me even though I was the one who suggested it. "
4yxbkb,1,2016-08-21,[EVENT] Improving education in Taiwan,ParkJiSung777,GlobalPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/4yxbkb/event_improving_education_in_taiwan/,"Taiwan is currently facing an education crisis. Our students are some of the brightest, but face the problem of creativity among other things. Thus, we will take appropriate actions in all levels of education.

#Preschool

Preschool will become mandatory from ages 1-4. Preschool will now take the American ""Montessori"" preschool method. This is in hope that children will become competitive at a young age.


#Elementary School

Elementary School will become mandatory at 5 years old. We'll improve our elementary schools by adding more electives specifically tailored to a specific profession. This is to gather interest from students to take a specific course. The main classes will consist of Mandarin, music, math, science, and history. We will expand our language classes to included Japanese, Korean, German, French, Spanish, Arabic, and Hindi, while keeping English classes. Things such as Singapore math, American STEM and Common Core, and others will be placed to help students think outside the box. Students will choose what general career path to take, such as Medicine or Law. Then, at the end of Elementary School, they will take an exam to see what Junior High that is tailored to their career pat they will take.

Junior High

Students will now go to a technical school that is tailored to their career path.  They will still have an basic education, but with electives specially to their career path. Singapore math, American STEM and Common Core, and others will continue to be prevalent in their school life. At the end of Junior High, they will choose a specific path-such as patent law or Anesthetist-to continue with in High School. They will no longer take the entrance exam for high school, but go to the schools that specialize in their career path.

High School

Students will be following the specific career path they chose in Junior High. They will have training and specializing in their career path. For example, if you take the Cardio surgeon path, that's what you will be practicing. The government will partner with other Taiwanese companies to provided each and every student intern opportunities to use their new skills in the real world. They will still have basic class and electives. Students must stay until they are 18 years old. Singapore math, American STEM and Common Core, and others will continue to be prevalent in their school life.

Higher Education

We will make school free of charge. However, you must pass an entrance exam and interview to enter in. They will be continuing what they did in High School, but with greater intensity and harder subjects. Singapore math, American STEM and Common Core, and others will continue to be prevalent in their school life. They will still have basic class and electives. The Taiwanese government has partnered up with prominent Taiwanese companies such as Luxgen, Garmin, HTC, I-Mei, and others to ensure that every graduate will have the chance to have a job.

4yxbvg,10,2016-08-21,I have never been in a relationship and this sub is tearing me apart,scaredofcheating,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/4yxbvg/i_have_never_been_in_a_relationship_and_this_sub/,"I am 21 years old and have never been in a relationship, but my whole life I have been a hopeless romantic. It is probably due to watching too many over-the-top romantic Bollywood movies (I am Indian), but I have always imagined that I would suddenly meet a girl and become head-over-heels in love with her and would want to spend the rest of my life acting like a fool to make her happy. I know that is completely unrealistic, and actual relationships probably do not end this way, but I was always hopeful that it might happen to me. I have recently been reading /r/relationships and I think it has given me good insight into what a real, healthy  relationship looks like, but to be completely honest it made me even more excited about what would happen to me in the future. 

A few weeks ago I was browsing /r/random and ended up on this subreddit, and I don't know why I stayed but I couldn't stop reading all of the posts here ... morbid curiosity I guess. To be completely honest this subreddit gives a very unique look into affairs, and while I do not agree with having an affair I understand why a lot of the members here decided to have one, and I honestly do feel bad about the situation a lot of you are in. 

Lately, however, I have been obsessing about infidelity. Now, instead of imagining being in a happy relationship I suddenly start imagining that I caught her cheating and I feel the pit in my stomach, as if it actually happened to me. I have even started making up ridiculous scenarios in my head, like one where I come back from work or something to surprise her and set up a romantic evening for her, and she walks into the house kissing my best friend and I am just standing there not knowing what to do; or maybe I go to visit her at work and I see her with a co-worker and my heart stops. What's even worse is that I started my first internship this summer, and whenever I stay a bit overtime it reminds me of all of the stories I have read where spouses become distant and they don't see each other that much anymore, so one decides to have an affair to cope. It has gotten to the point where I can't even focus on work and I start reading the infidelity posts on /r/relationships instead, and every time I read them it breaks my heart, as if it is actually happening to me. I don't even know why I keep on doing this, maybe I'm just a bit masochistic; but I feel like I have completely lost all hope in relationships. I no longer daydream about my movie romance because every time that thought comes into my head I suddenly start imagining that I caught her cheating. I see me crying and her crying, apologizing and begging me to hear me out, but I just stand there because I don't know what to do or what to say; it's like I even feel her regret of having an affair. Sometimes I remind myself that a lot of affairs are due to deteriorating relationships originally, and that I would do everything in my power to make sure that would never happen to me, but then I remember some of the posts here like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/3mydvq/women_how_many_of_you_have_pretty_decent_husbands/), where people seem to be in happy relationships but still cheat, or how much some people miss their affair partners and describe how wonderful they are, and I feel like everything is a lost cause. I want to feel like how everyone here does with their affair partner with my future wife, and she feels the same way about me, but now I feel like that can never happen to me. It's fucking ridiculous because I haven't even BEEN in a relationship yet, and now it's like I already have trust issues and I don't want to start one feeling like this.

I know that is probably the absolute worst subreddit to post this in, and everyone comes here to stop hearing things like this, but it has been bothering me for so long I feel like I needed to get it off my chest. I honestly don't know why I keep on obsessing about this in particular; it has happened to me in the past where I read something and my heart starts beating really fast and I cannot stop thinking about for months. Hopefully I will get over this feeling eventually too, but I feel like this time I really need to talk to someone about it. I just want to become a hopeless romantic again :(. "
4yxlo3,10,2016-08-21,Should I choose accounting or CS/engineering? And which one would be a better career for high-functioning aspergers individuals?,Career_to_Become,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4yxlo3/should_i_choose_accounting_or_csengineering_and/,"I am at a cross roads deciding what I would enjoy. I like math, science, and being able to learn things that related to my own ability to learn quicker and faster. But I have a learning disability so a homework that takes someone 1-hour to do takes me 4-5 hours unless I have done something similar in the past. I also enjoy financial planning and stock watching, as well as reselling on ebay. 

I have built computers, troubleshooted information, built a website, modded games. I tend to break part consoles and repair them, then sell them. Though I do not know if I could finish the schooling and get a competitive engineering job while accounting seems more safe and secure (for outside hobbies).  

According to my research so far: 

Accounting Pros - 

* Ability to work in most cities 

* Everyone needs an accountant 

* Flexibility, high time off in non-peak hours 

* Can get any business job 

* Can start your own business 

* Large growth 

* Once you get public experience, your skill set will be in demand in almost any industry 

Accounting Cons -

* Long hours in public

* Dealing with business students 

* Not really ""passion-driven"" industry

* The work atmosphere can be more toxic 

* More credentials are needed (CAP, Masters). The schooling is less for education and more for work-related information. 

-------------------
Engineering Pros - 

* Ability to think, problem solve, and relate to the world

* Engineering students are usually some of the best and brightest to work with and they can push you to learn new things 

* Higher pay, lower hours are potentially easier to attain 

* Life long passion for learning if successful 

* Once you get a job, your skill set will be demanded in almost any organization unless you are put into a dead-end position 

Engineering Cons -

* Slow growth for entry level positions leaves many flooding into computer related fields 

* Dealing with engineering professors and risk failing, dealing with arrogant engineers

* Potentially low GPA metric means lower chances for scholarships, jobs, internships.

* A fear of failure and causing someone to die. Though they tend to compensate by over-estimating EVERYTHING from what I read. 

* The work atmosphere can be static without direction

4yxxcc,10,2016-08-21,Career change from chef to IT role,hiya19922,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4yxxcc/career_change_from_chef_to_it_role/,"Hello, kind people. So basically I'm a 24-year-old chef. I'm on a degree course in my second year(BSc Applied Computing degree. http://www.stir.ac.uk/undergraduate-study/course-information/courses-a-to-z/school-of-natural-sciences/applied-computing/)

So I have gained an HNC in Software Development (will gain an HND after the second year) and a vendor certificate. Plus most importantly I love what I'm learning. I absolutely love the whole debugging code and trying to get it to work. It makes it difficult to sometimes go into work, to be honest.

My question is I don't know if my current job has many transferable skills related to Software Development which actually scares me. Do you think this is so? Also, would you in my position try to leave the world of cheffing for a more techy job before looking for an internship/future Software job? (My only worry with this option is it's quite difficult to find any local jobs in admin/helpdesk work and I don't feel qualified at all for even the lowest tier of IT positions)

I'm going through local software companies and emailing them about the prospect of getting some work experience days at a few them. My course has a mandatory summer work experience between 3rd and 4th year but I thought it'd be good for me and my CV to get some before looking for internships.

Plus over the next few months, I've made a detailed list of goals and aims when it comes to coding and that to try and build a little portfolio of programs. Also, I've booked an appointment at my universities careers centre to discuss my CV and gain their insight.

TLDR: Worried I have no skills anyone will want and at 24 it'll be a hard to slog to get those skills."
4yy0n5,2,2016-08-21,My [26/F] GF broke up with me [27/M] on Wednesday. Part of me feels lost at the moment. LDR for 1.5 yrs,Emccle7,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4yy0n5/my_26f_gf_broke_up_with_me_27m_on_wednesday_part/,"So this whole relationship starts with a dinner party in the summer of 2015. I met this girl (She's 26 and I'm 27). We hit it off over our obsession of Breaking Bad and laughing over the numerous amount of people who bought $2 wine to this party. As we started hanging out more she was offered a scholarship to Univ of Iowa for the MFA program they have. I have never done long distances before. But I was open to the idea because I liked the vibe of this girl and saw a future with her. The idea of moving to Iowa City kind of popped up right around the time she was leaving Baton Rouge (Late June). At the time, I was working odd jobs and was kind of getting tired of the scene around here. So, I said ""I'm open to the idea of moving up there as a possibility. Soon after she left I got hired as fundraising/recruitment coordinator at a local hospital. Not exactly what I wanted to be doing right out of college. But it pays the bills and they promised to reimburse my masters degree once I work 6 mos.

During the Fall things got more serious. Especially after she invited me to her best friends wedding in Tennessee. We also visited Atlanta for NYE where our first major argument went down. Basically while I was showering in our hotel room. She went through my phone and found messages from a female co-worker that she deemed to be inappropriate. I'll admit that the conversation could look sketchy to someone who is unfamiliar with my work environment. But nothing was going on with this chick and I. In my job, when you spend that much time with people on the road. You kind of have conversations that to the outside eyes may look a certain way when they are not. (This would be one of two times that she went into my phone without permission btw . During a Saint Pat's day party she went thru my phone and covered a text conversation from February 2015 and in her mind believes that it took place in 2016. She was pretty drunk and made massive scene. Which I don't even know how to explain) Nevertheless, I started to really hunt for jobs in Iowa City and the surrounding areas . My SO started to look for apts in the area and soon found somewhere to live. I never experienced this before. But apparently finding rental space in Iowa City is a difficult move and people start figuring out things for the next fall way more quickly than when I attended LSU . Needless to say, we signed a lease and I was really hoping for an interview to pop up soon.

Basically the job prospects in Iowa City and the surrounding areas aren't exactly amazing now. I applied to 20-30 jobs that were similar or better than the one I have now. Many of them gave me the typical ""you lack experiences"" line. In that time I told my SO that moving to Iowa City in August looked like a uncertain situation. She would kind of brush my statements off and still act like I was moving there in August. One night (I believe in late May) I literally had to tell her point black that it would be wise to entertain the idea of a backup plan just in case August 1st didn't work out as planned. Over the course of Summer16 I visited Iowa City three separate times (One time involved a mix of St.Louis for our anniversary). The first visit went fine until the night before I was going to drive back to BR. She said that we needed to talk about things. Basically she believed that I should quit my job in BR and move to Iowa City because it would be a fresh start and that I would eventually find something to do there. I openly told her that this would be a shaky plan because what happens if I don't find something and we are left with months of rent and bills to pay for. She responded with ""I can cover the financial situation for 2 or 3 months"". That entire deal seems like a red flag in my mind. In no way did I think that was a good idea. Basically she didn't like my answers and we ""broke up"" that night. I say it that way because roughly two weeks later we visited STL together for our anniversary and a concert. Which brings me to the month of July. I thought things were slowly coming into place for her folks to help her out with her rent. That was proven to be wrong when she messaged me one day after asking ""What do you want to do about paying the rent?"". Personally I have no problem helping my significant other pay for some things. But asking someone to pay $460 a month (total amount is $960 a month with two cats) on a place they do not live is absurd to me. Along with the fact I have a car note and insurance to pay for.

Nevertheless, we got into a screaming match and she felt that I was ""throwing her under the bus"". I took some time over the weekend and decided that it was kind of **** up to leave her hanging for a full months rent with 15 days before her move in. So I took a part of my tax return and paid my portion of the rent. That's when her mood seemed to change and the she started to talk about ""Whether or not I was going to come up to Iowa City to help her move in?"". So I drove up to Iowa City and helped her move in. Like before, our ability to communicate face to face really isn't a problem. But the morning I was about to leave she asked ""Are we going to talk about things?"". We talked and I explained I was willing to help her. She responded with ""Well I don't really want your help because I don't want you to hold it over my head and make me feel like I should get on my knees and praise you for doing so"". Which I consider a slap in the face and kind of carried over to our last argument. Basically a week after I visited her in IC. My best buddy asked me to go to a beach volleyball tournament in Destin FL. On that trip I didn't really communicate with her that often because I was playing in a tournament and slightly upset about her comments at the tail end of the Iowa trip. Saturday night after wrapping things up and having drinks with the group. I saw on her instagram that she took some selfie and a few of the comments by her undergrad friends kind of **** me off. So I sent a ""nice photo..."" comment to her. I really don't know why I said that to her. I do know that it was meant as a sarcastic jab in somewhat of dickish way. Anyways, that sparked her asking ""Why are you being mean?"", ""What did I do to you"" etc.
I kind of blew her off the following Sunday. Mostly because I knew I was in the wrong for the comment. That Monday I apologized and on Tuesday I kind of explained why I was said what I said (which again, I admit was pretty **** stupid and **** to say). She then jumped to the conclusion that I was at the beach trying to sleep with other girls and that she really didn't care anymore. I called her and basically talked the conversation off the ledge because that wasn't what the trip was about whatsoever. Our conversations seemed to be getting back on track when the flooding in Louisiana started. Then the work week began and I swear it felt like a rollercoaster as far as communication goes. I didn't talk to her much on Monday until night time. Then on Tuesday I texted her and it was only when I mentioned ""Can we talk about our communication"" that she replied. Later that evening I knew she wasn't getting off her server shift until late. So I sent her a text saying that ""I know that things can't change overnight. But I feel like our communication is hot &amp; cold at times"". She responded back to me at midnight asking for a photo album back (Something she gave to me as anniversary present). I called her and it was fairly clear by her speech that she wasn't sober. By the end of our conversation, she made the comment ""That was a **** move on my part. You can keep the album"".

Which brings me the mother of all blow up breakups over the phone. Wednesday, I texted her ""Good morning"" and didn't receiver a text back until about noonish which stated ""At some point today we should talk about things"" followed by ""I wasn't sober and I didn't want to say what I needed to"". So I talked to her during my lunch break and it was basically started off with a yelling rant for about 30-40 mins. She basically said that for the first 7 months of our relationship she felt that she was doing something wrong. But that the incident in ATL changed how she felt about the situation because it was clear that I wasn't fully invested. Then the conversation floated over to how the only way that she would believe that I ""evolved and really wanted to be with her"". I'm going to attempt to give the cliffnotes: But she also went on to say that I caused her anxiety to spike/was the blame for her losing 20 lbs this year, That a guy at her new serving job followed his GF to Iowa City and now has an internship while he waits tables (She deems this as making it work and doing whatever it takes for the relationship. Finally she explained that at her orientation her colleagues kept asking her about how my move to Iowa was going? She replied with ""He isn't coming"" and they immediately said that it was horse **** that she was left with $900+ apt on her own. Furthermore it's clear that she has not spoken to her parents about being a cosigner or helping her with her rent. As she said ""Working four jobs and going to school will suck. But I just have to put on my big girl panties and do it because I can't trust you to be dependable"".

By no means was I perfect throughout this relationship. But I did see a future with her. Late Friday night, I decided it would probably be a good idea to block her on all social media platforms. Mainly so I don't look at her pages. Also, I wrote an email to the apartment complex in Iowa about removing my name from the lease agreement. I don't feel like I should be responsible for a place I do not live with a person that doesn't want to date/communicate with me anymore.

tl;dr: Broke up on Wednesday, She wanted me to move to Iowa so we could live together. I couldn't find a job in the area. Part of me feels like I lost my soulmate/best friend. But the other part of me feels like I did the right thing by not just running to Iowa and quitting my job."
4yy1wj,11,2016-08-21,Hey /r/techtheatre! What are some of your Go-To Stage cleaning tips and tricks?,opportunemoment,techtheatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/techtheatre/comments/4yy1wj/hey_rtechtheatre_what_are_some_of_your_goto_stage/,"Hello all,

Tomorrow evening I'm hosting the very first class for the incoming group of high school interns at my theatre. I've chosen the focus of this class as basic stage cleaning: sweeping, mopping, and other assorted cleaning and organizing. Please allow me my excitement for this topic--I feel a lot of folks take it for granted that everyone knows how to sweep and mop effectively, but I often find even 30-year-old ""professionals"" skimping out on this basic and important task.

What tips, tricks, best practices, or other cool know-hows do you have as far as cleaning a deck and/or backstage wings? Even and especially notes that you think would be common sense--I know I get surprised more than I expect when people overlook what, to me, are glaringly obvious notes.

As an example, here are some notes I'm planning to hit:

* favor soft-bristle brooms whenever available, and especially with hard-bristle brooms, try not to attack the stage too ferociously--leave the small dirt to the dust mop
* when beginning a sweep, start from the area of highest traffic (ex. the stage door or the bottom of the stairwell to the dressing rooms) and end with lowest
* use only hot or warm water to mop; add soap or other cleaning solutions only on a case-by-case basis
* when mopping stage, start from center and go off--this way the cleanest water is reserved for the performance area
* mop in a figure-8 pattern and switch sides of the mop head every few passes, mopping not more than ~64 ft^2 before rinsing and wringing the mop head again
* change out the water in your mop bucket when it turns gray
* towel mopping with a push broom: it's a thing! also make sure in turn to clean these towels and your mop heads and buckets
* don't overlook cleaning your shop vac filter and drum, as well--and know to check your hose for debris
* don't forget to clean corners and under stuff"

I had a series of panic attacks that lasted an entire evening and totally screwed my brain up.  I have been diagnosed BP MDD Panic Disorder and GAD.  My brain is just broken.  I moved back home for more intensive therapy and hopefully get meds figured out.

To add to my anxiety, I am supposed to be going to Italy in three weeks, for 5 weeks, for an internship.  I am scared shitless and don't know if I can do it.  When I'm not depressed and lying in bed all day tingling with anxiety wishing I was dead, I am pretty charming and happy go lucky.

I am sick of living between depressive episodes and having to move back home to get better.  I'm just really struggling thinking that this is my life..."

I graduated from college a year ago this month with a bachelors in finance. I've held several  finance scholarships, participated in a handful of serious banking internships and graduated top of my class but.. Lately I've had trouble figuring who I really am and what I really want? 

I've been with my daddy for 3 years now and we have a 24/7 Ddlg relationship. Now that I've worked for a year straight as an associate lender at a big bank , long hours, and taking on more serious responsibilities at work.. I've almost felt like I've lost my baby girl side. My boyfriend and I are rarely in that ""little space"" mode at all anymore.. Probably because I'm always so stressed at work and bring it home with me. 

I guess I'm just trying to figure how who I am and what makes me happy. I love my bubbly baby girl side but at work everyone (including myself) is always so serious. It's tearing me down. 

I'm just ranting but, if anyone else has had to deal with this.. How can I make things better? I want to feel like myself again. Maybe this industry isn't for me? Maybe I need to make an extra effort to get into my little space? 

I feel so lost.

Help from current and Alumni EE students,jeremyolar,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/4yy9sq/electrical_engineering_concentrations_help_from/,"Hi! I'm an EE Major and still have yet to decide what concentration of EE that I will look into. As there are different 14 concentrations listed on the website. 

I narrowed down my choices to the following:

-Analog Circuits

-Digital VLSI Circuits

-Embedded Computing Systems

-Power Electronics

-Controls

I read the reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/3v6ra3/electrical_engineering_concentrations/

I believe there is a high number of EE Major in reddit and I would like to ask a few questions: 
*How difficult are the classes?

*Is there a high chance that you will sleep overnight in school?

*Who are the professors/advisors that I can talk to about this?

*Among the 5 concentrations, are there any 
professors that is really stressful and are there really good professors?(From what I know, James Peckol will 'break your fingers' and Scott Hauck for EE271 is a really loveable professor)

*If there are any graduates willing to answer, How hard is it to get a job?(with respect to the concentrations you have taken)

*Is internship programs/ research programs easy to find ?

I would really appreciate if anyone (an EE major) would answer this questions(with experience and respective to the concentrations you have taken). 

As of right now, I do not know which one interests me the most(from reading the description of classes and each concentration)
So Help would be really appreciated
Thank You"

To Whom this May Concerns:

Since the beginning of my nursing education, and now into my nursing practice, my aim is to be a nurse who can provide the best quality of care at a high level of intensity and skill. I believe that the philosophy of St.Joseph’s Medical Center would not only align with my own, but would challenge me to continue to strive for excellence in my nursing craft. Improving the quality of life of my clients is my passion. I am motivated through generating results and using evidence based research to improve my knowledge as a nurse. 

In my present role as RN supervisor, I coordinate and direct care to individual and families using a holistic approach. I collaborate with a group of 20 nursing staff and other members of the healthcare team to care for chronic and acutely ill patients. Most of the time I provide leadership and support for staff and patients, but I also provide direct patient care on a regular basis. This position enables me to have experience in caring for a diverse number of patients with multiple diagnosis &amp; treatments, including those with COPD, infections, amputations, and other medical conditions. In this fast paced environment, I am constantly refining my clinical judgment, reviewing patient specific disease processes, and self-reflecting on my level of care to consistently provide excellent patient care. 

While my current position is not considered acute care, I consistently strive to grow as a better nurse, as evident by my certifications in ALCS, PALS, NIHSS, and EKG monitoring. I am also actively pursuing the NRP and TNCC certifications. I am experienced with IV's, wound care, CVCs, PICC lines, interdisplinary team collaboration, and developing plan of care. I am confident my evolving clinical skills, collaborative readiness, and positive receptiveness to feedback would be a great asset to the nursing team and department. My certifications, education and experience will enhance your organization. 

I believe that I would be a great addition to the St. Joseph’s and Dignity Health team. I would be grateful for an opportunity to meet with you and discuss further about my application and qualifications for this position. 
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration

4yymw3,1,2016-08-21,F4M A few scenes!,DPPAPPRP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4yymw3/f4m_a_few_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."

I have joined a club that is related to my major and specifically what I want to pursue (fashion merchandizing and marketing). I know that internships are very important, so much to say that it is way more important than GPA (which I agree). But with the current situation I am in, would club activity look good enough on resume? Ofcourse it is not as fancy schmancy as internship but I am doing what I feel like its best for me, but I also feel like there is something missing.

* Would not consider myself *strong* at any language, although I am decent with at least two
* Not at a ""strong"" CS school

I feel pretty competent in my Javascript knowledge and I have also worked on a few projects and put together a website.  I don't yet feel confident enough to apply to a junior role, but I do think an internship type role would be ideal.  My other options would be taking out a loan to go to some sort of boot camp or go back into accounting (I have experience/education in accounting) and continue to practice programming on the side.

I'm just getting discouraged because a lot of the internships I see are for CS students or recent grads.  Should I apply anyways?"
4yz20r,4,2016-08-22,Should I go the IC route while also seeking therapy?,NatalieSilvers,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4yz20r/should_i_go_the_ic_route_while_also_seeking/,"I apologize for the word pasta and long text post that's ahead, I'm slightly drunk and trying to work through some thoughts right now, and need advice from someone that's not myself.

 

So, the local therapist that takes my insurance is not able to have our first meeting until September 11th (Which actually is kind of nice, an appointment on a sunday, which works really well with my work schedule :D) however, I am kind of thinking of going to an IC clinic and at least getting on anti androgens. I guess I'm just looking for some advice from someone more sane than I am. 

I'll provide a little bit of backstory. 

Aside from bouts with depression since I was 15/16 years old, I didn't really have any issues until I was 18 years old, and started to question my gender identity. Sure, when I was younger I would crossdress, but at that point it was mostly just a sexual thing. 

Before I was to start college, I had a mental breakdown and ended up dropping out. In the year that followed, I was in a very dark place in my life. Within that year, my crossdressing had gone from being what felt like a fetish to being something more. I  finally started to put the pieces together of why I never liked body, and came to realization that I was trans. I know it's cliche, but when I was dressed up, I had finally felt a happiness I had never known before.

During this time, I had started college again a year later, and was doing a less than great job in my classes, due to depression and probably dysphoria. I would stay in my bed all day. At this point, I was sure I wanted to transition, and had even contacted my school's student health service for resources to help me. I came out to one of my closest friends, and we even went to a bar on it's goth night with me wearing a dress (still one of the happiest nights in my life that I can recall). I was fully prepared to start a transition, I just needed to start therapy. 

Fast forward a few months, and it's my second semester in college. Even with my abysmal performance in my first semester, I am able to obtain a wonderful position as an IT co-op doing some net admin stuff for a great company. I decided to focus on work and school, and life is going much better. My feelings of gender dysphoria all but disappear. Though I realize now, I was just subconsciously pushing away those thoughts so I could focus on what felt more important to myself, other than some random bouts of crossdressing, or wearing more female underwear, I had completely forgot about being trans. 

Fast forward to this year, and I somehow managed to graduate with my associates degree after 3 years. Life is pretty stress free now, I have been a full time contractor from said internship since the beginning of the year, and life is going great. However, a few months ago, dysphoria managed to strike again, and all my thoughts from 2013 came rushing back. At one point, I had started to developing an eating disorder, trying to have a more feminine body, (at one point I dropped 7lbs in one week, which is really bad because I'm already on the lower side of a healthy weight for my height) that I've managed to overcome, and now I'm at a point in my life where I realize that I need to transition. 

Again, I apologize for the word pasta, but my question is, do I sound crazy for wanting to go to an IC clinic to get on hormones, while at the same time talking to a therapist to get myself into a better mental state, or is that a bad idea?


TL;DR, I know I need to transition, and going through a therapist will take a while. is it a bad idea to go to an IC clinic and get on hormones while at the same time talking to a therapist to work out not only being trans but other things in my life?

Thank you very much to anyone who reads this.

Also, I'm really sorry for all of my rambling, this is much longer than it needed to be."

4yz95r,4,2016-08-22,"Wandering in circles, need a small nudge to wander elsewhere",onetallmofo89,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4yz95r/wandering_in_circles_need_a_small_nudge_to_wander/,"Hello, I am posting here because I am really lost job wise (27 male north east USA).  I followed a parent's advice because I have made it known that I need to go back to school for something while I am currently working, community college just for a few courses.  

I looked up engineering course work and my ego crumbled the pre-cal (prob still suck hard at math, quick calculations np but non-tangible ideas and thoughts lose me quick), physics (which I think I can pick up) but the rest just felt like maybe I overgeneralized and lost interest real quick.  Maybe it was a naive brief dream, I don't know, but my gut was quiet and did not feel like a huge disappointment a few hours later.

My current job is with the federal government.  The pay is ehh for my age (maybe? high 30's for tri-state).  I started working at this job about a year ago.  It's not permanent and that's ok because I wanted to go back to school during the off-periods.  It's an afternoon-to late evening job so it freed up my mornings but I can't see myself doing this job for another year or career.  Hearing people talk about retirement packages already makes me cringe and gets scared I am going to get trapped here.  I know the younger I am the easier it is to move.

I know this is not really relevant to this subreddit but the desire to find a career path is important because it is spearheaded by my at home life.  My dad had a traumatic brain injury a few years ago, likely bedridden for the rest of his life/minimal conscious state, and I take care of him with my mom and two siblings.  I come home, give him some medicine and help change his diaper after work and wake up in the morning and before work.  Before I got this job, I was doing that all day with my mom from time to time.  I want to get on a more determined career path to help take care of them and it would help my mental and emotional health.  I am a bit binded at home to help but the option to move is there.  I want to be able to go back to school and learn new skills so by the time I finish my family will move or go into more long term care strategy (new home, etc).

I graduated with a bachelors in business administration from a local college.  It was a bland and generalized degree which I never regretted but I feel I should have interned and maybe expanded myself more without the limitations of the course work (more excel skills) but I've gotten over that.

I quite frankly have no freaking idea.  I usually do not get envious at all but just reading and hearing about people on the path to their career or already on the long path of their career goals makes me incredibly envious.  They are likely not working dream like jobs but going to work day to day that you are working the top of your skills and work would feel rewarding for me.  This current job just feels like a very nerdy hobby and my co-workers make me look like an ambitious driven person their yet I am completely lost on the inside.

Interests are reading, video games (though job direction could finally make me quit playing); which im happy for) and watching sports basketball/football/euro soccer and playing basketball and lifting.  

Career/interests (things i like; generalizations I know)
politics - always liked the layers of politics from local to state to federal and the ripple of effects from policy but I just think pol science is too much of a risky major and I don't know if it'll pay even decent in a few years in the field.

Investing/banking - I've liked researching and reading up/discussing IPOs and mergers/acquistions when I can but I don't think I could put the time into it and craze like some people can.  May have missed the career for that seeing as most people my age are now associates or on the long term career path in their respective firms.

Sports - Nike/Jordan/Under Armour would be nice but most corp offices are far off and the skills they were require are a bit tricky but then again a bit lost on me (MBA is out of the question till much more career exp).  Would be cool to work on behalf of them or work for a professional/near professional sports team, being the competitive a-hole I can be sometimes.  Not interested in coaching in any sport.

Insurance underwriting - went on job interviews and briefly worked in some areas but the firms I worked/interviewed for were a bit sketchy.  Open to it because my dad worked in the insurance and his job coincided with underwriters.  

Law - I really like see the loopholes and studying arguments in courts or just in mediation but I have no desire to do law school.  I probably wouldnt have been able to even do well on the LSAT, I just struggle with standardized tests. Really liked intellectually property law but no law school and engineering hinders me on that too

Engineering - I know it's broad but I looked into it but just felt the coursework would be too much for me, listed above the reasons but I could be open to exploring it again in the future.

Pharmaceutical - I had a fam member work for a big company out the in the central USA area but she mainly focused on administrative work and those were where most of her connects were before she retired a few months ago. I would like to explore it more especially coupled with my intellectual property but I think I could only work in this industry thru the business angle and not the science one.

Music - listen to a lot of music, go to a few friends new band concerts but I have no musical talent and don't think a producer or sound engineer is too risky/over-saturated market.  Sigur Ros to Wu Tang to Tool to Isaac Hayes to Tricky to Mozart, I enjoy all types of music but don't see a career or reliable one for me.

Hospital/Health administration - Looked into it briefly and liked it but never really trusted the graduate programs for it and didn't see a lot of courses in non-graduate to get a feel with it.  Didn't want to pay a lot of money for a job that will start off maybe a bit more then what im making now.  Still open but very skeptical of the programs nearby especially seeing it on TV all the time made me more hesitant.  

career/interests (not interested in)

Accounting - good job market but no thanks, brother majoring in it and reading his text books and helping him with his internships have turned me off completely.  Have no desire to explore it or even go to school with it.

Nursing/therapy - too many rehab homes/nursing homes/hospital visits with my dad to really ever have any desire to work in the field; had a lot of bad therapists and nurses - jaded on that industry.  Looked into respiratory therapy but didn't like the career growth and flexibility.

Writer/journalist - I don't like writing. I like reading from time to time but yeah, no - no thanks on writing.  Maybe a hobby, but no desire for a career from either of the two.

Language - I've always been interested in learning languages.  Took Spanish and then German a bit in high school but briefly flirted with both in college and listen to Spanish/German stuff for sports/other things but have no desire to make languages my focal career point.  Always liked languages to open the door to travel further.

There's prob a bit more for both but these are the bread and butter, did not intend to insult any career path or person but these descriptions - just thoughts from a person who's lost and looking thru the abyss. 

I appreciate you reading all of this and I know it's still oversimplified but I just need some guidance.  I don't mind putting the work and doing the work to learn more and go to the career path but it's just finding it.  I'd just love a career/job that I can trust my gut and have everything fall in place after I work towards it (hopefully social life and relationship can get better too, to the next topic! just kidding)  Thanks again for your time and any advice you give.

4yzj8p,0,2016-08-22,Old University figuratively holding me HOSTAGE. HELP!,june_in_july,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4yzj8p/old_university_figuratively_holding_me_hostage/,"I need advice. 

I started my freshman year of college at an out of state university where I didn't do FAFSA/Financial Aid and partly paid a sticker price with the help of my parents to the tune of 14K. I was able to pay off my first semester, but my parents lost their job as I was going into my second semester and I left that University with a 20K debt that was not paid to the school. Unable to pay for my sophomore year, I transferred to an instate community college and took the required classes to be able to get accepted to a top 20 public university. However, I do need to turn in transcripts for admission to the public in-state school, but the old university is holding them until I pay the balance. I'm vigorously trying to pay off my balance with the summer internship I have that pays greatly above minimum wage, but I will only be able to make a dent into that balance due. I'm trying  to get a private school loan from Wells Fargo with a credit score of 670, but my parents can't cosign me because of their bad credit and it kind of sounds like I'm out of luck unless I find a cosigner. I created a FAFSA and have a EFC of about 5100, but I don't know how I will be able to get money to pay off my previous university debt. I'm confident I would be able to get enough financial aid to pay off my debt at my new university.

The conundrum is how I can get a private loan/student loan for the tune of 20K so I can pay off my old university and start new at the new university I was accepted too. Specifically what are my options for a private loan with a mediocre credit score. 

I also know that this is entirely my fault, I depended on my parents but I realized only now that they won't be able to bail me out. 

If it mattered, I am Econ Major/ Comp Sci Minor but hoping to eventually switch that so I can major in Computer Science and minor in Economics. I eventually want to do Quantitative Trading out of undergrad, work for a few years, and then get in MBA. Project Management is also dope. "

So I can get pretty dark and dirty; I'm certainly not going to be shy in abusing you.

[This is my kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/v5UKoBS.png) ; I enjoy degrading and abusing cunts, mother/daughter incest, snuff, fake tits, and being an Alpha Male. I believe that cunts have no rights.

Some scene ideas:

1. Job Interview. I am well known writer and despite my misogyny I received an option to be interviewed for a job at a Feminist magazine. You would play the managing editor, a powerful businesswoman (perhaps even a lesbian), and you are fully aware that I am a misogynist; but your magazine has seen declining sales and you honestly believe that my writing would increase sales. But you have to convince me to join, doing everything you can from increasing my salary, giving me your own office, to offering up your body and those of your very young daughters (ages to be discussed). You increasingly degrade yourself, your employees, underage interns and family until I am the editor and your magazine is no longer feminist.

2. Muscle Humiliation. You are a bodybuilder, with powerful muscles in your arms and thighs. You got large breast implants to continue to show off your feminity, but you are also proud of what you have achieved at the gym. No men ever approach you. Until I come in, an Alpha Male, and just start abusing you and calling you names, squeezing your breasts and suggesting a new gym outfit. You are thoroughly humiliated and come to agree to each of my demands happily, even when I start getting violent.

3. Girls School. You are the Principal of a girls school. The new school year is about to start but you are concerned that your school has been doing terrible in both grades and athletics. You decide that presenting a new image of the school will help, and decide that who better to determine that new image than the man who just moved into the house across the street from the school. You soon realise that this man has his own ideas of how a girls school should look and behave.

4. Fall of a Celebrity. A famous feminist, like Emma Watson or Daisy Ridley, reduced to being a fuckslut. Daisy Ridley could be using social media to promote the latest Star Wars film, gets degraded by a Star Wars nerd, and invites him to the set to prove him wrong. Instead she ends up being his cunt slave."

I always create a timetable commit to it and say to myself ""I'm gonna follow this no matter what circumstances may come"". This lasts for 2-3 days and again i am off the track what should I do in order to stick to a plan permanently and follow it. 
Also, I've come to know the reason for my failure is the lack of discipline.

My timetable is as follows:--
8 AM - 5 PM - College &amp; Internship.
6 PM - GRE studies(I am appearing for GRE on 30th of December).
9 PM - College Studies.
11 PM - Miscellaneous (Like courses on coursera or work related to internship).
12 PM - Goto sleep.

But I hardly follow the above time table also I have a lot of distraction like watching TV shows online or browsing the web or lurking around FB. I want to get rid of all those distraction's and follow only the things stated in my timetable.

Can anyone guide me to overcome this problem?
Thanks for reading."
4yzy2j,3,2016-08-22,Worried I may not be competitive enough for pathology/immunology PhD programs (xpost r/gradadmissions),tripping_right_now,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/4yzy2j/worried_i_may_not_be_competitive_enough_for/,"**TLDR: Recent Med Lab Science graduate worried about competitive application for this cycle. Good GPA, unknown GRE scores, great LORs and SOPs/Research Statement. Worried that the type of person and work that I am is incompatible with the PhD lifestyle. My dream career involves teaching undergraduate students or becoming a science editor/grant editor. Research interests include parasitology, allergies, and IgE-mediated disease states.**

I graduated this May from the University of Vermont’s Medical Laboratory Science program. I passed my board exams and am an American Society of Clinical Pathology certified Medical Laboratory Scientist. I currently work at a monoclonal antibody production company where I began as an intern 2.5 years ago (I’m an employee now).

As the application cycle for this year approaches, frankly I’m terrified that I’m not a competitive enough candidate for PhD programs. I knew early on during my undergrad years that a hospital-based lab tech job was not for me; I have planned for many years to pursue a PhD with the end-goal of being an academic professor/lecturer someday, or a professional editor/grant writer.

I feel very passionately about learning more, developing my laboratory skills, and asking the important questions. I know grad school is not undergrad 2.0; I am mentally prepared to take on graduate school as a profession and learn how to become an independent researcher and academic. But lately, so much self-doubt has been setting in…

My professors in undergrad have encouraged me to apply to top-tier schools: Stanford, UNC-Chapel Hill, Georgetown. I do not believe my application is good enough for these schools, nor do I want to attend institutions like these. I am more interested in the following schools: U Washington, UC Boulder, UC Denver, Dartmouth, UVM, UNH, U Michigan.

My undergrad GPA was a 3.54. I only got 3 C’s in college, all in chemistry/organic chemistry courses. I got A’s in all of my major specific courses (Immunology, Pathology, Microbiology, Genetics, Parasitology, Hematology, etc.)

I have not taken the GREs yet; I am scheduled for October 1st. I did poorly on the SAT and very well on the ACT in high school. I’m going to assume my GRE scores will be average (155V/155Q/5W).

I will have fantastic LORs for my application and a very strong SOP/Research Statement. I am a strong writer and have been told I am very capable at conveying scientific information to an audience. Additionally, I am a decent public speaker and perform well in interviews.

I’m just so worried that I’m not qualified enough for these graduate programs… The average GRE scores/GPA for accepted students at almost all of these programs are 158V/158Q and 3.8, respectively.
I also worry that what I want out of life is incompatible with the PhD I want to pursue…for example, I would like to settle down in a rural area (not a city person). I want to get married and have a child in the next 5 to 10 years. I don’t know if I can compromise traveling the country and living in locations I dislike just to get the job. And I have a SO that I am beginning to plan my life with, and I worry so much about our relationship and going long-distance. I have also learned (basically after reading this sub so much) that the way I like to operate in a lab doesn’t seem to be the way academic labs are run. For example, I’ll put in significantly more week-work hours if it means I don’t have to work the weekend. I am a very team-based worker and enjoy consulting other employees for help/wit questions. I worry that the kind of worker I want to be is incompatible with the realities of being a PhD student.

I am very capable in a laboratory setting and feel confident in my lab skills. A short list of my skills includes: tissue culture, mouse handling/immunizations/euthanasia, PCR, basic gene sequencing, various ELISAs, protein purification, antibody isotyping.

The research I have performed at my lab revolves around the various binding epitopes on coagulation factors that our antibodies bind to and determining whether our antibodies bind to the zymogen or the activated factor. On a personal level, I am highly interested in parasitology and mechanisms of eosinophilia that encompass various helminth infections; I am also interested in the overlap between IgE-mediated allergic reactions and how these may be similar to/different from IgE responses during parasitic infections. Unfortunately I have yet to find a single lab on my list of schools that studies parasitology or allergies.

Any honest opinions about how competitive my application is?"

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

--------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

If you're coming to China through an internship/volunteer/study abroad company like Go Abroad China or CRCC, please stop, take all your money, never give them a dime, and run the other way!

I personally went to Beijing through Go Abroad China and had to pay so much money for 2 months for them to find me an ""internship"" at a shitty company. They promised weekly activities, good living accommodations, and a general overall great experience. But this experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth, one that has left me with a negative image of China in general. The other GAC interns have all said the same thing. We know they pocketed our money and pretty much left us to fend for ourselves in a country we know nothing about and amongst people we do t know how to communicate with. 

I have so many examples I could share but those could easily take a post each, so I will leave this here. 

We are trying to find out how to stop this company's business but that might be a hard thing to do since I heard most of these types of companies are scams.

I’m a junior agent at [Emerald City Literary Agency](https://emeraldcityliterary.com) (ECLA) representing science fiction, fantasy and YA.

 
ECLA was started in November 2015 by founder, literary agent and writer Mandy Hubbard, and we have a fabulous list of authors writing everything from picture books, middle grade and young adult to children’s nonfiction, adult romance and adult science fiction/fantasy. We are a full service, boutique agency located just south of Seattle, though Linda Epstein also acts as our eyes and ears in New York. As an agency we’re in it for the long haul – we represent our client’s careers, not just a single book. We are always looking for new talent – those voices that just absolutely wow us – and I am open to queries, so you can check out [my submission guidelines](https://emeraldcityliterary.com/lindsaymealing) on ECLA’s website.


I got my start in publishing at the beginning of 2015. I was given the amazing opportunity to act as a reader and intern for the fabulous Mandy Hubbard while she was with D4EO Literary Agency. I read manuscripts, wrote reader reports and worked the query inbox (or slush pile as the industry calls it) for nine months before she asked me to join her as the Agency Assistant when she started up her own agency in November of 2015. From there, I began building my list under Mandy’s careful guidance and was promoted to Junior Agent a few months ago, in June!


So that’s a bit about me and ECLA. I’m super excited to answer any questions you have about myself, the agency, publishing, the querying process, agent/client relationships, etc. 


I’ll start answering questions around 10am PST and will continue to do so until 3pm PST. So ask me anything!



* Edit: Thanks for all the questions so far. I'm going to take a quick break but will get back into them soon!
* Edit2: Going to do another 30 minutes of questions (until 4pm PST) before I get back to editing!

So I am thinking about transferring to a large university, like the University of Florida, Florida State, UNC, Georgia, etc,. The reason being, my major is almost useless if I don't go to a major division one university with the best possible internships, because of how competitive it gets. After this full year, my hope is to have between a 3.5 and 4.0 GPA at my current school. If I go to a large D1 school like this, the cost of attendance with out-of-state tuition can get near $40,000, if not more! My parents have recently been making way more money than they ever have ($150k+), and I will get little to no money at all from FAFSA. I personally can't afford this, and my parents recent income has come after a very hard couple of years when I was in junior high school, where they were both bouncing between unemployment and temp jobs because of the recession. My parents don't have the money to help me out yet, and I don't have the money either. My dad has an associates degree and my mom dropped out of UCLA in her third year to move to New York with my dad (dumb decision..), and my grandparents were highly educated (BS from UCLA and MBA from USC) so I won't get any ""first generation college student"" grants/scholarships. With my GPA, how much do you think I can expect to get through scholarships? I really would love to start my Sophomore year at a school like the ones I stated, but I'm not sure I can afford it, and I don't want to waste my degree at a SUNY (not that these aren't great schools, I just don't think I'll get anywhere with a Sports Management degree in central/western New York). If you guys have any experience or advice with academic scholarships and what is required, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you all so much!"

I have an ethics question regarding vaccinations and a febrile seizure call I ran on my paramedic internship.  I'm not sure whether I crossed a line or not.

The patient was 2 years old and had been sick for about 12 hours.  Parents accessed 911 after witnessing a 30 second seizure.  Response time was about 8 minutes.  On arrival the kid was laying on the couch, sluggish but alert.  HR about 160 sinus, RR about 40 with no retractions and clear lung sounds, BP was about 100/p.  Core was hot to the touch and extremities cool, cap refill slightly delayed.  Temp via tympanic thermometer was 104.5, no rashes, bruising, cyanosis, kernigs and brudzinskis both absent, no red flags for abuse, blood sugar normal.  We cooled him down a bit but he stayed pretty sluggish.  However, he was always arousable.

In other words, completely normal febrile seizure.  We started transporting code 2 with Dad in the back, and while I was getting a basic history.  When I asked about childhood immunizations Dad said no, when I asked what he meant he said ""we don't believe in vaccinations.""

 I said OK, and didn't ask any more about it.  

Then I upgraded our transport to code 3 (lights/sirens).

Now, protocols are pretty lenient when it comes to when to upgrading code 3.  The fact that the post-ictal phase was on the longish side at 25 minutes by this point, delayed cap refill, HR stayed high, and the temp stayed very high, I was within protocol.  But the main reason I did it was because of the anti-vaxx stance.

Did I overstep? Most medics (not all) that I've asked about it thought it was fine, but I would like to hear a physician point of view on the situation.

Thanks!"

I interviewed at a couple other places but was rejected, and took this job (I really wanted to stay in the town that I went to uni in, at least for a few more years). There aren't an incredible amount of tech companies here, so take that into account. At first I was kind of disappointed with the environment, as there are only a few other local people at the company (and I'm the only tech person in the office), but I've come to realize that it could be pretty sweet--the main guy I work with (who works remotely) is very understanding and detail-oriented, and I've definitely learned a lot from working with him so far (I had no internships during my time at uni). I can also work from home a couple days a week, and the work is pretty flexible. 

That said, a few thoughts linger in my mind. I a currently working hourly, and when I was asked for my “desired pay” I stated $32/hr (based roughly off the average starting CS major pay of ~60k). I expected my boss to counter-offer, but he went with that number without any sign of rebuttal. I don’t get any benefits, so in retrospect I feel like I should have now gone for a higher number, but at the time I thought I was high-balling anyways. I feel like after another couple of months, I could negotiate a salary, but the flexibility that the job has offered so far has been awesome. 

Second, working with one other developer is definitely a smaller team than I ideally wanted. Any tips for maximizing the amount of learning/growth at this job in terms of long-term career development? I could see myself working here for 1-2 years as is, although I expect the amount of developers at the company to grow in that time, which would maybe make me want to stay (even though I will probably want to leave the town by then)."

One thing about this company is that it was started by students from my university (the founder is now 25) and they tend to get a lot of part time student workers to do in-house printing (easy manual work for their niche). These students are probably paid on the lower end near minimum wage. 

Currently, the company is using a web development firm to manage changes to their website, but they have become frustrated with the time it takes to make changes and want to switch to in house development. I killed the pre-interview questions as well as the interview, and I was told to expect a call this afternoon. 

Pretty great, right? My problem is that I am worried that they will seriously low-ball me when it comes to pay. Especially since the position (found through my school) was labeled as an ""internship"" even though I was told to be ready to work hard, and even to be ready to answer the phone at night. I'm willing to work my ass off, I'm confident I can juggle it with school well, but I'm not going to be willing to do it for some lowball price like $12/hr. 

Wondering what my best course of action should be going forward. What sort of money is acceptable for me to work for? What's the best way to bring this up to the employee that will be calling me?

How do I get over this?,blue_teapot8284,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4z22s5/i_was_bullied_by_my_roommate_at_home_and_at_work/,"The person I moved in with in May (she's 28, I'm 24F and we're in the same Masters program) basically went full on crazy on me within 2 months of living together. She has moved out but not after actively working on making my life hell and stymieing my ability to get work done and network at the internship we both had this summer. 

It started out with her asking if we could not eat lunch together at work and have separate friends. I did the feel like I could say no, you have to include me but it was really weird. She escalated from there by making me feel uncomfortable at home. She was incredibly  passive aggressive. She'd be loud when I'd try to go to sleep, take over when whole fridge and freezer, and told me it was making her physically sick to live with someone else. She made me agree to a bathroom schedule where for a certain amount of time I couldn't even knock or get something. We'd previously been on different schedules but she started getting ready for and leaving for work at the same time I had been. She would also leave the kitchen a mess so I wouldn't be able to use it unless I cleaned up after her or she'd start cooking at the same time, or complain about being starving. She also set up two routers in the apartment - one network that I could access and one I couldn't. We paid for 30 mbps but I never measured more than 5. I had a hard time even watching YouTube videos but she had no problems streaming in HD. When I asked if she also had problems with the Internet she would say she was also really frustrated with how slow it was. I'm pretty sure she was throttling my bandwidth with the two router setup. She also wanted to talk about her life all the time and was constantly looking for reassurance of her own worth and that we were friends and that I was impressed by her. She would frequently send me we need to talk texts and then make me feel like it was my fault that it made me panic and that I should trust her to be reasonable. 
At work, she would whisper about me to other people in our cube neighborhood, tell other interns that I was obsessed with her and was always trying to get invited to do things, always wanted to know where she was. (I found this out because another intern at work told me about what was going on and said she was sorry I had to put up with this girl). She made me feel guilty because she was being paid less than I was (it was a research job and I have a BS in a hard science with considerable research experience and she does not).

Everything came to a head when she told me she was moving out to live by herself. I was overjoyed. We went out for a beer together to discuss but it turned out later she didn't give me all of the information I needed. She told me she had found a place and was moving out within the week and wanted to find someone to take over the rent immediately. I said I wouldn't agree to anyone I didn't have the chance to meet. She sent a snippy email saying of course she would and was offended that I didn't think better of her. 
I interviewed 9 people and chose a Fulbright scholar who was abroad because I thought she needed a place as soon as possible. My roommate did not tell me the building required a credit check and wanted me to tell this girl no because she was taking too long to respond to things and she was worried her international status. My roommate went behind my back to demand a commitment from this girl that she would start paying even before the paperwork was finished because she didn't want to pay double rent. In her defense, we live in a very expensive city. 

The girl backed out because she felt like I hadn't been upfront with her about the steps necessary or when she would have to start paying. My roommate confronted me at work in front of our coworkers and accused me of trying to screw her over, being dishonest and tried to get me to agree to take over her portion on the rent by 2 weeks out because I was taking too long to find someone. On my dad's advice, I contacted HR because I couldn't take her anymore. 

She was instructed to leave me alone at work and they moved my cube to be away from the her. I also told the director of our graduate program  (it's very small) and requested we not be put in the same groups for group projects. 

I'm really worried that she's going to besmirch me and prevent me from connecting to the people in our program. I'm afraid that she's going to yell at me in front of people. I know that she's not particularly well liked in our program and I know there are people who will stick up for me (my significant other was with me through all of this and also wants to keep me safe from this person), but this entire thing had been really overwhelming because my mother was BPD and there were a lot of similarities between her behavior and my mother's. 

What do I do from here? How do I let this go and move on from my life?"
4z23yz,16,2016-08-22,Managing hospital insulin,DamnYellowKnight,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/4z23yz/managing_hospital_insulin/,"I'm very sorry in advance if these are stupid questions, or if this is the wrong place to ask. I'm a new intern and basically trying to still get a feel for the right way to make certain decisions when making orders.

(1) Right now, I'm on night float, which has me handling lists of patients I barely know, and one thing that comes up a lot from the nurses is insulin. Should they give it, should they give less, etc.

I have a resident who taught me during my first month that if a patient is going for a procedure and is NPO from midnight, that we should cut their long-acting insulin by half for that one night. But then I've heard conflicting instructions by other residents who say that you never touch long-acting insulin and that it's okay to give. 
Is there a consensus to this? Anything evidence-based or guideline based that I can refer to?





(2) In regards to tweaking hospital dosing of insulin, I was wondering what strategy people tend to recommend. Right now, I was taught by my last resident to 'weight base' my patients. That is, I do 0.5 units/kg, then half goes to long-acting, and the other half goes to short acting in divided doses. Is that what you guys tend to go for?

How about making tweaks to that when the patient remains uncontrolled on that initial regimen, or on their home regimen? One trick that was taught to me was to keep looking at the sliding scale and add up how much they got off the sliding scale throughout the day. Then add this to the total daily insulin, and divide that daily total as you normally would into long-acting and short acting. Is that a good rule of thumb? Are there any guidelines that advise differently?




(3) During my ambulatory care block, I often encounter patients who will come to us for the first time with HbA1Cs &gt; 9. Supposedly this is the point at which you begin insulin therapy on a patient regardless of if they were ever on medications before, until their HbA1C is back under control. I was wondering if anyone had more specifics to this rule, where I can read more closely about it and what the reasoning is?
For instance, some of these same patients have had poor medical follow up in the past and are just finding out now that they are diabetic. Some of them are unhappy about the idea of sticking themselves with insulin every day. In some cases, even if you do start insulin at that point, you end up switching them to oral meds when they're back in better control anyway. Is there a proven reason to always start insulin at that trigger point?

For instance, the other day I had a lady who was pretty decently controlled on metformin. She had a bad string of months with personal crises, in which she stopped taking her meds altogether. Unsurprisingly, her HbA1c came back something high like 10-11. My attending suggested starting her off on insulin at that point, but honestly if she was just not taking her oral meds, could we not just begin her on the oral meds and follow up in 3-4 months?

Sorry again for the dumb questions! I want to be insulin saavy since diabetics are bread and butter medicine and I want to be good at getting them under control.




Also, when do you guys start considering calling an endocrine consult?"

I finished my last semester at the end of April, have been looking for a job since mid May. So it's been over 3 months now. I graduated from a notable university in Canada, majored in electrical engineering. Have internships, 2 of which are relevant, all were software related. I have been trying to delve into the software field.

I have been getting interviews, and initially I couldn't even get past the first phone screen. Then I started getting past that but then I couldn't get past the first technical phone screen or coding challenge. Recently I have been getting past those too. 

I have been practicing coding problems and learning CS concepts. I'm getting better at giving interviews, I can feel that but I'm wondering what happens if I don't manage to get a job for a long time. 

It's already been 3 months, if say I am still unemployed by like January what will I say when companies as what I did the whole time? I don't think that ""teaching myself programming"" would be a good response to that. Should I try to pursue a master's in CS? Though I'm sure getting into a master's program for CS has its own requirements.

My interest lies in game development and I have gotten interviews from 2 companies in that field, the first one I failed in the first round. The 2nd one which I failed in the third round recently (improvement, but empty handed at the end still). 

I don't know how long it will take for me to find a job, and I don't know how I will be judged by companies if I stay unemployed for too long.

A couple months ago I got a call from HR asking me about relocating to a different city because they were growing. I was polite but made it clear I was hoping to stay in the city I was hired in. They seemed completely fine with it and forgot about it thinking all was well.


However, fast forward to now when some of my fellow interns were scheduled to start working, there seems to be more issues.  They still have not started work because they were asked to relocate a couple weeks before their start date and when that didn't work out HR has been trying to find somewhere for them in a different service line/somewhere else but hasn't gotten back to them yet. I guess in the year or so between accepting my full-time offer and finishing school this department has lost some major clients and no longer has the need for everyone they hired. Many of the old employees are now gone or traveling to clients.


Anyways, I don't really have all the details on this as I haven't been told anything myself, but that's what I'm worried about. I don't want to get the call a couple weeks before my supposed start date that they don't have the space for me and then be forced to find something new when they knew all along this was happening.

Would you recommend being honest with my managers that I am actively interviewing for a FT offer in B4 public, and therefore will have to be in and out of the office? Or make excuses for these 2 weeks and possibly call out for interview superday (I'm also taking FT classes so I can claim issues with financial aid, scheduling etc that require me to go to campus for a few hrs). 

I can make up the hours I miss at night/on the weekend, but I am concerned about how it will affect the rest of my internship (lasts until end of year) if I let my firm know ahead of time.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

My question is which major you would recommend to be able to actually obtain a job or internship during or upon completion of my degree.

I just have a couple questions for any environmental science majors at UW.

Some of my questions:
1. Regardless if you’re in L&amp;S or CALS, did you like the environmental science major? Most importantly, did you think your courses prepared you for a career after college? If not, why?

2. Would you recommend me to major in a different science major like biology or chemistry over environmental science? If so, why? Do biology or chemistry majors have significantly more openings for jobs over environmental scientists? (I have no intention of applying to med school, to keep that in mind).

3. For L&amp;S, it says that the major is housed in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, and for CALS the major is housed in the Department of Soil Science. Does this mean anything for the major besides the location?

4. What are the internship opportunities like? Are there any that are readily available or ones that you’d recommend to me? I’m interested specifically in researching either air pollution or renewable energy.

Extra:
I’m taking Environmental Studies 127 this fall. If anyone has taken the class and would like to give me some insight on what to expect, I’d appreciate it!"

Long time lurker, first time poster; was hoping you fine folks could help me with a quick smell test.

IT is half my job because I am in a smaller organization.  My passion is the operations side of running big systems, so I am a bit naive in corporate IT.

Earlier this week, my intern was verifying warranty status with the manufacturer for some newly purchased workstations in our inventory system and noticed that manufacturer's start date of the warranty was from May despite the products being ordered and purchased this month!  (Note this is a 3 year warranty; vendor lists it as 3 years on the order detail page).  

I would understand if there was a bit of slack time due to supply chain, but May to Aug seems very excessive.  It does seem like the manufacturer understands this as well, as they do seem to grant extra time at the end of the warranty (July vs May), but that is still one month short from the purchase date.

So short version: I would expect the warranty to start on or about the purchase date.  Is this naive or is my vendor being shady?

&gt;#**The Lurker’s Guide to Nirn**
&gt;##*or: Why You Should Play Nirn Powers*
&gt;###Part I: the History of Interregnum, 2E 430 - Present

Hello! I am Nagaialor, fledgling Elder Scrolls lore scholar and owner of The Most Magical Place on Nirn (maybe). I’ve noticed a small, steady climb in the Subscriber count (yay!). This is great news.

It means we got a lot of lurkers; lurkers that could join the game, lurkers that could spread word about the game, and lurkers that can enjoy the stories we weave here on Nirn Powers.

If you’ve been lurking from the start or just staring, you’re probably wondering what in Oblivion is this?

Well, Nirn Powers is an xpowers type subreddit, a political simulation on the Plane(t) of Nirn where you can be the leader of a nation! This is a continuation of a former xpowers subreddit called Elder Scrolls Powers which ended with the world it inhabited (sort of). Now there’s a fresh start waiting for you if you want to take it! Let me explain:

&gt;####**The Stage of the Political Theatre: the Arena**

It all started with a lovely Tsaesci Potentate named Savirien-Chorak. His father Versidue-Shaie passed the Guilds act, allowing the Fighters Guild and the Mages Guild —alongside the Cobblers Guild, the Weavers Guild, and most importantly the Prostitutes Guild (there were many more besides those) —to exist. Then he died: murdered by the Morag Tong. Chorak made it possible for the counties of the Second Empire to levy localized armies to defend themselves. Then he *also* died.

This began a storm of events called “**_THE INTERREGNUM_**”, beginning in 2E (or CE depending on who you ask) 430.

Nations rise and fall at the drop of a hat, civil wars breaking out, ambitions fulfilled and spurned, not knowing who to trust. This is Nirn during the Fifth Century of the Second Era, an exciting time.

Things got rocky in Skyrim with its civil war between High King Svatr and High Queen Freydis, a conflict that divided the nation into Eastern and Western counterparts. A plague descended in the midst of the fighting that turned some away from battle and others into zealous piety. Meanwhile, Hammerfell was being united by Ena of Sentinel, proclaiming herself Sultana and beginning a campaign to conquer all of High Rock. This ends with her messy demise in Daggerfall where Duke Jociel explodes himself during a meeting at his castle. Her adviser Avik takes control of the Sultanate. Delusional after the death of someone he genuinely loved and trying to shake off his sobriquet of “the Meek”, he proclaimed himself a living Saint of the Sword, starting a ‘Caliphate’ in the broadest of terms and subjugating all of High Rock with extreme prejudice. This encouraged Svatr to ally himself with the Yokudans of Hammerfell, giving him an edge in the war. Little did he realize that Avik was playing a grand gambit, but more on that later.

To the south, Cyrodiil was trying to maintain focus without the empire. The Elder Council tried to cobble together a central government, then the mysterious Blight of Peryite wiped them out; another Elder Council is formed, mission still the same. Colovian warlords did what they do best; fight each other. The Nibeneans went a more diplomatic and intriguing route with trade deals and casual poisonings. The ambitions of Duke Albinus Severan of Chorrol came to a head as he forged an alliance of Colovian kingdoms alongside Kvatch leader Magnus Palam. Colovia declared war on Nibenay, a nation with a meager military force in comparison. It was mostly a shadow war where subterfuge gave Nibenay (particularly Cheydinhal and Bruma) an edge; Bravil refused to fight and was easily persuaded to allow Colovia to do what they did. A fringe kingdom of Ayleids, led by the famous Last King freed from Coldharbour, neither part of Colovia or Nibenay officially, stoked the ambitions of Palam in an attempt to have him turn on Albinus and stake a claim to be Emperor, fearing the larger powers of the west would stomp on a divided Cyrodiil. Albinus’s assassination, an entirely unforeseeable event caused by an internal struggle, created a power vacuum that sorted itself out rather neatly in favor of Magnus. The civil war ended and they tried to crown the King of Kvatch as emperor. The Elder Council said no, but they did make him a Marshal of Cyrodiil and gave him special wartime powers. This would be handy later on.

Morrowind, currently called Resdayn, is perpetually a cluster of Great and Lesser Houses loosely guided by the ALMSIVI still in their prime. Interactions with the xenophobic Dumner have been kept to a minimum, but they have seen some prosperity: House Dres partook in a slave-free trade deal with the Ayleid Kingdom that would benefit much of Nibenay, and the Morag Tong was beginning to branch back out into Cyrodiil (even if they were outlawed to operate there). Conflicts with the rising Dark Brotherhood have not occurred yet but are likely forthcoming. An Ashlander tribe prospected much of Vvardenfell, riches mixed with bloodshed. There is, of course, someone trying to domesticate Cliff Racers, but it is unknown how successful this ends up being.

Valenwood and Elsweyr are hardly looking to tear each other apart at this time; the Camoran Dynasty did much to clean house of Imperial influence, going so far as to conduct a smear campaign against the Elder Council and cutting ties with murder. One Wilderking, so bent on declaring war with literally everyone, threat of a giant wild hunt looming, was replaced with another, more peaceful one. The Camorans tried to reconcile peace between Tamrielic rulers early on in the 430s, but this was never meant to be. Peryite’s Blight, a crisis starting in Skyrim, had a profound effect on Falinestian politics that the Camorans tried to capitalize on to find the cure.

The Mane’s influence wanes much like the moons that form the Lunar Lattice. The Tsaesci of the Rim stay allied but separate on a precarious rope tugged by the Khajiit and the Imperials wanting them to join Cyrodiil. Leyawiin, noticing the Mane’s inaction, has been tempted to join forces with the Empire proper. Northern bands of Khajiiti tribes end up helping Colovia in exchange for aid on a personal vendetta.

Argonia is rife with war; the Lilmothiit forged first a Kingdom and then an Empire that grows and grows slowly, Saxhleel tribes either fighting them to the death or joining the fox-folk. A tribe of Bright-Throats wanted to reclaim the swamps south of their river, lands that happened to be owned by County Bravil: a tricky treaty keeps this from turning into Full-Scale War, ending with a mild Hist influence in Cyrodiil.

Alinor is as Alinor does. The Aldmeri Dominion is fledgling with Thalmor operatives carrying out missions in the shadows with nobody, not even High King Hidellith, batting an eye. High Kinlord Rilis XII has continued his eccentric reign, dissembling the great Orrey of Firsthold, stretching Aldmeri influence far into the Niben, and attracting many the quizzical stares of his admirers and dissidents both.

There are, of course, other pockets of Nirn. The Middle Isles are in a precarious union, making deals and being spurned by Akavir. The Skaal continue getting nibbled to death by Rieklings. One of the last known Dovah rules Roscrea, the halfway point between Skyrim and Atmora. Old Yokuda laughs at what their brethren of Hammerfell have become, the Maormer are in the midst of rebellion against their God-King, and the Sload? Nobody knows.

Then the conflicts really began.

&gt;####**The War against the Nords**

(An In-game title for the war is tentative)

Avik, weary of the prospect of a long, drawn out winter war, went to Freydis with a literal proposal; the union of Skyrim, Hammerfell, and High Rock by Matrimony. He gave Svatr to her on a gilded plate in exchange for hand: she accepted. This frightens Cyrodiil into a tizzy. Multiple assassination attempts against Avik fail comically at his wedding, but not without leaving him into a coma for a few months.

One assassination attempt did work though, eventually.

The Ayleids, fearful of a new Ra Gada sweeping across Cyrodiil, crafted an Amulet in the image of Chim El-Adabal with an orange hue. It was a Dark Welkynd Stone amulet that would set its wearer on fire after slowly setting their magicka aflame. Since it was enchanted by ancient magics beyond the comprehension of Avik’s guard, they could not detect the danger.

He burst into flames during his First Council meeting after wearing it.

Before his death, he gave succession rights to his new bride, Freydis. This created a flurry of speculation, one going so far to claim that she was responsible for his death (a claim quite popular in High Rock and some parts of Hammerfell). Frightened Cyrodiil eventually marshaled under Palam, declaring War upon the Greater Caliphate of Western Tamriel. Freydis’s lands were simply too damn big, and honored, cherished leaders like Counts Varro and Tharn of Bruma and Cheydinhal respectively were disappearing, presumably murdered by Skyrim.

Before the First Battle, subtlety was the watchword of both sides. For County Bruma, subtlety was sending a thousand spies to try and hurdle the border. Propaganda blossomed; most were captured, many executed, some agents of sabotage. Fighting followed.

The First Battle at Pale Pass, the one that started the war, was not so much a battle as a bloodbath: an advanced cadre of Ayleidoon sorcerers were able to sneak into Skyrim and attack from the other side, causing an avalanche and killing over 12000 soldiers combined on both sides. This stirred internal conflict and mild distrust towards Ald Cyrod, but Cyrodiil eventually recovered and assaulted the sundered pass a second time, winning control of it by superior infantry tactics, heading towards Falkreath, sheer speed of Brumean calvary on their side. A fleet led by Magnus Palam himself made landing on High Rock and prompted a secessionist movement, charging into Skyrim from the Bangkorai pass with consent from the Reachmen and besieging Solitude. A third invasion was pulled off by the combined forces of the Ayleid Kingdom and Cheydinhal through the Rift’s border crossing: underpaid soldiers of the Rift turned against each other, many of them joining the Ayleid King and threatening Riften proper.

The fact alone Cyrodiil was hellbent on Solitude, Falkreath, and Riften was bad enough, but Dawnstar cut ties with Freydis and joined in on the bloodbath. The Caliphate dissolved: Hammerfell, tired of Freydis’s defeats, split into kingdoms and joined the conflict alongside Palam. Freydis called for an end to the war; Cyrodiil called for an end to her reign.

&gt;####**Red Sun Rising: the Future**

The success of the War won over the Elder Council; Magnus Palam became Emperor and the Kingdoms and Counties of Cyrodiil part of an Empire. Some want Cyrodiil to not be expansionist, focusing on radical ideals like ‘democracy’, while others look outside the borders, wanting to grow. Still, others are unsatisfied; there isn’t a Dragonborn on the Ruby Throne. There is no Amulet of Kings. Hidden power struggles in Bruma and Cheydinhal threaten the delicate balance of the Empire. The Dark Brotherhood is united and rising, many powerful leaders marked for death. The Mysterious Blight of Peryite, seemingly gone before it began, still has no cure and could reemerge at any moment. Religious tensions are mounting across the world between prominent cults of Aedra and Daedra both; Meridia has become quite popular in Cyrodiil and High Rock, much to the dismay of Cults to the Divines. Flying ships are starting to crop up from the Empire, one with seemingly Daedric motifs confusing and mystifying any who witness it. A looming prophecy hangs over everyone and certain factions within Tamriel are vying to fulfill it for their own selfish gains. What does the future hold for Nirn?

Join, and you can decide.



---------------------

*I made this post detailing how to join.*

---------------------



Hello! I am u/bold0727, AKA Castellan Torelo of Balfiera. Here, you will read an easy way to join the fun and not be engulfed by confusion. You can choose to lead a nation, be an independent character, or lead an organization. I will touch on independent characters and organizations later.

**== CHOOSING YOUR CLAIM ==**

First, you need to choose your claim. Find an area you like on the [map](http://nirnpowers.github.io/). Then, go to the claims map (upper right hand corner, click on the three sheets and then click claim map. Red/brown/yellow shades are claimed, blue/green/purple shades are unclaimed, and grey shades are NPC) to see if that area is claimed. If it isn't claimed, you can claim the area. An area is denoted by color, and the little ""mini-areas"" can change what nation they are a part of. So, for example, House Hlaalu consists of the brown area of Vvardenfell. Make sure to read up on your [claim's wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/wiki/claims) so you have information about the claim from previous players, if there is any.

**== MAKING YOUR CLAIM ==**

First, make a reddit account. Do this by pressing ""sign up"" in the top right. Then, press SUBMIT [CLAIM] on the right of the subreddit to start your claim post. In the title, it should look something like ""[CLAIM] (Area)"" without the quotations or parentheses. In the text, you will put a small history of your area, a description of your area, and whoever is leading your area's backstory. Search on [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13aq9HYdvJT4w1DwJXnFVKVY974jzAZP1omgS46fQkvM/edit?usp=sharing) for your area, and see if there is a bold name beside it. If not, then you can play with whatever character you want (As long as it is lore friendly. A Khajiit won't be running House Hlaalu.) If there is a normal face name, however, you can change who runs the area. For examples of other claims, check out the [previous claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/search?q=%5BCLAIM%5D&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all). Once you are done, hit ""Post"" and wait for it to be approved or be given advice from a moderator to improve your claim post.

**== AFTER IT IS APPROVED ==**

Once your claim is approved, you will get a link to a wiki. In this wiki, you can put whatever you want. I reccomend copying your claim post into your wiki for the start. Check out some [other wikis](reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/wiki/claims) for examples. Make sure you link to your spreadsheet (below) in your wiki.

**== SPREADSHEET ==**

Your spreadsheet is what IS your nation. You need to keep this maintained. See /u/GOOD_GUY_GREG_2810's [post on spreadsheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/comments/4ws09v/modpost_beginners_guide_to_spreadsheets/).

**== MODERATORS ==**

The current moderators are:

/u/GOOD_GUY_GREG_2810

/u/slovakiin

/u/fabricofspacetime

/u/tofukiin

/u/JocundXarxes

/u/MysteriousDrifter

/u/bold0727 (I can edit the map and wiki, nothing else really)

The current interns (half mods) are:

/u/A_Wild_Wurmple

/u/inguaz

/u/Le_Herp_Derper

/u/Nagailor


(If I missed any tell me!)

**== THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ==**

Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.

A post is done for everything. For example, if you make a ship, make an [EVENT] post about it.

Conflicts are done via dice-rolling to put some randomness into the equation.

I control the map. Send me a PM to request a change.

You can buy or conquest a land. To buy it, negotiate with the owner of the land over Slack (see below) and then make a post about it. Conquesting a land, if you want to incorporate the land into your area, must have stakes of annexation and win. You need to state this in your [CONFLICT] post. If your stakes are vassalation, if you win the land will become a vassal of yours, and follow your rules while retaining independence. Check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13aq9HYdvJT4w1DwJXnFVKVY974jzAZP1omgS46fQkvM/edit#gid=) to see if you want to take over a land or not. It's data is averaged with your data, so keep that in mind.

You can only claim one area at a time, however more land can be obtained by purchasing/conquesting.

You cannot split a mini-region in half.

If you do not post for a week, you will get a warning. If you don't declaim for another week, you will be declaimed.

Renaming a mini-region could be possible if you ask a mod.

This game takes place around 100 years before ESO, so make sure you check the [UESP](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page) for help making your claim post lore-friendly. You can also ask fabricofspacetime in the Slack (see below) to talk to a lore master!

Put a date in the comments of your post so its easier for the mods to determine when your post happened (something like ""1 (real date) Frostfall ([month depends on day](https://nirnpowers.wordpress.com/tag/date/)) Year (in sidebar).""

You must only have one claim, whether it be a nation, organization, or independent character. If you own a nation, you can own an independent character without a claim post as a member of that nation.

**== SLACK ==**

If you want to be invited to the chat, send an email you feel safe giving out to /u/fabricofspacetime. Only he will see it and use it to invite you. You can ask to be invited before you claim if you have questions about anything regarding claiming.

**== INDEPENDENT CHARACTER ==**

An independent character can work for whoever you want and live wherever you want. To make one, simply make a claim post with the title as ""[CLAIM] (Character Name)"" and have the text be your character's backstory. Most of your posts as an Indendent Character will be roleplay posts and possibly nation-like posts if you run a business character.

**== ORGANIZATIONS ==**

To make an organization, make a claim post with the title ""[CLAIM] (Organization Name)"" and in the text, put a description of the organization and where it is based. You also must fill out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dUouVkEQX2nr6adtlX6WxCKT6ql_oXP26HXF-vAVqW8/edit?usp=sharing). These would be run like a nation without land. Follow the directions on the spreadsheet and ask for help in the Slack to set up an organization! ((NOTE: I have been told organizations may not be playable anymore. Please consult a moderator for more information.))

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy your time in Nirn Powers! Make sure you read the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/wiki/pocketguide) before you start playing!



---------------------

*And, last but not least, /u/GOOD_GUY_GREG_2810 's post on the spreadsheet*

---------------------



Are you tired of toiling over a spreadsheet that just doesn’t make sense? Have you not tried just because of how goddamn scary all the different colours and boxes are? If so, you’ve come to the right place: the complete guide to the NP spreadsheet!

First things first, you’ll want to find your claim in the drop down menu of the “nation claim” box. You’ll find this at the very top in the centre, in the salmon pink box. Then, fill in your main character name, and your username in the boxes below. This is shown [here](http://imgur.com/a/5GOaB).

Once this is complete, you will have to fill in all the boxes that are in blue. Don’t worry about the “Mercenaries”, “Other Income” or “Other Expenditure” boxes just yet, these are filled in by events in game (ie. hiring mercenaries will add men to the “Mercenaries” box, and money to the “Other Expenditure”, showing the additional troops that you gain and what you paid for them). One blue box that you will find is the [“Tax” box](http://imgur.com/a/gUsz4). This is the severity of tax that you inflict on your citizens, and therefore affects how much money you gain each half-year. However, you can’t just tax your citizens to death; they’ll rise up and depose you if you do. Tax rates will be unpopular after 50, and too long at too high will cause riots. However, when you’re at war, you can get away with more taxes. For a while at least.

The next boxes that you’ll need to do are the army boxes. These are the ones that tend to be the most confusing, so listen up. The size of your army can be chosen by you when you claim. However, your army size cannot go above the size of your [“Base Manpower”](http://imgur.com/a/tbGeX). One thing to look out for is your [“Profit”](http://imgur.com/a/Dmxmk), on the right. This shows how much money you make each half-year, and therefore how many soldiers you can have without going bankrupt. With this in mind, you should experiment a little, trying different troop quantities, making sure that your “Profit” doesn’t go into the negative (unless, of course, you want to go all viking and do something like raid to pay for your soldiers). When doing this, you should change both the [“Army Full Capacity” and the “Army Current” boxes](http://imgur.com/a/ODD2Q), as these will be the same when you start, and both are required to fully show both your profit and how much manpower you have left.

Once you have decided on how many soldiers to have, you need to set your [“Current Manpower”](http://imgur.com/a/RTK6V). This is essentially what’s left of your manpower after your army has taken a good chunk of it. Therefore, you should set your “Current Manpower” to the same as [“Remaining”](http://imgur.com/a/I6PWG) manpower, or just the box above it. If any of the boxes go read, then something’s gone wrong. It is likely that either your “Army Current” and “Army Full Capacity” are mismatched, or that you set the “Current Manpower” *before* you set the “Army Current” and the “Army Full Capacity”.

Finally comes your navy. If you are not a landlocked nation, then you can start with a total of 10 ships. Just put the ship quantities you want in your “Current” column. Like your army, navies cost money, and you should be wary of the cost, and make sure that it doesn’t make you bankrupt. Some more information on ship types and purposes can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nirnpowers/wiki/pocketguide#wiki_navy). The location of the Navy boxes are [here](http://imgur.com/a/PMm2j)

Now that you have successfully set up your spreadsheet (and if you haven’t, don’t hesitate to ask one of the mods for help!), you will now need to keep it updated. Every Sunday we have a pause where only Lore, Meta and Roleplay posts are allowed, and on this pause day, you will need to update your spreadsheet (you should update it the first sunday you come across, not on your first day). It is very simple, and all you have to do is change the values of the green boxes. If you have recruited more soldiers, or taken casualties, then update your “Army Current” boxes to the values seen in your [“Army Next Time”](http://imgur.com/a/8U8mv) boxes. Then you will need to update your “Current Manpower” to the value shown in your [“End Manpower”](http://imgur.com/a/8LdWN) box. Then comes your treasury, and you will have to change the [“Money (start of time)”](http://imgur.com/a/NbcNc) to the value shown in the [“Money (end of time)”](http://imgur.com/a/LOcVn) box. Lastly, if you are making ships, you will have to update those that are being made to the “Current” box.

Finally (and I swear this is a finally in what I can see turning into a thousand word wall of unfriendly text), here’s a quick overview of what some of the other boxes mean, and what all the fancy colours mean. Blue boxes are boxes that are chosen by you. Yellow boxes are chosen by the mods, and link back to the master spreadsheets. I’m afraid you can’t change these unless through events, which will have to go through mods first. Green boxes are the ones that you need to update on Sundays. Your “Eco. Strength” and “Trade Strength” is the size of your economy. Therefore, the higher these are, the higher your tax yield will be. “Tribal” shows whether your society is tribal or not (surprise!), and affects your maximum troop count and other aspects of your society. “Military Modifier”, “Volunteer Army” and “Magic Modifier” set the quality and cost of your troops.

4z35gn,1,2016-08-22,"[Milwaukee, WI] A Tech Recruiter is posting incorrect information about me online to help me get hired. Is this legal?",xxfallingxdownxx,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4z35gn/milwaukee_wi_a_tech_recruiter_is_posting/,"Hello r/legaladvice!

I recently graduated community college (3 months ago, to be specific). I had posted quite a few times on reddit seeking job hunting advice as I still haven't found work, and many of them suggested seeking the help of a Tech Recruiter (as I graduated with an A.A.S. in Programming). I've contacted multiple recruiters from various companies, gave them my resume and contact information, and haven't had any issues with it until now.

One day I was going on one of the websites for a recruiting company I've contacted in hopes of seeking information about jobs in my area. I stumbled upon a section of the site about talent information, and decided that I would look at my profile to see what was on it out of curiosity. I found that the recruiter posted information saying ""she is a talented developer with 4 years work experience in education"" on my profile. I don't have any work experience at all and I've told the recruiter this. All I have as far as experience is a 5 month internship at my college and a completed project. 

I know that if an employer saw this work experience information, hired me for a job, and found out I didn't have any of this experience, I would be fired immediately for lying on an application. So I don't understand why a tech recruiter is posting this false information about me. I also don't know why they're posting my gender, as I know an employer can't inquire about this information without consent. The recruiter never asked for my permission to disclose my gender.

I would like to know, is any of this legal for a tech recruiter to do? And what should I do? 

Thank you for your time."

I was seen as a drug addict by my parents. Next thing you know, I started drinking, but not just any drinking, BINGE DRINKING. I'd get fucked up, blackout drunk, then I'd go home, stumbling, and get yelled at.



 All the while I've been a successful honors student, going to a top tier college, completed internships, etc. I just graduated high school with honors and 5 chords, the first in my family to do so. I helped 20 kids graduate by doing all of their final essays, making over $500 in a week. They think I'm a fuckup with lots of potential.

 I've done loads and loads of cocaine and xanax, and in addition, just seem to have this void in my life that cannot be filled. I've never had a girlfriend, have had constant family problems, and never have felt true happiness. I bet my dopamine receptors are pretty fucked up as it is, but I can't quite feel happniess at all. I've urged my parents to take me to a psychologist, but they've been quite negligent. I went to rehab classes and then once I graduated I relapsed, because I simply wanted to graduate to show my parents I wasn't a drug addict.

 1 week ago, I was mixing xanax and alcohol, lost $300 and my wallet, stumbled into a fast food location, and was arrested for public intoxication. I was brought home to my parents, then subsequently, just went to bed. The next day, I got high as fuck, and got in trouble with my parents for coming home with red eyes. I've caused my parents so much misery, that I can't even imagine how they feel, because I feel like nothing really matters in life. I just shrug it off, and I do think about it, but I don't really understand. I know I have emotions and intelligence, but I don't really have empathy. I don't understand. My parents said while I was on xanax that I was threatening to kill myself, and even my dad? I don't know, I've been sober for a week and my head hurts like a bitch. Maybe it's a fried feeling I've obtained over the years by overworking my serotonin and dopamine receptors, or maybe it's just me. Over the years, I've been kicked out and beaten by my father, stayed with friends etc. I haven't really lived the life I intended to. I believe I have mental health issues, but my parents just don't understand. My life has this void that can't be filled. I'm just indifferent. Maybe it's depression or something, but given the fact that all of this shit has happened has made me want to just stop, think, probably just end it. It sounds cowardly yes, and I probably won't end it either way. I have too much in store for me in the future. If my parents had just taken me to a psychologist years back and let me smoke weed, maybe I wouldn't have had such a problematic life so early. It is a shame to admit all of this, but this is why I'm using a throwaway. I'm disgusted at myself, but don't really know how to feel. I'm just me. I'm going off to college in 3 weeks and feel like I don't need to be babied anymore. I feel too dependent on my parents, which I shouldn't be. I feel like a leach for even existing. My brothers make me feel bad that they're even helping me go to college, for even having faith in this lying sack of shit drug addict. Goddamn, just today I was to have one guest, a friend I haven't seen in three months, and when I closed the door to my room, it began reeking like weed. To say the least, my parents knocked on the door, kicked him the fuck out and told him never to come back, then proceeded to yell at me and tell me what a disappointment I've been. I didn't even smoke weed or anticipate my friend bringing weed, nevertheless he had it in a jar. He had enough kindness to drop off a nug in a secret location in my neighborhood for me to pickup later on, I'll probably be walking my dog later to pick it up in secret. I'm being surveillanced as it is. They tell me they're scared to live with me, and now I guess I'm supposed to live with that knowledge. It sucks being me at the moment, and I for one, despise my life right now. Hopefully it betters as I go to college. My dad cried today since he smelled weed on my friend, and I couldn't wrap my head around why I still deal with this? I don't feel bad that I got caught, I feel bad that I have to hear the same thing over and over again. It is really a shame that I've lived the life I've lived with such supportive parents, and have disappointed the fuck out of them, but for some reason, I don't really care. Nothing in life really matters to me, and I'm going to college for something I don't even know if I want to do. As long as it gives me a fresh start in a new city, I'm happy. I'm ready to move the fuck out of here. Advice?"
4z3hij,7,2016-08-22,I'm fucking sorry that I don't have experience in order to get experience!,grizzfan,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4z3hij/im_fucking_sorry_that_i_dont_have_experience_in/,"I am fucking sorry to everyone I interviewed with that I wasn't a resident assistant.  I'm sorry I wasn't a supervisor before.  I'm sorry I didn't conduct 100 programs, or was the president of any student organization, or headed a major group research project.  I'm sorry I wasn't involved every single fucking semester in college.  I'm sorry that I didn't get heavily involved until my fourth year of undergrad (even though I had a 7.5 year undergrad and was heavily involved the last 3.5 years).  Still, I have three years in housing, two years in admissions, was on two E-boards, involved in over five organizations, volunteered at a college prep after school program for high school kids.

I KNOW I WANT THIS FUCKING CAREER!!!  I know I have the heart, the mind, the determination, the work ethic, the professionalism, and the ability to learn quickly.  I want nothing more than to have a career in student affairs and to help and advise students to find themselves professionally, personally, and academically.  

To all the LGBT and multicultural jobs I applied for (which is where I want to work), I'm sorry I'm a masculine white cis-man (even though I am a sexual minority).  I know I have privilege, and I have not faced a lot of oppression.  That doesn't mean I can't be involved or have the ability to be a good worker or social justice advocate.

WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU PEOPLE WANT FROM ME!?  I KNOW THIS IS THE CAREER FOR ME!  I KNOW THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO!  I CAN'T GO BACK TO FRESHMAN YEAR AND BE INVOLVED FROM THE GET-GO FOR YOU!  I KNOW I'M BEHIND, BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT I AM MORE THAN CAPABLE TO WORK RIGHT NOW!  

I've interviewed for over 20 positions since January and have been doing everything I was advised to do.  I've visited multiple schools, I've followed every advisor's advice.  In mock interviews everyone told my answers were excellent and I speak excellently.  I tailor and practice all my interview answers before hand to be varied and match up with the job.  I research the positions and the schools to learn the missions and visions, the tidbits, the goals and aims of the school.   Candidates were coming to me for interview advice even!  I ask for feedback from jobs I don't get and all I get is ""you needed more undergrad experience.""  I went to conferences and did interviews in mass.  Advisors and former supervisors told me there is no way I won't get a job offer.  Well guess what, I fucking didn't!  I did everything and then some.    

I got rejected from two more jobs in the past couple days (one today).  One of them was just an internship position even!  I felt extremely confident and was more than prepared in both of them.  I have never felt better at my chances than these last two.

Now I have to slug it out in a student affairs masters program with no job that relates at all to student affairs.  I'm 100% on financial aid.  I am going to volunteer and get as much field experience as possible, but now I have no source of income.  I'm the only person in my program that doesn't have an assistantship or internship.  I can't get involved with our group conversations because I don't have one of those.  I'm left out.  I feel like an outsider.  I can't contribute to the conversations.  I'm falling way behind, and everyone knows it.  Everyone else is all happy with their assistantships, and they'll all graduate with little to no student debt.  They'll be able to get a good jump start on making money because of the low debt, but nope, not me.  Everyone is working right now.  Meanwhile I'm stuck here sitting on my ass with nothing to do.  ""Oh just wait a year and get an assistantship next year.""  Well guess what, I STILL DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE TO GET EXPERIENCE!

I don't want to play the blame game, but I don't know what other solutions there can be anymore.  In regards to multicultural offices, I'm a masculine acting white cis man who definitely fits the jock description.  I know how much hate/how hard it is for men in that position to have jobs in these fields currently.  I also don't want to blame the fact that I am 5'2,"" (and going bald at 26), but I know men under 5'5 on are more likely to be passed up for a job over a man who is taller than that.  I just don't know what else there is that I can do that is still in my control.

JUST FUCK EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW!  I have no motivation anymore.  There's no point.  I'm just gonna slug through the semester and fall farther and farther behind everyone, putting me even farther behind when I get my master's.  I'm going to have a fucking master's degree and I'm still not going to have a fucking career.  All of it because ""I didn't have experience to get experience.""  Everything is trying to tell me I'm a failure, and I feel like one, but I know this is the field I want to be in!  Somebody just give me a fucking chance!!!"

Long story short, I got a coding challenge for an internship from a company with a relatively simple problem: merge two sorted arrays.

It's been a year since I took data structures, so I initially forgot the exact algorithm, but needless to say I fucked it up. I had 15 minutes, and it took me a few minutes to remember how to start.

I got the first part merging right, but I forgot to append the last elements once you've made a list empty after removing elements from it. I would have added it, but I didn't have enough time left.

I'm about to enter my senior year of college and my internship is nearly half over already. It has been several weeks of the nine-to-five and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want the summer to end. Being an only child, I was always given a lot of attention from my loving mom. I did my best to make my dad proud, but it never seemed to be enough. With his constant travelling for work, he wasn't there to see me play youth sports and was only proud when I brought home a trophy...mainly so he had something to display next to his self-made wall of fame.

You...you are my mom's best friend and neighbor and the woman I first ever fantasized about when I first discovered the joys of masturbation. You have a loving husband but over the years, something has been missing in your life. You simply don't know what yet. You and my mom both don't have to work as your husbands bring in more than enough to support the families. You often find yourself lounging around our pool with my mom.

It's Friday around 3 PM. I got off work early and couldn't wait to come home. The truth is I knew you would be over and I could get a glimpse of you in a bikini as you lay out. It's nearly 90 degrees and I cannot wait to jump in the pool. I throw on some trunks and head out to the pool and find [you and my mom reading gossip websites on your tablets](http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/178966602-two-women-using-ipads-by-the-pool-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=EJohqlxhEoMaBN8er34Ev9POnDFgP6zdgsSFBcHKlS3lYW1bQxEjCVEV7u%2FWN6je). We make small talk and my mom excuses herself to go inside for a moment. 

The conversation between you and I continues and we get a little personal. I tell you I am not seeing anyone and you tell me your husband is away on business so you're staying alone. You tell me that you often get scared staying alone and you were thinking about staying at our house for the night since my dad is away on business as well. Soon after my mom comes out and you quickly change the subject. You and my mom excuse yourselves after and I continue to swim alone. I begin think to myself ""was she just trying to tell me something?""  

I swim for a little longer then get on a float and begin to daydream as I cannot get the image of you in your bikini out of my head. I start to wonder just what it is you two are doing inside the house and my fantasy begins to include my mom. I envision the two of you in her room slowly pulling your bikinis off as you lay next to each other and are making out. I begin to doze off and wake up sometime later. The sun is still out but it is time I head back in to the house. I grab my towel and head for the back door...
______________________________________
I will let you decide what happens from there. Do I walk in on you and my mom going at it? Do you go back home and invite me over? Do you spend the night and find a way to sneak to my room/somewhere else in the house? Do we include my mom as well? (if you cannot tell, a kink of mine is definitely incest). We could both play the role of her and direct her based on whose turn it is. You can determine your age in the RP, add more back story to your character, and make any other changes you like.
___________________________________________
I'm pretty open sexually. Some of my other kinks include being dominant, anal, light bondage, deep throat, threesomes, public sex, and age play (18+ only). But I'm open to any and all suggestions. I am looking for long term RP for this. "

I got a D+ in a math class and it brought my GPA down from a 3.3 . I've got 2 yrs to get it back up and then transfer to a CSU or lower tier UC (university of California system). My GPA, super harsh grader but awesome professor, and math has given me some big questions I need help with. 

The best CS professor at my college is big on grade deflation. 2 people got 95% in the intro to c++ class and only 5 got B's. This was after 10 people out of 25 dropped the course. He is known for being a harsh grader and gets excited when the class average on an exam is 75%. I don't get why he teaches like it's a UC and not a community college. I don't want to sound mean, but people sometimes go to community colleges because they didn't have the best grades (including me). I'm at one because of money and my high school GPA was a 3.2, so why bother trying. My parents seem to never get it when I tell them about his grading. They are upset that I can't get A's in his classes, my only available major classes BTW (I always get A's in General Ed classes), and they've got me highly anxious now. This is likely my last class with him. How badly will his grade deflation hurt me in the short and long term? It seems like his class will be a GPA stunt or something. How do you get through these types of professors with a grade above a C+ (C++ pun intended)? 

Another worry is math. I usually get low B's or high C's in math, because math isn't my thing. I don't know why I'm better at programming than math, maybe it's a mental thing (I've heard they are similar). I've talked to a lot of people in the CS field who almost never use math beyond Algebra or ""cheat"" with google and stuff. I only need 2 yrs of it at this college and then it's pretty much over. I've heard that some specialties need zero to one elective math class at one of my potential universities. I won't be going into those field that produce people who invent languages or show stopping AI. How important is math beyond Calc for software or IT or programming or web dev. ? Again, math seems to be another GPA stunt.

And lastly, a question this sub gets a lot, is how will my GPA affect me in getting work? I have no confidence in me ever landing a Google job or anything. I'd be happy with a medium company or a typical heartless corporation or some bank that pays me $65,000+. I plan on doing internships, playing around with code (AKA personal projects), applying my code to my hobby in robotics, and getting my degree with at least a 3.0 GPA. I'm a social media director for a club at my school because I need something to put on my resume, make me take fun breaks doing fun stuff with Photoshop, and force me to go to social events. I do online transcription work (social anxiety, the last fast food job I had nearly killed my GPA, and the typical funky class schedule) and have a minimal social life because I'm so worried about my GPA affecting my job chances. My parents put school over everything, so that's also a thing. 

Any advice is appreciated!

4z4fxq,0,2016-08-22,F4M Some scenes to choose from!,DPPAPPRP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4z4fxq/f4m_some_scenes_to_choose_from/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."

4z4o2w,20,2016-08-23,[Crosspost from /r/jobs] Struggling to find a job ~4 months after graduation,roharia,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4z4o2w/crosspost_from_rjobs_struggling_to_find_a_job_4/,"I posted here before, but It's been almost 4 months since I've graduated. I've been applying to jobs all over the US including but not limited to CA, NY, KY, CT, WA, TX, and CO.

Applying out of state is awful because as soon as I tell the recruiter that I'm from out of state it seems like I pretty much seal my fate. I am willing to travel for interviews if they seem promising.

I know it's a number game, but I must have applied to a million places by now.

I've applied for both Software Engineering and Web Development roles. I'm in KY but I've been applying in CA with my uncles address (he has a spare house he said I could stay at if I need to).

I've only had maybe 3 interviews and like I said, as soon as I say I'm out of state (like they don't see my address on my resume) it seems as if I'm done. The interviews themselves went very well I thought. I spoke very clearly and confidently, and answered all or most of the questions with ease.

I really want to begin working and building my career. I'm not picky about pay (basically I will take about anything that is paid), I am willing to work overtime, I am willing to be on call on the weekends. I am not being picky about what I need to do or my roles. If they want someone that will work overtime, I will be that person.

I didn't go to a top school or anything, but I would say it was at least average. Ideally, I want a web dev role but I am willing to get into just about anything.


I'm willing to consider just about any state (although I would like to stay away from the South, just because that is part of the reason I am applying out of state and I've lived in the south my entire life). I went to school in CT though.


I have 3 resumes for different locations/roles right now:

1) http://rohanharrison.com/resume/RohanHarrisonResume.pdf

2) http://rohanharrison.com/resume/RohanHarrisonResume1.pdf

3) http://rohanharrison.com/resume/RohanHarrisonResume2.pdf


I have a website, which I think looks decent:

1) http://rohanharrison.com/

A Github, which I admit could have a bit more:

1) https://github.com/rohanharrison?tab=repositories

And a Linkedin:

1) https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanvharrison


It boggles my mind that I haven't had any real luck. My internship actually reached out to me last week and basically asked if I wanted a job, I replied with yes and they never got back to me. My boss messaged me on Linkedin and I replied there. I also sent an email yesterday in case he doesn't check Linkedin much.

I know it's a numbers and waiting game, but I'm really sick of waiting at home, not making money, not working, having no purpose, and living in this awful state. I don't even know what to do. I've applied with Glassdoor, Indeed, Linkedin Jobs (I got the Linkedin Premium Trial).


My internship background was mainly .NET/ASP.net stuff with Microsoft SQL. My personal experience is more towards Web Dev with PHP/JavaScript/jQuery/HTMl/CSS/MYSQL, etc. In school our default language was Java, but we also used many other languages and frameworks.


Please for the love of god, tell me what I need to change or do differently. I am out of ideas and I want to be out of here so soon. My parents have been (thankfully) very supportive and have tried to help me, but my dad being in a different field does not have many connections in software/development. 


**Edit since I posted to /r/jobs: I changed my resumes at the same link as above. Let me know what you think.
These were my resumes *before* I edited them. I made them more focused on my more confident skillset.**

With 3 semesters to go before graduating, I have no internship nor hefty personal project done. 


However, I do have much healthier mentally than ever before and strong will to succeed.


I'm retaking a course to get the F out of my transcript and increase my GPA this semester... and probably will be hunting for internships next semester 

( I want to make sure I'm out of probation before I start looking for an internship ).


I'm feeling confident that I can do well in upcoming semesters, however, I feel insecure about my future as I talk to my colleagues (@UIUC CE) who are coming back from doing internships from the big 4 companies... I honestly feel bad knowing how behind I am compared to them.


What do you guys think about my current situation and what could I do to put myself in a better position as I try to make this turn-around?

4z4p79,1,2016-08-23,Asking for promotion / raise too early?,csthrowaway1666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4z4p79/asking_for_promotion_raise_too_early/,"Hey all,

So I'm 3 months into my job as a Junior Software Developer, and I'm considering of bringing up the possibility of promoting me from Jr to....not Jr, so Software Developer.  

**Some background**:  This is my first job out of college and I had no internships.  Only 2 side projects that weren't that impressive I feel, but apparently I did exceptional in the interview.  How much they were impressed with my interview has come up a couple of times since starting ( I honestly thought I completely bombed my phone interview with them).  I was offered a 60k salary and had no other offers lined up.  The company is situated in the LA area ( silicon beach/santa monica ), where apparently my current salary is significantly(?) under market.  I was planning on bringing up that I am attempting to save money to move closer and pay off student loans instead of outright asking for more money.


I'm not sure of typical Junior responsibilities so part of this post is confirming if I'm way over my head and am doing what every Junior is expected to do anyway.
The following can pretty much sum up my time so far at this company:

* I am currently working on building a new API along with one other Senior Developer.  The bosses seem to be very happy with our progress and we have exceeded the deadline expectations so far.  
* Been involved with a couple of calls with high level managers from important partners where I was expected to and did answer a few questions / concerns they had.
* Onboarding new developers (about 4 devs (one who left after 1 week ) whom are all also 5+ years of experience)
* Refactored a very delicate and major part of an existing service, which significantly sped up the process while also making it less prone to breaking.  (This is also related to the calls that I mentioned I have been on, as this is mostly what they typically were regarding.  Some calls are regarding the new API I am on)
* My bosses have mentioned that I get along well with all of the other team members.  And I do actually really like all of my coworkers with one exception.
* I am typically the earliest dev to show up and the 2nd latest one to leave.  Not requested any time off yet, and have been in office every weekday. 
* Not sure it's worth noting, but I am the only native english speaker dev who is on site.



With this would negotiating for a promotion / raise be ridiculous?  Am I just at the level any Junior Dev is expected to be at?  Should I wait for at least 6 months?  

Looking for any insight.

Thanks!"

I am sending out my resumes for internships next semester and I was wondering if I should include my GitHub? It isn't very good; I have included some work there but none of it is too impressive. I also do not update my work there too often.

Do I still give them a link to my profile? Will it look like I am more passionate about Comp Sci if they know I have a GitHub? Or will they not care too much?

Also, there is a good chance some companies will see my profile because these are the ones I have referrals to.

Thanks guys!

4z4tre,2,2016-08-23,Kinda scared of the future.,ymetwaly53,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4z4tre/kinda_scared_of_the_future/,Let me start off by saying I know it says kind of but I'm actually very worried. I just saw on an ama that this guy who has a degree in marketing can't find a good marketing job and is very poor. This has me worried as I'll have around 30k (could change) in student debt by the time I graduate and I'm starting my freshman year in a few days. I have always been interested in business originally was gonna major in accounting and even got some college credits for it by passing my AP class but decided that's not what I want to spend the rest of my life doing. I ended up choosing marketing as my major with hopes that I can get a job or great internship. I guess my question is: Is there a demand in marketing jobs or did I make a huge mistake picking it? I haven' t chosen I minor yet but I've narrowed it down to computer science (because I know how to code and I like that stuff) and business management.

4z4xf1,0,2016-08-23,Learn all the languages?,qrto,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4z4xf1/learn_all_the_languages/,"Background: 

4th year CS student graduating next year.

Thus far, I haven't properly learnt any programming languages at uni and more just picked up enough to write the program for that assignment (e.g in C, Java, Python, Haskell etc).

The only language I actually have studied deeply in my own time (for an internship) is Javascript (and Angular).
________________________________________________________________________________________
Problem: 

I'm starting to look around for graduate jobs and am realising that:

1) The languages I have worked with, only cover around ~40-50% of the adverts I'm seeing. (e.g I've not touched C++, .net, C#, Ruby...)

2) Even the languages I have worked with, I don't seem to know deep enough (e.g. I know nothing about JEE, Hadoop, popular python libraries, other JS frameworks). 
________________________________________________________________________________________
Question: 

What to do? 

1) Quickly pick up as many other popular languages as I can and be left with an okish, but not very deep understanding of any of them.

2) Stick with just the languages I know now, and dig deeper into each one+their related technologies.

Any help would be much appreciated. Cheers!"

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, like many threads here, it's about one girl. 

In my case, it's about a soon-to-be ex-coworker. We've known each other for about 6 months, **she's friendly with everyone** (I shit you not, even with the interns), we weren't talking a lot, she **was with someone** at this time and I knew that a lot of guys were **hitting on her**. Moreover, you guys know better than me, coworker relationships can end up being really awkward, so I **didn't really pay attention** to her (even though I recognized that she was a decent HB7-8). 

We talked sometimes, our conversations were **pretty normal**, (the usual ""hey, how are you?"", ""good, how about you?"", ""great, have a good one"").

3 months ago, I started thinking about getting a job in another company, and for some reasons, that's when we started **getting along**. When I told her that I was planning to quit (here's a surprise for you guys, she's now the HR) she kind of felt ""heartbroken"". (""WHAAAAAT, YOU'RE LEAVING?! STAY WITH US"") and that's when I **got for her number**.

So, I decided to use my vacations, I went to visit South America (I'm from Europe) and we texted, a lot. (Asking when I was coming back, to send her some photos we took before I left, telling and showing me her new piercing...). 

We joked almost all the time, and she recently told me that she loved my humour. I don't remember why, but she told me that she **broke up with her boyfriend**. That's when I told her that we should go get something to drink when I get back.

Here's the thing, like she said, ""I'm technically still her coworker"", so we could do it, but she'd ""want to **keep it secret**"". 

I came back from my trip last sunday, went to work on monday and made a quick stop at her office, because I bought her a souvenir and to ask her if she wanted to grab something to eat. HR made the usual ""is it my wedding ring"" joke when she saw the gift, and her freaking best friend came at the same moment. So HR asked her friend to come with her, and I went to get a friend too.

Lunch ended up being pretty **boring** to me. We didn't really talk to each other, she mostly talked to my friend and hers. One hour later, everyone was working in their office.

I felt pretty bad for the rest of the day because I felt like she ignored me.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I just woke up to a text from her, telling me that she loves the souvenir and that she was flattered that I brought her something. I joked about how she thought I was ""proposing to her"". 

* **Me**: ""We're too compatible to be together, this will never work between us""
* **Her**: ""Oh come on, I had it all planned""
* ...(insert more jokes)...
* **Her**: ""Btw, I won't be at work today"",
* **Me**: ""Well, have a good one then""
* **Her**: ""😘""

Currently, we're only chatting with texts, I don't know if it is cool or not, but it's almost only jokes and I'm thinking that she's maybe just like that with everyone. I'd plan to invite her to get a coffee, but with yesterday's lunch, I'll probably wait until next week.
All I want for now is to get a job in another company, but it will take another 2 or 3 months.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: Getting attached to coworker who is over friendly with everyone, I'm about to leave company, we text a lot, but don't really talk IRL. Asked if she wanted to get something to eat/drink, she said that if we do, she doesn't want the others to know.

**Question**: What would you guys recommend me to do during this ""job hunting"" period. Any advice on how to know if she actually has some feelings about me? How can I do something if she wants to keep it secret?

I am pretty sure I am not only one browsing this subreddit now who can't sleep, there are 323 of us. And I am also sure I am not the only one online who lives in this particular timezone. And I guess I wouldn't be wrong if I say that there are some women browsing this subreddit currently too who lives in the same timezone as me, who can't sleep and who are lonely just like me, I mean why else would you be browsing this subreddit at 2:15 in the morning!

So now that I established you are lonely, I propose that we chat! A preposterous idea indeed. A very vile demoniacal proposal. What can we chat about you may ask? I have no clue I would reply! I literally know nothing about you stranger. All I have is a hunch that you are lonely. But a little bit of deductive reasoning will further reveal that you want to talk about something dirty like sexuality? I mean you are browsing a subreddit called dirtypenpals and clicked on a male 4 female link! Well, I want to talk about something dirty too. So I guess we have a topic that is interesting to both of us!

So let us explore this topic a bit. I will go first and tell you what sort of dirty filthy things I am into and then if you are comfortable you can PM me all the nasty, perverted things you are into! I swear I won't judge and even if I was a judgmental person nobody in their right mind would want to start a fight at 2:30 AM in the morning. Anyways lets not digress, I am into holding people's hands, talking &amp; eating in reasonably priced hotels which serve delicious food till they kick us out, watching movies in theaters and making out in darkness whilst everyone else is busy with the show, doing stupid things and laughing at each other etc., etc., 

None of that interests you? That is totally fine. Let's talk about our personal lives a bit then and see if we stumble onto something that is interesting to both of us. I am single, pursuing a masters degree in computer science. Will be TA'ing for a course starting this semester and I am shitlessly scared about teaching for the first time. I did an internship in a bank this past summer and I have saved up enough that I don't have to TA. But I am still doing it cause I believe it's going to be an interesting learning experience. I am a movie freak. I guess it is safe to say that I have covered almost 80 ~ 90% of the IMDB top 250 list. I am also a huge disco music fan. Earth wind and fire, bee gees, Boney M, even Micheal Jackson. I also listen to a fair bit of current music. I also want to learn how to swim!

Want to discuss plain sexual stuff? I will be more than happy to! Tell me what turns you on, tell me about the best sex you ever had, tell me what kind of sexual act turns you on the most, tell me what is the one sexual thing you always wanted to do but never got a chance to do. Describe to me how you look like! Your skin, eyes, hair color, your physical dimensions etc.,  Are you single just like me or are you seeing someone. Where did you meet your last boyfriend or your current boyfriend. Tell me all the fun sexual stuff that you guys do and make jealous. Be assured that I will masturbate to anything sexual you tell me about yourself ;)

Really eagerly waiting for your message, stranger."

After years of using an unlicensed version of PT10 for post-production work on student projects with no problem, I decided to upgrade to a full, licensed version of PT12 for the freelance work I've started to acquire. With this though has come a serious issue; video will not consistently play.

When I hit play, sometimes the video doesn't play at all, sometimes it will play for a few frames or seconds then freeze, and very rarely it will actually play just fine. I tried increasing the playback latency, disabling anti-virus, and more. Eventually I contacted the video editor for the film and had him export and send a new copy with a DNxHD codec. This process took days, and while it is marginally better, the problems persist.

After weeks of trying to figure this out, I'm starting to get very stressed. I have a deadline fast approaching and am getting to the point where I may have to rent some time in a studio where I did post production work as an intern in order to fulfill my obligations to my client, thought it would lose me money.

I know that there are known issues with the Pro Tools video engine, and I know that these types of questions have been asked before, but I have read dozens of those threads and followed multiple tips to no avail. If there you guys have any possible advice at all, I would be incredibly grateful.

No idea if or how this works or if it will just get buried, but I supposed I'm writing it for myself anyway.  About a year ago I hit my first 1 year sober bday, pretty much the longest stretch ever since I started drinking and smoking around 16.  During that time I went through some real shit...my wife moved out, I started doing harder drugs, I found out she started an affair with the guy that caught the garter I threw at our wedding....and the drinking and drugs got REALLY bad.  I almost lost my job, took a leave of absence, went to inpatient treatment and came back into the world feeling like I had some spiritual armor on.  In the following year I got through some amazing stuff sober--getting a new job, applying to grad school, selling my house, being kind through a divorce, deciding to leave my job and go back to school full time.  I couldn't believe how much I was capable of during that time and how healthy I became both physically and emotionally.  

Then I got cocky and fucked it up.  I used the week off I had between leaving my job and starting school to drink and ""blow of steam"" because I was back in control.  I've been battling to string together more than a week sober at a time for the past year, sacrificing my integrity for a whole list of shitty reasons.  Now I'm in Asia, 8000 miles from my home, trying to hold it all together and not totally blow the internship I'm doing now for school.  Not sure I've ever felt as alone as I do know--even when my wife left me in all that pain I had my dog there to keep me getting upright.

I guess I'm writing this for two reasons.  First, if anybody with some sober time asked me if it was worth going out and trying it out again....not.  A fucking.  Chance.  I've had some good times going back out once in a while to be honest, but it never stops there.  One good time leads to another and another until it doesn't and I wind up in the same place hating myself, too anxious to sleep and wanting to curl into a ball and hide from the world.  I could be on a precipice of a great life and I'm fucking blowing it and I'd give anything to be able to go back to last summer and slap that beer out of my hand.  Shit, I can't even believe it's been a year of this again...and it's largely a blur and full of regret and mistakes and embarrassment.  Living with that knowledge is at the heart of the anxiety and depression that's been building up in me.  Just my experience.

Secondly, I guess this is tossing out a lifeline.  I've spent the last two hours this afternoon perusing Imgur, came across a sober bday post, read some comments and wound up here.  In four days I fly to Thailand to meet up with my 2 year+ sober girlfriend who is the only reason I've made it through this year, and I have to share with her some of the mistakes I've made while being here.  I have not been a good employee or a good boyfriend  It will NOT be fun conversation and that's assuming I'll make it another week sober to see her.  I'm on the tail end of a three day bender, feeling like shit and already worried I won't make it to Saturday sober.

No idea how this works but writing it already has me feeling a little better and I'll continue to check in here and read thoughts of you guys who understand this shit.  

Fuck, I'm disappointed in myself..."

So I can get pretty dark and dirty; I'm certainly not going to be shy in abusing you.

[This is my kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/v5UKoBS.png) ; I enjoy degrading and abusing cunts, mother/daughter incest, snuff, fake tits, and being an Alpha Male. I believe that cunts have no rights.

Some scene ideas:

1. Job Interview. I am well known writer and despite my misogyny I received an option to be interviewed for a job at a Feminist magazine. You would play the managing editor, a powerful businesswoman (perhaps even a lesbian), and you are fully aware that I am a misogynist; but your magazine has seen declining sales and you honestly believe that my writing would increase sales. But you have to convince me to join, doing everything you can from increasing my salary, giving me your own office, to offering up your body and those of your very young daughters (ages to be discussed). You increasingly degrade yourself, your employees, underage interns and family until I am the editor and your magazine is no longer feminist.

2. Muscle Humiliation. You are a bodybuilder, with powerful muscles in your arms and thighs. You got large breast implants to continue to show off your feminity, but you are also proud of what you have achieved at the gym. No men ever approach you. Until I come in, an Alpha Male, and just start abusing you and calling you names, squeezing your breasts and suggesting a new gym outfit. You are thoroughly humiliated and come to agree to each of my demands happily, even when I start getting violent.

3. Girls School. You are the Principal of a girls school. The new school year is about to start but you are concerned that your school has been doing terrible in both grades and athletics. You decide that presenting a new image of the school will help, and decide that who better to determine that new image than the man who just moved into the house across the street from the school. You soon realise that this man has his own ideas of how a girls school should look and behave.

4. Fall of a Celebrity. A famous feminist, like Emma Watson or Daisy Ridley, reduced to being a fuckslut. Daisy Ridley could be using social media to promote the latest Star Wars film, gets degraded by a Star Wars nerd, and invites him to the set to prove him wrong. Instead she ends up being his cunt slave."

My bf has been exchanging messages on FB with two of his female interns/students to a point that I find exaggerated. THey talk about thinks that are not professional at all, and he almost always has messages from them whenever he opens FB.

To the point, that he started only checking FB when I'm not seeing...

I started to get really insecure, annoyed and paranoid about this, specially because he has always been super jealous with me. I've limited my life to a certain extent so as not to upset me and now he's talking to his female interns all the time? (and it's not about professional things?)

So I asked me if he could show me the messages. He was reluctant but he agreed to show them. With one of the girls, the message was deleted. there was only one message from the previous night, around midnight... she was sending him a song (it was a love song, but he doesn't understand her language, so I can't be sure whether there was any hidden meaning).

I got super mad that all the messages were deleted. I can't sleep because this makes really anxious. He denies having deleted them and says that they simply disappeared, but I seriously doubt it. I tried to add the intern's husband on FB, first I was accepted, and then I got unfriended and blocked. I suspect she might have done this, not him, because she's still my friend on FB.

he says he loves and doesn't want to break up, but I think there's was/is sth dodgy going on.

What would you do in my situation? I'm not afraid of walking away and leaving him, but I don't know if that's an overreaction.

I've spent most of the past year on and industrial placement with a decent-sized software company in the CAD/CAM industry. I was placed essentially in the internal infrastructure department, developing and improving the dev tools, plus some time with the automated testing team.

The tool I worked on most, by far, was the internal testing framework we used. It reads CSV tests, written by testers, that describes the steps to take, parses them and calls the relevant function. It's written largely in Java, with a Perl frontend.

I'd like to avoid being pigeonholed as QA, so how would I describe the experience above? This internship is the only software internship in have, the other being a Technical Sales Engineer at Cisco.

after playing the game for nearly 200 hours I'd love to bring some ideas into the development process. Since I'm not really sure if the Paradox crew may read this, I'll probably re-post on their own forums.
Since Paradox Interactive has a history of excellent post-release care for their bigger strategy games and they are known to have a solid interaction with ideas from the community I feel like this post will be worth the effort put into it.

Some of the points I will make are minor possible changes, some would be more elaborate game mechanics.

My method of gathering ideas for this post was just writing stuff down while playing the game to reassure that I don't rush out any stupid posts. So some of these ideas are a few months old, some have come into my mind yesterday.

If there's something in the following wall of text that has been already brought up from/implemented in the planning for Heinlein and which I didn't notice I want to excuse me in advance, it isn't my goal to steal anyone's ideas. But I'm not on the subreddit/forums frequently enough to know all the community's input.
If there are some writing mistakes/strange forms of writing: English is not my native tongue, so please forgive me minor (or major) errors in grammar etc.

But let's start the journey, shall we?


1. The possibility to set different quotas of mineral and credits for sectors to send towards your central government.

(Note: I will refer to the energy-currency as credits, towards minerals as...well... minerals and to both as resources in this text)

This one is simple: Sometimes the sectors as well as the central governments income are not ""equally"" divided between minerals and credits. So it may be necessary to just extract one kind of resource from the sector because the other one isn't needed or extracting both at the same rate would compromise the sectors intern economy in the long run.
As you are able to transfer resources towards sectors this is more of a comfort function, but something that may come in handy nevertheless. 


2\. A sector building override

First things first: I do like the general idea of the sectors as something to implement the disability to administer a galaxy-spanning empire with an highly centralised aproach.
But right now the actual state of sectors is a bit troublesome, because of a lack of administrative features that enable your central government to at least stop the sector from doing stupid stuff with the buildings.

In my eyes there are three viable options to keep the aforementioned administrative fluff-legitimation for sectors but still keep the sector AI from doing silly stuff. Or at least save the day after the AI did silly stuff.

a) The ability to just force the AI to build/replace/resettle something. That would be the most problematic option from the viewpoint of fluff but useful regarding the pure gameplay. 
Most players don't bother to micromanage everything so the AI would still do the most of planning, but micro-managing munchkins like me could make every world min-maxing heaven for their populace instead of waiting to develop one planet before putting it into a sector or getting it out of sector and than reintegrating it again.

b) Same as the first one but with something that I think would be more realistic:
Forcing sector AI to build/replace/resettle costs a little extra fee of maybe 1-10 influence (testing would need to be done for a proper amount) in this scenario.
It still makes it possible to correct AI wrongdoings but limits it so the ""self-governance"" style of sectors is preserved.

c) The third option is some kind of general building plan to force upon the AI.
The devs may realise it via an extra panel where you can set ""necessary"" buildings you want every planet to have in the sector. Like virtual combat arenas in a heavily happiness-based empire. This option is of course a bit clunky. Possible could be also extra conditions for buidings, like planet size... but at some point it could be overcomplicated, I guess.

3\. A general improvement on the fleet triangle formation

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't be a much smarter fleet formation a square (or a the fleet block of Sins of a Solar Empire, but I don't think that this is possible in the Stellaris environment) instead of the bloody triangle?
In a square you'd have more ships at the front line which means more firepower, where it is needed.

4\. Stability and cores

Although I do like that Stellaris isn't just ""EU IV in space"" I do think some basic concepts from there could be applied to the intern logic of Stellaris-governance as well. 
Right now it feels sometimes a little bit undercomplex for a Paradox title.

Especially stability and cores are something that would really be a great addition for Stellaris

a) Cores

Following scenario: Your xenophile-militarist Republic has just freed a world from the grasp of some awful galactic backwater monarch and required some new citizens by doing this.
Sadly their bureaucrats (difficult word) have a strange way of doing their work and the local elites aren't exactly sure what to think of the new top of the food chain. At the moment this is just represented through conquest unhappiness and the divergence between your and their ethics and this way dominantly based on happiness.

I'd argue that even if the populace is quiet a new conqueror would also need some changes in administration/elite behaviour to successfully run the planet. So the additional necessity of a administrative core like in EU IV (maybe just developed over time, with or without Infl cost) would be an enrichement towards the game. 

b) Stability
Mostly self explaining. Do your own buraucrats do what the government says them? Is there corruption? Do the nobles wear ugly hats? All nicely summed up in an overll stability modifier like in EU IV.


5\. A more fluid approach towards ethics

Take this with a grain of salt, but at the current state is (if I have understood correctly) that the divergence determines the ethos to spread in random directions (if div&gt;0) and develop towards your dominant ethos (if div&lt;0).

This is troublesome when facing spiritualists (a group with some dominant belief on some stuff), because they will change towards your ethic system over time if they aren't unhappy. If you have for example an materialist-fan. xenophile with high happiness their religion basically tells them to leave their religion. This is a bit of nonsense.

I'd prefer a split system with one modifier for ethics divergence (how strong ethics change) and another modifier setting a weighting for the possibility of a different ethics appearing in the process of divergence on a planet/populace.
This would stop the ""waiting for a unhappy people to relatively fast diverge till not unhappy anymore"" system right now in the game and give incentive towards decisions regarding taking  measures to make your ethos the dominant in the pool of possible ethics or stop divergence.

Of course all this would be relatively complex in terms of rebalancing and implementation.


6\. Changing your governments ethos

This one is rather basic again. Kind of an elaborate version of EU IVs culture change for government. If you have a big group in your borders with diverging ethics, you should be able to change your governments ethos to come closer to them. Maybe combined with some really unpleasant Infl costs or effects on the public order.

7\. More complicated government changes

Simple as well.
I think the idea of easily changing your government for (an admittably) high Infl cost is too simple. Maybe lock changes between democratic, aristocratic and monocratic governments behind event-chains, catastrophes or revolution styled rebellion stuff.

8\. More logically understandable sector government mechanics

This one has a funny backstory to it:
One day some guy complained about the sector ethics divergence on some forum and another guy replied that it depends on the distance of the sector capital. That was fault.

But this misinformations is actually a brilliant idea.
If they make the sector mechanics like a little mirror of the whole empire that could be pretty fancy. 
I imagine this: The player is able to set the sector capital. This planet functions a the ideological hub for the surrounding sector and has actually a lower (also based on its distance from the empire's capital) ethics divergence than the surrounding space. With every inch a planet in the sector is away from the sector capital there is a rising divergence penalty. Maybe it could be possible to set a ceiling of planet numbers in the sector above which there is an additional divergence penalty, much like the demesne in CK II. 

Example: Ceiling is 10 (the exact number would need testing)  planets. Those can be chosen by the player and only suffer the standard sector divergence penalty plus their distance to the sector capital. Every additional planet would get an additional divergence penalty.
This would encourage players to use more and smaller sectors (which of course costs more governors), which adds another layer of decision-making into the game. Also Mono-Sector empires could be prevented. Off course there would be a need for massive playtesting and adjustments of the exact numbers for ehics divergence (like lowering the base penalty for being a sector in this concept) regarding this idea.

Another advantage of the aforementioned idea is fluffwise: With certain empires you can run big mono-sectors at a certain point in time. But the ability to do so really strains the suspension of disbelief in my eyes, because the whole point of sectors is right now that in Stellaris an overcentralized empire shall be unablle to work.

Note: Maybe there is also room to give concessions towards (fanatic) collectivists at this point because of their centralization based ideology.


9\. Solar governors

I'm not really sure with this one, I'll say that. Maybe it could be nice to have solar governors instead of planetary governors? I feel like that would fit the move from having max planets towards having max solar systems under central command from a gameplay perspective. But maybe its actually to give an incentive for decision making where to put my experts.

From a fluff-viewpoint of course planetary governors make a little bit more sense. ;)


10\. More experts in the very late game

Also not really sure with this one.
I feel that (only) in the late-game you need more possibilities to upgrade your maximal leader-number.
In the early game the caps are fine I presume.

From a fluff-viewpoint it is debatable if the small elite of your central government makes sense compared to an state with thousands of billions of people in it.


11\. FTL-Travelling

Here comes something I'm actually pretty uncertain about., but I think it's actual a problem and localizing those is one third of the job done.

I do think that a part of why some of the Stellaris space wars are sometimes very tedious are tiny harassment fleets hoping around in your empire which you need to micromanage and that are pretty tedious to catch because your travel method differs from the one of your opponent.

I have no real solution to this problem other than building police fleets/posts to safeguard the intestines of my empire and I do also really like the variance this game has regarding FTL.

So I'd hate to have just one FTL-Method (we have an option for this ingame) but the clusterfuck that fleet hunting can be also is kind of annoying.

Maybe someone of you has a good idea towards this problem?
Maybe some kind of natural small FTL inhibition, but that would make problems with the intended parts of space warfare 


12\. Super weapons

I'd love to produce tomb worlds when roleplaying collectivist tyrants. Period.
Of course this would be need to be balanced (especially for multiplayer to prevent griefplay) maybe around massive happiness penalties  for everybody except xenophobes and collectivists (depending on the target and probably warscore) and also relation problems with the galactic neighbourhood.

Mechanicswise a fourth bombardement mode could do the job. Please no special project. :P


13\. New ""exceeding core systems penalty""

Without the silly empire wide modifier but organized like the states system in EU IV. If the system is above the limit of your space-demesne it could have worse public order, productivity or something like this.
This would be more reasonable than the one system over your planet limit tht makes the whole empire go haywire.


The following last three points will heavily intertwine with one another and to be seen as a whole:

14\. A rudimentary ""multilateral"" trading system.

This game needs more markets. Imagine it like the black market in Sins of a Solar Empire but more elaborate.
My basic idea is that two or more empires could join a free trade zone. This would give them access to an ebay-like system, where every member could offer resources/or even contracts to self-set prices. 

In an federation the free-trade zone would be mandatory. That would make alliances and feds a little bit more different again (I know that alliances are going to be kicked out with Heinlein, at the moment it is reasonable to do this).


15\. A rudimentary domestic market

This one is a bit more complex.
Has anyone ever read Asimovs Foundations Trilogy? Trantor sounds pretty neat. We can't have Trantor right now. Why do you ask? 
Part one of the answer: Because Food is too heavy to be lifted out of into space apparantly.

Don't get me wrong: I do understand why the food system is as it is right now, for the current built of the game it makes a fair amount of sense. But we can't have Trantor with its ridiculous dependence on imports which could be an fantastic feature for risk versus reward decisions.

My basic idea is to give every planet set sphere in which it can ""trade"" with other planets. That sounds complicated, but it isn't really. Just imagine multiple shared resource pools for food. This way dedicated agrary worlds could feed their surrounding space area, hell even efficiency buildings for food would make sense that way. Not to mention those Fallen Empire food paradises. If the agrary world is blockaded on the other hand... lets say things would get  a bit messy for the importing worlds.
Why a sphere limiting the access to food ex-/imports? Because can't send an apple from the one galactic end to another.

A second (bigger) sphere would be set for industrial products. In this special case the shared resource pool would make dedicated refinery worlds possible. This would of course need another special type of refinery which would synergize with the planet-unique Mineral Processing Plant. Lets call them  ""Refinery"" for the moment. Those would produce no mineral but give a percent-based bonus in their sphere of influence. This would give an incentive towards building them on one single planet in order to not compromise optimal industrial output on other planets. To make it attractive to build ""industrial planets"" there should also be a maximum of resources that these refineries could process. If the neighbourhood of the refinery planet produces more mineral than the refineries can process there will be need for more refineries on this planet. The whole concept should be balanced around longterm-investment and refinery planets should as a whole pay off big, but at a much slower rate than normal planets with heavy mineral focus. Needless to say the implementation may be quite challenging.

This would ad more risk vs reward decision-making into the game. Also the existence of dedicated agrarian and refinery worlds would add greatly towards diversity of playstyles, planet management.

Also the fluff aspect: This would just be pretty awesome.

16\. Going full Trantor

""I get the point of refinery worlds, but why should I do the agrarian world? The risk doesn't match the benefits and I can just place one of those super effective late-game hydroponics on one tile... no big deal"" you may say. 

At this point you are right. But now we come back at Trantor:
The unique thing about Asimovs idea is that the whole bloody planet has buried the natural soil under megatons of steel and other industrial material.

How could we implement this in Stellaris?
I took an idea from abroad there.
In an older browser game called ""Ogame"" there was an interesting idea of terraforming.
Instead of modelling whole planets like in Stellaris terraforming in Ogame was simpler:
You build a ""terraforming"" building on one place of the planet... and the building would produce a gross product of two new tiles.

How could we adapt this for Stellaris?
The concept of Ogame won't really fit for Stellaris.

But I'd like to introduce another feature I'd love to call ""Trantorizing"" for now.
And this needs to be a rare technology absolutely designed for late-game.
In this case, your civilization would take the planet and go full Japan with it. Enclosing it in an hull of space-concrete and futuristic equivalents of steel.
Trantorizing a tile would create two new tiles. But it would also suppress the collection of both minerals and food on all affected tiles. You see, where I am going with this? 

This gives you the possibility to have an highly specialized planet for science/commerce/refining industry (for the last see the chapter above) and double the population.

If the whole (important) planet is trantorized, the game will unlock another, second and final wave of trantorization. It will be much more expensive and absolutely targeted for the most longterm of longterm benefits.

The good thing: Your planet may become pretty fancy. Bad thing is that it now absolutely relies on food imports from less developed worlds that actually grow trees themselves.
Also it is important that this form of planet will never occur in large numbers; because of its supression of food and mineral an empire consisting only of Trantors would collapse under its own weight. The trantorized planet would be more of a massive hub for science/commerce/refining. The two step system of trantorization would on the other hand allow a big variety of playstyles regarding the actual implemantation by the player. With a first wave of urbanisation that can still leave soome farms intact, or a second wave that requires you to kill of food and mineral production first. Also it would set an incentice for designated food hubs to sustain the enormous second-trantorization population.




This have been my two cents on maybe improving or adding some game mechanics.
Thanks for reading so far and I would be really interested in hearing some opinions regarding this jumple of ideas that I just dumped here.

Have awonderful day,

LTL, very cautious poster (kinda afraid reddit will nail me to the cross if I post anything even remotely off-topic). Tonight, I'm sharing a tale with you from back when I interned at **$LCS**. [My previous story](https://redd.it/4yo0vm) will give you all the insight you need into **$LCS**. This is another tale involving **$BB**, but a clear shortage of customers.


This would be my 2nd week at **$LCS**. I've just gotten the hang of the problem report form (which was just a sheet of paper I scribbled in, and I kept it vague because we only ever really did virus scans and generic 1st-grade diagnostics). I've walked in to the store to find a new laptop sitting on the workbench, with a sheet claiming that the screen is faulty.

I turn the device on, and sure enough, I'm greeted to pink. No, not the band, or the artist, just pink. Squinting through my glasses, I can see there is an image being displayed underneath. And now, for our star of the night, **$BB** (**$BigBoss** for those who haven't seen my last story).

&gt;**$BB**: This laptop came in yesterday, I don't know how to fix it.

&gt;**$DJ** (me): It looks like there isn't much to be done, it looks like it is thoroughly f*ire tr*ucked.

&gt;**$BB**: Can you try to fix it anyway?

&gt;**$DJ['Out Loud']**: Sure, I'll give it a shot.

&gt;**$DJ['Internally']**: Sure, I'll happily procrastinate for the next hour.


Short of replacing the screen, which is what this dinosaur of a laptop needed (it really needed to be thrown out), all I could think of doing was screwing with the display settings. I suddenly remember a fix I had to a problematic monitor way back when I was still in primary school: Drop the refresh rate!

I swap the refresh rate from 60hz to 50hz, and suddenly I can see the screen again! There were still minor graphical problems, (screen would flicker and duplicate the image with a bit of an offset and transparency adjustment, as well as other things), but all in all I'd say it could be used again to recover data and transfer to a new device (without using caddys and stuff). Making a return is **$BB**.

&gt;**$BB**: Have you fixed it yet?

&gt;**$DJ**: As fixed as it's going to get. You will need to replace the screen in it if you want it any better, but it's not worth it in my opinion.

**$BB** takes this opportunity to actually take a look at the screen. He immediately notices the flickering and duplicate image.

&gt;**$BB**: This isn't fixed, why can't you fix it?

&gt;**$DJ['Internally']**: Because I'm just a lowly intern who has literally 1 week of actual experience, this is the first time I've seen this problem, and I don't have a god damn replacement screen to place into this dinosaur.

&gt;**$DJ['Out Loud']**: It isn't getting any better than this unless you order a new screen for this device. I'll go ahead and call the customer and see if this is what they want.

&gt;**$BB**: No, just fix it.

I proceeded to turn the laptop off, sign off on it, and put it on the out-bound shelf.

**TL;DR** Boss-man asks me to fix broken screen without replacement screen. I change setting to make broken screen usable. Boss-man expects me to make replacement screen materialize out of thin air.

Also sorry if this isn't really on-topic. I just desperately wanted to share another story and I only have one left I can really share apart from this, which is honestly my favourite."

This option is of course a bit clunky. Possible could be also extra conditions for buidings, like planet size... but at some point it could be overcomplicated, I guess.

3\. A general improvement on the fleet triangle formation

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't be a much smarter fleet formation a square (or a the fleet block of Sins of a Solar Empire, but I don't think that this is possible in the Stellaris environment) instead of the bloody triangle?
In a square you'd have more ships at the front line which means more firepower, where it is needed.

4\. Stability and cores

Although I do like that Stellaris isn't just ""EU IV in space"" I do think some basic concepts from there could be applied to the intern logic of Stellaris-governance as well. 
Right now it feels sometimes a little bit undercomplex for a Paradox title.

Especially stability and cores are something that would really be a great addition for Stellaris

a) Cores

Following scenario: Your xenophile-militarist Republic has just freed a world from the grasp of some awful galactic backwater monarch and required some new citizens by doing this.
Sadly their bureaucrats (difficult word) have a strange way of doing their work and the local elites aren't exactly sure what to think of the new top of the food chain. At the moment this is just represented through conquest unhappiness and the divergence between your and their ethics and this way dominantly based on happiness.

I'd argue that even if the populace is quiet a new conqueror would also need some changes in administration/elite behaviour to successfully run the planet. So the additional necessity of a administrative core like in EU IV (maybe just developed over time, with or without Infl cost) would be an enrichement towards the game. 

b) Stability
Mostly self explaining. Do your own buraucrats do what the government says them? Is there corruption? Do the nobles wear ugly hats? All nicely summed up in an overll stability modifier like in EU IV.


5\. A more fluid approach towards ethics

Take this with a grain of salt, but at the current state is (if I have understood correctly) that the divergence determines the ethos to spread in random directions (if div&gt;0) and develop towards your dominant ethos (if div&lt;0).

This is troublesome when facing spiritualists (a group with some dominant belief on some stuff), because they will change towards your ethic system over time if they aren't unhappy. If you have for example an materialist-fan. xenophile with high happiness their religion basically tells them to leave their religion. This is a bit of nonsense.

I'd prefer a split system with one modifier for ethics divergence (how strong ethics change) and another modifier setting a weighting for the possibility of a different ethics appearing in the process of divergence on a planet/populace.
This would stop the ""waiting for a unhappy people to relatively fast diverge till not unhappy anymore"" system right now in the game and give incentive towards decisions regarding taking  measures to make your ethos the dominant in the pool of possible ethics or stop divergence.

Of course all this would be relatively complex in terms of rebalancing and implementation.


6\. Changing your governments ethos

This one is rather basic again. Kind of an elaborate version of EU IVs culture change for government. If you have a big group in your borders with diverging ethics, you should be able to change your governments ethos to come closer to them. Maybe combined with some really unpleasant Infl costs or effects on the public order.

7\. More complicated government changes

Simple as well.
I think the idea of easily changing your government for (an admittably) high Infl cost is too simple. Maybe lock changes between democratic, aristocratic and monocratic governments behind event-chains, catastrophes or revolution styled rebellion stuff.

8\. More logically understandable sector government mechanics

This one has a funny backstory to it:
One day some guy complained about the sector ethics divergence on some forum and another guy replied that it depends on the distance of the sector capital. That was fault.

But this misinformations is actually a brilliant idea.
If they make the sector mechanics like a little mirror of the whole empire that could be pretty fancy. 
I imagine this: The player is able to set the sector capital. This planet functions a the ideological hub for the surrounding sector and has actually a lower (also based on its distance from the empire's capital) ethics divergence than the surrounding space. With every inch a planet in the sector is away from the sector capital there is a rising divergence penalty. Maybe it could be possible to set a ceiling of planet numbers in the sector above which there is an additional divergence penalty, much like the demesne in CK II. 

Example: Ceiling is 10 (the exact number would need testing)  planets. Those can be chosen by the player and only suffer the standard sector divergence penalty plus their distance to the sector capital. Every additional planet would get an additional divergence penalty.
This would encourage players to use more and smaller sectors (which of course costs more governors), which adds another layer of decision-making into the game. Also Mono-Sector empires could be prevented. Off course there would be a need for massive playtesting and adjustments of the exact numbers for ehics divergence (like lowering the base penalty for being a sector in this concept) regarding this idea.

Another advantage of the aforementioned idea is fluffwise: With certain empires you can run big mono-sectors at a certain point in time. But the ability to do so really strains the suspension of disbelief in my eyes, because the whole point of sectors is right now that in Stellaris an overcentralized empire shall be unablle to work.

Note: Maybe there is also room to give concessions towards (fanatic) collectivists at this point because of their centralization based ideology.


9\. Solar governors

I'm not really sure with this one, I'll say that. Maybe it could be nice to have solar governors instead of planetary governors? I feel like that would fit the move from having max planets towards having max solar systems under central command from a gameplay perspective. But maybe its actually to give an incentive for decision making where to put my experts.

From a fluff-viewpoint of course planetary governors make a little bit more sense. ;)


10\. More experts in the very late game

Also not really sure with this one.
I feel that (only) in the late-game you need more possibilities to upgrade your maximal leader-number.
In the early game the caps are fine I presume.

From a fluff-viewpoint it is debatable if the small elite of your central government makes sense compared to an state with thousands of billions of people in it.


11\. FTL-Travelling

Here comes something I'm actually pretty uncertain about., but I think it's actual a problem and localizing those is one third of the job done.

I do think that a part of why some of the Stellaris space wars are sometimes very tedious are tiny harassment fleets hoping around in your empire which you need to micromanage and that are pretty tedious to catch because your travel method differs from the one of your opponent.

I have no real solution to this problem other than building police fleets/posts to safeguard the intestines of my empire and I do also really like the variance this game has regarding FTL.

So I'd hate to have just one FTL-Method (we have an option for this ingame) but the clusterfuck that fleet hunting can be also is kind of annoying.

Maybe someone of you has a good idea towards this problem?
Maybe some kind of natural small FTL inhibition, but that would make problems with the intended parts of space warfare 


12\. Super weapons

I'd love to produce tomb worlds when roleplaying collectivist tyrants. Period.
Of course this would be need to be balanced (especially for multiplayer to prevent griefplay) maybe around massive happiness penalties  for everybody except xenophobes and collectivists (depending on the target and probably warscore) and also relation problems with the galactic neighbourhood.

Mechanicswise a fourth bombardement mode could do the job. Please no special project. :P


13\. New ""exceeding core systems penalty""

Without the silly empire wide modifier but organized like the states system in EU IV. If the system is above the limit of your space-demesne it could have worse public order, productivity or something like this.
This would be more reasonable than the one system over your planet limit tht makes the whole empire go haywire.


The following last three points will heavily intertwine with one another and to be seen as a whole:

14\. A rudimentary ""multilateral"" trading system.

This game needs more markets. Imagine it like the black market in Sins of a Solar Empire but more elaborate.
My basic idea is that two or more empires could join a free trade zone. This would give them access to an ebay-like system, where every member could offer resources/or even contracts to self-set prices. 

In an federation the free-trade zone would be mandatory. That would make alliances and feds a little bit more different again (I know that alliances are going to be kicked out with Heinlein, at the moment it is reasonable to do this).


15\. A rudimentary domestic market

This one is a bit more complex.
Has anyone ever read Asimovs Foundations Trilogy? Trantor sounds pretty neat. We can't have Trantor right now. Why do you ask? 
Part one of the answer: Because Food is too heavy to be lifted out of into space apparantly.

Don't get me wrong: I do understand why the food system is as it is right now, for the current built of the game it makes a fair amount of sense. But we can't have Trantor with its ridiculous dependence on imports which could be an fantastic feature for risk versus reward decisions.

My basic idea is to give every planet set sphere in which it can ""trade"" with other planets. That sounds complicated, but it isn't really. Just imagine multiple shared resource pools for food. This way dedicated agrary worlds could feed their surrounding space area, hell even efficiency buildings for food would make sense that way. Not to mention those Fallen Empire food paradises. If the agrary world is blockaded on the other hand... lets say things would get  a bit messy for the importing worlds.
Why a sphere limiting the access to food ex-/imports? Because can't send an apple from the one galactic end to another.

A second (bigger) sphere would be set for industrial products. In this special case the shared resource pool would make dedicated refinery worlds possible. This would of course need another special type of refinery which would synergize with the planet-unique Mineral Processing Plant. Lets call them  ""Refinery"" for the moment. Those would produce no mineral but give a percent-based bonus in their sphere of influence. This would give an incentive towards building them on one single planet in order to not compromise optimal industrial output on other planets. To make it attractive to build ""industrial planets"" there should also be a maximum of resources that these refineries could process. If the neighbourhood of the refinery planet produces more mineral than the refineries can process there will be need for more refineries on this planet. The whole concept should be balanced around longterm-investment and refinery planets should as a whole pay off big, but at a much slower rate than normal planets with heavy mineral focus. Needless to say the implementation may be quite challenging.

This would ad more risk vs reward decision-making into the game. Also the existence of dedicated agrarian and refinery worlds would add greatly towards diversity of playstyles, planet management.

Also the fluff aspect: This would just be pretty awesome.

16\. Going full Trantor

""I get the point of refinery worlds, but why should I do the agrarian world? The risk doesn't match the benefits and I can just place one of those super effective late-game hydroponics on one tile... no big deal"" you may say. 

At this point you are right. But now we come back at Trantor:
The unique thing about Asimovs idea is that the whole bloody planet has buried the natural soil under megatons of steel and other industrial material.

How could we implement this in Stellaris?
I took an idea from abroad there.
In an older browser game called ""Ogame"" there was an interesting idea of terraforming.
Instead of modelling whole planets like in Stellaris terraforming in Ogame was simpler:
You build a ""terraforming"" building on one place of the planet... and the building would produce a gross product of two new tiles.

How could we adapt this for Stellaris?
The concept of Ogame won't really fit for Stellaris.

But I'd like to introduce another feature I'd love to call ""Trantorizing"" for now.
And this needs to be a rare technology absolutely designed for late-game.
In this case, your civilization would take the planet and go full Japan with it. Enclosing it in an hull of space-concrete and futuristic equivalents of steel.
Trantorizing a tile would create two new tiles. But it would also suppress the collection of both minerals and food on all affected tiles. You see, where I am going with this? 

This gives you the possibility to have an highly specialized planet for science/commerce/refining industry (for the last see the chapter above) and double the population.

If the whole (important) planet is trantorized, the game will unlock another, second and final wave of trantorization. It will be much more expensive and absolutely targeted for the most longterm of longterm benefits.

The good thing: Your planet may become pretty fancy. Bad thing is that it now absolutely relies on food imports from less developed worlds that actually grow trees themselves.
Also it is important that this form of planet will never occur in large numbers; because of its supression of food and mineral an empire consisting only of Trantors would collapse under its own weight. The trantorized planet would be more of a massive hub for science/commerce/refining. The two step system of trantorization would on the other hand allow a big variety of playstyles regarding the actual implemantation by the player. With a first wave of urbanisation that can still leave soome farms intact, or a second wave that requires you to kill of food and mineral production first. Also it would set an incentice for designated food hubs to sustain the enormous second-trantorization population.




This have been my two cents on maybe improving or adding some game mechanics.
Thanks for reading so far and I would be really interested in hearing some opinions regarding this jumple of ideas that I just dumped here.

Have awonderful day,

Our relationship is that they are the 'investor' and we are creating/selling a more younger and a more innovative product than they do. A few months ago, I became a member of the team as an innovator (they already started in December, but nothing really happened in those months). As I noticed and recognized the troubles they were facing, things changed rapidly the previous months and due to some hard work, we were suddenly building actual products, creating a new design, new entity name and a good working environment. However, as we take 1 step forward, we soon take 22 steps backwards. 

There are some major issues in our business structure are holding us down from further growth:

- We have to show the HQ everything we are doing (from a simple Facebook post to the notes of our meetings), resulting in major delays in our work and development; 
- Every member of the team (except me) is working parttime for the startup (the other part they are working for the HQ), therefore there is a lack of clear communication and coordination within our strategy;
- We have no financial insight in the actual 'investment' (we have to show expenditures we want to make to the board of the HQ);
- Our strategy seems to change on a daily basis;
- In order to make some money and pay rent, we have to work on business from the HQ, which slows us down from creating our own business. 

Obviously, I tried to address these issues in several meetings. I feel that everyone is aware of the problems, but somehow nothing is really changing. It is very frustrating for me. Nevertheless, I am trying to keep the team motivation alive every single day... but as the days go by, I feel that in de end, we are going to fail. 

I am working at the company under an internship contract. I get paid very little, but somehow I am managing everything that is happening within the startup. I notice that, even after two months of working there, I suffer from psychological problems. I cannot think of anything else other than my work and sleep very little at night. My friends and family are also noticing my issues. It is literally taking over my life. 

People tell me that this is part of entrepreneurial life, and I guess they are right, but I also feel that this is going to kill me in the end. On the other hand, I don't want to give up to soon. My question therefore is: is this all part being an entrepreneur, or should I quit? Is our startup failing, or am I failing?"

(Computer Vision, Electrical Engineering vs. Computer Science)",AhmedOfAmerica,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4z72rt/am_i_in_the_wrong_masters_program_computer_vision/,"I did Computer Engineering in undergrad, but I did a software engineering internship.   
I already knew I enjoyed programming a lot when I started, but I looked at the undergrad program for CS and it seemed to mainly be geared towards preparing people for an IT career, and I was still interested in learning about Embedded Systems of which ECE had a lot of hands on classes for.     

My undergrad specialization was also in Embedded Systems and Robotics (I managed to get both in because I double majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering).  
In my senior design project, I had a Robotics project that heavily involved using OpenCV, that I enjoyed using a lot, so I decided to try and find a job in it while also applying for grad school, since again I knew most of those types of jobs required a masters degree or more.   

I still had the same problem as undergrad, deciding between Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I still felt like I enjoyed software engineering more than traditional ECE, but the dissertation projects I saw in the ECE department seemed a lot more interesting, and the fact that I already knew professors who were willing to work with me (both as a researcher and a TA) pushed me towards ECE.     

However now that I'm in my first semester I feel like the difference is becoming much more apparent. The specialization I'm in is called ""Computational Intelligence"", and it recommends taking two classes in the CSC department, but I'm also starting to realize where the differences arise.

For one thing, Computer Vision and AI is treated as a subset of digital signal processing (a topic that I completely ignored in undergrad) which also means that my degree will actually be in Electrical Engineering, and I'm a little bit worried about how that will look when I start applying for jobs (including ""backup"" software jobs if I can't find the ideal position).

A lot of jobs seem to require a ""PhD in Computer Science"", often with the caveat of ""or related fields"", but my experience from applying to internships as an undergrad was pretty much that a lot of company's filter out people that don't have the degree title on their resume, and that I really underestimated how different the skill sets of an embedded systems programmer and a computer science programmer are so i don't know how well my skills would translate.

I'm also worried about whether the classes are actually taking me in the direction that I'm trying to go because right now it just seems that they're focusing on signal processing and not algorithm and machine learning development.    


I don't know how to better articulate what I'm feeling, but I'm seriously considering changing my major for next semester and I just don't know if it'll be worth it and I was hoping to hear from the experiences of others working in the same field and how much their degree mattered."

Until early this year i had never kissed a girl before, or hold hands, and all that. Was very depressed and almost giving up college, things did changed a little bit when i got a nice internship at Volvo. Met some very nice people on my new work, started using the money i'm earning to buy new clothes and went back to the gym. 
Recently i joined a whatssapp group of FA's of my city, all the dudes are from a forum of FA's, so no one knew each other, the plan was to start hanging out, and making some friends.
 I had never tried to pick up girls, so i started to watch simplepickup and RSD videos on youtube, with not much hope thou, i think i'm a 5/10, so those guys on the videos are way more attractive than me, but i have this never give up side of me, the side that says, no matter what, i'll try, because i'm only got to be young one time, and i dont want to regret not trying harder.

Anyway, me and the other FA's dudes had already hung out quite a few times, and i still sucked at talking to girls, always needed tons of alcohol just to give it a try, needless to say not a single hug was given. Then one night was different, we went out to a club, i had no expectations, i just wanted to get drunk and laugh a bit. Me and my friend were on the dance floor and this short girl started looking at me, was obvious that she was into me, i hesitate, than the voice in my head screamed -""go talk to her you fucking moron"", so i did, she was betting with her friend who would kiss more guys that night, so yeah, she didnt think i was special or anything, but that was huge for me, like, she wasn't disgusted by me, i was at least good enough for her to kiss me, and so i did, first kiss on my life, was ok, i didn't reaaally enjoyed it, but was huge validation, like i said, maybe i'm not the monster i thought i was. we kissed for like 3min, then she left and 2min later was kissing another dude, anyway.

So 10min later i saw this girl, like super cute, way out of my league, skinny with short hair, dancing with her female friend, and there was like a bunch of dudes around them trying to get her attention. Then the voice in my head said something like -""look at these scumbags, lets go there and try to speak with her, we may not get anything, but at least lets show these assholes we have them balls to talk to a girl"" and so i did, i made fun of her drink, because she was drinking with a straw, and for my surprise, she responded really well, i said something about her hair, then she put her arms around me and smiled, i almost melted.

Again, i've had my first kiss just minutes early, and this was pretty much the first time in my life i was interacting with a girl one on one, the first one just wanted to kiss a bunch of dudes, interaction was zero. I had no idea how to flirt, so all i did was like saying she was smelling really good, for some reason i remembered a line from Ryan Gosgling on that movie, crazy stupid love, and started calling her fancy face, she then made me guess her name, which i did, she smiled and kissed me. Now yes, that was amazing, oh my god, i'll remember the felling forever, i wasn't drunk yet, so i remember every detail, holding her warm body against mine, my face touching her's, that was the most romantic moment in my life, we stayed the whole party together, i even remember some random dude saying we made a cute couple.

I got her number and we went on a date, which yes was my first date ever, but i think i'm pretty good at faking my behavior, so it went really ok for someone that never had any experience with being alone with a girl. Just the thought that a girl was getting out of her way to go in a date with me was awesome, didn't work out tho, we are very different, and she was way too young, 18yo. 
Since that day, i kissed another 4 girls, i still dont think i'm good looking, i mean, all of them were kinda drunk, i still dont have friends, all the FA's of the group are now in a relationship, and i do mean all of them, all of the 7 fuckers now have a girlfriend, so i dont have anyone to hang out with.

But i still have hope, now i'm going to start trying to speak with girls at my college, i dont care if i'm going to get rejected 79 out of 80, if i know that i can have that felling of holding a girl in my arms again i wont give up.
So yeah, we all need to hold on one thought, we only have this one life to do all the things we want, i mean think about it, how pathetic we all are, in the infinity universe we all live in, we are completly irrelevant, in scale of time, we are nothing, yet we fear the dumbest things ever.

I was always keen to excel and have done reasonably well in school as compared to the average cohort, however due to my terrible traumatic internship experience and declining interest in my field (it's the arts and advertising industry), I ended up being unemployed since May. I had a small job stint but eventually they laid me off because they had no jobs for me anymore.

I don't know why whenever people ask me what I am doing now, I always subconsciously lie and say I'm still working at that former studio blah blah and how I'm paid reasonably well. I managed to find a drama teaching assisting job on the weekends but it's not enough to pay my bills. I do enjoy teaching and plan to teach. However, I went on to tell people like wow, yeah, I'm also a drama teacher when I'm only an assistant.

I find that sometimes I do that with the guys I date too. I know I'm somewhat artistically inclined, I can paint, draw, write and sing reasonably well but not amazing yet I find myself constantly trying to ""sell"" my artistic talents and then they think I'm some amazing special talented genius of a woman when I'm really not that amazing, more like a jack of all trades. 

I don't know why I tend to find myself constantly trying to justify myself to others. Maybe it's because I hate to feel inferior among my friends. They are all either studying university which I couldn't yet afford or have full time paying jobs. I'm at a stage where I don't really know what I want to do with my life and definitely not continuing my major which I didn't like anymore.. But I feel bad that I'm just lying about my achievements without hesitation when in fact I've been contemplating whether or not to go out everyday because I'm getting so broke. 

I was thinking of working at the mall during my weekdays to get by for the time being and continue my weekend drama job but the thought of letting others know I probably work at retail selling clothes is almost, embarrassing? I really hate to think that way. I don't know what happened to me, I just lost track of who I am and all motivation to start anew. Here's a girl who scored a decently good GPA yet couldn't find a proper job out of college for almost four months now, who sits around and do nothing most days and feeling like a wreck. People would be shocked to discover what I'm actually doing now, being home most of the time and sinking into depression.

Am I turning into a compulsive liar? "

I made a lot of stupid decisions and I don't know how to fix it. I'm not even sure its possible now. *TLDR at the bottom* 

After High school I had no idea what I want to do. I went to study mechanical engineering to college but I hated it and quit after first semester. I really needed money and a job so I accepted one with no contract. It was a printing company, all I did printing and work with photoshop. In college we had one programming class and it was only class i actually enjoyed, so I decided to go back to college to study CS.

 I was really excited. First semester was great. I passed every class and I even got a contract at the job I was doing so I finally had something on my resume. Second semester I didn't pass calculus II. I managed to get an QA internship at a really big and well known corporation. Next year (third semester) I didn't pass another two classes and I got really depressed. Next semester I barely visited any class or lecture and I ended up dropping out again. 

And now here I am with two unfinished colleges, no money, close to no skill or job experience and a huge empty space in my resume. I feel like a loser.

My job is going to end next week. I would love to work as a programmer or tester but I dont feel employable at all. I have some basic knowledge of python, sql and a little java. I have practically no portfolio.

I don't know what jobs should i apply, what should I do, or what should I learn to be employable asap.

Also what do I say if someone asks me at the interview about what i did between colleges?
Please help me, i will be thankful for any advice

**TL;DR Dropped out of college, took contractless job, went back to college to study cs. Had a QA internship. Next year dropped out again. Now im depressed and unemployed. Please tell me what should I do now**"

I was told many times that I should brush up my programming skills during my Physics studies. I took the advice to heart and did as much coding as I could. Next and probably my final year, I have chosen computation-based modules. I am also currently doing an internship in a tech company.

I don't doubt that the knowledge I possess has great potentials, but I cannot see any clear career path ahead. It seems that apart from the research sector (which I'm not planning to go into), every other career option will throw away my physics knowledge entirely. Don't get me wrong, I love programming, and if I were offered a position in a top tech company I would accept with no hesitation. However, I think this chance is rather low for I have to compete against graduates with actual computing degrees.

I would therefore love to hear what many of the experienced individuals here would say on this matter. Furthermore, a more specific bonus question: what types of Masters programmes should I look into to gain specialised knowledge that can assist my career?

Any advice/guidance is greatly appreciated!"

thank you in advance fpr your advice and help!
Later this year I will be doing an internship in China for 6 month. I plan to travel after the internship, and thus I don't want to take my primary Laptop, which is a Thinkpad L450. It is just to large and to expensive to me. I don't want to bother much about material stuff while travelling and worry if someone will steal it or else. 
I do not need the notebook to be able to perform all the tasks during my scientific internship, there will be computers in the lab. What I need it to do is to be decent to write on, and be able to perform basic online tasks and office. Watch videos. Skype. 

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Maybe 250 €, less is of course appreciated, am considering buying used, Germany 

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
I am not sure about this 2 in 1 would be nice maybe.

* **How important is weight to you?**
as I will travel with it, it is a main factor

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
11''-13'', during 6 month in china I would rather buy a screen, than carry around a large computer afterwards

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
N/A

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 


* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 a not completely horrible keybord would be great.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

I just graduated with a degree in human development and family resources (essentially it's social work). I have always wanted to help people and I am very good at listening to people, offering them help, empathizing with them, etc. I enjoyed my internship (working as a case manager for at-risk families) but I don't think I can do something like that as a career. I think that I would get burnt out really fast dealing with as the depressing things related to the field. Additionally, I know not everything is about money but the higher salary in HR versus social work is attractive to me. Also, I really enjoy working in an office setting and paperwork doesn't bother me. 

Here are my questions:
What is the day-to-day like working in human resources?

I have no prior experience in HR and my major isn't in HR, do you think I'll stand a chance getting a job? (I'm fairly good at interviews, but I'm afraid companies might not consider me because of my major/lack of experience)

Do you enjoy your job? What are some of the challenges?

About how much of your time is spent working with people and how much is independent work?

What is your work environment like?

Metro 2033 was a game that made me note of many things; no game had thrilled me in such an amazing way and made me jump in my spot so many times, whilst also telling a story, which sparked the utmost interest in the sci-fi, thriller and fantasy lover in me.

When THQ shut its doors for the final time I felt terrible that the 2nd book's game wouldn't be finished. Only to find out soon later that Deep Silver had picked it up, and 4A games were finishing it!

So Metro: Last Light launched, to my pleasure I bought it on the first day because no amount of bad reviews would've stopped me from doing so anyway, I just wanted that story told too; mind you it is a great great PC game as it turned out.

Due to my undergrad studies, then internships, travelling abroad and then working etc., life (including hardware issues on occasion) just didn't let me play it as a whole and I wouldn't have it any other way. So I waited for that day I could start in the morning and finish by the night.


Today was that day and boy, was it worth it. From the graphical fidelity, to the physics, to the guns and play types variety, to long combats that left me speechless and out of breath after 5 minutes of nonstop action; the game made me think of how I moved, where I was and what I would do next so well that it was an absolute pleasure, a thrill and deeply satisfying to play it. The game, most importantly, has an amazing, 2 books covering, in depth and diligent thought provoking story.


Thank you 4A Games, Deep Silver, THQ, and Dmitry Glukhovsky. It was a true pleasure."

I'm not saying this to be a douche, I just wanted to make it clearer why they contacted me about an interview.

Recently I've learned that data science is the field i want to get into. The problem is that my only experience is basically thru online courses (Python and R courses). I still have two years left in school so my plan is to take as many programming classes at my school as possible (esp in Python and R), while still completing my physics degree.

The internship is for a startup i found on angellist. The interview is a video call. The intern description says R/Python and machine learning are ""required skills"". The issue is my R/Python skills are beginner (at best) and i know virtually nothing about machine learning. I didn't lie in my application (i just said i have R/Python knowledge).

I guess the one thing i do have going is the fact the internship is unpaid, which does decrease the applicants somewhat.

Data science is something I'm really interested in and this internship could be a good start.

Does anyone have any advice for my interview tomorrow? I just feel at this point im pretty underqualified for it but at the same time I'm really interested in it because the company also interests me."
4z9c8e,3,2016-08-23,Freshman CS Questions,ThePolychromat,columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/4z9c8e/freshman_cs_questions/,"Hey, all! Incoming freshman here. I'm planning on majoring in CS eventually, but I've still a couple questions about scheduling. I think I've bothered my advisor enough at this point, and I'd really like tohget some advicd from some other students/alums. And before you point me there - owners of CS@CU are evidently out enjoying their summers and haven't added me yet, much as I'd love to check there.

So:

1. How much is the Data Structures workload compared to Honors Intro to CS? I have a fair amount of programming experience, and I've actually taken my high school's version of Data Structures and covered what seems like a lot of the material, though I'm sure Columbia's is more difficult. Most of the people on here seem to recommend Honors, though - is that because it's an awesome class or because Data Structures is going to suck first semester freshman year?

2. I've seen Discrete Math thrown around, too, from time to time. Since I've got the calc requirement out of the way, I was thinking of either taking that or Linear Algebra (which I'd also be repeating, but that was one class I really wouldn't mind taking over). My advisor's response was essentially ""OK, if you want to,"" so I'd love to get some opinions.

3. When should I *really* start looking for internships? I've gotten so many mixed responses to this that another few can't possibly hurt. I'm more interested in the security and would love to learn the systems/servers side of things, but it seems like there's a major catch-22 when it comes to learning those skills - you need experience to get a job to gain experience. Preferably, I would like to amass enough experience to actually be *paid* for my work when I graduate. 

Anyways, sorry if some of these questions are kind of silly - just an anxious little freshman here stumbling around like a newborn calf or whatever. I don't want to take an overly ambitious courseload and then die under a mountain of work."
4z9jom,0,2016-08-23,Since we haven't had a MacBook Review in a Week...,adunofaiur,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4z9jom/since_we_havent_had_a_macbook_review_in_a_week/,"iPads made laptops better. They raised expectations for lightness, screen-quality, and responsiveness. And, most importantly, they did so without compromising on battery life. But what about the MacBooks?

Apple's MacBook Air is a bit old nowawadays (it's external design is from 2010!), and with age comes a certain form of maturity. It's a quick computer for all your ultraportable needs - web browsing, writing, coding, light photo editing - and it has a robust selection of ports. The battery life on recent models is also insane, with run times of over twelve hours being entirely obtainable. But with age also comes drawbacks - though not outright obsolescence. By this I really just mean the MacBook Air's screen. It's a 1400x900 TN panel, which is to say that it's a legible display that isn't particularly colorful or sharp. In a vacuum it's fine, but it's absolutely destroyed by the 3840x2160 IPS panels in the Dell XPS 13 (and the Dell is the same price as a MacBook Air). The Air's weight (a little under 3 lbs) is also entirely passé these days - though tt's worth noting that it set the standard. 

With it's new MacBook, Apple sets out to reclaim its lead in weight, screen quality, and sex appeal, but it loses the benefits of maturity. 

Let's start talking body. The MacBook is an absolute marvel of industrial engineering and design. The chassis curves precisely, it's every edge machined with absolute intention. I don't mean to sound like a marketer, but it's undeniable that the MacBook is a new benchmark in design. At a mere two pounds, it's light enough to sling around like a tablet. And it's so compact that you can mistake it for one at a distance. Absence completes the illusion, specifically the absence of fans. The MacBook cools itself by dispersing heat through its aluminum unibody. In practical use, it gets just warm enough that I notice it, but not warm enough to be uncomfortable. I've heard reports that it can throttle if pushed to its limits, but for my usage (web programming, Google Doc-ing, watching videos) it's never complained.

Speaking of performance, I'm happy to report that the MacBook exceeded my expectations, but not my wildest dreams. Running a dozen Safari tabs, Photos, iTunes, a couple Pages documents, iMessage, and Brackets worked quite well. Responsiveness overall was very good, though scrolling in Safari would lag from time to time. Safari was also a little cantankerous opening new tabs as well. Actually, Safari's been lagging for me on the MacBook Pro my internship assigned me too, so it may be an application-specific issue. My one complaint is that Apple may be a hair too aggressive in pairing the MacBook's core m chip with a a Retina display and macOS. Small frame hitches occur in places like iTunes and opening Mission Control. They are  minor, but if you're sensitive that kind of stuff, using the ""reduce transparency"" setting [which you may want to do anyways to maximize legibility] will patch that up. Personally, I leave everything on the default settings.

If you'll indulge a brief rant, I am vexed by many tech reviewers. These professionals have a bad habit of calling the MacBook underpowered because it's slow to render 4K video. Never mind that it's an ultraportable and that anyone looking to edit video professionally should aim for a laptop with a dedicated GPU anyways. It's just not a relevant criticism for this device class. The MacBook (and other Core m-powered laptops) are more than sufficient for most people. It's not like the 15w i5 in the Dell XPS 13 is going to be ideal for that anyways. I assume that most reviewers are salty that the MacBook Pro hasn't been updated for like 18 months, but taking out those feelings on the MacBook is asinine.

Now, as for more relevant criticisms, let's take a look at the MacBook's port. It's a USB-C port which supplies power, can run an external display, and, if you have an adapter, can be made to work pretty much any other port you can think of. Personally, I don't really mind that the MacBook only has a USB-C port and a headphone jack. I almost never plugged anything into my MacBook Air, and I don't mind continuing that trend with the MacBook. What does bother me is losing the MagSafe adapter. It was very, very convenient to have a magnetically-attached power cord. 

Speaking of power, the MacBook last me about eight or so hours on a charge. That's good news for a student, but office workers will have to keep a charger at their desks. My standards are kindof low (even new, my MacBook Air only lasted about 5 hours), and I will mention that other laptops last longer. For a two pound laptop, the MacBook is best-in-class.

Now, the MacBook's most significant advantage over the Air is it's shiny new Retina display. It's got about 220 PPI, which means that at laptop-viewing distance it's fairly hard to see pixels. The display is really, truly beautiful, but not quite best in class. Blacks are a little bit crushed, so if you spend a lot of time picking between dark shades of gray you'll be unhappy, but no one else should care. In comparison to the Dell XPS 13's 4K display, the MacBook's isn't quite as colorful or sharp, which is a bummer.  However, Windows laptops are still a bit of a mess when it comes to super hi-res displays. Newly updated apps will look great on a 4K Windows laptops, but many older programs will be blurry or unusable. Apple, on the other hand, seems to have figured out how to get everything into working order. In a few years, hopefully I'll be able to recommend HI-DPI Windows laptops, but that time has not yet come. Until then, the MacBook's Retina display is the most practical way to get hi-res laptop experience.

This review is already getting a bit long, so I'm going to rapidly cover the other relevant parts of the MacBook life. The trackpad is perfect, though only marginally better than Dell and Razor's best. The webcam is bad, which is sad but doesn't affect me. The keyboard is a mixed bag. The keys are larger than usual (yass), but have next to no travel when you press them. Still, they make a nice click and the physical feedback isn't bad. From my perspective, it's a slight regression from the MacBook Air. Speakers, holy cow! Not sure how you get so much sound from something so little, but they're great from impromptu dance sessions in front of my mirror.

If I've not made it clear, I'll be a little ham-handed in my opinion: the MacBook is the favorite piece of technology I've ever owned. It's beautiful, functional, and pink! However, my unabashed love should be contextualized by the reality that the MacBook is not my only computer. I have a desktop to fall back on if I ever need to a ridiculous amount of multitasking (like a literature review). 

The MacBook is also very, very expensive, starting at $1300 for a 256 GB SSD. Comparable laptops often retail for $999 with a 128 GB SSD, with a $1200 model with 256 GB. So the MacBook only commands a $100 premium for it's futuristic form factor, which as far as Apple taxes go isn't bad at all. In absolute terms, that's still a lot of money. The MacBook's price is justifiable, but not necessarily reasonable, affordable, or practical. For me, macOS is worth the extra money, but if you aren't bound up in Apple's world buy a Dell XPS 13 instead. 

The MacBook is a special laptop, the first in a new wave of ultra-ultra-portables that you can fall in love with. But laptops haven't improved that much in the last 5 years. A 2006 laptop in 2011 sucked, but a 2011 laptop in 2016 is a relevant computing machine. I wonder what I'll think of the MacBook in 2026.

4z9kja,1,2016-08-23,What is a reasonable hourly rate for a junior-level (2-3 years of experience) freelance UI/UX designer?,topical_mango,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/4z9kja/what_is_a_reasonable_hourly_rate_for_a/,"I recently put in my two weeks at the startup (6 years old) I've been with for almost 3 years where I started as a graphic/web designer and more recently have been focusing on UI/UX for our products. I left to pursue freelancing, as well as work toward a full-time position on a side project I've been working with for over a year.

I am the only designer in my current company and have a hand in nearly every part of the business from marketing to advertising to branding to UI/UX design to print design. I am also one of the most tenured employees. Of the ~30 employees, only 4 have been there longer than I have.


Several months ago - around May - I negotiated for a change in title of graphic designer and salary of 36k to a title of UI designer and salary of 70k (still about 15k below the average going rate in my area). I had been focusing almost solely on UI/UX design for our mobile app and client websites for nearly ~9 months at this point, in addition to the other things that were being asked of me in other areas of the company. 


I ended up getting a raise of +19k to 55k, but no change in my title. The reasoning behind not giving me the title and subsequent pay increase I requested was a lack of formal schooling (I did not major in Design in college). Although I can't say that I was upset with 55k as a 24-year-old...


Immediately after letting them know I was leaving - as in during the same meeting - they offered to contract me as a part-time employee as I ramp up into a full-time role with my new company. This sounded great... I can start my freelancing career with a consistent client already in the bag and I can make more money for my time while working on more focused aspects of UI/UX compared to the massive scope of things I was responsible for prior.


After a meeting with my boss (product manager) today and discussing what projects I will be focusing on in my last few days and the coming months of contracting, I asked about compensation. He told me that accounting had mentioned pro-rating my previous salary and basing my hourly pay off of that amount. Which comes out to around $26.


This feels like a low hourly rate for contracting purely for the graphic design related needs, and **very low** in regards to what I've read a lot of freelance UI/UX designers charge (most of what I've seen ranges from $50-$150/hr depending on experience).


My frame of mind is this:

I quit because I wasn't fulfilled at the company, was held back creatively, often presented ideas and solutions to problems with real-world case studies and research yet was told ""no"" without any of the above, was being asked to do things that I felt were a waste of my time and below my skill level (literal busy work that any intern with photoshop/illustrator could do)... the list goes on.


But the bottom line is *I* quit. And they immediately asked me to come back in any capacity I could manage. It's not as though I was fired and then they asked me to come back on part-time a couple months later.


So - I am just trying to gather any thoughts or advice I can on how to approach this situation, from what I should negotiate towards for my hourly rate, to how to handle this whole contracting thing, etc. Really anything helps right now.

**tl;dr** - Web, Branding, UI/UX designer. Starting out freelancing. Company I just put in my two weeks with has offered me a contracting job after I leave, but at an hourly rate equivalent to my previous salary prorated $26. I feel this is low. I'm not crazy to think this is really low, right?


Thank you!"

4za5aa,7,2016-08-23,Seeking advice- just read that Nmom has completed a course specializing in dementia as a financial planner,yawnlikeyoumeanit,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4za5aa/seeking_advice_just_read_that_nmom_has_completed/,"WALL OF TEXT WARNING, so here's the 
TL;DR - Nvessel could be setting herself up to steal from people with dementia.  I can't ignore my moral obligation to bring her history of identity theft to her employer, and am looking for suggestions of how to do this without destroying my relationship with my sister, and could really use some support right now.

I kind of want to call her Nvessel because I feel so disgusted right now.  Went NC 8 years ago because she stole my identity and created a bunch of fraudulent accounts for a popular international ""direct sales we're-not-a-pyramid-scheme"" makeup company for women (being vague because I don't want to give her Google fu any fodder to find me online; ironic because I periodically Google her to see if she's up to any shenanigans for reasons I'm about to outline.  Anyways.); there were a number of other reasons why I wasn't speaking to her at the time but that is what made it stick.

I declined to press charges because I was so emotionally drained; she had tried to contact me, pleading that I don't do it because she'd lose her job selling RESPs, and the officer in charge of the case was explained how she was sitting there at his desk and was incredibly upset when he asked me if I wanted to pursue the matter further.  She would have been charged in a town located hours from where I was living, as that's where the crime occurred, and I just didn't have the energy to continue to pursue the matter.  I figured because I was keeping an eye on my credit reports and I had reported the identity theft to the RCMP and had a fraud watch placed on my identity, that I had covered my bases and I could drop the matter and get on with my life, which was so much better without her in it.

Like I said, I've googled her (and other names, terms, etc., that she might be using) once every few years to check and see if there's anything suspicious on her end regarding me or anyone else in my family.  Two years ago I saw that she had become a financial planner.  Immediately I wondered if I should contact the company she works for and let them know what she had done.  But I didn't.  I don't have a good reason other than selfishly protecting my own mental state; I felt a strong moral obligation to, but I have ignored that guilt that arises from ignoring that.

Tonight I googled again, and saw on her LinkedIn that she pursued certification in one of those meaningless private centres for planning for those who suffer from dementia.  I can't ignore this any longer.  The real problem is, I can't turn to my sister to ask her if this is just because my grandparents suffer from dementia.  Nvessel is their caretaker, and recently landed in the hospital and left care of them to my sister, who is a full time student who was about to embark on her mandatory internship.  My sis had to drop everything in her life because of the sickening irony that Nvessel had not prepared at all for the possibility of not being there to care for my grandparents (and the only reason why she lives with them is because she decided to stop paying her bills and her house was foreclosed on).  They're located in Ontario, and have access to homecare through OHIP, but Nvessel is selfishly leeching off of them, and as we recently learned through this experience, was borderline neglectful of their health care- they weren't taking their medications properly, with little supervision in that regard.  The relationship between my sis and I is precarious at best, we both love each other and want to support each other, but my sis has the N habit of jumping on the defense whenever I've brought up what has happened to us (her identity was stolen too, but she decided to keep this toxic, selfish woman in her life), and she refuses to recognize the abuse we were subject to from both of our parents.  So I can't turn to her and ask her if this something she pursued because of our grandparents, or a direction she's choosing to pursue professionally.  If it's the latter, I can't sit and do nothing anymore.  I mean, the certification is listed on her LinkedIn.  I have my answer there, I guess.

I don't know what to do.  Should I contact her employer?  Since I didn't press charges, and didn't provide the makeup company with the documentation they requested to pursue her themselves (which was incredibly irresponsible of me), I don't have much of a case other than my anecdote.  But she is dangerous if she's in the position of controlling assets of those who can't speak up for themselves and are unaware of what's going on.  And this could potentially destroy my relationship with my sister- Nvessel is a disgusting and selfish human being and won't hesitate to paint me as a vindictive and bitter person who is out for revenge.  Sis is smart, but heavily invested in that relationship and I don't know that she'd see what I would do for what it is- trying to stop her before she destroys someone's life.  I can't see a way to do this anonymously.  To be honest, one of the reasons I told myself to hold off on contacting her employer initially was because I figured the next person she stole from wouldn't hesitate to charge her.  But she could be targeting such a vulnerable group of people.

Many of my friends have amazing full-time jobs and I'm still working part-time struggling to look for someone to hire me. I feel like I'm so behind compared to my friends and they keep telling me that I'll get something one day but just keep getting rejected. I've had 9 interviews total but no offer because I suck at interviewing (I know this because I get nervous in almost every interview). I'm still searching since I have to keep applying until someone says ""yes"". Sometimes I feel like I don't have much job experience even though I have a great combo of internships and part-time jobs including the one I have now (3 years total). However, at the same time I know that I'm good enough for some company/organization out there and I just have to be patient but it's tough because I thought that if I had a Master's, employers would want me more. However, it's not how it seems anymore. Sometimes I just wonder what I should do next since nothing is really working for me. My connections have failed me also. Neither of them have told me about who's hiring nor would they consider hiring me within their company (that includes where I work as well). I love where I work and everything but I want to upgrade myself already and I can't move out of NY since I don't know how to drive. So there is no option for me now except to stay here and it's upsetting really."

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

4zb20p,2,2016-08-24,Thoughts on how to properly handle this situation.,bionicbrit,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/4zb20p/thoughts_on_how_to_properly_handle_this_situation/,"Ok short background. I'm one of three interns at a small contracting company. The office I'm in only has about 30 or less eployeees (including the interns). The interns are only allowed to work on capital projects, and to shadow other members who are full time employees. I am the newest one to the team. I've been there for roughly 5 weeks and seemed to have gotten along great with all but one of my co workers, or so I thought. Above me is my supervisor, Jimmie. We are on the face of the company as far as working with our clients. The other interns and I have been running out of work on a daily basis, finding ourselves ""bored"". However my supervisor and two of the full time members above us have been absent from the building for a large portion of my time there, often leaving us alone for full days with little to no work. So instead of sitting there all the time next to the large pile of completed projects I have been shadowing a few people on the networking side of the company ( with awknowledgment of the overall head of operations (nathan),  Jimmies equal on the ladder bill, and the person whom I am shadowing. Now, I've asked on numerous occasions to shadow people when there is no work, and haven't been told no or given warnings. I also jump to help all the time when someone in the office asks, even if it's just moving a mid sized computer to storage. I've spoken with the others, and have heard then complain about the other male intern being lazy and not helping. This all has been going on for weeks (at least the me heloing, shadowing and us interns finishing every task ahead of schedule). 

SKIP TO TODAY August 23rd

All is quiet in the office, then out of the blue someone asks for a few hands to help a large move. I offer my help, but then Jammie sends the others and drags me to his cubicle. He sits me down, 1 on 1, and the conversation goes a little like this:

Him: I'm not beating the bush, I don't like you, your personality, or attitude. I haven't for weeks. People are saying you're lazy, not helping, giving sass, and refusing to learn anything. People have complained that all you do is sit on the phone all day and play games. Let me also tell you, I'm not happy that you're going behind my back to shadow people and pick up other tasks. If you want work come to me, or inform Bill. I need to have some clue as to where you're at.  ( he says in an extremely hostile tone)

*keep in mind his boss requested I shadow people ok the network side, and even has them come escort me over there* 

Him:  I'm also sick of you asking the same question s over and over. You don't seem to take this seriously. If you're bored then just come to me and I can send you home. 

Me: I believe what you've heard is false, and what is it exactly you don't like? I'm sorry for using my phone. 
(In the heat of rage that was building inside me I forgot to tell him I've had permission, and to point out the fact he signed my internship forms numerous times saying that I've shadowed the other side and picked up projects on my own, giving me a 8+ on everything with no negative comments. )

Him: I don't like little things you do. I don't know, anyways I'm  done, I'll be discussing things with the others too. Get back to work. 

So as I go back to the intern room, the others arrive. He then shows up shortly after, closes the door, and in a gentle  voice says,"" I've gotten complaints about you guys being on your phones, being rude, and turning requests to help the full time employees out dowm. Let's try to change that, I figured I'd talk to you all as a group so BionicBrit  wouldn't feel singled out.  (Proceeds to stare at me the entire time) As far as you all having no work, come to me and I'll find something. If I can't I'll have you shadow someone, just like Bionicbrit is doing over on the networking side."" He then turns to me and says,"" sorry for giving you the brunt of the complaints,""smiles &amp; laughs. 
 
I don't feel like he was being genuine, and I feel like I was wrongfully targeted. Our HR rep is only available via email and phone. I have many questions, such as:
Why wait so long to bring up issues?
Why have the need to bash me one on one, then try to act like it's all ok, even though you did nothing to fix the issue?
Why complain about me to my face, not bring in those who made the false accusations and figure out the truth either before or during the meet?Is there  any documentation this conversation happened? 
But those are ones I mainly have him, and what I think I should ask if I get a meeting with HR. 
So to you reddit I ask, how should I approach the issue, what should I ask, and what should I avoid? How good of a case do I have at proving that his behavior is personal and not professional? 


Side note: there is a full time spot open, I have to see him again tomorrow, no one else knows that the conversation happened, and I think the accusations are meant for someone else. Names have been changed to protect those involved, and the strong language has been removed (all him, and my thoughts). Hopefully I gave enough information, if not I'll respond to any query in the comments. "

Since it is mostly for work, I need it to be very professional looking as opposed to the loud designs most gaming laptops have which is what I've seen with the specs I need.

* 15in. screen preferably. Cheaper is better in this regard and as long as it fits in a backpack.
* I'd like an HDD as well as an SSD. If it doesn't have an SSD, the option to add one is a must.
* 16GB of ram. but if it is DDR3 then the amount of memory doesn't matter because I have 2x8GB already.
* Decent processor. i5-6300HQ and above.
* Battery life, if it is above 2 hours I'll be okay.
* Screen quality. Better is best but no real preference.
* Touch screen, type of keyboard, fancy lights are irrelevant. Probably not even in my price range
* I'd prefer discreet graphics like a 960m but it's not necessary. Most laptops with similar specs seem to have one anyways. I'd like to be able to play Rocket League at high settings, but it's certainly not a deciding factor.

So I can get pretty dark and dirty; I'm certainly not going to be shy in abusing you.

[This is my kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/v5UKoBS.png) ; I enjoy degrading and abusing cunts, mother/daughter incest, snuff, fake tits, and being an Alpha Male. I believe that cunts have no rights.

Some scene ideas:

1. Job Interview. I am well known writer and despite my misogyny I received an option to be interviewed for a job at a Feminist magazine. You would play the managing editor, a powerful businesswoman (perhaps even a lesbian), and you are fully aware that I am a misogynist; but your magazine has seen declining sales and you honestly believe that my writing would increase sales. But you have to convince me to join, doing everything you can from increasing my salary, giving me your own office, to offering up your body and those of your very young daughters (ages to be discussed). You increasingly degrade yourself, your employees, underage interns and family until I am the editor and your magazine is no longer feminist.

2. Muscle Humiliation. You are a bodybuilder, with powerful muscles in your arms and thighs. You got large breast implants to continue to show off your feminity, but you are also proud of what you have achieved at the gym. No men ever approach you.

You decide that presenting a new image of the school will help, and decide that who better to determine that new image than the man who just moved into the house across the street from the school. You soon realise that this man has his own ideas of how a girls school should look and behave.

You've said that its hard to relocate houses and npc's because of the coördinate system. Can you give us an insight as to how you normally relocate/make a new building with npc's? 

2. What would be the process of relocating 1 house with 1 npc in it?

3. Is there a possibility that an intern can get onto redesigning Zeah? This would save the current team much time and he/she can be a future runescape content designer.

4. Can we see some data on the amount of new players joining when the reddit post of /u/gentletractor got to /r/all?

5. You've said before that the map designing tool is very complicated and can therefor not be published. Is this tool made by Jagex? Is there a possibility we can see the tool in action on some stream?

6. /u/ModMatK When is the dater stream coming?

I got a parking ticket worth more than 400$ back in January in downtown Toronto. After having read that pleading guilty generally reduces the fine by half, and being a student with limited disposable income, I decided to go along the path of taking the ticket to court.

I was hoping this ticket would be settled in few months while I was in Toronto but I just got a court date today, almost 8 months after the incident. The problem is, at the time, until early August, I was doing an internship in Toronto, but I just moved back to Montreal two weeks ago.

I will be in Montreal attending school in the assigned court date; not to mention doing a commute from another Province with the round-trip ticket price and lost time isn't worth the reduction I'm going to get through pleading guilty. Hence I I rather not physically attend the trial. Also, asking someone to take time from their busy schedules to attend my trial as my representative is a huge favour to ask; something I don't feel comfortable with.  

At this point, I am considering just paying the full amount and by-passing this whole ordeal. Is this even a possibility? Can I just pay my ticket at the city offices and not show up on my court date?

Alternatively, is it possible to send a written statement to the court or attend remotely through teleconference?

Please let me know, if you know anything about legal procedures pertaining to my case.

I'm in desperate need of advice.

Thanks"

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also very much wanting to do a RP based off The Witcher.

Here’s my resume :

Finished high school in France when i was 19, in 2008 (i was one year late, no biggie i guess)

2008-2010 : i had several jobs : assembling computers for gamers, working for an asset management company for a couple months, working for a wedding magazine

2010-2013 : bachelor degree

2013-2014 :took a year off, 4 months to travel in thailand (i had family there back then, and i wanted to travel a little), and some time to prepare for the BS's competitive exam when i went back to france.

September 2014-november 2016 : master’s degree in a good business school (at least in France. I had to prepare for weeks in a preparatory school), during which i had a 6 months internship in Bangkok, as a ""business analyst"", for a big company.

Now here’s the issue i have : I’m finishing my education this november, maybe december, and i’ll only get my degree next year. If i want to, i can take another internship until june 2017 (it’s called an « internship year » i believe) and it won’t change anything, i’ll receive my degree in 2017 anyway (and be considered as a ""2017 promotion student""). What should i put in my resume if i finish my education at the end of the year, that i graduated in november/december 2016 right ? (a lot of people told me to do that) It doesn’t matter when i get the degree as long as i finish in time? And what about the option to make it a 3 year masters degree (with another internship), will employers be afraid of my age ? (if i finish my education in november, i’ll be 27 years old, but if go with plan B I would almost be 28 (born in the end of august) if i finish it in june 2017)

Honestly, do you think i’d be fine in both cases, 27 or 28 yo, since people can graduate with masters at 23 in France, just like in England i believe? (it’s not a majority though, but people tend to graduate early in France, 25 is probably the average with masters in business schools)

Thank you very much

nb : as you can see, i didn't have a job, apart from my 6 months internship since 2010 when i was a student, as i wanted to enjoy being a student (universities are almost free in France, although you have to pay for business schools)

I think I'm stuck using my lease as one of my proof of residency documents, since utilities are all done through the leasing office's online portal and the internet bill is in my room mate's name. Do you think the MVA will accommodate the date discrepancy?

Other options I've thought of:

Get my car registered and titled first, use the title for PoR. Not sure if I can use my MA license to get the car registered in MD though.

Use a print out of the online utility bill pay portal from my leasing agent. Not sure if this will be accepted.

There isn't a penalty listed on the MVA website for failure to exchange license in 60 days, and googling hasn't turned up anything specific to MD. Is there a penalty at all?

4zdphb,48,2016-08-24,Vast difference in engineering students,_Matterhorn_,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4zdphb/vast_difference_in_engineering_students/,"So today it dawned on me how many different types of students are out there in the engineering program. I was talking with an old friend and he is doing great with good GPA, lots of experience (we are both sophomores) and really knows what he is talking about. I thought I was doing well with a dumb summer internship in an unrelated field but I cannot talk the way he does about engineering concepts. It is pretty obvious the difference between us. Anyway later that day a stranger started talking to me and he was a former engineering major but couldn't pass statics on his 2 attempts. Its weird cause me and my old friend were just talking about how well our high schools prepared us for college and how others were lacking in basic skills of problem solving. We were saying how if you can just keep your work organized you can do very well in statics no question. It is weird being in this type of environment where I want to achieve more when I am around people like my friend because I am comparing myself to him but when I talk to this stranger I feel pretty good about where I am in my engineering career. 


I think the reason that my friend seems so much better than me in my eye in this field is because he has had these experiences, he has been a part of multiple design teams and I have just done really well in my classes. At my school it has been hard to get on these design teams where you have to apply to them and they only take a select few. So I don't really know why I am posting this. Maybe its partially a rant. Maybe I would like people to give me advice on how to get on a design team so I can get an internship later. Or maybe I just want to see if you guys can relate to how I am feeling about this situation.

4zdxj5,14,2016-08-24,Alumni Reflection,PlayMeOut,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/4zdxj5/alumni_reflection/,"Hi all, this is a little rambly and written kinda blog-ishly, kinda highlight reel-ish about my experience through the program.  


I started in Fall 2014 (27 years old) while working a 40-70+ hour a week industrial job in radiation safety. My end goal was getting out of that environment but shortly after starting the program I found a much better job in radiation safety at a research facility in a big city. With the pressure to get out of that industrial job gone and my hours dropping to 40 a week I decided to keep pursuing the degree because I had some money saved. My first degree was in Physics, so computation wasn't new but my only exposure to coding was a single Java class my freshman year.


I started the program taking 161 on its own. My attitude from the very beginning was always to prioritize my learning and comprehension, so I spent a few extra hours every week practicing my syntax and trying work through concepts that didn't come naturally. 161 was very exciting for me with seeing the potential of what I could do with this new skill, and I really believe between that class and 162 the next quarter I learned enough fundamentals to be successful later in the program. I ended up passing that class with an 'A' and was totally excited for the next quarter.


From there I jumped headfirst into 162 and 225. 162 was a big step up in terms of the amount of code for each assignment, but getting started early in the week helped me get there. 225 (Discrete Structures) was kind of new, but I had taken digital circuits in my physics degree so boolean concepts weren't foreign to me and all I needed to learn was proof structures (which we saw plenty of in Physics, we just never had to come up with them from scratch). This was also the time frame where I was starting my new job (that February), and moving to the city (prepping for my girlfriend to move in with me) so a lot was happening in my personal life, but I kept my head on straight and kept practicing in my free time in both subjects.


From there everything in my life just sped up and became a whirlwind of classes, new job, living with the girlfriend, getting cats, and more classes. That spring I took 261 and 271 together. Data structures was pretty straightforward if you know your pointers (know your pointers people!). Architecture whatever (Assembly) was pretty tough, but once you got the hang of it patterns emerged and its just another language (albeit very pedantic). Redfield is one of my favorite instructors because the expectations are clear, and everything is extremely fair in my opinion. His classes also feel more like my on campus classes did as far as amount of work expected so don't plan on a light workload.


That summer I took 344 on its own because I had heard how scary hard it was. It wasn't. It had a lot to deliver in 8 short weeks, but its a very cursory look at what an operating system does as opposed to how to design one. I feel like the class should be renamed to ""tools and utilities of an operating system"" because I didn't learn anything about what goes on under the hood, but I learned all about low level system calls and how to build things that interact with the operating system. My C/C++ skills had been fairly honed at this point so learning the system calls was pretty straightforward and it's not as beasty as people make it out. Plus Ben Brewster is another great instructor that is involved and cares about your learning.


In the fall I took the revamped 290 and 352 together. That first quarter of 290 was fantastic in my opinion. Talk about a mountain of new information, but staying on top of it and really learning the hard stuff (like closures, and high order functions) really nails home some solid skills for later. Plus JS is a really awesome language (coming from someone who loves the static typing of C/C++). Justin Wolford was teaching this class, and even through the growing pains I thought he cared a lot about our experience. He was always looking for input and came up with a few lectures overnight to fill in some gaps in the prepared material. 352 was a joke. Group work and this program don't mix, yet there's so much of it. It was essentially a feel goody art class in my eyes, even though I can now categorize some fundamental UI necessities (although creating them is a stretch...). Not my favorite necessary expense.


At this point the whirlwind settled down a bit. I had been living with my girlfriend for a while, work wasn't totally unfamiliar, and school had been going well. Padma sent out an email asking for peer tutors so I decided it would be a great way for me to practice my early class skills while making a few extra bucks. Turns out it was one of the better choices I made. It's really awesome being able to give back, but also to have a side income for how little effort it took on my part. I recommend this if you're doing well in the program and can afford the time commitment. I did this for the last 9 months of the program, and it felt like a bonus for getting good grades.


That winter, when I started tutoring, I took 361 and 340 together. I don't know why, it was stupidly easy. 361 was another kind of feel goody class, but it teaches you industry lingo so keep up on the big picture concepts (waterfall, agile, COCOMO, etc.). 340 was totally fun because the bar was really low. They give you a crazy easy framework and you learn a little PHP and you're done. I should have taken a ""hard"" class this quarter because it felt like a vacation after the previous quarters. Also, 361 has more group work (boooo!).


Spring quarter was coming and I had a decision point. I had planned on 2 classes in spring, 1 in summer, and 2 in fall to finish, but I was sick of school eating up my time. I jumped in head first to 372, 362, and 325. This was a busy quarter. 372 is another Redfield class and I actually loved it and learned a ton. I hated Wireshark labs (they didn't contribute much in my opinion), but everything else was top notch. Focus on quiz material and study study study since its mostly rote memorization of facts and terms and architectures. 362 was a pain. ""Testing"". Right. I spent more time learning Dominion than I learned testing. This is a donger of a class so mentally prepare for shallow lectures, links to udacity (fuck that), and the github repo getting nuked by your peers at least twice. The NASA guy who designed it has good lectures, but right when he's about to talk about something he recommends a book and shortchanges it. My teacher couldn't answer questions very well, but was super involved and super nice though (very understanding about git/github nuking your work). 325 was not that hard for me. Sorry, it is the truth. My physics background made about 50% of the content familiar, and really only the implementations of algorithms in certain styles (more group work...) was tough because I usually took the challenging non-trivial algorithms. You have two choices for the projects, work on them collectively, or split up the algorithms for implementation among your group. If you can trust your group, I recommend splitting it so that you don't have a bunch of time wasting meetings and can do your algorithm, dump it in your project and turn it in. A lot of people recommend skipping the class lectures. I'll say it again, this is not a good choice. Watch them on 2x or 1.5x speed so you know what the content covered in class in and what her expectations are. If you need more, then watch the MIT lectures or whatever. It's your experience, but I think skipping her lectures outright is not a good strategy for this class. Further Schutfort in my experience was pretty involved answering questions and with office hours as well, so while some make fun of her lectures she seems to care about student success.


Finally, I made it to this past summer and 496 and 419. I don't recommend this combo, but if you have to do it try not to do it in the summer. Good lord. 496 isn't hard per se, but as many people note if you don't use Google App Engine and Universal Windows Platform the lectures aren't useful until the last week where you need to watch a few so you can write your take home final. I went with Node/Express/Handlebars on AWS with an Android app, so I was on my own (but with the revamped 290 focusing on Node, it was doable). Plan on all your individual projects having to work together as your final project, and implement a login system from the beginning and you'll be fine. Just be prepared for about 15-20 hours a week coding. 419 isn't bad, but again it's group work. At this point you should be able to trust your peers but don't. Really. They may be smart, hardworking, and deliver good code, but you never know what's going on in their personal life that will prevent them from coming through to the highest level. I spent about 10 hours a week on 419 because I made myself trust my group. However, I had to spend 40 hours in my final week debugging and refactoring our whole code base because there were segfault issues internal to someone else's code who didn't have the time to fix it himself. We ended up with a fucking outstanding little project (alright, nothing novel but I'm proud of it for 8 weeks) but at the cost of almost shooting myself in the foot. The final week is also when the how to (due that first Sunday), and final project (due that Friday) and take home final (originally due that Friday, moved to Sunday) are due for 496. I didn't finish the final project by midnight that Friday due to my work in 419, and to my surprise late work was not acceptable for the final stuff in 496. The final project is 35% of your grade, so don't make that mistake. Fortunately I wasn't the only dummy who turned nothing in by midnight, and so Wolford made an allowance because of the short quarter to turn in the projects by Sunday for a capped grade of 80%. I repeat: DO NOT RELY ON THIS. This was a rare circumstance. Fortunately with high marks on everything I fell face first over the finish line and squeaked by with an A. I had to interact with Wolford about clarifications about my grade, and while I complained about his lack of communications (I was panicking, ok!?) he was totally receptive to the possible error and with his adjustments in policy to how the students were doing with the final project and involvement in 290 I think he does really care about the students as well. He just happens to teach the classes that have the broadest scope and most dynamic material while trying to cram it into an 8-10 week period.


I hadn't mentioned it for every class so far, but I finished the program with a 4.0 while working 40 hours a week, changing jobs, and moving in with my girlfriend. This did not come cheaply. The program itself, all costs included was probably close to $29,000 with text books, and ProctorU costs. Fortunately my original job paid me well for ruining my life, so I didn't have to take any loans. My new job paid well enough that I didn't entirely drain my savings either. The tutoring offset about $1400 bucks worth of expenses as well (seriously it's awesome if you can do it). My social life has been non-existent. It has been for a long time though. My old job moved me away from my friends, and took up all my time so I really only socialized with coworkers (which I generally avoid like the plague). By the end of the program I was drinking a bit more than I should because I never had time for friends, and it was something to do fairly quickly and cheaply for my couple hours a week of downtime. I gained about 20 pounds from lack of time to exercise (alright its an excuse! I just didn't bring myself to do it!). My girlfriend had a really tough time with my commitments and told me she missed me and felt lonely. I prioritized her the highest, but I always found a way to schedule everything in so it still weighed on us by a number of factors. I'm lucky I don't have kids yet, cuz damn.


All is well now though. I've spoiled the girlfriend with attention since finishing, I'm reconnecting with friends I've put on the back burner, my savings are rebounding rapidly, I'm back in the gym, and with the new addition to my resume my job hunt will begin shortly. I love my current job, so I'm not in a rush to move on to CS. I'm going to shoot for the big fish and take my time with offers since I'm already happy. I don't think with the academic projects I have to show that the not having an internship will be a major factor for me. We'll see though, I have a tendency to be optimistic.  


I've recently purchased a Raspberry Pi 3 which is the coolest ever. Since I'm losing access to Flip, my first concern was ""but where will I code?"". For anyone looking for the cheapest little Linux box ever, get a Pi. It was so easy to set up, and has a smaller foot print than your standard notecard. It cost $65 bucks to buy all the components($36 for the pi, $12 for an SD card, $8 for a case, and $9 for power), and about an hour to get Raspbian functioning. Another couple of hours working on port forwarding, and setting up a dynamic dns client, and I've migrated my homepage and all my work to the Pi and I can SSH in with a private key from anywhere just like Flip.


I'm excited about CS, and none of this would have happened without OSU. It's had high points and low points, but I think the cost has been worth it. This subreddit is a huge boon in so many ways, but remember when reading it that it is not always representative of everyone's experience. Not everyone in the program is here, and not everyone is super outspoken. Not everyone experiences bad moments with instructors, and arguably the good moments probably go under reported here. The courses are what you make of them. Put the time in to learn and practice the materials. Take advantage of the peer tutors if you need it. Time manage. Don't rush. Prioritize your learning. That's my unsolicited advice if you're starting. You're committing too many resources to not learn as much as possible.  
If anyone has questions, I'm open. Sorry about the wall of text and unsolicited advice, but I wanted to write everything out somewhere and maybe it will be helpful to someone.

4zdzrh,1,2016-08-24,Switched Hosting and Lost Site? Help :(,partypuppy,webhosting,https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/4zdzrh/switched_hosting_and_lost_site_help/,"So I've been trying to help out with my company website. I'm not experienced with webhosting/webdesign (I understand the basics of HTML and CSS), but I definitely only have a vague understanding of the interconnectivity of stuff like cPanel and the backend of creating websites. I'm sorry if I sound like an idiot.. but I am an idiot and I'm desperate!

SO here is my best attempt to explain what happened: 

-My company has two websites. Originally, they were both hosted on GoDaddy. One of the sites was made by an intern and was really dysfunctional so they stopped using it completely. Instead, my bosses then when to an outside web developer who created a new site using a separate hosting (the hosting is called uswest73).
-My boss told me yesterday that they liked the site, but they wanted it to be moved over to the GoDaddy deluxe hosting
-SO I called GoDaddy and explained that we wanted to keep the same site but have the hosting switched to GoDaddy. Whoever I spoke to didn't seem to think much of this and pretty quickly moved the site over. 
-THEN about an hour later we looked at our site and realized that it was no longer the same site that our web developer had designed, but instead the previous site (created by the intern)
-sooo I called GoDaddy, they tell me to contact our web developer and get the correct IP address from him (because now our site is directed to the wrong IP address)
-so I got the IP address from the web developer but he said ""if you've changed your DNS settings this IP address is no longer working. I sent you ALL the information for you hosting account. Any qualified developer should be able to use that info and move your site."" (I thought he was the qualified developer..? idk.)
-SO I logged into the cPanel and from what I can tell the content from our current site still exists? I think? We just need someone to transfer these files? 

Basically, I don't really know what I'm talking about and I'm just hoping that we can restore the site to its original form because my company paid a lot of money to have it created.. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

I'd like to work in another Scandinavian country to get some international experience. (I'm currently in Finland.)

I've worked mostly in small non-profits as a programmer. I like working at those places even if those are not full of other IT experts (I've often been the sole one!). I however have written lines and lines of code, and I can say I'm pretty damn confidient with object-oriented PHP.

Programmers are in demand because people want to get successful with their ventures. I've read and seen that developers are in pretty high demand in Norway.

Do I stand any chances?

**Webdev-specific**

- Tens of projects with **HTML**, **PHP**, some **mariaDB**/**MySQL**
- Done sysadmin stuff like **Apache, bash scripts, command line PHP wrapping, urgent security stuff, regex, terminal escapes, accidentally deleting files** (and restoring from backups)
- I know what **traversables, scope resolutors, PDO** and **lambda functions** are along with hundreds of other PHP quirks
- I use **type hinting** on input and return, I **comment** codes which are not immediately obvious, I write code max **80 chars per line**, I know things like **DRY** and proper **OOP** along with several best practices
- I know what an **MVC**, **Composer**, **templating engines** (like *Twig* and *Smarty*) and **web frameworks** (like *Phalcon*) are
- Tried creating several **frameworks** and **database function sets by my own** (and got embarrassed and thus never published these)

**Supporting**

- Done tens of **web designs** with **CSS**
- Participated in **entrepreneur forums**, have read **hundreds of books** about **what makes a business work** (i.e. I know what makes stuff work in systems), taken lots of **random gigs** online and offline
- Excellent English writing skills
- Operated **several websites** (no longer public) and have **online community management** experience
- Currently and seriously learning **Swedish** (Level 6-7) and **Bokmål Norwegian** (Still lvl 1) through Duolingo. Will absolutely want to practice these with locals. Duolingo is not everything but I feel it *does* teach the basics well.
- Absolutely willing to consider **internships** if that's a better option
- Am really the best motivated at the right type of a company (I especially like **non-profits, the animal industry** and **artistic projects** like games, visual art... and I have experience in all of these)
- Minimal fuss with immigration due to my Nordic status

This looks like a CV, but thought to bold stuff to make my list easier to skim...

If I do stand any chances, how could I reach Norwegian IT professionals/organizations requiring talent?"

So I am a 28 year old dark skinned black man that has the worst luck possible. I'll break this up in parts...

First, my childhood was not so good. I was the youngest of 3 raised by a single mother in poverty. Not only we were poor but I lived with verbal abuse from my mom and it affected me since I was a child so of course it made me shy around others and it resulted in me being teased. I finally graduated high school and went to college hoping I could find a good career as my ticket out of poverty.

However, I couldn't land one single job and my grades suffered. Let me pause and tell the readers that being a student is way easier when all you have to worry about is being a student. My grades suffered and got kicked out of school. I had to move back home, back to poverty where I contemplated suicide. 

But I finally went back to school, got a job, got an internship at a high ranking research facility, won research awards, and even got a publication. I ended up graduating with a bachelor's degree while living in my car throughout undergrad. I thought my life was finally moving forward.

That was until I couldn't find work in the new city where I was about to begin graduate school. I couldn't find work anywhere, not even as a janitor, although my resume is 4 years of clinical and research experience. I have the ability to do doctorate level work but I can't even get hired for anything lower or menial.

So here I am, jobless, not going to school this semester. I'm now living at my grandmother's house, sleeping on the floor with 20 dollars left to my name.

My love life is non existent too. I've never been on a date, kissed a girl, nothing. I've been rejected all of my life and it really hurts. On top of that, since childhood, I often prayed to God that I can at least catch a break or get a chance at school, a job, love. But I never got an answer after all these years. Overall, being rejected by women, hundreds of employers, AND not having my prayers answered for decades takes a huge mental toll on you.

I since gave up on religion and turned away from God. I truly hate God, society, and in general the world because of the life I got dealt. I've always been taught that if you work hard enough, make sacrifices, and keep a positive attitude, you will succeed. When in reality, social mobility at large is based on nepotism and favoritism and not merit. I've always been taught that love will eventually find you and you should improve yourself, etc. But in reality, looks and social status is most important. I've always been taught that I have to keep praying. But in reality, God doesn't exist.

All of the realization hit me at once and it is alot to take in.  No matter how much I can try, I still have to endure stereotypes daily, being stereotyped by my own race, and never get an answer for why my life is this way. The cycle of poverty is REAL. Some people are born on the lowest rung on the ladder, but others have to FIRST climb out of the abyss THEN climb the ladder. It's a rigged game.

It's hard to realize that maybe I wasn't meant for love either. Being rejected is a pattern that is sometimes right. I don't believe in God anymore and I think ALOT of happiness is attributed to luck.

Finding someone, getting a career to escape poverty, having your prayers answered does have luck involved, but it seems like fate or chance always seem to skip over me.."

Thanks to this sub along with many other resources I was able to get an internship helping a health organization. I've only done front end stuff, but they want me to do a small concept of a web app with a backend that allows users to sign up and help request blood donations. 

I've never really done a production backend and honestly have little experience with it. They gave me the choice to implement the web app on any languages and backend as my choice. Does anyone have any recommendation as to what would be easy to get started with, maintainable, and secure for me. If it's a detailed guide someone has already done that would be even better.

Again I'm just doing a small concept of the app, but they want me to start building a web all that will go into production after that.

Thank you!"

During the spring of my junior year, I was attacked by a car burglar and nearly lost my life. I received 18 units of blood, and obviously had to drop that semester.

I only need 4 more credit hours to graduate (one more accounting class and a lab). I have had interviews with 3 of the big 4, and RSM. I was invited to an in-office interview with PWC, and attended RSM's summer leadership program. I thought the RSM program went well and thought I had a good shot. Unfortunately, I have not received any offers.

My overall GPA is 3.4 and my accounting GPA is 3.0. I had a governmental accounting internship lined up for after my junior year, but unfortunately, I spent this time recovering from my incident. 

So for this upcoming fall, my original plan was to finish up my undergraduate degree and add on two of the classes required for the CPA. The following spring, I would take the other two courses and study for the CPA exam, then I would be ready to work full time next summer.

However, I am now having second thoughts. I am considering applying for the master's program at my school. I feel this may give me a better shot of working at a firm I like. As of now, I don't have any options, and am depending on having a successful recruiting season this fall.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1.  I have no experience in any IT/IS job at all(yes I should have got an internship)

2.  The security knowledge I have is mostly theory based and hardly any practical use(if any) same with networking. 

3. Unsure of what jobs I should be looking for(job titles etc) googling has given me very vague information.  

I was told certifications are useless unless you have experience so I'm not sure where to go. 

Ultimately I wanted to get into cybersecurity but have kept my options open as to where to shift self-learning focus. I guess right now I'm unsure of how much I'm worth with a degree and wonder what the best kind of job would work with me atm.

I'm stupid.

I was looking for housing and a guy contacted me saying he was willing to sub-let to me. I had to go to California for my internship and my current lease was ending so I never got a chance to see the house. I asked him about the condition and he said it was in good condition.

He sent over a lease and I digitally signed it. The terms are from September to May, 350$ per month.

I thought that's that. I have a place to live. However, I just landed and checked out the place. Its not what I expected, far less what I imagined. Its smaller and dirtier. And my roommates smoke pot ( I don't. Wasn't aware of this.)

I have to give the landlord security and rent tomorrow morning ( I was allowed to stay early).

I don't want to stay here. Is there any way I can avoid this?

I have to note that the sub-lessor (the guy I'm subletting from) did not provide me with a copy of the original lease ( while stating that I'm bound to all its terms in the sub-lease agreement ). He has also not sent back a copy with his or the landlord's signature.

Is there any way I can get out of the lease? Is it even binding at this point? As I haven't received a copy of the landlord's acknowledgement or the sub-lessor's signature. Please help."

&amp;nbsp;

Background Info: Born in the sewers of Reag among a homeless community young Blake didn't have much going for her. Her mother, June was a rather surprisingly beautiful woman who worked nightly at a local brothel getting just enough scrap to pay for food she slowly saved up to give her newly born daughter a better life. Nightly her mother would head off to work leaving Blake with a hunchback elderly man named Edward William Alphonse. Edward was not poor but was exiled from civilization for his deformity he was often babysitting many young children often teaching them his favorite hobby engineering and tinkering.

The city of Reag had massive towering buildings of remarkable architectural/mechanical prowess, a city that prided itself on it's inventions and world-renowned engineers. Years upon years Blake was left with Edward and as she got older she began staying up to be taught by Edward and she slowly became obsessed with engineering and tinkering alike. She formed the habit of staying up late with Edward who she commonly referred to as Uncle Edward, learning the tricks of the trade like a student. Her mother would return to her child who was always covered in dirt, surrounded by sprockets and dead asleep.

Blake was most amazed by a rather intricate set of mechanical gloves which served as a multi-tool full of a miraculous number of things custom made by Uncle Edward. Slowly over the years she became a master in the craft and together they began working on a number of tools and utilities to help their friends in the homeless community. As time went on they swapped positions, as a child she would pass out early and Edward would continue to work on the project but Edward was much older now, and Blake stayed up tirelessly to finish each day/weeks project. Blake had become a master home taught engineer over the years, and at the ripe age of 16 her future seemed bright in the field.

Day by day they would stay up creating a number of tools; showers, water purification tools, simplified robots, clocks, salvaging broken parts dumped haphazardly aside major corporations deeming them not worthwhile to repair the parts but Blake and Edward saw it as a gold mine for possibility. The pair slaved away creating gifts for their fellow men selling their creations to provide food and slowly save up money.

The old man knew his time was coming, living as a hunchback in the sewers for years took a tole on him, he was 87 years old after all. His final gift to Blake was his mechanical gloves he had proudly regarded as his best invention. He said with smirk, “Once I kick the bucket you better find more friends!” She shot back saying, “You're not allowed to die uncle Edward and yes, yes I will” the two chuckled. Like any other night Edward fell asleep and Blake continued working as Edward snored like usual she giggled to herself before calling it quits for the night, kissing Edward on the forehead, tucking him in and heading back to their roost she did not know those would be her final moments with him.

The next day she was awoken by her mother with tears in her eyes and Blake”s heart dropped, she knew Edward was slower and getting older but was just wishing for another day with him. She cried embracing her mother, she cried harder than she had ever cried. The funeral was held and he was sent off out of the major sewer system, the typical way the community handled their burials and everyone returned to their roosts but not Blake. She watched as the boat holding her hero passed through the system out of site looking at the sewage mixed with human waste and discarded toxic materials she was disappointed, not with anyone, but with life itself. Disappointed that a brilliant man such as Edward was discarded simply for his looks and health issues she vowed to never judge a person for their looks and to always give others a chance.

On her typical salvaging runs she passed a news organization talking about money and business when she overheard them discuss the richest men in the world. Curiosity irked at her as she pulled herself back to the TV store watching through the glass she saw the list as the news anchors muttered their names and professions she heard a common phrase repeated 7-8 times “ ----- Hunter.” She fell dumbfounded when she heard the anchors next few words, “Hunter licensees sell for close to a billion jenny as well, and that's just for passing the test.” With a smile and skip to her step she rushed home with a new objective in mind. She continued making gadgets and toys to help supply the people with a source of income over the next few months before kissing her mother goodbye and waving to her lovely community vowing to return one day with enough money to move them all out of the sewers she headed off to the location of the first stretch of the hunter exam determined to pass and make enough to help her people.

She passed with flying colors and through tinkering she upgraded her 2 favorite gadgets gaining the admiration of a number of the examiners one of which suggested she heeded their advice and had plans to travel to a location where another trainer would guide her she first made a trip back to Reag. Having sold her hunter license she put her mother and the community in an apartment complex having given close to 40 years worth of rent she departed again with a smile giving her friends and family a chance to grow and have more than scraps. As she hugged everyone and left with a smile and a wave she boarded the nearest tram and with tears filling her eyes she thought of Edward. Hoping that somewhere, somehow he was smiling at her, happy that she kept her promise she cried tears of joy looking outward at the world ahead of her she as free to do as she wishes. She had forgotten about the trainer in this moment and looked for a job.

At the age of 18 she signed for an intern program at an amazing state of the art facility where she slaved away working on a number of mechanical issues an problems slowly working her way up the ladder before signing up for a company quarterly program where inventors were tasked to come up with amazing inventions. Day and night she slaved away making what she thought the ultimate product to sell, something almost every boy and girl with could enjoy. A month later the project was done and the competition was held. Blake proudly displayed her invention, a beautiful mechanical board that latched around the users shoes that transformed into a skateboard, skates, surfboard and glider. The judges were insanely impressed and she was sent to meet the board of the company where she pitched the idea, the company agreed and she was given a multi trillion dollar contract she had no monetary worries and again sent money to her mother and the community but she had plenty left over but she felt purposeless now with enough money to live her lifetime and more over she hit a wall again with no real purpose she picked up book writing as a hobby and began writing short novels and works of fiction but this was just a hobby, something to do in her free time she decided to find a real purpose.

She fulfilled her contract before departing the company stepping outside feeling the air again and watching the busy city folk move around all in a hurry. She stopped and focused on each wondering about their lives and stories she saw a business man in his late 30's wearing a wedding ring, he was in a rush “he must be late” she thought with a smile. She saw children being escorted down the road as cars drove by rain began to fall and she wondered about her next step. From behind her she heard a door shoot open from her previous employer as a young man looking determined and almost crazed bolting for the hunter building she realized she had never done much else as a hunter.

She thought of the hunter examiners advice and left in hopes of finding the trainer that would apparently take her to the next level. She looked up at the hunter building with a smile, rain pouring all around her she left on a mission to become stronger. She later passed the secret hunter test and became a 2 star hunter with her amazing inventions at the centerfold of her accomplishments she now sought out the unknown. She heard of a crew looking to recruit for a trip to the dark continent, curiously and casually she decided to take her chances and left for the unknown.

All her inventions tucked away ready at her disposal she was prepared for what was ahead of her as she approached the dock. She approached the recruiter on the docks asking about the flier for the dark continent crew a curvy girl wearing a western getup smirked and yelled back at the beautiful armored ship saying “Hey Cap, we got a recruit here for ya” A shadow arose from the cabin as the sunlight fell upon him filling out the person approaching. A rather tall muscular man with a huge build with a face covered in oil. Staying completely oblivious she was rather intimidated by the mans stature and demeanor looking more rugged and stronger than any man she had encountered. She nervously sighed in an attempt to calm herself but it did not work. As the man approached, her tensions rose, her possible future boss stood before her, she was nervous as he towered over her. “How can I work for hi-” he interrupted her thoughts outstretching his hand “Let's start as friends, what's your name?” he asked. The words of Uncle Edward echoed in her mind, “Once I kick the bucket you better find more friends!” perhaps she had found a friend she thought, as she uttered “Blake.” Perhaps she had found more....

Hatsu: Max of 4

	
1. Maestro of Metal – Blake uses an odd pair of mechanical gloves custom built with a multiplex of tools at her disposal anything and everything an engineer would need and ask for and then some. This odd mechanical pair of gloves also serve as a medium to which she can manipulate assorted sprockets and gears. Each finger has a multitude of tools stuffed inside of it that operate by the users hand motions. At the end of each finger is a blow torch that is specially designed to feed off raw nen energy as fuel. Other assorted tools include; scissors, spoon, fork, knife, can opener, lock pick, magnifying glass, screwdriver, Phillips head, wrench, hammer, glass cutter, zipline, lighter, plier, drill, billhook, bolt cutter, cats paw, nail clipper, etc, etc, etc. (Everything under the sun) She can also use the gloves to manipulate Alphonse and levitate herself via the sprockets and gears inside but this puts a strain on the parts and can't be used too often, too frequently, with too much stress or it might break Alphonse. Blake is an experienced engineer and can easily replace the sprockets and gears in a few seconds but further use puts strain on the other parts which she has to manage in her free time, in the middle of a fight it is normally not possible to fix in a moment.
	
2. Sprockets and Gears – The user can manipulate any sprocket and gear they have physically touched. The only way to deactivate access and reset access to a sprocket or gear which requires a user to surround the object in zetsu to make her lose control. Sprockets and Gears can be manipulated and thrown at high speeds. She has an assortment of Sprockets and Gears just piled up in her backpack. If a sprocket or gear breaks it can still be used with less intensity and if a gear piece is too small it'll be increasingly harder to manipulate and keep track of it. Gears may be remelted to enter full function again. She can also use sprockets to lighten falls or take temporary steps in the air. Higher chance to break the sprockets/gears.
	
3. Striking while the Iron is Hot – Using her Maestro Engineer gloves finger blowtorches she super heats the sprockets and gears to a molten state and continues to manipulate them. She uses this strategy an in attempt to sauter metal and as well as forming molten shields to protect herself or flinging molten hot sprockets and gears at her enemies. 	
	
4. Tink the Hermit Robot – A number of factors must be met in order for Tink to be summoned. The following are all requirements for Tink to be summoned; Blake must have made physical contact with her target when she started creating him, Blake must keep eye contact with her target for the duration, Blake must be untouched by the target for one minute while she emits Tink from her body slowly, any contact temporarily halt Tink's creation which may be continued once the two previous factors are made. Once all factors are met and the time limit is over Tink is brought forth. Sadly the Robot doesn't get out much and is very nervous and scared and feeling an odd sense of attraction to the target he chases them mindlessly in a haphazardly and anxious way. Whenever the target uses nen in any way, shape, form a small fraction of the nen is loaned to Blake. If the target keeps running from Tink or moving too fast he starts to freak out worried that his new friend may leave him and begins to loan a larger percentage to Blake while frantically chasing the target. If they welcome Tink and bring him with them as they fight Tink calms down and embraces his new friend only draining a small percentage of aura on aura moves and nothing more. If the Robot is repeatedly damaged by the target this also increases the loan percentage and if Tink is destroyed in a final act of desperation, defeat, and sadness forces the target into a state of zetsu for 1 minute. If the Robot is destroyed all factors are reset and the same factors must be met again. If Tink is summoned on the same target twice in a row he starts off much more anxious and scared than normal. Poor Tink.

General Strategy: Blake focus on flinging parts at her enemy managing to sneak in and touch her opponent lading a possible hit if she can relying on her quick reaction time, speed, and agility to pull through using her multitude of tools at her disposal if need be using Striking while the Iron is Hot to step up the attacks while preparing to summon Tink to keep the barrage going she super heats the parts often leaving her foes knocked out by blunt objects or knocked out and left with ridiculous burns. She can also create a molten wall of Sprockets and Gears as a defensive tool. She uses SwtIiH sometimes to sauter and repair broken structures constantly gathering pistons and gears a long her journey she always carries a massive pile of parts in backpack that overflows with parts constantly having pieces fly out as she pulls them back in. If parts break she tends to molten heat them to repair and also weaponize them more efficiently filling two jobs at once.

&amp;nbsp;

Personality: Blake loves to tinker and collects parts any chance she encounters constantly throwing pieces into her backpack and repairing broken mechanical things for sport often doing favors for strangers she is known to be very kind hearted and accepting of others across a variety of spectrums she dislikes violence and tends to only use her most dangerous move, striking while the iron is hot only when she feels her life or those she loves is threatened. She has never considered having children but as time goes by she becomes interested in literature reading popular works of poetry and stories which in turn awaken her desire for love and companionship.

Over time she casually began writing her own books and even creating her first master guide to engineering and tinkering. She constantly looks for inspiration in all walks of life and began creating fiction stories imaging far off worlds with amazing inventions and technologies and of course romance learning only of relationships and marriage through books she was rather awkward and no idea as to her approach with such a thing. She tries to always give others the benefit of the doubt. She is very determined in her goals and doesn't intentionally disregard others advice for goals but more subconsciously forgets as she happily pursues her own desires. More often than not she ends up circling back to the goals presented by others if she is found pursuing her own personal goal. "

And so, I want to limit the amount of schools I'm applying to.

I'm thinking of not applying to schools where it's a complete reach, because that would probably be a waste of money.

My dream school (Stanford) has an average ACT of 33, while my score is a 27. I didn't really have much time to study over the summer--mainly due to procrastination and a research internship I have--but I'm going to try my best to raise it to a 30.

I think my ECs are good (coauthor of research paper; started many clubs in my school: stem club, esports club, programming club; attended many competitions, especially engineering ones; leadership positions), but would that even be enough to be accepted? This is starting to sound like a chanceme thread, so I'll end it here: should I bother applying? 

I'm super disappointed at myself for procrastinating so much. If you're an incoming underclassmen/junior reading this, I highly suggest you start studying now to avoid the same mistakes I've made. "

4zflvi,11,2016-08-24,Job Market Rant-WTF am I doing wrong,ralatorr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4zflvi/job_market_rantwtf_am_i_doing_wrong/,"I have a rant about the current job market. To fully understand where I am coming from a little background about me. I am 24 years old, I live an hour and a half from Chicago driving from Northwest Indiana. I have recently graduated with a Bachelor’s of Computer Information Systems with a minor in Biology. I can code with Python, R, Java, HTML, CSS, MySQL. I did an independent study of Python for my capstone to graduate over an internship as my family wouldn’t allow me. I graduated last May, rather early May and began looking for a job even in the last few weeks of school. It is now the end of August, so let’s call it a total of 4 months. I have yet to get a single job. 
I was told that when I go to school, if I do well in what I do, it won’t matter that my biology grades drug down my GPA. I was told that a college degree would open doors but they all seem closed. I am overqualified to work a damn minimum wage job flipping burgers but I’m underqualified for my field. 


Let’s look at this using some numbers shall we: let’s say I applied to 1 job a day. And over the course of 120 days I’ve been rejected, presuming I apply at the same company for a different position. 120! Imagine looking for a date to prom and you ask over 120 women/men and they all say no, do you realize what that does to your confidence? Do you understand that they have all flat out rejected me due to my over qualification or lack of professional experience. At this point I am ready to just quit life as is. 


My degree has not opened any doors, it has only closed them. 6 years of my life are gone trying to get my degree and those 6 years I cannot get back. I am frustrated and tired of being rejected. Is there some secret I am missing to getting hired? Or is this what life is outside college? A series of closed doors that lead you down a path a despair and sorrow until your timely end. 


I didn’t even attend an unaccredited online college, no I went to a legit college where I commuted. I don’t drink, have no arrests, heck I can piss clean 400 days of the year I’ve partied that little. What is it that is wrong that I can’t get a job? Is it me? Is it my education? Is it the fact I don’t live in the city what is it! I’m tired and frustrated with everything. Indeed, hired, zipprecuriter.com, all of it! I’ve done it all and can’t get a job still and guess what, the way things are looking I probably won’t any time soon. I am simply distraught over what to do.


Am I really the only one in this boat? Fresh from college with a decent degree in something, not to bash a degree but art history or women and gender studies majors, who cannot find a job period. Not even a job outside my field. I am just so sick of what is going on and how little hope I have I just want to quit. If you have any suggestions I’m all ears because at this rate either my anger or my depression over the situation that has accrued for the past 4 months will be the end of me.

I'm a second year and I just switched out of ChemE to pure chem because this is what I really like. I am okay with going to grad school, but I'm not really sure if this is what I REALLY want. Next semester, I can switch to CS (I like coding too but I don't know if I want to be a full-time programmer). I know CS jobs now days are high demanding and has a lot of vision.

I'm like almost half way through the chem classes, and I can probably graduate in three semesters (i.e. IF I don't do internships/co-op/study abroad). If I switch my major again, I probably will have to take summers to graduate in 4 years, and it means I will incur more debt, and probably won't have the time to take off for a study abroad or an internship.

4zg7n8,41,2016-08-24,Lessons I've learned from my first year in practice.,djd4391,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/4zg7n8/lessons_ive_learned_from_my_first_year_in_practice/,"Hi everyone, I've been in the field as an outpatient mental health counselor for just over a year now. I had an internship for a year before that, but that was barely part time work. I had no idea what to expect prior to starting my career, and I wished someone told me what to expect. Here are some of the lessons I've learned. (This list is by no means exhaustive, and I'd appreciate hearing other people's experience!)

1. Burnout is real and it's something you need to actively work to prevent. 
- boundaries are very important here. Our job is hard enough to leave at the door, especially with all the stories we hear throughout the day. Practicing active coping like engaging in hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or whatever makes you feel rejuvenated, is necessary to survive in this field. If you don't have self-care skills, cultivate some.

2. Your supervisor is not your personal therapist. (In other words, SEEK THERAPY!) I have to say, this point is partially because I am a naturally anxious person. I struggled with the transition to my new career pretty seriously, and found myself looking for therapy from my supervisor a little too much. Don't get me wrong, your supervisor is there to support you and sometimes that requires them to comfort you about your concerns. That being said, I believe that using supervision as a way to strengthen and harness your clinical ability is much more valuable. Plus, having an outside therapist will give you a fresh perspective on your experience at work.

3. Utilize your work supports. 
-You are not the only one experiencing what you're going through. Your coworkers have experienced much of what you might be going through. They provide you with a sense of validation and understanding. This was very valuable to me in the beginning.

4. Case management will be a bigger part of your job than you anticipate.
-it is important to get familiar with community resources. Especially in community mental health, clients have a lack of resources, and this can create or worsen many mental health issues. I can't count the number of times sessions have revolved around finding clients housing, or helping them apply for financial assistance. Knowing community resources will also help strengthen your quality of care for each client.

5. Everyone has a ""clinical bubble"", and it can be popped.
-This point may be a little controversial, but I'm just being honest about my experience. When counseling others, it is important for me to walk the line between caring and being empathetic for a client, and protecting myself from vicarious trauma.  The clinical bubble is what protects me from having my clients tragedies significantly affect my own mental health, and carry over into my personal life. However, there are certain stories that pop that bubble. This is normal, and a sign that you really do care. Seek supervision, meet with a therapist, work through these things actively.

6. Education CAN'T stop after graduation.
-I remember feeling this sense of relief when I graduated a year ago. I felt like I would never have to open another textbook, or research another topic again. Of course, if you had asked me at the time, I would say of course you have to do that after grad school. But I don't think I actually believed it, or I didn't want to believe it. Either way, counseling is an ever – evolving discipline, and it is our responsibility to use best practice that is empirically supported.

I hope someone can benefit from my experience. I appreciate all your feedback!"

I just started my last year of high school here in Colorado and I'm planning on attending either CU Boulder (where I'm thinking at the moment), CU Colorado Springs, CU Denver, or Colorado School of Mines to get my BSCS. I would love to attend Carnegie Mellon or Stanford but I'm going to stay realistic for this post. I love coding and I'm planning on being a software engineer after college at the moment. I'm also considering Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. What I was wondering is, as of right now, what can I do to ""beef up"" my resumé for future employers?

**About Me**

 * I ""know"" Java, C++, Objective-C, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL (ew), and Python.
 * I've created two iOS apps in Obj-C but they're not on the app store (more for fun and education).
 * I run my own little website business (using WordPress though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
 * I'm attending a ""technical"" high school that is teaching me Computer Science and Cybersecurity in conjunction with traditional classes while simultaneously earning me CS credit at my local community college. (this credit does not appear to transfer to CU though..)
 * I competed in Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest in April and got to the interview stage for their Codequest internship. While I did not get the internship, I'm going to give it another shot this year now that I know what they're looking for.
 * I did however get an internship at a government agency but unfortunately it's more of a tech support job rather than coding.
 * I have a 4.0 weighted GPA and at the end of the year will have taken a total of 7 AP classes. My ACT score is 31.
 * I am part of one after school club that does volunteer work (similar to NHS) and did marching band for 4 years.
 * I have 4 **very** basic certifications regarding computer hardware/security (lower than A+ so they're rather irrelevant) and I have one Oracle Database Design certification which according to my teacher is actually semi-valuable(?) I'm also planning to get my Certified Ethical Hacker certification which I know is a low level certification but you have to start somewhere right?
 * I'm completing a capstone related to machine learning (I'm taking the Stanford Machine Learning class on Coursera then writing a program to do some machine learning stuff).

**My questions**

 * Would starting to build some reputation on SO and GitHub be a good use of my time or is there a negligible benefit? I searched around on this sub a little and I got mixed responses, some saying it's a total waste of time, others saying they got job offers at Microsoft from their SO profile...
 * I'm not too into the ""Big 4"" or whatever you want to call it, but I'm also not against it. I'll probably end up going wherever I can get paid the most while having a good location, doing work I at least semi-enjoy, and not having too many crazy work weeks.
 * If I'm thinking of starting my own software business 10-15ish years down the road is there anything I need to do now? This is obviously very tentative...
 * Living in Colorado, there's obviously a very good tech culture here - especially in Boulder and Denver - and I'm fine with California as well, but as far as outside the US goes are there a lot of job opportunities in say Europe? I would love to work across the pond for at least a few years.
 * Does anyone know how good (or bad) the CS programs are at Columbia University or Rensselaer Polytechnic? Both universities seem very interested in me and from what I can tell appear to be fairly good CS schools.
 * Is there anything else I can do to boost my resumé that I'm not thinking of that won't ruin my social life 100%?

Any questions, comments, or constructive criticism about either my poor formatting style or the post itself are welcome! Thank you to everyone who took the time to read through this! I know it's rather long and scattered.

I have never posted before, but you could say that now I’m desperate. I hope this is the right thread for my question It’s a lengthy post, so I apologise in advance. Before I start, some introduction, I am a 19 year old guy from Singapore, studying in my final year at a polytechnic, currently on internship. I am usually considered by my friends as unattractive but it doesn’t matter to me because I generally have a high sense of self-worth.

Okay. So basically, I have this really good girl-friend of mine, she’s 18, a small cute girl, not very attractive, child-like and we are very close, and it’s been this way for close to a year now. She's been at my worst so many times. We tell our friends that we are a “part-time” couple, which means that we date without any feelings, and of course without the intimacy of a couple (holding hands, kisses and all) However, it wasn’t until a month ago, when she told me she was interested in one of my guy friends that I realised I didn’t want to lose her to someone else. However, not wanting to be a dick about it I just constantly listened to her, and did not at any point make put that guy down in front of her. 

Three weeks ago (do note that she was still interested in that guy at this point of time), she asked me what I would do if she liked me, saying that one of our mutual friends casually told her that I would like her. I simply told her I was afraid of losing this friendship, but I would at least give it a try (I was being honest). I thought that this HAD to be the signal, so my feelings for her strengthened. I then asked her the same question and she said that she may consider dating me.

We have since been texting continuously since that day. In this period, she was suddenly sweeter than usual. Her usual texts of “jiayou” (which is the Chinese equivalent of “keep going”) became long texts. She would be my personal alarm clock. And, she would talk about other cute guys, as usual. Last week, she lost her interest in the guy, and boy, I was overjoyed. I asked her out on Sunday to dinner and the movies, and following a tip given by a close guy friend, during the movie I made a bold move by pushing her head gently onto my shoulder to rest when she said she was tired. He said this was a good way to ‘test the water’.
Nothing much has changed since then, except for yesterday.  Since morning, her replies have been half-hearted and even though she sleeps late, she ignored my latest text until this morning, not even giving me an explanation of why she ignored it. 

Now here’s where I need your help guys. I spent my whole morning at work today googling for help and was told that when a girl pulls back I have to pull back as well, and wait for her to come back to me for the attention. I plan to reply to her text only when work ends. Has she found out my feelings for her? Why is she acting like this all of a sudden? Is there another guy now?  I truly am scared.

And also, a lot of the websites I googled earlier have been telling me to flirt with her in a sexual way, but is that even advisable considering I’ve known her so long and that I’ve never done it before, moreover can't bring myself to even do? How should I go about from here?

If you’ve read all the way to here, thank you. I really appreciate it. I don’t know how to sum this up in a TL;DR.

4zgkll,20,2016-08-24,Massikaroz disappearance investigation thread,seanmaniac,ChivalryGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/4zgkll/massikaroz_disappearance_investigation_thread/,"Many of you know the player Massikaroz. He was loved by all and is friends with just about everyone in the comp scene. He has played this game since the start. Now I'm going to give some bad news... Massikaroz has disappeared. He has deleted everyone off his steam friend list, on all four of his accounts on steam and his one account on battle.net. 

Here is his main account that he currently played chiv with.:
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164970009 STEAM_0:1:102352140 He has not used this account since the disappearance. As you can see when you click the steam link, it shows as if his account has been deleted and that is has no aliases. This points to extremely malicious behavior as it is impossible to delete a steam account. If you do not believe this was Massi's account then look at this. http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjacub
This is NinjaCubs profile, one of his Faucheur teammates, if you look on the comments you can see a user whose name is a random series of numbers. However these are not random numbers, these are the same numbers as the account that i linked earlier. And yes this is massi's account, because I've had him nicknamed on steam for 3 years now. Same with these ones: http://steamcommunity.com/id/whereiseveyhyde STEAM_0:0:43134874 AND http://steamcommunity.com/id/foorksnds STEAM_0:0:91873056

As you can probably tell these accounts are all private and this does not help at all. However, on this account:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/foorksnds  
the aliases are SST and variations of it. And inside the Lg ts there is a user named SST. This is also Tyrannis' name and the teamspeak user known as SST is located in America according to TS. However Massi is known for using VPNs quite often and the user he hangs out with in that channel is NinjaCubs, so it could be Massi. Because as you can see, Massi loved NinjaCubs a lot according to the many comments on Cubs' profile, so why would he leave him and US without saying anything.

Next lets move on to the other link: http://steamcommunity.com/id/whereiseveyhyde 
Inside the link the words whereiseveyhyde are written for his profile URL. Some of you may not know, but Evie was one of Massi's IRL friends. Most of you probably don't know either that Massi composed music with Evie. Evie was very close to Massi. Evies gender is not known. However I fear that something may have happened to Evie, as Massi's profile link changed, prior to whereiseviehyde it was emptynorthernhhemisphere. This points to something bad happening to Evie. One last thing that Massi always talked about was his internships and research in other countries. He talked about how he was going visit Iceland from may to september(he never ended up going as he didnt get the travel visa) and that he will be there for an extended period of time and may not play videogames anymore after. He also talked about how he got accepted for an internship in Hong Kong, which might explain why he left so suddenly.  But he always told me he wasn't certain if he was going to do it and said most likely not. So it points to no. Even if one of these theories are true, it still does not explain why and how massi's account got deleted. It also doesn't explain why he left without saying goodbye to anyone.

EDIT: I have also forgot to mention that the whereabouts of his fourth account is unknown. It was a smurf account him and I made and I fear it is lost. He always went on it to play every once and a while though, so he may have retreated to that account. I think the player Hairy might have him added, but I am not sure as his profile is private. "

4zgoc4,35,2016-08-25,Fuck it. My Smaude fanfiction.,epicjude,SourceFed,https://www.reddit.com/r/SourceFed/comments/4zgoc4/fuck_it_my_smaude_fanfiction/,"For many years, Sam Bashor’s life was - to put it gently - solitary. He lived the bachelor's life for many years, because of (or perhaps, in spite of) his bow ties, sonic screwdrivers, and generally awkward demeanor. To an outside observer, Sam’s love life seemed static. It seemed like it was hopeless. And sometimes, Sam thought that too, but deep down inside, he knew that he was just waiting for the perfect girl; cute, funny, nerdy, and maybe even with a sexy foreign accent. He really was ready for somebody, but he’d have to do a lot of waiting.

After years of taking odd jobs wherever he could and internships at small entertainment companies, he decided he would step out of the limelight, take charge, and go find himself someone. So, when business offered to take him to AdultCon in early 2013, he jumped at the chance. What better place to meet his future wife? But, even with the help of expert wingman, Steve Zaragoza, his search turned up nothing. Discouraged, but not defeated, Sam decided he would go looking a little closer to home, SourceFed.

Even at his own workplace, he didn’t have an easy time finding someone. His first choice, Lee, wasn’t exactly picking up on his signals. She treated him more like a nephew that a lover. Next, it was Trisha. She seemed to suffer from the same condition as Lee; they were blinded by how “cute” they found him. So, not wanting to go around in circles, he decided he’d have to increase his desirability.

He worked for the company for years, slowly rising in the ranks, gaining the respect of his peers along the way. He was becoming a heavy-hitter, with his own show, and a respectable following. And then, all that work paid off when one of the new hires walked in. She checked all the boxes: cute, funny, nerdy. And, she was Japanese! She seemed perfect. But, before he could make his move, somebody else swooped in. Will. Williams Washington James Haynes. He couldn’t bear it. He had followed her over to SourceFed Nerd, abandoning his precious FHP, only to be outdone by a black guy doing what he did two years ago? He was livid. His now-meaningless life trudged on, until one day, things changed.

It was just another boring, uneventful day for Sam when she walked in. At first, he barely glanced up from his computer screen. He was so jaded from the last new hire that it took him a second to realize what his eyes were seeing. He looked up again. He only diverted his eyes when he realized how awkward he must have looked staring at her for so long. He quickly ran it through his head: beautiful blonde hair, a Star Wars dress, a gorgeous Australian accent, and a height to match his. From the moment he met her, he knew she was the one.

Sam didn’t want to rush things, though. He wanted to take his time, get to know her. The two of them became the cutest of co-hosts on Nerd News. They laughed, they cried, and in one case, even kissed (on the cheek). The two of them were so adorable together, they became the subject of a relentless barrage of gossip and annoying fanfiction. And although their relationship was strictly professional, Sam had strong feelings Maude, which had only grown stronger in their time together. He decided that today, after work, would be the day he’d confess his feelings to her, and hopefully enter a relationship. 

As the end of the day approached, his stress mounted. He was very nervous. He was beginning to lose focus. He couldn’t stop thinking about her, but he also couldn’t stop doubting himself. He was sweating. The day was almost over. He heard her sing-songy voice behind him.
“Sam!” she called.
He turned around, trying to mask his visible nervousness.
“We’re shooting the last video of the day. Come on, let’s go!” she said, in an enthusiastic tone.
He got up and scurried over to the set, where tried his best to hide his almost feverish desire. The shoot wrapped, and the two of them walked back to pick up their things and go home. The inside of Sam’s head was a cacophony of messages to go talk to her, but he was hesitant. As he leaned down to pick up the phone he so clumsily dropped in the empty office, a voice called out to him from behind:
“You know, you look really cute when you’re clumsy.”
It was Maude. 
He looked up and blushed slightly. As he stumbled to find words to reply with, she walked up and grabbed his hands.
“I know you love me. You’re not very subtle about it, you know,” she said, in an almost scolding tone.
Sam was even more flustered. He continued mumble nonsense, now in a more anxious tone.
“But,” she said with a smile, “that’s okay, because I love you too.”
And before Sam could even process what she had just said, she leaned over and kissed him. He was nearly melting, he was so overwhelmed with emotion. Almost reflexively, he hugged her, and pulled her closer. When they let go, Sam was left with bright pink lipstick around his mouth, which Maude playfully wiped off. She walked over to her desk and pulled out a bottle of whiskey, because of course she had a bottle of whiskey. She took a swig right from the bottle, traditional Aussie style, and handed it to a now realized-what’s-just-happened Sam. 
She said, “Let’s have a sleepover,” and paused for a moment, then giggled. 
Sam did too, but he wasn’t entirely sure why. He couldn’t tell if she was serious (the idea of a sleepover at the office was a little ridiculous), but with her, he was up for anything. She took the whiskey back, now downing a shot or two worth of alcohol. He would try and match her, if she wasn’t Australian. 

The rest of the night was the best of both of their lives. And the whiskey only made it better. They fooled around on the #TableTalk set. They tried Elliott C. Morgan’s “baby powder”. They wanted to get into the PhillyD office to “use” the couch, but he locked it. They even chatted with Ross Everett’s ghost who haunted the offices. They passed out at the end of the night, holding each other on the old, dusty Comment Commentary couch.

As morning rolled around, they were both glad it was the weekend. Even in their hungover states, they decided it was best to just go home, and talk about what happened later. They both left, high off of yesterday’s euphoria. Both of them knew it would have to happen again. But for Sam, the hangover was a small price to pay. He was now no longer single, and in a relationship with the girl of his dreams. Now, for life to be perfect, all he had to do was get the Speed Force and shit."

It’s been a long day at the courthouse. I sit back in my chair and read the memo the new intern has written. I sigh as I correct the typos with a pen as I read. “I guess this girl never heard of the “I before E” rule” I say to myself. 

Halfway through the memo I become exasperated and toss it to my desk. I call your name out and after a brief pause, you appear at my door. “Come in.” I tell you, “And close the door behind you.” I add, leaning back in my chair.

“Look at the memo you just handed in.” I say, a look of impatience on my face. “This is not good. Not good at all. You know the rules, of course. You’ll have to be punished.” I smile at you. “What happens to naughty little sluts when they misbehave?” I ask you, standing up from my chair.

4zgzuw,2,2016-08-25,I feel like so many people in my field are anti-hard work and it's driving me insane,StormTr00perz,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4zgzuw/i_feel_like_so_many_people_in_my_field_are/,"I am a Student in Uni and I've had several internships in IT and Development positions. While my overall experience has been positive I have to say one thing that is driving me up the wall is the box that people put themselves in all time. 

The moment work comes in that they aren't sure how to do they freak out and complain as to why they were assigned this work. When I was assigned work that was out of my range of knowledge and I tried to figure it out I was discouraged and told I would be better off escalating the issue to someone who had a better idea. 

What's wrong with taking on a challenge, even a small one? What's wrong with not knowing something and having to learn something new? Often times in college I'll have a problem and the response was always ""well you better learn"". I've been handed programming languages I never touched before and told I had a week or so to be familiar with it. I didn't bitch moan or cry, I got on google and every problem I encountered I worked through and solved. 

What is some of these workers' mindsets? Are they that afraid of stepping outside their comfort zone? Are they that adverse to learning something new? Are they content with the fact that they've been almost mindlessly handling the same types of issues for years and years without learning something new? 

I graduate next year and entering the workforce frightens me. It frightens me because the culture of ""well you better figure this shit out"" will be replaced with one where I do the same simple work day-in and day-out without anything challenging me. The most valuable thing I've learned in college was to overcome the fear of the unknown and to do something harder every day, and I will be goddammed if I have to give that up and spend the rest of my life doing mindless work.

I feel like NYC should be teeming with opportunities for a desk job related to programming or even IT, but using sites like Monster, Hired, Dice, etc hasn't given me anything.

4zhht5,1,2016-08-25,My [25/M] broke up with me [21F] over a small argument and claims he hasn't loved me for awhile.,hierikaa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zhht5/my_25m_broke_up_with_me_21f_over_a_small_argument/,"My boyfriend broke up with me recently, a few days ago. We had done this a lot. He would get mad over very little things. The reason we broke up this time was because he called me late at night and wanted to vent about his brother being an asshole - during that conversation he did a weird sniffing noise and I asked what he was doing - general question. He got defensive because recently we talked about how he had been using a substance for approx two months and he wanted to stop. He wanted to get away from it. I told him I'd be there for him - he was asking me for help. When I asked him that question about what he was doing, he flipped out on me. He blocked my number (he had done this a few times before), blocked me on FB, instagram, and to this day he has not unblocked me. But we spoke on the phone for about an hour. He texted me on Monday and kept saying that we were over, it's not in our best interest, he's depressed (which he has been in that state for awhile since he moved back home and suddenly quit a bad work environment). I'll admit that I do get a little naggy and needy sometimes and I understand that that's not what he needed at the moment and so when he told me he had been using a substance and that he wasn't in a good state I told him that we don't need to be lovey at the moment and that we needed to focus on him finding help. Last time we fought, he flipped out on my and said we were over because I supposedly thought he was lying about his phone being broken, when I was merely asking him to show me if it'll turn on because I wasn't there to physically see it. Then we made up, he hugged me, apologized, asked to bring me out to dinner and then told me he loved me. Anyway, Monday he texted and said no it's not going to happen etc, etc. Then he told me he couldn't stop his habit. I asked him to come out and talk to me or call me at least because I cared. He wouldn't reply, he ignored me. I started to get scared because he - although wasn't my boyfrined at the time, he still replied to me. As someone who cared, I drove over and texted him to come out and walk with me (he lives with his parents atm). But before I could even send it, he was already walking down the street. Then he tells me that he has been lying to be about being in love with me for the last three months. He said it just ""doesn't"" feel the same after what happened (where I supposedly hung out with a friend from school and he didn't approve of it and we were both very jealous people, but I got over my jealousy because I didn't want things to be unhealthy). I'm really confused because just a couple of hours ago he was sending me hearts and we were having a nice conversation. We were joking around. A couple of hours before that he told me he loved me. A couple of hours before that he was asking if he could call me every couple of hours. A couple hours before that we were enjoying a nice dinner at our favorite restaurant and walking around LA. I asked him what was all of that, his response was, ""Babe, I can't be happy just doing those things with you?"" And that's when it snapped inside me. I was so angry. I felt so used and I slapped him. I sent him a text apologizing and he says that he doesn't love me and that he has been lying to me and saying, ""You're right. I am angry, confused and depressed. But I can't go on lying to you anymore."" He's done this a few times and then would come back and say I'm sorry. He would say that he didn't mean those things. 

He texted me because he said he saw my car driving down a street near his house. I was delivering something for my job. I asked him if we could talk, he says no. I asked him why can't we talk. I made a simple joke. He tells me that I need to watch this really funny interview. I told him if I watch it, then he has to talk to me. We finally talked again, on the phone. He told me that he's at a dead end job and that he has no friends and that he's depressed. I asked him if he could unblock me and just add me again. He was like, your life is already better without me. After this incident, you immediately got an internship opportunity. I told him that that doesn't matter or mean anything. He told me he just doesn't love me anymore. I asked him if he thinks about me, he says everyday. And then I said I don't understand this and he says, I just can't. I can't lie to you anymore. I've bene lying to you for three months. 

Again, I'm confused. He says that he doesn't want to and hasn't wanted to do things for me for awhile. But within the last three months since we got back together he would tell me really sweet things about wanted to be together and that he was sorry for all the fighting and that he knew it was his fault. When he got his new job, he said that he was really happy and that if it weren't for me and my support and my love it wouldn't have been this way. He told me that he really appreciated me and could not show his love or appreciation enough. I asked him about that and his reply, viciously, goes, ""I was probably fucking high."" And I was like...that's bullshit. You couldn't even afford that shit at the time. He would stop by and bring me a random bag of pita chips because we would always snack on them and he would bring me a cactus plant because it made him think of me. 

There's so much to this story. I feel like I'm rambling. 

When he gets really mad at me he'll say really hurtful things like, I don't love you. I haven't loved you. You're stupid. Fuck you. Fuck off. And I'm just like...what did I do to you? What did I do to make you get so angry. And I would be balling my eyes out because I've been trying to stop fighting, but his temper has gotten to be bad. I know he's depressed and stressed but he won't go to therapy or do anything about it but sulk.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend is depressed with his life, breaks up with me and says he hasn't wanted to do anything for me for awhile and that he hasn't loved me for awhile but a couple of days ago was sending me sweet messages and wanted to talk to me all day. And a couple of weeks ago would bring me things and little gifts, and a couple of weeks ago would send me really appreciative letters, and a couple of weeks ago was telling me that he wanted to start paying for meals because I have been supporting him a lot. And just a few days ago asked me out for dinner because he wanted to take me out on a nice date. He has had these weird unstable emotions for awhile now. "

I don't know why I am up this late and I am ashamed to be posting this (and probably will regret this later) but I got to get a few things off my chest. THIS IS HELLA LONG BUT I APPRECIATE ANYONE WHO CAN READ &amp; LEND A PAIR OF EYES/HEARTS. JUST NEED TO VENT.
As the title suggests I am 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition &amp; depressed.

By squatters' conditions I mean:
Living in a house that had two fires almost 10 years ago/on-going construction.
Living without heat, running/drinking water, shower/tub, toilet, stove/gas. Aka can't shower, cook, or shit properly. 
Living in a living room/sleeping on couches with my parents. This is where we eat, sleep, ""lounge""

How I got here/Where I was: Almost a year ago.
Got laid off unexpectedly. I was very unprofessional at this job and surprised I didn't get fired (due to depression). Weird but kinda saw this as a blessing in disguise.
Mom got fired (again) from part-time job, lost apartment we all had to move back to the house. Mom previously left Dad after first fire. My mom has lost hope.
Dad living paycheck to paycheck, constantly working.
For months before internship, half-assingly looked for apartments, sublets, full-times jobs, but never really followed through because of depression, fear, and anxiety.
Have savings but don't want to touch in case of emergencies.
I am very disciplined when it comes to money. I save constantly and can pay for food/phone bill.
Fear of being broke; also makes me afraid to spend money.
Been battling diagnosed depression for 5+ years. I had a counselor for 2 1/2 years and she told me she things I have major depression.

Where I am/Present day:
Let go from internship recently after a long bout of unemployment due to small non-profit budget reasons. Got let go in early August.
Mom has part-time job. Before then used to help out/give her $$$
Dad has full-time job.
Again half-assingly looking for apartments, sublets, and jobs.  Actually have 2 job interviews today but I am not sure I am going (fear, developing slight Agoraphobia). Not sure if I want a job now.
Managed to save money from internship (already on top of savings from last job). I can live off these savings for a couple of months.
Family is divided. Father stubborn and overworked. Mother hopeless and slightly irresponsible. Etc. Constant fights. 
Feel alone, that no one has my back, that I can't trust anyone.
Resentment, betrayal, anger, sadness/mixed feelings, towards parents/family. My parents has let me down so much.
Don't have confidence in myself/ going out on my own because I don't have anyone to truly fall back on if I fail. 1st world poor.

Now that I got the backstory out the way it's time for feelings.
This past couple of months have been the worst of my life. I have never felt soo lost and soo weak ever. On days that I didn't have my internship I used be afraid to leave my house. I only survived at my internship because my fear of being completely broke outweighs my fear of being outside. Towards the end of my internship it has gotten way worst (my developing Agoraphobia). I say developing because I can physically go outside it's just that I need to mentally distract myself (playing games on phone, listening to music, reading). I even experienced silent freakouts at my internship. The house has made me a bit crazy. Thoughts racing, constant stomachaches when I think about my ""reality""; feeling unhinged/unsafe. The only way I can relax myself is Netflix. I have developed escapist tendencies &amp; I don't think I can face reality head on. 

LOGIC/HEAD IS TELLING ME
Get a full time job
Save some more.
Get the fuck out.
Don't want to enable my mental illnesses.

HEART/BODY IS TELLING ME:
Slow down, take it easy, take care of your mental health FIRST.
Be creative, use this free time to write and figure out life/career.
Need emotional support.
Fear I am heading towards a breakdown

I feel I always have to choose between them. To be honest I am leaning more towards my heart. I am not sure if it's my fear/mental issues talking or if it's actually what I want to do. The only real reason I am leaning towards my heart is, I never actually truly followed my heart. I always did what was expected of me, always was responsible, mature, put together. And for 5 years onward my programming/facade is breaking down. I always did my school work, hardly ever socialized, never got in trouble, always obeyed my parents. I was always smart with money, controlled, and careful. Got to college and all that I was, was questioned. I realized at 18 I was never actually truly happy. I did things because I thought that is what I should be doing than what I want to be doing. Negative thinking, social media, social community isolation (went away for college).

Before I close this novel of a post; I just want to let you know that I am NOT/NEVER WAS SUICIDAL. I also don't think I am completely hopeless. I know I am smart &amp; responsible I just need help/time/emotional support and to not be soo hard on myself. Even so, I don't believe it (I know this is statement contradictory &amp; weird). I struggling with knowing &amp; believing. I know things/have insight, but I can't put them into believing/action.

Anyway vent over (I got much more to say but this is HELLA long)."

I did things because I thought that is what I should be doing than what I want to be doing. Negative thinking, social media, social community isolation (went away for college).
Before I close this novel of a post; I just want to let you know that I am NOT/NEVER WAS SUICIDAL. I also don't think I am completely hopeless. I know I am smart &amp; responsible I just need help/time/emotional support and to not be soo hard on myself. Even so, I don't believe it (I know this is statement contradictory &amp; weird). I struggling with knowing &amp; believing. I know things/have insight, but I can't put them into believing/action.
Anyway vent over (I got much more to say but this is HELLA long)."

I've been tasked with finding an alternative for our ASA 5515 PPTP VPN tunnel. Currently we use our ASA and authenticate with AD but we need something more secure.The new VPN tunnel must use two factor authentication and be fairly cheap.
So far I've came across StrongSwan and OpenVPN and I'm going to test these but I came here to see if you guys knew of any other ones.

So, does anyone know of any good VPN tunnels that use two factor authentication?  

Yes I googled it. I just came here for an additional means of research.

Had a phone interview then face to face and met with HR director and HR VP they gave me a verbal offer for a position and then never heard back. They needed an bilingual Spanish speaking person in their office for the type of work I want to get into, I thought it was fantastic and very happy about the position I sent out thank you emails and heard back two weeks later about how they were still interested and to wait for next steps, after this they went ghost on me I followed up with two emails and haven't heard back since. I figured they weren't interested so I began job searching again.

Now, throughout my whole undergrad career I was working part time as a bank teller which kind of helped me because I was able to get an internship under my belt. After graduating one of my former bank managers asked me if now that I was done with school if I wold like to work full time and I said of course. He is an awesome guy to work with I did tell him about my situation with X company he said it was fine If I'm pursuing other things he would never hold it against me. Since I've started to apply I have gotten numerous phone interviews but no success and now there is one that may have an offer soon but its a contract position for 3 months after the 3 months there is no gurantee for a full time position. Realistically I would like to take it to get my foot in the door somewhere and begin my career but I also don't want to leave my full time bank teller position because of health insurance, 401k, and the steady income. I really don't know what to do. Please any suggestions would be great!"
4zimqp,1,2016-08-25,Me [23/F] keeps having constant dreams with friend [22/M] that I have not spoken to for almost a year,whaletailisland,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zimqp/me_23f_keeps_having_constant_dreams_with_friend/,"WARNING: LONG
Two years ago I went out to the Midwest to do a short summer (10 weeks) internship. Being from the East Coast, I was really homesick and after a month of being out there, I was ready to quit. There was nobody on my floor who was my age, and the other interns at the company were located in different locations throughout the Midwest. My then-boyfriend (now fiance) [20/M] at the time came out to visit me for a weekend because I was so homesick, and he convinced me to stay for one more week just to make sure that I was sure I was going to leave. The day after he left, the company hosted a small two-day get together for all of the interns and I ended up meeting one guy who I really got along with, completely platonically. I didn't have any feelings for him at all except extreme gratefulness that I now had a friend at my internship. 


We became really close in the remaining time out there, and ended up spending a decent amount of time together. He invited me over to his place a lot, especially when his roommate would throw parties so I would get to meet some more people and not feel as lonely. We also did a road trip to Colorado one weekend to visit some family/friends and had a really great time. I told my boyfriend about him, and my BF was really happy that I had made a friend since I had been so lonely out there. 


Anyways, the summer ended and I returned home to the East Coast. My friend and I stayed in really great contact - we skyped a lot (with my BF with me), we called each other a bunch, and we snapchatted back and forth constantly. He told me about this girl that he met in his class, and I helped kick him in the butt to start talking with her [21/F], and eventually they started dating. We started skyping (friend, his gf, my bf, and me). We all exchanged #s and I actually became friends with his gf, in some sort of strange modern pen-pal way. 


Anyways, last November, I texted her asking if she could relay a message to my friend since he was terrible at responding to texts. She didn't respond, but two days later my friend texted me saying that it was really inappropriate for me to have asked his gf a message that was intended for him, and that we couldn't be friends anymore. I was completely taken aback and said ""okay, I didn't mean to overstep any boundaries but a romantic relationship is more important than a friendship, so I understood where he was coming from"". He then responded saying ""my gf found out that I cut you off and got really mad. I'm in the shitter with her right now and I don't know what to do so I'm sorry. We can still talk and stuff and be friends"". At this point I was really confused and just said ""Okay just let me know what you want to do... I obviously value our friendship but I don't want to be an issue in your relationship"". He called me later to apologize again and said that we could still be friends, etc. 


Since then, I've heard from him once. It's been 9 months. I called him a few times just to see what was going on, and he answered a few times, but started ignoring them. Before, if he had missed my call, he would usually call back within a few days, and vice versa. I've pretty much given up on hearing back from him, and I stopped calling after a few months. 


What's weird is that for the past 6 or so months, I keep having dreams about him and his gf. They're really platonic dreams, like my fiance and I double date with him and his gf, or we run into them at the grocery store, etc. But they happen 3 -4 times a week, and I'm not sure what to do about that. I don't really think about him at all during the day, but then I go to sleep and he just keeps popping up. I don't know how to get rid of them, or why I keep dreaming about him and his gf. I don't want to call him up and say 'hey I've been dreaming about you and your gf, let's catch up' because that's just creepy, but I also want to move on with my life and each time I dream about him, it makes me miss his friendship. I'm not sure what I should do/what it means...
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I was really close with a guy friend, and after he was dating a girl for a year, we drifted apart. Now I keep having dreams with him and his gf and I don't know why/how to make them stop. "

I am studying for a computing degree and I was hoping that I can find an IT job that is relevant to my studies. I studied German in my local university and am now at Level B1 competency, so the language barrier (if any) should be manageable. I just have a few queries:

1. What is the likelihood that I can find an internship at all in the first place, given that I'm a foreigner from outside of the EU and I can only work for about 4 months?
2. Should I write my resume and CV in German? I have sent out a couple of applications but have not received any reply yet (maybe because it was written in English...)

I am currently applying to MNCs, as I think they would be more open to hiring random interns like me, but I would be grateful if any of you have any recommendations too.

Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!"

4ziy5j,98,2016-08-25,The right to remain silent,princessofsalt,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/4ziy5j/the_right_to_remain_silent/,"Hello, I am back with another story! I really love posting my crazy encounters on here.

I am an intern for a certain public defenders office. I work on the misdemeanor docket. I do normal intern things like file papers and make copies, bur I also get to work directly with clients: conducting interviews, reviewing police reports and sentencing guidelines, and helping to get plea deals. It's a pretty good job.

A client was having a pretrial for assault &amp; battery and malicious destruction of property charged because she allegedly slapped her ex boyfriend in the face and then shattered his phone. There were pictures of the shattered phone and the nasty bruise the boyfriend had. 

I took her into the interview room before her pretrial to review her police report. After greeting her and introducing myself and asking if she has any initial questions, I explain that she's here for a pretrial and ask if she understands what that means, she says yes. So I had her the police report and photographs and tell her to read it so we can talk about what parts of it are true or if she has her own side of the story. 

She reads it all over then sets it on the table and says, ""I have nothing to say.""

I say, ""um OK so do agree with what happened in the police report or do you have your own side of the story?""

She said, ""I will not speak to you. I will only speak to the judge. I will not contest what he wants me to do.""

At this point, I'm super confused and I say, ""I work for your court appointed attorney. You need to talk to me so our office can help you. Did you not want to be represented by our office? If you're saying you want to plead no contest to the charges that's totally fine and you can do that.""

Then she tells me, ""I am going to use my right to remain silent.""

I stood there, dumbfounded. I have never had a client just refuse to speak to me. I thought maybe she was just confused and thought I was trying to trick her into some comfession. I told her, ""I'm not a police officer. I work for your attorney. If you choose to not talk to me, we can't help you.""

Then she stands up and starts pacing around the room demanding that she get to ""know her rights."" I remind her that she signed an advice of rights form at her arraignment that had all of her rights on. 

I then asked her one last time, ""would you like to talk to me about your case so we can decide how you want to plead?""

She just looked at me and said, ""I am going to remain silent and let the judge do what he wants."" 

Frustrated and confused, I just said, ""OK fine."" And walked out of the room. She went back to sit in court and I got the investigator for the public defenders office (one of my supervisors) to try and talk to her after about 20 minutes to give her and I time to cool off. Then, he asked her to come with us back to the conference room and introduced himself and asked her what happened on the night she was accused of assault. She told him she refused to talk to us.

My supervisor asked, ""OK so you want to represent yourself? Because you told the judge at arrignment that you wanted an attorney."" 

She said, ""I am no contest. I will let the judge do what he wants.""

My supervisor just stared at her and said, ""did you just say you are no contest? You clearly don't know what that means.... do you want us to explain what what a no contest plea is?"" 

She looked at him and said, ""silence. I will use my right to be silent.""

My supervisor, who is the type of person who wants to try to not conflict off of any case, kept pushing. He said, ""you don't have a right to remain silent with us. We aren't the police. I work for your attorney. You can choose to not talk to us, but then we will choose to send you to a different attorney and you'll have to do this whole process again.""

At this point, our client is getting angry and tells my supervisor that I violated her rights because I never told her what her rights are. It took us a minute to understand what she was saying: she was complaining that I, and intern for her attorney, didn't read her her Miranda rights before talking to her.

We just exchange looks and I inform her, for the third time that I am not a fucking police officer and that I don't have to read her any rights. 

Then we told her we were not going to help her and she would be assigned to another attorney and left the room.

About a half hour later, she walked up to me when I was on my way to the bathroom and said, ""so do you know what my attorney said?""

And I looked at her and said, ""the court will assign you a new attorney since you refused to work with us. You can also choose to represent yourself, since you seem to be pretty sure of what you want to do.""

She asked, ""I can represent myself?""

And I smiled and said, ""yup you go right ahead if you want.""

I hope that bitch goes and tells the judge she is ""no contest""."

I am 23yo guy, and I have been dating my girlfriend since I first started my studies at the university. We love each other very much and I can't live without her. We had the same classes in the university, we have the same friends. We travelled many times together and spend many great time together. We bascically did everything together.
All the problems started when we learned about an Internship in USA and we were both very interested in doing it, so we both applied for it and after passing the interviews with the recruiter we both got accepted but we had to wait for some months in order to start our visa procedure, so we went to another internship in Ukraine, and it was where we really knew how much we love each other and how helpful to one another. We stayed in the same place and lived together for 2months, only her and I without knowing anybody in the whole country. This travel made us know each other more and to know each one's weakness, and we ended up loving each other even more.
When we came to our country we had to apply for the visa for the US, so we did. Sadly, her visa got accepted but mine got rejected. Knowing that we made the promess that if one of us is accepted but not the other, none of us will go and we finish our master's degree.

I know she dreamt for a year to have this training with me, I really want to go with her. But unfortunnalty my visa got rejected even tho we had literrally the same visa application documents. The officer did not ask her to prove anything but she did the exact opposite with me. She asked me for all my documents and I did provide it but the officer wasn't conviced that I would come back to my country, even tho I had all the documents to prove that I am coming back.
I really felt hopeless because I disappointed my girlfriend so much, I did all I could do to not to fail at the end of this.

The real problem is that now that we are facing this problem, that we knew that promesses we made were kind of not that easy to make. My parents always told me to never go without her because they love her very much, but it's not the case for hers. Her mother want her to go really bad even if I'm not going with her. And she said ""no"" and she wont go without me, her mother insulted her saying she was a dumb girl. She started to cry and that really torned me apart. 

I really feel hopeless, I feel like a trash because I failed my visa, I feel so much depressed, I thought about killing myself because everyone in her familly think that I am the reason why she will not go for her training in the USA (Knowing that in my country, USA means heaven and Eldorado). Now she has to make a choice between staying with me (We wanted to get married and have our master's degree together) or to please her mother and go to the US without me(which means our relationship will be done).

You can't even imagine how much I cried every night, I can no longer find sleep(about 2 to 4hours each night), I start to have a high bloodpressure due to stress and sadness. I loved this girl since the day I saw her the first time, I loved each second that we passed together, I love each smile of her that brighten my days.
I will try my best to reapply again, and maybe I will be accepted (or not) and all this will be just a bad dream. But if I get rejected again, we will be having the same issue over and over.
I feel destroyed, I feel hopeless, I never felt this way in my life, I want to die, so that she doesn't have to make a choice, I want life to be fair with her.
Help me, I am begging you, HELP!

I love her more than anything else in this worlds"

1 - Income is king. Taking out $50K in loans for a $100K job is better than taking out $30K in loans for a $30K job. You can take out any amount of loans as long as you're confident in your chances of an increased income.

2 - Only take out what you need. My friends all went to Taiwan, Cancun, Bora Bora, etc for vacation. I kept all of my vacations domestic (Myrtle Beach, Las Vegas, NYC, etc). Remember a flight for spring break might be $1500 or more!

3 - Work during school. $1 you make now is worth more than $1 you make when you graduate. And, in school, you tend to have time. I did three 15 week internships, and made $12K, $21K, and $31K from them respectively. I also did research for one of my professors for a few thousand dollars a semester. This allowed me to reduce my loan load.

4 - Work after graduation. Many of my friends wanted to delay working for 3 months. Well, that 3 months is a significant income source. I started working the week after graduation.

5 - Live frugally. I eat out a lot, but I make an effort to live frugally in other areas. I share a 2 bedroom apartment with 5 other people so my rent is only $550/mo. You don't deserve to have your own private room in a nice location just because you're you - you're only entitled to it when you can pay for it. When I needed a car, I really wanted a new Mercedes and could have gotten one, but I opted to buy a new Honda Accord instead.

I hope this helps! And feel free to ask for specific advice."

So I've always had major anxiety which caused me to put off things like getting my driver's license, going to school, having relationships etc. In the last ear I got my license and finished school, and it's just now hitting me how much I missed out on because of my fear.

On top of that, I'm supposed to start my job in less than a month as a junior software developer, and I feel like it's going to be a disaster, because I never had an internship or anything like most CS grads do, so I have no idea how to function in this kind of job. I'm going to be signing a year long lease, and I feel like I'm going to fail at the job, get fired, and then be stuck with rent I can't afford for a year.

Even if it does work out...the idea of working 50 hours a week just kills me. I know, ""welcome to the real world"", etc. It just seems not worth living in. What is the point of selling your life away for money? So you have money to do nothing with because you're always stuck in an office anyway? But of course, I can't choose to work less, because I have a bunch of student loans to pay off. FML.

I just feel like I'm a 28 year old with the skills and life experience of a 21 year old, or a teenager. To make it worse, I'll soon have no free time to start finally doing things I want to do. It feels awful and hopeless."

Sonja is right on the mark about Lu. She doesn't want to deal with the truth. But I feel that this is Lu in general. She doesn't want to deal with the truth about anything. Sonja is also right when she said Lu just wanted to get married IMHO.

I personally think Lu is a bit delusional. I heard whispers before that she thought she would get her own show (not from Sonja, from a blogger). To quote Bethenny - I mean....  

Sonja is also the voice of reason on the subject of Tom. When she said: ""Why is anyone surprised?"" I laughed because she is dead right (and it was the delivery too). Some men don't change. 

OK, onto mics. B is getting slammed for telling Lu on camera. Lu asked for filming to halt - but continued. Me, I would have ripped off my mic pack and said to Bethenny ""Not here"". If we didn't want the crew to hear things we whispered and texted. 
I felt so bad for her (I felt it was a very real couple of scenes) but she still went into the bathroom and had the conversation on the phone. She might as well have had it on the balcony with Bethenny. 

I wouldn't have done it Bethenny's way but Lu let it play out on camera too. They both did it. I think there was a moment of friendship between them where it was about one woman saying to another: ""I don't want to hurt you but I didn't know how to tell you and I have to tell you this is what your man was up to."" A few days apart, I'd say Lu's head got swivelled round by Tom.

And I thought John was going to be the villain of the season..."
4zjjo3,11,2016-08-25,Obtaining an entry-level data analyst position with just a portfolio?,iplayguitarsorta,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/4zjjo3/obtaining_an_entrylevel_data_analyst_position/,"I realize this sub is probably more dedicated to data science rather than data analytics, but I hope to draw some advice on the latter. 

I'm currently seeking employment as a data analyst either in an an entry level position or through an internship. Thus far, in the span of about a month, my attempts at doing so have largely been unsuccessful. It's somewhat understandable however because I have no actual work experience in this area and some of my related skills are at a rudimentary level. I'm getting a master's degree in applied mathematics at a state university and have basic, not proficient, knowledge of SQL and R. I've set my eye on also learning Python, Hadoop, SAS and maybe even Tableau as many of these seem to be essential skills in the data analyst's toolbox.

Assuming I can't find a related internship or entry-level work in this field on my existing circumstances, is it a good idea to polish my programming skills and work on building an attractive portfolio that can potentially gain me such employment despite my lack of experience? I mean, is obtaining employment this way even likely?

I should mention that I have an upcoming interview for an internship that might include some aspects of data analytics (the recruiter wasn't exactly sure and instructed me to ask the individual interviewing me to get exact details). Were I to be offered the position, I would be somewhat apprehensive not only because this internship may not be entirely oriented around data analytics, but also because it's a non-paid, 3 month position and would require 20-30 hours per week. I only have enough money to last me the next two months, which might even be an optimistic estimate, so if landing a job through a good portfolio is possible, then I rather not take this internship and look for temporary paid employment. 

I'd be very grateful to hear any Redditor's thoughts on the matter. "

He had called in sick. He had sabotaged the machine. He had fled to the bathroom every time he saw a bleary eyed morning zombie trudging up to his desk, brandishing a thermos. There was no escape today, though. Edgar had him cornered in his cubicle, his beady eyes shining with suspicion. He knew, and he would have answers. ""Sam, isn't it your turn to make coffee today?""

Time stopped, though in the split-second prior, Edgar had just enough time to begin to roll his eyes. Sam skidded over to his computer, the golden question spilling from his fingertips. ""how to brew coffee"" vanished in the search bar, replaced by a Google query, but no answer. The telltale dinosaur blinked on his browser, and Sam smacked his forehead: the Internet didn't work during a time stop.

Sam leapt from his seat, darting past Edgar, and began to navigate the maze of frozen people. Several heads poked out of cubicles, faces pointed towards the coffee machine sitting in the back of the room. Expectation lingered in their frozen eyes as they waited for their savior to deliver them from the morning drudgery. Sam pored over the cup, the back of the machine, and even a stray coffee filter, but none bore the bible of brewery he needed. 

He sighed, picking at the creases in his shirt. He worked in data entry, for crying out loud; there was only one type of filter he knew about. The supervisors had no grounds for delegating coffee duty to an spreadsheet monkey, even at Starbucks's corporate office. But Sam had asserted his proficiency as a barista at the job interview, and lying was grounds for a reprimand at the very least. So he pressed onwards, clattering down the stairs, in search for a solution. Did the Starbucks's offices have a library? A printing center? A cute step-by-step wall adornment teaching kids and hapless interns how to make their own coffee?

As it turned out, they had none of the above, but they did have their own cafe, nestled in an alcove on the first floor. A barista slumped against the counter, watching the coffee timer tick down—or rather, not tick down, as the case currently was. *Of all the time to pause time*, Sam thought. He would've stolen the pot if it had been ready. An idea struck him: his eyes fell upon the coffee drinkers spread throughout the cafe, cups pressed to their lips. One by one, he gathered their drinks, five in total, and began to climb back upstairs.

It occurred to Sam that he ought to have taken them up on a tray. Or even bring the coffeepot downstairs and perform the transferal there. This occurrence occurred approximately one second before one of the cups sprang loose of his teetering hold, and a hot liquid came pouring out, spilling onto and through his shirt. Though pain seared in his side, Sam managed to persevere up the remaining stairs and all the way through the office door. His reward was half a pot of murky brown FrankenCoffee that smelled like an identity crisis.

Sam's knees buckled, and he collapsed onto the floor, his head rolling upwards. He needed more time, more energy, to fill the pot completely. From the domed ceiling, the Starbucks mermaid stared at him, a silent siren's song emanating from her pursed lips. She offered Sam a promise, a promise of liquid glory and rejuvenation. He accepted, crawling to his feet and lifting the pot to his lips.

It tasted like shit and backwash.

Edgar blinked as time resumed. ""Well?""

Sam straightened his shirt, not even attempting to hide the brown stains. ""Someone broke the coffee machine again."""

My girlfriend of two years broke up with me last week, and I'm having such confusing feelings and thoughts, especially since she goes to school with me.

Work has been very stressful (I've worked for the last week or so straight) and I've only gotten a total of 10 hours of sleep in the last two days, mainly because I stay up late from fear of sleeping. 

My anxiety from my hypochondria is doing terrible right now because of a bump that came up under my temple on my left side, and I don't know if it's a pimple since it's skin colored. I have a sensation on the back left of my mouth, on my soft palate up top, where I just feel my palate, I don't know. My left eye has been twitching a bit. I have been dealing with the fear of rabies and cancer for a few years now. I feel like my left I is slightly more closed than the other, but I don't even know, I feel like it's just in my head. 

My parents are really stressing me out and irritating me because the only times they talk to me is when they nag me about my future (school, work, internships) and it upsets me to think about that stuff.

And I'm going to start college in three days, which I'm freaking out about because I have to worry about social situations, wanting to find more friends who are girls, and also keeping good grades.

I haven't been eating much, or well. I'm just very sad, alone, like I'm going to die, and feel doomed. I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else is going through something tough, so they know they are not alone.

edit: Forgot to include that I have recently tried using dating apps like Tinder, but for some reason I get intense anxiety from using it, I'm not sure why since I don't get anxiety from social situations, unless I'm around alcohol or drugs."

However, my main concern is the long hours during tax season. I have worked long hours before in industry and also during my co-op (internship) at a small public accounting firm; and I notice the following problems occur when I work long hours:

(1) My eyes begin to hurt from looking at a computer for a long time.
(2) I begin to get stressed out because deadlines are tight, partners keep pushing me to finish the work fast (even though I can't since the client hasn't gotten back to me), I have to keep switching back and fourth between different files, etc.
(3) My desk is small, and I have so many files (pending further info from client/partner) on my desk. There is little storage, so I end up with a lot of clutter on/around my desk. I find this clutter distracting. 
(4) Fatigue begins to develop, and I become slower/less productive in completing my tasks after about 8 hours. 
(5) I begin to develop migraines after about 8 hours. After I get home, they still persist. 

That said, I have seem a lot of people who seem to thrive and succeed while working long hours, and I'm sure there are some of those people on this board :).

How do you all handle the stress and issues (including the ones listed above) associated with working long hours? 

Edit: Just another thought - I find exercise helps me deal with stress. At the firm where I did my co-op/internship, nobody was allowed to go exercise during the day. I would try and leave slightly early so I could go to the gym after work (when it was crowded). I would think exercising mid-day would be helpful - do Big 4 firms tend to allow this? "

My savings from previous internships amounts to about 20k, with 15k in medium- to high-risk mutual funds, and 5k in a savings account as an emergency fund. I also have about 15k in student loans to pay off.


The offer is in an area with a relatively high cost of living (Seattle), and most studio apartments seem to run 1.5k/2k a month. I calculated my monthly take-home pay to be around 6.3k/mo without voluntary deductions using [this calculator.](http://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/salary) The company offers up to 9k/year in matching for its 401k plan; my understanding is that I should max that out, pay off my student debt, then contribute to an IRA at 5.5k/yr, then continue to contribute to my savings, per [this chart.](https://i.imgur.com/fb7Dtmh.png)


My plan right now is to follow those steps. I should hopefully be able to knock out my student loans immediately with my starting bonus. I won't have a car, so my high-priority expenses are mostly food and rent.


I have a few questions about my situation:

1. Can I reasonably afford a 1.5-2k/month apartment with that take-home pay? I've heard that the rule of thumb is about 30% of your take-home pay, but with the heightened cost of living, I'm not sure if that still applies.

2. The relocation package includes an option of either a 5k stipend, or 30 days of free housing in an area of my choice + a relocation specialist. I've heard from some to take the 5k and figure out housing on my own, and from others that the 30 days is really important to apartment-hunting. Any feedback would be appreciated.

3. The company is also offering me an ""on-hire stock award"" of 60k. I've read through the contract thoroughly and am still confused. Is this stock something I should keep saved, or reinvest as soon as I get it? I'm unsure as to how corporate stock plans typically work, and could use some guidance.

4. Any additional advice on avoiding lifestyle creep would be appreciated. I've been trying to educate myself on managing my finances over the past year or two, but I'm still a little overwhelmed by the whole process and don't want to blow all of my money as soon as I start.

I just came back to school after a couple of internships, and recently was accepted to basically my dream job starting in spring.

I don't have any friends here and don't know how to make them. After years of university, I've made a few good acquaintances but since I was away from school for ~6 months, I don't feel comfortable reaching out to them. My classes are difficult and time-consuming. I have a boyfriend, but I don't expect him to be my main social support and he has a pretty demanding job. I'm just so lonely and miserable all the time. My first internship was amazing and I made so many friends, but they're all across the country living their own lives with their own friends now. And when I think back on it, all I can think of is whenever I said something embarrassing or dumb and feel like everyone actually hated me the whole time, and that I never actually had any friends at all. 

I know I should try to do extracurriculars but the thought of biking to campus and socializing feels so draining. I haven't made any real friends after 3 years here, so what will change now? Last year, I pledged a co-ed fraternity and felt accepted and a little bit happy, but I was failing my courses and having difficulty keeping up with things due to an eating disorder and wound up quitting. I don't think they'd understand me asking to come back. And what's the point if I'll be leaving in a few months again anyways?

Everything feels so empty even if I have a great job opportunity, a boyfriend who loves me, and a pet I love very much. Schoolwork is draining and convincing myself to go to class is difficult, and it's only the first week. I've tried therapy and found it condescending, annoying, and unhelpful. I tried antidepressants for a couple months a couple years ago, which also didn't help.

I'm just tired of always being lonely and feeling isolated from the world. I think it's all in my head, but I can't stop thinking how annoying and weird I am to everyone around me, so I don't reach out to talk anymore. I only feel better when I drink or get lost in video games, movies, and shows, but that can't last forever. 

I know that a new opportunity for happiness will come in a few months, but it feels so far away and I'm afraid of messing it up. I'm easily overwhelmed by everyday tasks - how can I hope to do a good job at anything requiring competence? I've attempted suicide a few times in the past, but even that feels like so much effort now. I'd have to break up with my boyfriend, find a new place to live, find a home for my cat, etc. I have suicidal ideations quite often and have romanticized the notion. 

I feel good for a while sometimes, but then see others laughing and talking and realize how alone I am again."

He is a software engineer and well above the average skill level of experienced software engineers, despite having very little experience (I'm also a software engineer, with over 40 years experience, so I have a very good understanding of typical software engineering ability, despite knowing surprisingly little about salary ranges).  
I did online searches for Software Engineer salary ranges and got absurdly contradictory results from different credible looking sources.  The offer he has is $85K with average (for software engineering) benefits, at a company that generally resists hiring non PHDs (but will make an exception for him) and gives the most undesirable assignments to the few non PHDs and especially won't make an exception for him.  He interviews very badly.  He lucked into an internship despite interviewing badly for it (and being an undergraduate), because they over estimated the insistence level behind the recommendation to interview him that came from a casual acquaintance of ours that was an important person to them.  
In the internship, he quickly gravitated to a role of diagnosing and correcting the most stubborn malfunctions that had stumped the permanent employees.  That is a special skill of his, and certainly why they want him back, and they would be incredibly lucky to get him back for just $85K a year, and while doing something you're especially skilled at tends to be gratifying, a software career of cleaning up the mistakes of respected but not terribly competent PHDs can get annoying (boy do I ever know from experience).  
So they would be incredibly lucky to get him at $85K, but he interviews badly enough that he might be lucky to get a first job at $85K.  Any other software company hiring him for more would be getting a good deal.  But they won't know that.
So should he roll the dice on landing a better first job with his great programming skills and rotten interview skills?"

Even for entry-level positions, many job descriptions include the requirement that the applicant has to have experience in a particular specialized area. 

For example, if I've had internships related to propulsion, would I be hard-pressed to land a full-time job that doesn't relate to propulsion, or would the experience of those internships still hold weight anywhere?

I know I want to try to get employed as a computer hardware engineer or something like that with a processor company like ARM or something. Where do I start with it all?

I'm very certain that I will learn programming and all the fundamentals here, but how can I get good enough at this stuff to make it notable? As it is, I do not feel like I know enough, if anything at all, when it comes to this stuff. 

I've been trying to connect to organizations and things that will help me later on, like the IEEE, but I don't know what to do other than that really. As it stands, I need to learn enough to take advantage of these, and get internships, join hackathons, build things, etc.

What do I do to really develop a career path when I'm starting from next to nothing? Do I just practice and build myself up this first year? Am I thinking about this all too early? "

And it’s only getting worse. I woke up this morning with my hand already between my squeezing thighs, moaning into the pillow. Praying that my roommate couldn’t hear me. From wet dream to fingerfucking myself in less than a minute, and less than two before I fought with my muscles to keep the sheets from being ruined. 

“Mmm… fuck!” I growled into the pillow. Flung the sheets to the side, prying my body away and stumbling onto quivering legs. The walk to the shower as my knocking knees slapped into one another was far longer than the morning prior. My memory even recalled the hallway as shorter.

It was like this every single month, where no matter what: I wanted to fuck. I wanted something stuck up my pussy and rubbing along my clit. I wanted something in my ass, be it fingers, cock, faces, toys or tongues. I wanted pair of thighs around my head. I wanted to fuck. Cum is something that I love, be it on me, in me or before me to lap up. I love cumming as well, don’t get me wrong, nothing like burying a face between my legs and coating it in liquid pleasure. And nothing like licking off that face as my fingers played the songs of sex.

Rattling rang out. I slammed the shower door. Recklessly, I flung my hands across the knobs and retreated against the wall. Fingers between my legs once more, a pair around my nipple as I silently screamed for relief. It was like this every time. 

Every. Single. Month.

“Ohhh jesusfuckingchrist,” I shrieked. The wall met my head. My back arched away. My toes curled. My eyes clamped shut. Just as tight as my pulsating pussy. I lost control of my breathing. Writhing body. Quaking core. Gritted teeth. In moments, I was wrought with pleasure and kicking my legs about. Pain shot through my leg, foot burning with agony and heightening the contrast with surging pleasure. I had kicked the fucking wall, sweat coming to skin with steam rising.

“Oww.. ooOOOHhh.. owww… fuck.. uuuHHHnnn.” Ever heard someone between pleasure and pain, squirming about beneath a battering of burning water? The spindrift splashed me with heat, my aching pussy demanding more despite the protesting clit. And I, I was unable to hold back. Eyes screwed shut, I thrust my hand down between my legs again, trying and failing to avoid the engorged nub. My hips bucked along the floor, fucking my hand with all the intensity of a bitch in heat, with groans to boot.

And that was only this morning where I got to relieve myself. I counted nine. Nine. Fucking. Orgasms. I had a bullet vibe in each, a slightly smaller one in my ass compared to the other one in my demanding cunt, while I ate corn flakes. Nude. I had milk dripping down my body, all over the towel and a spoon on the floor by the time I was finished. A shower later, and I prayed -- it was a moment of reprieve -- that the worst would come tomorrow. That just for today, one day away from the promised Friday, I would have some mercy.

Every. Single. Month. Today was the first day, it would be (and always has been) bad. But manageable. Barely. Day two and I’d grind myself along a leg or foot as I sucked or ate someone out. Day three was the worst, practically bedridden with toys and heat, and if the fates smiled, a partner. Or partners. Day four was the same, before it would begin to taper off, and by day seven I’d be an almost regular person with a high sex drive.

Fuck!

My office chair was at risk of becoming a wet sponge. Red-faced and ruined panties from my drooling lips, I did my best to keep my gaze down as I headed for the bathroom. To no avail, literally every single person looked fuckable. I could rub myself along their hands. I could wear a strapon and fuck them all in the butt, yanking their hair while my body raged for more. I undressed and tied up both myself and the entire office in my head.

“Shit!” I hissed, my ass slamming into the seat. I needed something in me. Forefinger went first, doing my best to stay silent and bite back the moan. My bottom lip screamed in pain as I bit down and wrenched my head to the side. Air rushed back and forth along my nose, trying my best to keep quiet atop the rumbling seat. Courtesy of thighs that wished to push my hand deeper. Modern music couldn’t hold a candle to the drumming beats of my heart. Footsteps cranked it up to eleven, then twelve and all the while I chanted for some angel of sex (or demon, or whatever would fuck me) to come down and take me. And for whoever was out there to just ignore me. They heard me. They definitely fucking hear-

“Fuuuuuck,” I groaned. The landscape of my smooth stomach quaked like Nepal. Shoes skidded along the floor, barely missing the stall. I gushed more than should have been possible. Twelve. Nine before work. Two while I was driving. And another one at work. God, how I wished I brought a vibrator to work, I mean like what’s the bloody point of a personal office if you can’t have a *little* fucking private relief? That intern from the second floor, fresh out of college, would be fucking amazing between my legs. Or I could pin him down and ride his face should his cock fail. Or the other one, she could probably eat pussy better.


“You okay?” I responded with deafening silence and ragged breaths.

Now? Now I’m home. And I crave a partner. This is day one. Day one is manageable. Just. I sent a message to all I know on every dating site I’d signed up for -- turns out most hadn’t been touched for exactly one month. I’m a domme. I’m a sub. I’ll ride your face. I’ll ride your cock. I’ll fuck your pussy. I’ll peg your butt. I’ll drain you empty and then some. I’ll hold a memorial when this is all over, in loving memory of my face between your legs. Or ass. For fuck sake, I’ll suck your hand and get myself off on your thigh if that’s what you enjoy. But please, I fucking need you for tomorrow and the days after.
Please.

I need to fuck or I’m going to explode. And I really hate doing the laundry.

I was contemplating going to Grad School for my teaching certificate, but found out this week that my job is going to be eliminated and I have a couple of months to find something new (no severance). So I'm shelving that goal for now,  I am going to apply for jobs in the education field (kindergarten teacher, etc) so that if I do go to Grad School I will have more experience. Also I need to get out of retail and child care centers pay low, but seem willing to take a chance on the less experienced.

During the ten years I earned a certificate in paralegal studies and had an internship the county public defenders office.

I'm feeling really insecure about how my resume looks to potential non-retail fields and all my past experience prior to college (except for the job I had in college) has been retail. I hate retail and have been trying to get out for a very long time now.

Do I list the internship I had at the Public Defenders Office?
Should I list the paralegal certificate? Should I list all of the potions I had at the grocery store or should I list the most ""important ones"" (management for 5 years, etc)? Do I bother with the temp jobs that were just a couple of weeks here and there?

4zljhf,4,2016-08-25,Should I be focusing on specializing or diversifying my Music Production skill set?,Red_PillCosby,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4zljhf/should_i_be_focusing_on_specializing_or/,"So in the next few months, I'll be finished with my Music Production degree and heading towards a paid internship with a really experienced mastering engineer. This guy ran a college studio for 20 years and has run his remote recording / graphic design / production / restoration / mastering business for 25 years.

I consider this internship a huge blessing for what's available in my area, and I don't really know where to go from there. He specifically told me that he was looking for someone to take over his business and wanted to retire soon, and that seems like an option (granted his clients are sustainable in the long run - there is plenty of competition within 25+ miles) - but he operates in a home space with $30K+ just in room treatment and I'm not sure what the course of action would be other than buying his house and gear (which would be impossible with my student loans that I'll have no way to make payments on following the internship).

When I spoke to him last, he told me about how himself and many other colleagues of his in the music business had gone through several bouts of diversifying, then specializing. He used to be more heavily focused on studio work, production, and mixing, etc. and for a good while, he's mostly been doing mastering.

When I went down to Nashville a while back, everyone I met there said the opposite. They said, ""Don't try to do everything. Don't try to do too many things at once, you'll burn yourself out!"" And they were all really specialized in what they were doing. I was even told to stick to one genre. Some engineers I met were more often delegated to tracking, or mixing, etc. Of course, I figured a lot of that may have been the difference between a small town with far fewer folks in Music Production and a city like Nashville that is saturated to a degree.

I went and studied this in college partially because I grew up with a mentor that ran his own sound company back in the 80's and played bootlegs from his big live gigs whenever I hung out with him, and taught me about all the gear he'd collected over the years. It was a huge inspiration, especially since I'd already been involved in music. By the time I started Uni, I'd already had 10 years of piano lessons, 8 of percussion lessons, and 8 years of self-taught guitar/bass... Not to mention a lot of experience playing in different groups. I even got hired on as a piano instructor at 18 at a respected local lessons studio and kept a roster of 20 some students there for the year I was teaching. 

I had already begun producing basement demos and learning Ableton in high school, and loved the rush of staying up all night hammering a song out till it was perfect then mixing / mastering it... and what solidified my choice was that a lot of folks I knew with Bachelor's degrees and Master's degrees in Music Education were unemployed. 

Now it seems like I'm left with anything but what I've studied in school as options to keep myself afloat financially. With the way things look, I've been practicing piano and guitar 3+ hours a day and gathering books because I intend to hop on any job that will pay the student loans and try to round up students. It was really sad seeing some colleagues at Uni who had never played before try to pick up instruments and convince themselves they'd make it as musicians (since the engineering opportunities seem much more competitive). 

My thinking in taking this internship was that any producer or engineer in a studio that mainly focuses on tracking and mixing would appreciate and benefit from the skillset of an engineer who can also track and mix, but has really learned mastering from a reputable mastering engineer (since so many studio websites I visit seem to advertise mastering services) and could play well enough to fill in on sessions... But aside from that, I don't know what else I can do to make myself stand out in this sea of unpaid internships that lead to nowhere. One of the engineers I met in Nashville who actually had steady work had taken 5 or so unpaid internships in LA studios before he moved there... I don't know how to compete with that.

Would it be more viable to try to further specialize in one or a couple studio roles granted I ever land any more internships/opportunities to gain experience... Or should I look into possibly taking over this business (even though I really don't want to pursue mastering full time, but it's uncertain if I'd get enough work in mixing/production to sustain it). Would it be a better option just to find another small town with private instructor / engineer / producer roles to be filled and treat a home space like he did, then conduct my own business? Not sure what would be the best course of action from here.

TLDR; Finishing a Music Production degree soon, future looks pretty uncertain. Should I specialize or diversify?

Thanks!"

4zllv2,13,2016-08-25,It was her.,fewlacerations,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4zllv2/it_was_her/,"pt1

It's been three days. She hasn't moved. She just stands there in the corner of my room.. And she watches me.. It terrified me at first and I did everything in my power to make her leave.. But I couldn't touch her. It's as if she had a glass box surrounding her. A shield. 

On the first night, after my endless attempts of trying to rid her, I became restless. I was running out of options. So I began to try to speak to her, I mean really, what else did I have to lose? I approached her cautiously, remembering that I could not touch her. I hesitated and then quietly whispered, ""What are you?"" She blinked. She did not respond. 

This woman looked to be about my age, 27. She stood tall and straight and she had long curly locks,  luscious espresso brown, that draped her shoulders and danced across her back. Her eyes were soft, a mesmerizing pale blue and her skin was deathlike. It was pasty and dull, as if she'd never seen the sun. She wore a white cotton dress, tight around the waist and free toward the bottom, that fell just above her knees. I observed her quietly from across the room. Was I imagining this woman? I couldn't be. She was standing across my bedroom clear as day. She blinked. She is alive.. Is she alive? I spent the rest of my evening staring back at her and I eventually fell asleep sometime around 3 AM. 

The next morning I awoke to a lovely soft humming of a song I was all too familiar with. The Black Swan. I had remembered it from my childhood. It had been my favorite melody, so soft and charming. I froze in my bed. ""FUCK"" I thought to myself. I had fallen asleep with this.. This woman just standing in my room. At some point in my slumber, she had found her way to my bathroom and retrieved a hair brush. On top of everything else, she had managed to drag a dining chair into the bedroom, without waking me. She was now sitting quietly, humming to herself, brushing her curls loose into a soft wave. 

I was horrified. I couldn't call the police. No I couldn't, they wouldn't believe me. Who would? I thought I may be going crazy, because even when I tried to call the police I couldn't physically bring myself to dial the number.. I was stuck. I was stuck with this woman in my house. I decided to try and pretend as if she wasn't there. I got ready for work, cautiously locking myself in the bathroom. I pressed my back against the door and let out a long sigh of relief. What in the hell was going on? .. Id find out soon enough. 

I left that morning without a doubt in my mind that she would still be there when I got home. I just couldn't shake the feeling. I went straight to work, no stops, and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. I worked in a ravishingly large building in the center of downtown. Quite frankly, I was just the lobby girl. A receptionist who directed interns and new clients to offices of wealthy attorneys with beautiful families. I, however, was patiently waiting for my.. Well that's not important. I arrived swiftly and made it to my desk without any problems.. But when I sat down is when the trouble started. 

I obliviously turned on my computer monitor and put on my headset, as I did every other day, but when I looked up.. There she was, in the same white dress from last night and again earlier this morning. Staring at me from across the room. In a panic, I jumped to my feet and froze. I don't know how long I was standing there, but a voice interrupted my trance. ""Ma'am.. Ma'am, are you okay?"" I turned my head quickly and looked at the man before finally nearly shouting ""Yes! How can I help you?"" The man turned to see what I had been so helplessly staring at, but it was as if he couldn't see her.. He didn't see her. ""Lance Trino's office please, I'm a new client. 8:00 AM sharp, and we're wasting time."" I grabbed the phone and dialed for Trino and sent the man on his way. She was leaning against the wall across from my desk, smiling and twisting a curl continuously around her finger. 

She didn't move all day. She was taunting me. Showing me that I was entrapped, and I was. Her eyes were so breathtakingly blue, I caught myself gazing into them for minutes at a time. It was hell and I thought it would never end. As soon as my shift was over I hurried out to my car. She didn't follow me, and I felt a little too weightless not feeling her presence, until I hopped into my car with utter confidence. ""Shit!"" It slipped right between my pursed lips. Almost simultaneously I brought my hands to my mouth at an abrupt pace. In my rearview mirror, her ghostly glowing skin caught my attention immediately. She was humming that song again.. Our eyes met, and I still don't remember how I got home last night.. 

Today is the third day, Saturday. I woke up in my bed. It felt like I had been sleeping for hours, my entire body was stiff. I crawled out of bed almost forgetting about the mysterious woman until her white cotton dress moved with the wind of a nearby open window. I stood up straight, but this time I did not look her in the eye. I examined her thoroughly, however, and noted that she didn't seem to be harmed anywhere. I assume this was from her invisible force field, or whatever the hell she has going on with her. I spent the next few hours pacing my bedroom trying to figure out what this could all mean. 

After four hours of pacing the bedroom and listening to her melodious hum of The Black Swan, I finally figured it out. It could be the only answer. I had missed it all along. I stopped dead in my tracks and walked directly in front of her. 

I looked into her eyes as bravely as I could and managed to mutter one single word, ""Abey?"" 

""I've been waiting for you to say that.."" Her words sunk into me like the long healthy roots in deep dark soil, and the words wrapped around my every thought. It was her.

During my senior year in highschool I shadowed a senior software engineer at blank company. While I was shadowing him I felt like I gave a good first impression and he even gave me his contact information incase I want to talk to him again. Fast foward three months; I just finished taking summer college classes and I decided to hit him up and he decided to have lunch with me and some of his colleagues. He even played my tab even though I insisted I should pay. At the lunch I asked a lot of questions about being a software engineer, what to expect, and how they got into computer science. After that I connected with them on linkedin and started my fall semester of college. Then after 5 weeks or so I decided to contact the person I shadowed and ask him when does your company open internship applications. He then replied that I should just send him my resume and he'll give it to the advisor in charge of interns. Now in all honesty I feel like I'm not as good as other candidates that apply as intern to this company. The people that usually apply are sophomores and juniors that go to the elite tech/cs school 10 miles down the road (think GT,UMich,UIUC, etc.). Even my resume I feel isn't up to par. I only know java, and c# and I only was a secretary in two clubs in highschool. 

TL DR: Will the connections I made help me get my foot in the door for the company I'm applying even though I'm a freshmen and dont go to an elite cs school?"

I work by myself and answer directly to the CTO of the company.

I am not sure if I am alone on this, but it seems most of the jobs out there require a lot of experience (2 to 5 years). As many, I worked during the day and went to school at night in order for me to finish my bachelor's. I am currently working in a grocery store (11 years), and they helped me with my tuition costs. During the time in school, I wanted to get a internship in the field. However, I decided to let that opportunity go since I had to work as full time in order for me to provide for my family (some of the internships were only part-time).
I am happy that I just finished with my bachelor's, and now I am hunting for jobs. From what my professors told me, HelpDesk Jobs are the best way to start since they provide a wide glance of how a company works in the IT field, and they also said ""...it would give you the best experience"". Currently, I am trying to talk with the IT recruiter of my company since I want to stay with them (benefits, seniority, etc). Sadly, I feel under-qualified for all the job openings and it seems that in order for me to get a job inside the company, I need ""to know"" someone inside. 
I know finding a job it's not a fast process and requires times and patience, yet it would be nice to hear some experience from people who have been in the same situation, and all your suggestions are always welcome. Thanks

4zmhkg,4,2016-08-25,Am I [22 M] right in thinking that my relationship with my SO [22 F] has been one sided?,settledforornot99,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zmhkg/am_i_22_m_right_in_thinking_that_my_relationship/,"Warning: It's going to be a long one. Thank you for your time:)

So as of lately I've been feeling very down regarding my relationship. The main problem I've had is a dead bedroom, but after having dinner with my girlfriend I think I have come to the realization that this is a deeper issue. I'm starting to think this relationship might have been very one sided.
My SO and I met 4 years ago during a college party. We clicked pretty well and I immediately felt something I'd never felt before. Because we met towards the end of the year, we only got got as far as dancing and kissing during parties a couple of times, but we did talk a lot throughout the summer. And I mean a lot, day and night we would talk to each other, to the point where I would help her fall asleep by telling her stories or academic stuff. 

Anyways, after we moved back into college things became more physical and we spent a lot of time together. During this time her attitude towards us changed drastically and she went from being a super sweet and affectionate girl who wanted a relationship to a reserved and somewhat distant person who wanted to be just friends with benefits. This change took me by surprise, as at this point we had been talking romantically for months, and to be quite honest this really put me in a dark place. The remainder of that year was a roller coaster of emotions, but I stayed fwb's with her because I wanted to win her heart, spend as much time as I could with her, and goddamn is she a fine lady. Well, after having this arrangement for over a year and a half I finally did it, and she told me she was ready for a relationship. I was the happiest person on this earth and the next year was pure bliss.  
Well, fast forward to now: I feel depressed. I feel useless. I feel so conflicted about my emotions and find my mood to be extremely volatile. What happened?
I feel like I have always valued the relationship more than she has. Don't get me wrong, I know that she loves me, but maybe not that way. I feel that I tried too hard to get her to fall for me and in the end manipulated her into doing something she didn't even want in the first place. What makes me feel shittier though is that I think she is drawn to me because I am guaranteed security, and my qualities as a person come second. She has become very codependent and her lifestyle has changed a lot by being with me: We can afford to live in a nice place. We can afford to go out every day of the weekend in a nice car and even have spontaneous fancy dinners during the week. We can afford expensive organic and local food instead of doing regular groceries. We can afford luxury items and treat ourselves with superficial things like purses, glasses, video games or whenever. We basically lead a very comfortable life. All of the money for this comes from me, and I am not even out of college yet, but I do have a prestigious high paying internship and very promising job opportunities in international banking for when I graduate. She has a low paying job and barely manages to maintain her savings account after rent and car payments. Last time we had dinner, she told me how she has multiple ideal scenarios for her life: one of them is marrying a smart and nice guy and living a comfortable life, another is ""marrying a hot but poor mechanic whom she is madly in love with and live a life of passion"". This hit me hard. Obviously the honey moon phase has been long over, and the excitement of discovering the person is gone, but I am still madly in love with her. I see myself being with her rich or poor, and I feel myself attracted to every aspect of her, from her flaws to her talents.  I feel a very personal and powerful form of passion for her, which I can't quite put into words, but suffice to say that the corny phrase ""she is like my better half"" resonates with me. And I don't think she feels the same way about me. As a matter of fact, it's almost obvious that she is settling for me. Every day I hear about every screw up that I make, from putting dishes too close to each other in the dishwasher to having the speakers too loud when I set up a movie for us to watch. She has told me before how she knows she is doing it and wants to change, but nothing ever happens. We are intimate with each other (cuddle, kisses) but never do anything sexual and  a large portion of our time is spent with her being extremely sad over something (for example, work, student loans, family). She firmly believes that I am immature and is constantly reminding me of it and getting upset over it. while I admit that I do silly stuff sometimes (like use a guitar themed pillowcase my mom bought for me before going to college or keeping a sperm cell plushy taped to a solar powered trolley in my book cabinet) I am mature where it counts: drive, ambition, etc. But yeah, it's like my SO doesn't really like me (romantically at least) as a person. Am I right to be thinking like this? How do you break up with someone who is so codependent on you and is likely to fall into heavy financial distress AND is prone to depression? Is it normal to feel like you want to marry the person one moment but hours later feel empty and that you just want to end it? Is it normal to feel so absolutely torn about making this big decision? I feel as if I am in a lose/lose scenario. I care for her. I love her and feel like she is my soulmate, but unfortunately it's not a mutual feeling and I can't spend the rest of my life being settled for. I feel like I deserve the chance to find someone that makes me feel good about myself and she deserves to find someone that makes her feel what I feel for her and whom she can have a fulfilling relationship with. During dinner she said all she thinks about when she thinks of happiness is me and how I am the best person she will ever meet and her everything. Like I said, I know she **loves me** but I don't think she loves me **romantically**, I had to tell her not to say that and, just like the last year, it was really sad.


**TL;DR : She is just not that into me, but breaking up with her is hard**"

Freshman year was an absolute nightmare and I struggled through Sophomore year re-taking and dropping core classes.

Eventually I sacked up and I'm getting my things together. I grew to love coding now and I've been trying to create very mini - mini projects to try and make up for my early struggles.

The thing is I'm in my senior year and I haven't applied to any internships, I'm struggling to push myself out there AND I need two more semesters to graduate (after completing these 2 semesters).

Will this have a major impact on getting internships and jobs?

Any advice would be helpful.

My class load is fairly light this year (except for AP Calculus &gt;.&lt;) so I've got a fair bit of free time. I took AP Computer Science last year, and prior to that I had a bunch of informal experience in Javascript and Python, including a Python summer camp thing. 

The extent of my programming knowledge in all three languages is about the same. I know how to create objects and variables, how to handle scope, some basic File IO, the general loops/arrays/boolean logic knowledge and all that for all of them. I'd like to know more, though, but I don't know where to start. I made a little bit of a candy-box-esque idler, but it's come to the point that adding more is more about just writing new content with the skills I already have instead of learning new ones. 

Does anyone know the sort of slump I'm talking about? I've read that I should try to make something useful to myself, but I really can't think of any programs that I'd need (at least ones that I could viably create). I'm planning on going into Computer Science in college, but I still want to get more experience so I'll be better prepared and also possibly an internship or something.

Anyway, I'd be very grateful for any advice on what I should do to keep learning programming. "
4zmt08,2,2016-08-26,I [21M] have feelings for my best friend [22F] of two years.,guitarfrk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zmt08/i_21m_have_feelings_for_my_best_friend_22f_of_two/,"I don't know how to start so I'm just going to jump right in. It's keeping me from sleeping and  even if I don't get any responses I think typing it out will help me with it.

About 2 years ago I met my best friend in class. At the time she was dating a guy for a while and they had some bad history. I didn't find out about it untill I knew her for 3 months however because for one reason or another she never mentioned him. I only met him when I was walking with her back from class and we ran into him. So from the beginning I had an interest in her, but as soon as I realized that she wasn't single, I didn't try to pursue it. I still wanted to be friends with her so I kept hanging out with her and getting to know her. After while it was clear her boyfriend wasnt the best guy and they eventually broke up. That was about a year ago. Since then me and her have become even more close, and I started spending large amounts of time with her.

At first it was normal as a friendship can be between a guy and a girl but somewhere along the way we started saying I love you to each other and making plans outside of our friends. We started to text each alot and Everytime I would leave her place I would miss her alot. We kinda got into the habit of right after we would split, text each other I love you or miss you already. To me it kinda seemed like it was going towards the direction of a relationship and I liked the idea of it.

We would take about relationships in general and it was clear that her relationship from before had left her with scars and she wasn't ready for something with anybody. So I figured that I cant wait for someone to heal. She also encouraged me to talk to other women and to get out more. At this point we were even closer because we could talk about anything with each other.

When I would come up during the weekends we started to go get dinner and see a movie. We would come into situations with waitresses  where they would assume that we were a couple and we would have to correct them. After a while however we stopped correcting them and just ignored it. It seemed to me that everyone around us thought we were a couple. I even asked her roommate one day if she had thought me and my friend were dating and she replied with ""you're not?"". At this point I really started to think about the possibility of what it would be like to be in a relationship with her and honestly I couldn't think of anything better. My best friend as my girlfriend would be a dream come true. 

So now I'm laying in bed waiting because tommorow I'm going up to see her at school, after an amazing weekend last weekend at an amuzment park where she is a intern animal trainer ( which was awesome, she rigged it so I would get picked as the volunteer), thinking about what to do. I know I have feelings for her and I want more out of this then friendship. I asked a co-worker who i trust about what to do and he says I should go for it. 

I don't really know how to bring it up and I'm scared of what it might mean but I can't help but think if I don't do something, she might find someone else and I know I would feel so incredibly jealous if she started to see someone. And I know from trying to date other girls while we are friends that it causes issues. I was talking to a girl for a bit over the summer and when she asked about my friend, I had to explain that even though we go out to dinner and movies and spend lots of time together that it's plutonic. She didn't go for it and we stopped talking. But I know that I would rather spend time with my friend then a girl I was talking to.

So I guess what I am asking is how do I bring it up? Is it worth the risk? Am I just crazy?

TLDR: I got the feels for my best friend; our friendship makes dating hard; How do I bring it up?"

I had just found out about this subreddit. For any girl who is interested in programming and has a free summer, why not spend your summer learning how to code for free:

1. [Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program](https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/): 7 week intensive summer program that also offers transportation stipends (if needed). Applications begin usually around spring for girls who are upcoming juniors/seniors in high school. I personally participated in this program and loved it! If anyone has any questions, please message me. Program also opens opportunities for future internships in programming.
2. [Kode With Klossy Summer Program](http://kodewithklossy.com/youth-scholarship): again, this is a summer program that is for girls 13-18 started by Karlie Kloss. It lasts two weeks. Unfortunately, this program has less locations than Girls Who Code, being that it is relatively new. It has partnered up with the Flatiron School. If you can't commute, there's also a [free full year course](http://kodewithklossy.com/career-scholarship) the program offers that you can take online for women of all ages. Application simply requires a video explaining why you want to do it, and they review applications each month.

*The two programs mentioned provide lunch and let you visit company headquarters such as Facebook, Google, Goldman Sachs, etc. The main issue is that the programs are only offered in specific locations, which may mean an extended commute. However, it is totally worth it just to surround yourself in a community of girls who are just as passionate about coding as you are. Bonus: gifts such as laptops, Swarovski jewelry, etc.

I was happy in the first year as i had made a lot of friends and a gf but the gf ultimately cheated on me as well and went back to her ex over the summer. I feel sick to the brim when i think about this. 

Let me cut to the chase, i had done an internship in bangkok this summer at my uncles firm. I have never been happier anywhere in my life. i just loved it a lot and i felt like i was ""cured"" of depression without taking any medicines. I hate my current environment so much that i find it difficult to even jump out of my bed. During my internship, i was without friends but was leading a disciplined life. The city gave me so much of positivity and passion and filled me with so much hope that when i came back, i am again my depressed self. I feel so low and so anxious at all the times that even prozac doesnt help. I am at my wits end and dont know what to do."

4znfkk,1,2016-08-26,Am I [22M] hurting my potentially suicidal girlfriend [19F]? How can I help her?,teasippingthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4znfkk/am_i_22m_hurting_my_potentially_suicidal/,"I am worried that my girlfriend has depression, and that I am making things worse for her. She has been very upset, and gets upset at me more and more lately for the smallest reasons. I seem unable to do anything right when this happens, and each upset seems to be worse than the last. 

Some background - I met my girlfriend at (UK) university, where we went to the same society. We have been dating since early October, so its been around 11 months. She has had a few issues with depression through that time, including attempting self harm in April, around the time of my birthday. I believe she has tried it in the past, though I am unsure. She is an (Chinese) international student from Singapore, whilst I’m a white Englishman. She has just started an internship for a year in London, whilst I have just graduated and am living at home (A rural town a few hours train journey out of London) whilst I find work. 

She has been struggling with the change. She never had a great many friends in the UK, and she struggles to make new ones. She doesn't seem that interested in most people here, and often doesn't want to get involved in things. This is made worse  now she is working full time on a meagre interns pay – she can’t afford to do most London things even if she had time to (works 9-17:30 with a 45min commute either side). By the time she gets back from work she is usually drop dead tired, and weekends she spends moping around her room complaining about being bored or lonely. 

Pretty much every night for the past three weeks since she started she has gotten upset over something. Sometimes it was something I did, sometimes it was something someone at work did, sometimes something her parents (fairly strict Asian parents) said to her, sometimes she just gets upset because of the thoughts in my head.
I’ve tried a number of things when this happens. At first I tried advice. I suggested she do things that might make her feel better. I suggested exercise, social groups, sports clubs, etc. This just upset her more, as it “made her feel lazy”. 

I had already started to suspect she had depression, so at this point I went online and looked for resources on how friends and family can help. The result tended towards “Be understanding, be comforting and make sure they know you are there for them”. When the next upsets came, I attempted this, but to no avail. She threw my words back at me, told me I didn’t care about her, didn’t love her, etc. I tried to comfort her, but eventually she would draw away. It was on one of these nights that she first began to show definite signs of depression – including suicidal thoughts. She asked me at one point if I would be upset if she hurt herself (something she has done in the past), and often when crying (especially after drinking) would proclaim that she wanted to kill herself). 
Sometimes she has calmed down, but only by distracting her onto other topics, which isn’t always possible. She tends to be unresponsive to other topics, giving one sentence answers and them complaining that it doesn’t seem like I want to talk and that if I don’t want to talk then I should just leave her alone.
 
The hardest parts however are when the upsets appear to be caused by me. The slightest word or phrasing can be enough to set her off, or things left unsaid. One of the most common issues has been that I don’t tell her she is beautiful or that I love her enough. (I have said these things pretty regularly, multiple times a day throughout our relationship, and still do. I mean them each time, and I will continue to mean them). When she said this today, I made the definite mistake of telling her this – that I do say it constantly, and she decided that it was because I probably didn’t mean it. The only times she remembers me saying it are while we are having sex, and this upsets her because she doesn’t want me to only use her for sex (I don’t).  

The worse part of these however, is that she won’t tell me if it is something I did. She will dance around the subject (she believes she is hinting, but she is not – it usually consists of “It doesn’t matter, its okay, its nothing” on repeat as I try to comfort her, but it will take multiple hours of me torturously trying to comfort her before she even gives any definite idea of what is wrong. And then when she tells me, it will be unfixable. She will complain that I don’t understand her hints, and that I should pick up on them, but I simply can’t pick up on them if they aren’t there. 

Previously she was upset because I didn’t want to talk about my previous ex, whom she knew I had a very messy breakup with. After finally revealing that this was why she was upset, I offered to tell her if it meant that much, but she decided that now it would mean nothing and refused to listen.

This time, the time that prompted me to write this post, she decided that it was the above problem of not loving her enough. When she told me this, she then decided that she should only hear it while she was having sex because that was clearly all she was good for.

I don’t know how to continue things. A part of me worries that my presence is hurting her, and if it would be best if I leave - I am loathe to do this however, not only because I love her but because she has nobody else here. No friends in London, only a few left in our university town, and only a few left in her home country. If my presence isn’t hurting her, I don’t know how best to help her. I am trying to be patient, and I am trying to understand and to care for her. But I’m getting tired. I’m tired of hurting her, tired of being the only one she turns to, and tired of doing the same thing day after day with no change. I’m trying to look for a job, which is emotionally deadening enough without having to deal with someones depression.

What should I do? I understand that there is no magic bullet for depression. There is no magic sequence of words and actions that will suddenly fix it, but I want to understand what I can do to minimise the damage I am causing, and to maximise the help that I can give to her – because it’s the only help she’s getting, as far as I can tell. 
Please understand – I am not blaming her (at least not deliberately). I was told once that a good way to approach a relationship problem is not from an argumentative standpoint, but as two people trying to fix a problem. This is what I am trying to do, and its why I’m not mad at her or upset or trying to blame her. I want to help her. 

That’s my story. Your advice would mean a lot to me, and hopefully to her. If there are things you need clarifying or elaborating on, please ask. I appreciate that I have probably left out things that I actually have done wrong, not out of desire to appear perfect but because I'm pretty clueless and I don't know what I've done wrong for the most part.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend is depressed, slightly suicidal, far from home, a long way away, and I don't know how to help her.

4znwiz,5,2016-08-26,Chakrabarti report refutes claims of rampant anti-Semitism in British Labour Party,ShaunaDorothy,UK_Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/UK_Politics/comments/4znwiz/chakrabarti_report_refutes_claims_of_rampant/," By Jean Shaoul
26 August 2016

A recent report on anti-Semitism and racism in the Labour Party, commissioned by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, concluded that the party “is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism.”

It placed anti-Semitism in the wider context of racism not anti-Zionism, thereby refusing to equate criticism of the Israeli state with anti-Semitism.

It stated that there is, however, “too much clear evidence (going back some years) of minority hateful or ignorant attitudes” and an “occasionally toxic atmosphere” that “is in danger of shutting down free speech within the Party rather than facilitating it.”

The report was published by Shami Chakrabarti, a human rights lawyer and former director of human rights organisation, Liberty. It made a number of recommendations for tackling allegations of racism, including procedures for investigating such claims in accordance with principles of natural justice and proportionality, instead of summary suspension based on accusations, a moratorium on new disciplinary cases, and a statute of limitation on old claims.

In so doing, she implicitly rejected the media-led hysteria based on anonymous claims and without evidence, as well as the trawling of old social media postings by low-ranking members, that the Labour Party is a hotbed of anti-Semitism.

This charge has played a key role in the right-wing putsch attempt by Labour MPs, working in cahoots with the Conservative Party, the pro-Conservative media, the military-intelligence apparatus in Britain and the United States, and pro-Israel groups, to remove Corbyn as party leader.

It is part of a broader attempt on the part of the financial elite to overturn June’s referendum result to leave the European Union. The re-fashioning of the Labour Party is their preferred means to achieve this, with the aim of shifting politics sharply to the right. These forces are vehemently opposed to the anti-austerity and anti-war sentiments of those who voted for Corbyn, against his right-wing opponents, as Labour leader last September.

According to numerous Labour MP’s—all hostile to Corbyn—and media reports, especially in the Guardian—anti-Semitism had only become a problem since his election as leader last September. The charge was made that all criticism of the Israeli state and its suppression of the Palestinians are a form of anti-Semitism.

For example, last February, a Daily Telegraph article headlined “Is the Labour Party's problem with racism beyond repair?” stated that the reports of anti-Semitism “are reflective of a perpetuation – and tolerance of – anti-Semitism that starts at the top of the Labour Party, then steadily works its way down. And are they no longer anathema to Labour or its heritage. Far from it. Anti-Semitism is now firmly embedded in the Labour party’s DNA.”

Similarly, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian, which has been at the forefront of the campaign to oust Corbyn, “Thanks to Corbyn, the Labour party is expanding, attracting many leftists who would previously have rejected it or been rejected by it. Among those are people with hostile views of Jews.”

Alex Chalmers, who had been an intern in the Israel advocacy and lobby group BICOM, resigned from the chair of the Oxford University Labour Club (OULC) alleging anti-Semitism. His resignation generated a media storm about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and OULC.

Yet in his resignation statement, Chalmers made it clear that his resignation had nothing to do with anti-Semitism but was because of the OULC’s decision “to endorse Israel Apartheid Week.”

Last May, Corbyn agreed to the suspension of his long-time ally, former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, from the party. This was in response to Livingstone speaking out against the suspension, the previous day, of Naz Shah, Labour MP for Bradford West, after she was accused of anti-Semitism in social media posts.

Livingstone’s remarks on BBC radio particularly incensed the Blairite coup organisers. He had stated, somewhat carelessly, “Let’s remember, when Hitler won his election in 1932 [sic] his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism. [He then] went mad and ending up killing 6 million Jews.”

It is however, a matter of historical record that after Hitler came to power, significant sections of the Zionist movement in Germany sought an accommodation with the Nazi regime, which did agree to the transfer of some Jews to Palestine.

Instead of opposing and exposing the undemocratic methods of the right-wing plotters who are seeking to remove him and their broader political agenda, once again Corbyn capitulated. He agreed immediately to the suspension of Shah, Livingstone and numerous others, and set up an inquiry into racism in the Labour Party to be headed by Chakrabarti.

Significantly, the report found that many of the accusations of anti- Semitism relate to statements made before Corbyn became leader. It should be pointed out that the Labour Party’s 2010 leadership contest was between two people of Jewish origin, while the polls show that the percentage of people in the UK that hold anti-Semitic views is small and has remained constant at around 7 percent.

Corbyn welcomed the report’s findings and pledged to implement its recommendations.

Far from calming tensions, the findings have added to the already “toxic atmosphere.” It has met with a vitriolic response from some Jewish community leaders and the pro-Israel lobby, who called it a “whitewash.” They are incensed because it did not confirm their accusations of rampant anti-Semitism.

Chakrabarti was accused of bias, after announcing on the day she was asked to lead the inquiry, that she had joined the Labour Party to gain members’ “trust and confidence.” Ephraim Mirvis, the Chief Rabbi said the “credibility of her report lies in tatters” after the announcement that she was the only person on the Labour Honours list recommended for a peerage.

The Chakrabarti report in effect confirmed the inquiry into anti-Semitism at OULC, led by her deputy Lady Royall.

Royall wrote on the website of the Jewish Labour Movement (the British wing of the Israeli Labour Party and an affiliate of the World Zionist Organisation), “I know that you will share my disappointment and frustration that the main headline coming out of my inquiry is that there is no institutional anti-Semitism in Oxford University Labour Club” [emphasis added].

In acknowledging this, Royall inadvertently revealed that the real issue was not anti-Semitism but opposition of many, including Labour members, to Israel’s oppression of the Palestinians.

Dave Rich, Deputy Director of Communications for the Community Security Trust, a charity for the defence of the Jewish community in Britain, which has a pro-Israel agenda focusing on combating the Boycott, Divest, Sanction (BDS) movement, likewise acknowledged this in a letter to the Israeli daily Ha’aretz.

He wrote, “Neither report [Chakrabarti and Royall] truly tackled the underlying question of whether the anti-Semitism in the party is a product of the obsessive mania over Israel that has gripped Corbyn’s part of the left for years.”

His remarks confirm that the witch-hunt over anti-Semitism is part of a broader campaign to override the widespread hostility to Israel’s policy towards the Palestinians, and its role as policeman for US and British imperialism’s interests in the Middle East.

I am a good student but health issues caused my GPA to drop rapidly and I hardly increased it from 1.0 to 1.6, completed 52 of 86 credits.

Now my health issues are over and I am more hardworking, passed a class I failed with F with 100/100 test scores etc.

My major is Applied Mathematics, my current plan is:

1) Increase my GPA to 3.0-4.0

2) There is this distant education system that allows you to apply for a second degree during your first, I plan to apply for Sociology.

3) Find a part time job/internship related to my major (and fill up my mandatory internship quota of 40 days) to be free during summer to take extra classes in summer school.

4) Be nice to teachers, which I am already doing, one of them even motivated me back to aim for programming.

5) Improve my programming skills.

6) Learn a third language (already know English and my native language), which is German, and maybe a fourth one as French or Spanish (I already know German as a beginner)

7) Join a club and become a high ranking member.

This is my current plan for the next 3 years, is this enough to make up for repeating 2 years and graduate as a good student?"

First and foremost, I'm posting this because I feel like I have no one to go to for advice. No one I can trust without being judged.

I graduated high school back in 2008. I set my mind to go to community college and knockout all the basic prerequisites before deciding what I should study. Not knowing what my niche was/still is I couldn't decide where to go. I came across a Art Institute advertisement. It sold me. I was heavily into music and anything associated with sound and the recording arts. I was so stoked to go to Art school and learn about recordings. Once again, I was young and had no one to see counsel from. 

Started my first year at AI, and I guess my ambition drove me to go to class and get everything done. First year was done. I felt no challenge. I made no friends because I was busy working a retail part- time job. They recommended everybody to attend the networking events, but I'm such an introvert that I had no idea how to socialize with people. Still not well with socializing. It's my biggest setback. 

I started realizing how this career I envision was probably not for me. I still pushed forward. I did not want to quit something I started. 

Here comes my last year of school at AI, students who did not even try were getting passing grades. I felt like an over-achiever, yet I wasn't shining because I refuse to be the spotlight or the center of attention. I doubt my talents and capabilities and constantly out myself down. 

I finished school at AI with a BS in Audio Production. Not knowing where to go. No connections in the industry. Nothing. I had an internship that broke off because the company was shutting down. 

I find myself in huge debt. Settling for any job I can take. I come across this production rental house. Thinking to myself that this my be my foot in the industry. Wrong. Been there for about three years and I haven't don't anything remotely close to what I know or what I was taught. Even though I feel like my education was a big waste of time and regret dropping out of community college. 

Now I'm here, developing severe anxiety and depressed, a bit frustrated/ angry, and becoming irritable because of my past decision. My head keeps telling me that I'm better than this. That I'm capable of more. But how do I seek for more? This job sucks the life out of me and the pay is not even great. Hell, I'm just near the 15/HR range. 

I've been trying to do some soul searching lately. I realized that this dream I had has failed. That it wasn't meant for me. 

I picked up a book called, ""Three Feet From Gold"" which is inspiring as hell but I don't know what to do with this information. When I think about what I was into as a kid, I can't get any list. Again, my pessimistic mind kicking and shutting me down with negative thoughts. 

I'm trying to pick up anything. I love computers and I'm very tech savvy for the most part. The idea of programming is fascinating and I've tried doing some searching to teach myself to code (learn Java, C++, and whatever language I can) not knowing if I'm capable of doing this is my biggest dilemma. I bought a book on programming for beginners. Heck, I'm even on CodeAcademy doing the free courses. 

I wouldn't mind doing school again. My finances are a mess right now. My living condition is absurd. I can't afford to treat myself to anything and I'm living from paycheck to paycheck. I've tried budgeting but I don't have the will to stick to it. I keep failing. I'm getting pretty desperate and I keep overwhelming myself with the thought that I am a failure. 

I want to master the art of programming and maybe one day end up in cyber security. For some reason, when I think about everything and what I'm good at. It comes back to computers.

What can I do to achieve this career change when I have so many limitations (no money, no time, and don't know where the hell to start)? How can I keep myself motivated and not bummed at work? 

tl;dr: 26, made the mistake of going to a shitty art school. Still got my ""degree"". Now working a low paying job when I know I'm capable of more. Really bad at networking and socializing.I have interest in computer programming/cyber security but don't have the help from anyone or idea on how to come about. My job and finances are creating severe anxiety and depression. Feel down and stuck. "

Not only am I unenthusiastic about it, I'm nowhere near as productive as the other interns. I loathe the thought of working at my desk all day and find it impossible to be enthusiastic about fixing rage-inducing bugs, while I thrive in and enjoy any situation that involves dealing with people.

My boss said he agrees, and told me when it came to communicating between business and the developers and presenting in public, I was by far the best intern. I figure I should progress my career in a direction that would take advantage of that.

So...what kind of jobs in tech would suit me that would take advantage of my experience? I'd appreciate anything you have to say.

Not a perfect World, but butter ;)",CRNA200k,churning,https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/4zouvf/grab_the_popcorn_points_save_the_day_not_a/,"Before getting started in my first experience traveling using points and miles I'd like to share this isn't the most aspirational trip report where I stay at the Hyatt Maldives or St. Regis New York. This is a trip report to Nashville, TN, USA and the **reality of traveling with points and miles** which might not be a popular opinion here, but oh well hopefully it will help someone. At the very least you find it intriguing to some degree.  I am breaking up this post with in a couple main parts: **Travel, Hotel, Story, Nashville activities, and redemptions** Here I go... TL;DR at the end

It was May and my girlfriend of 4 years and I wanted to plan a trip during our summer vacation from College. We had internships so we didn't want to miss too much of work so the days we were planning to travel on were weekends. Since we are based out of Chicago we have a plethora of options for traveling (ORD/MDW, Amtrak, Megabus, etc).

**Travel------------------------------------**

I was looking for cheap flights on long weeks throughout the summer. Eventually I found a cheap return flight on Sunday out of Nashville back to ORD, Great! The only problem was that the tickets for Thursday Night/Friday departures were out of my comfort zone to pay or use miles with. I eventually found a 11:59pm Megabus departure on a Thursday for a 10:10am arrival Friday morning. Tickets were $10ea, including all the fees it was $25 total to 2 seats. I bought them thinking this is great, we get there early enough to have the whole day to explore, and I can just sleep on the bus. We got tickets to and back from Nashville, but I now have the knowledge to never ride megabus again and just pay the airfare ;) 

**Hotel-------------------------------------**

I didn't have any sort of status when I booked the travel, but I knew I could use Hyatt points at a couple of properties downtown or near Nashville. I didn't want to shell out the 12k/night (now 15k/night) for the Hyatt Place downtown Nashville even though it is a great location. I was planning on staying at the Hyatt place Opryland or Hyatt Place Nashville airport because it was less points + had cash/points availability and I can park there if I get a rental car. Through more... *unorthodox* ways I became a Hilton Diamond since then. I decided to book my stay at the Home2 Suites Nashville Airport by Hilton. About a week before my trip I checked my amex offers after signing up for the 100k Hilton bonus and I saw an offer for  5k Hilton points after 2 stays by Halloween! So I changed 2 nights at Home2 Suites and  booked 1 night at the Hilton Suites Brentwood/Nashville to get an extra night.

**Story-------------------------------------**

So 2 weeks before my trip my girlfriend and I decided it was best to breakup. We ended on good terms and I urged her to still take the trip, but she declined. She felt bad and paid me her share of the trip expenses which is reasonable even though I did not ask her to. I asked an intern whom I worked with and met this summer to go with me, but she declined because she ended work 2 weeks earlier than me to go up to her lake house before school and would be there. Ok, great now what? All my friends already left for college (I'm on trimesters so I don't start until mid-september). I could take my little brother who is 16, but then that would mean I couldn't get into the Nashville Honkeytonk bars and experience the live music scene. I decided to take him anyway since it'll be a good trip for us and Nashville still has plenty of fun things to do while you're under 21 which I couldn't say the same if I were going to Vegas. 

Now that I knew I was taking my brother I just had to change the name on my ex's ticket to my brother. I decided to procrastinate and called in Thursday night while grilling dinner before we go downtown to take the megabus. This is where problems started. I didn't know that you can't do a 100% name change on a ticket even if I wanted to pay a fee (please don't comment, I already learned from my mistake. Please don't make the same mistake). Crap, what do I do? Tell my brother he can't go anymore after more than a week of anticipation? My specific flight is sold out and the other options that day were like $300-400 at a different time. I had the signup bonus from a Barclays Arrival+, but I didn't really want to use it plus my mom was not going to have that and said we have to be on the same flight no matter how that happens. Well I guess I rather spend more money than to hear my mom fuss about this any longer. (My brother and I were both fine with him traveling alone for the hour and half journey...but moms) 

Using google flights I saw that the day after our original departure was only $144/ticket. I decided to ditch both tickets on the Sunday flight (since they were so cheap it wouldn't be worth it to pay for AAs fee to get the credit) and book 2 tickets on the same flight monday evening. There was no seat selection available unless I wanted to pay $34 each to sit in the exit row (no thanks), but at least we were on the same flight! Eventually at check in we got 2 seats next to each other with no problem. If this was a normal traveler who is not in the points/miles game they would have had to pay for the extra hotel night, but I just used Cash+points for another cheap night. It is truly a game changer even when hotel nights are decently cheap. It was the difference of paying $500-600 or $150-180+points. 

After I was done grilling my Aunt came over to celebrate her birthday before we were off taking the Metra Train to downtown Chicago. Except ANOTHER mishap. My dumbass didn't look at the train schedule and we had 10 minutes before the next train left otherwise it be too late even though it was 3 hours before our bus left. Luckily I found another train station 10 minutes away on a different train line that still goes downtown at a much more practical time. My trip started pretty bad, but luckily it got much better. See Below for activities.

**Activities in Nashville----------------------------------**

**BONUS: What I learned**

* You can't do a 100% name change on a ticket
* Drive around Nashville to find cheapest parking spot
* I love hot chicken
* Nashville is an awesome place and so glad I went than just ditching the trip
* Even with points/miles it costs a pretty penny to travel when you factor in food, rental car, gas, souvenirs, entertainment, etc.  
* These trip reports take a MUCH longer to write than I thought
* The most important...points can save the day with flexibility and availability  

I hope people learn from my experience because I know I surely did. Points and miles are not perfect, but they definitely help (especially for college students, compared to the 30 somethings making $100k+/yr). My little brother and I had a great time and bonded even closer. I have a boatload of points left that I can't wait to use, but I just don't have the time to use them yet. I am going to the Philippines in December though! 

**TL;DR:** Bought tickets for GF and I to Nashville. GF and I broke up. Wanted to take little brother. Found out can't switch names on ticket. Used points to book last minute flight. Used points to stay extra night in hotel.

I just figured I'd share after reading this awesome thread: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4zj456/27_260k_nw_perspective_from_a_guy_who_didnt_major/

As another person who never received a CS degree (in fact I'm a high school dropout), I think it's good to highlight some other potential paths. Not that I look upon CS degrees negatively, I think it's an awesomely interesting field. I just ended up going a different path and am grateful to have achieved what I have now. 

So, I'm currently 33 and have a net worth of 155k. Relatively low for this sub maybe, but I'm proud to have achieved it and it's increasing quite rapidly. Growing up my parents never taught me about money. They simply didn't know about good financial habits. My mother was a waitress, and my father worked for the railroad. Dad had a bit of a gambling problem, which I look back on as funny since I turned out to be so different. I never lacked anything, though, financially or emotionally due to his gambling. 

My career path started out in manual labor. After dropping out of high school I didn't really have many options, so earning $8.50/hr at 18 seemed like a decent start. Unfortunately, manual labor is an area where I couldn't seem to earn much more than 14/hr at my peak, and you had to absolutely destroy yourself physically to achieve it. Not to mention the hours you put in (60-70+ at times) to get it. Dangerous working conditions, no benefits, no true OT (they might pay it off the books), no vacation/sick time and many other horrible conditions were the norm. Even back then, though, I was a natural saver. I budgeted and was always able to save a bit of cash. Nothing to retire on, but enough to always have a decent emergency fund. 

I didn't really see a way out of this lifestyle/career. Looking back, I was probably suffering from some sort of depression or other mental condition because eventually I became homeless. I just didn't know how to properly care about myself, and ended up not putting in any effort to try and find a job/place to live for a time. I lived in my car for maybe 8 months to a year, while occasionally crashing on friends/families couches. At some point during all this, I went to apply for a job working for a warehouse and somehow managed to impress the guy interviewing me enough to secure the warehouse manager position. I was making $650/week, which was the most I'd ever made up to then. They found out I was living in my car after catching me sleeping in the parking lot, and were kind enough to let me live in the basement of their offices. Things ended up not working out there, and after a bit of a conflict with my boss I was fired. Lost a home and a job simultaneously, and had pretty much hit bottom. I was about 25 when this happened. 

Not too long after that I had to move back in with my parents, which was humiliating. I sunk into quite a depressive state, gaining a lot of weight (around 320 lbs at 6' 3""). I don't think I left the apartment more than 10 times in a matter of almost two years. It was a one bedroom apartment where me, my dad, my mother and a nephew of mine lived. There were a lot of family issues going on at the time too, which only compounded the misery. 

Luckily, I tried to stay afloat mentally by exercising my mind. I just laid on the floor reading endlessly on the internet. Books, articles about all different kinds of subjects. I tried to make it like a mini-college experience. Eventually I started to enjoy reading about computer technology and started to wonder if I could ever make a career in that. At the same time, I started to try to get back in shape physically. My body was so atrophied from lack of movement that I had trouble walking around the block, but I did my pushups, situps, squats and lunges, started walking further and further each day getting myself down to about 250-260 after a number of months. 

While things were improving, I was still very depressed and had no job. The thought of going back to the shitty conditions of manual labor was stomach turning. So one day I ended up googling something along the lines of ""free computer technician training"" and came upon an organization that offered this very service if you were accepted into it. It did require that you had the free time to dedicate to it, and living at home facilitated this. I ended up making it in, and got some really good basic computer tech training over the course of 3 months. After you completed the course, they worked very hard to try and get you placed in a real job. After a short internship to get something technology related on my resume, I was offered a job at a law firm doing a mixture of remote access and mobile device support. $18/hour for a temp to perm contractor position. Wow. I was beyond happy. Plus, it was in a corporate environment and I didn't have to suffer from the conditions. After impressing some of my colleagues with my work ethic, they let me know that if I got hired I could get around 50k/year, plus bonuses, paid vacation/sick time, real OT, benefits, 401k etc. Now since I had worked in conditions that paled in comparison, I was a very hard worker. I was on time, reliable and a very quick learner since I wanted to pull my weight and was extremely grateful for the opportunity. The people I worked with had become a bit complacent in their positions over the years, so I was able to capitalize on that and not only get hired starting at 47.5k/year, but after 4 years of working here I am earning about 100k with overtime, bonuses and employer 401k contributions and have been promoted to head of my team. 

For the first few years I worked here, I didn't know anything about investing or 401ks/IRAs etc. I saved my money anyway, but once I learned about FIRE I accelerated things and am on pace to save about 60k/year. I don't have a degree, and work on a ""lower level"" part of the IT spectrum, but still carved out a niche for myself and was able to demand the kind of salary I'm currently at. 

That about sums it up, but feel free to ask any questions if you have them. The TLDR is something along the lines of: fuckboy struggles for a while, but doesn't give up. fuckboy then makes 100k and might have a cool million in about 9 years if things continue to go this way. 

Good luck to everyone else out there on this FIRE journey!"

I have a great girlfriend who I left behind in the US 10 weeks ago for an internship in Asia.  The first couple weeks were filled with wonder and excitement and fun and booze--nothing bad happened....but guess what came next.  I needed more.  I started thinking ""maybe I should've broken up with her before I left"" so I could really get nuts.  Our planned weekly video calls stopped.  Like she always does, she didn't push or bother me, just allowed me to go through it.  So on one of the weekend trips to the city I went out by myself and just started wandering and drinking and looking for more of everything.  Doesn't matter where it started but fast forward two weeks after that and I'd had serious blackouts waking up in strange places with girls I didn't know.  Twice that happened, twice sex was part of it.  At least with the first one I used protection...the second...only half of the time.  When I freaked out in the morning about that she showed me her recent clean blood test results, but I couldn't shake it.  Couldn't shake the guilt of what I'd done or the threat of losing the one I love or the fact that I had to do that messed up stuff to realize how MUCH I did love her.  

The next two weeks waiting for a blood and urine test were torture.  Without any symptoms any little thought or tingle sent me spinning out.  The results came back all negative and I thought that was great, let's drink the rest of that anxiety away about the fact it was pretty early for legit HIV results.  So I numbed it away...hard.  Didn't really bother me and when it came to mind in that state I was able to easily shove it aside, or so I thought.  

At the end of a three day bender, missing the last Monday of my internship it all came flooding back.  In ways I'd never imagined.  I started googling for every stat and information I could find.  10 in my favor were dwarfed by anything I could possibly read into as against.  The axiety started in my chest.  I started having to leave work to try to walk it off, bursting into tears in toilet stalls.  Combing over reddit and imgur for quotes on anxiety help and ""letting go""...any relief was seconds, the suffering was hours, and now days.  Talking to the last girl from 4 weeks ago and hearing that she is still healthy and happy and back out dating didn't help either.

I had my first panic attack during the lunch I skipped--haven't eaten hardly anything and only sleep when the soothing podcasts play until I'm exhausted.  The longest day of my life was today and I just got back from my second blood test.  In the hotel room now waiting until 2 am to call in and get my results.  The doctors level of calm and seeming lack of worry did nothing for mine.  

In the morning I wake up and fly to another country to meet up with her.  I did everything ""right"" since that night I could think of except call her and tell her--I knew tonight was my latest chance for a meaningful result and the thought of her on that long plane ride full of anger and anxiety broke my heart.  Again.  I hate myself.  Countless times my life I stood to have with her flashed before my eyes every day the past week and it's killing me.  

I don't want to drink.  I want a lightning bolt or a car crash or anything less painful than this.

I don't know why pain seems to keep me sober...its when things start going good that I really can't be trusted with.  And as of right now, tonight...they may never be good again.

Flag or whatever if this is inappropriate.  I've been keeping this all a secret for weeks and I just have to put it out to some....thing."

4zpoz3,6,2016-08-26,"Me [21 M] with my GF [21 F] of 10 months, broke up because I am an insecure idiot",Nagazaki,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zpoz3/me_21_m_with_my_gf_21_f_of_10_months_broke_up/,"Hey /r/relationships.

Two months ago my girlfriend of 10 months broke up with me. We are both second (to be third starting this Fall) year students in the same university in Europe. She is from Asia, I'm from Europe, and we are studying in a uni in my country. She is my first relationship and I'm her second.

These two things have been the biggest problems with our relationship: what to do after graduation, and her being afraid that I would cheat on her because I haven't been with another girl.

I have always reassured her that I would never cheat on her. During our relationship I have done my best to show her through my actions that I want to be with her etc. Things like cooking for her, going out with her, giving her massages, making sure she's enjoying sexy time, just making sure she feels loved and wanted. However, I am insecure due to some personal reasons which I'll get to in a bit.

She has brought up me being only with her only twice - first time I told her I wouldn't cheat on her, second time I told her the same but things happened differently.

This is what happened the second time. We had been apart for 2 months - she went to the USA to work for the summer (to pay her tuition), and I stayed and started an internship. She asked me if I would cheat if she would allow me. Now, I'm a believer in discussing things so I said, ""If we discussed it and you would be OK with it, then maybe... But I believe it would be more detrimental to our relationship because it would break our fidelity."" Now, her parents divorced when she was young, and it has left a lasting scar. She said she doesn't really believe in fidelity and that she doesn't expect it. We continued talking and basically this is what was said:

I told her that it felt infuriating thinking she had been with another person (insecurity 1), that I felt regret due to not being able to live my highschool years fully, the way she has, due to my health issues (insecurity 2) and I questioned her commitment to me (insecurity 3). She told me that I should focus on the mental, not the physical. Also throughout our conversation she was saying things like ""You are more special, I think we should spend more time together, I wish we were next to each other,"" but I kept on hammering her with my words. Now, mind you, we didn't insult each other or get aggressive with each other. 

In the end, I told her ""Should I settle? Should I be stuck in a relationship with you or try and find something happier?"" I honestly was not thinking of breaking up with her, I just wanted some response, but what more could I have wanted than what she previously had said? I think I wanted her to get aggressive and fight for me, to put me in my place and tell me to stop talking such BS. Instead, she told me to try and find happier. I told her I hate her attitude (because I really did not want to break up) and that if she really believes my time is better spent trying to find someone else then maybe there's no point in going on. She sent me ""Zzzz"" stickers indicating she was sleepy and at one point just disappeared from the chat, which made me really angry. I know she had work in the morning, but she could have said something, not send a sticker and disappear.

The next morning when I woke up, she had messaged me that she though it would be best to break up now rather than later. I begged her not to do it but she said she made up her mind. For the past 2 months we have been keeping in touch, mainly due to me messaging her periodically. Next month I am going to go pick her up from the bus station when she comes back for the semester. I told her that I still want to be with her and she asked me to please not make it difficult and in the end agreed with me to talk in person because she could see that she can't convince me. She also said that she's not ready for a relationship and that she needs time for herself. She is very ambitious Reddit, and feels a bit that she is wasting her time in Uni because it feels like she isn't really pursuing her goals. But at the same time she has shown that she has feelings for me, so it's all really confusing.

She is also extremely individualistic Reddit, and that's what got to me. Her attitude of ""I don't need you"" doesn't mean ""I don't want you"" but I confused that and that's why I was questioning her commitment. Not only that, she's really stubborn, and now that she has decided that she doesn't want to be with me because, as she said, she won't live anywhere but home and I won't live with her there, I don't know how to tell her that I""m sorry and that I want forgiveness.

What hurts the most was that I had started learning her language and wanted to surprise her when she came back. I know that going to her country would be a part of our relationship and I wanted to show her that. I suppose I should have told her that, but I wanted to surprise her and show her (actions speak louder than words, etc). Also, I had started exercising because I told myself enough is enough, I shouldn't feel sorry for myself but should start working on my health. She has been an amazing support and is one of the reasons why I started doing it. It also really hurts that she did not intend for us to break up when she asked me that question, and neither did I intend to break up when I started being an insecure idiot. We get along really well and our relationship has been through ups and downs but we have always been able to overcome our problems and get up stronger.

What do you think Reddit? Should I pursue her? Do you think I have better chances when we speak in person?

tl;dr: GF of 10 months broke up with me because I questioned our relationship due to my insecurities after she questioned our relationship due to her own concerns. She is coming back for university next month and I will go to pick her up. What should I do, how can I apologize to her?"

Skills include Excel, Python, C++. I've taken econometrics, differential equations and linear algebra classes so far. 


I could probably take the CFA level I if that would help.


Unfortunately all of my internships and research experience are chem focused. I had a one year internship in a lab since last summer, so I wasn't able to take any other internships my junior year. I don't have any real finance experience, but I know how to do trading comps and DCF analysis. I've been working on doing practice DCFs with random companies. Nothing I can stick on a resume though.


I could definitely use some advice on the best ways to make myself more attractive to firms. What's the best way to sell myself considering my lack of financial experience? 


I'm also planning on applying to the Fed (research assistant position). Would a data analyst position be useful in segueing to financial analysis or applying to an MBA program later?

4zpv2t,3,2016-08-26,Help! Drunk Dialed a Colleague from Work,zerty2,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4zpv2t/help_drunk_dialed_a_colleague_from_work/,"Hello AskGayBros!

I am in desperate need of your help since I screwed up last night.

A year ago I started as an intern and one of my first tasks was to organise an event for the company. I also had to be in the reception of the event and register the attendees and my boss paired me up with an intern from another department to hep me out. 
I remember my first impression of him was: he's cute but he smells cheap and his suit looks like it came from a thrift store. It was all baggy and didn't fit him. I really wasn't interested in that guy. 
But spending all that time with him and talking to him made me realise that he was actually super nice and we talked the entire event. He would put his hand on my shoulders and at one point he out his hand on my thigh and I thought he was coming onto me and I wasn't really comfortable. 
The event ended and we exchanged numbers. 

We texted for a bit that night and he asked if I wanted to grab a beer with him. I said sure and said I would organise a group of friends so he could meet some new people in town. (He had just moved to do his internship) 
He was pretty insistent on  being the two of us alone and I stopped talking to him because I didn't want to go on a date or anything and compromise myself. 

Fast forward to the Christmas Party (which I also organised) and he came up to me and asked us to sit together, he helped me with the activities I had planned and we had a lot of fun that night. At the end he grabbed my hand and wanted me to go with him to the terrace where nobody was. 
I thought it would be a great idea and was about to follow him but my chauffeur arrived in that second and I had to leave.  

The romance of the evening or whatever wore off and I didn't reply to him again. I also finished my internship and didn't get to see him again. 

Yesterday, I got wasted and was extremely horny and I decided to call him. He didn't answer and sent me a text saying if I was ok. 
After like 5 minutes he called me back and we talked and I asked him to come over. He was a bit confused and asked what I meant. I thought he was playing the innocent card and I said something like: I want you here, playing with me...I feel so lonely. 

And he said: I moved back to my hometown but even if I were there I don't think it'd be a good idea. I'm not gay. 
In that moment I died and said to him what went on every time he touched me or asked me out and he said he has heard that before but that he is 100% into girls and didn't mean to lead me on. 
I asked him if he was completely sure and that I wanted to skype with him and jack off and that he would love the experience. 
He said he wasn't into that and that he had to leave. 
Before that, I changed my voice tone and told him: I am xxx, I am friends with him and was just messing with you, please don't tell him or he's gonna kill me and he laughed and said it was ok. 
(I am dying of hungover and embarrassment as I type this) 

This morning I woke up still drunk as can be and texted him like: Hey, it's me... I saw a bunch of texts from you and a call and I was wondering who you talked to and what about? And he just said: it's chill man. And I insisted someone stole my phone and he didn't reply. 

Now, I have sobered up a little and I am so embarrassed and have no idea what to do!
My dad owns the company and is also very good friends with my ex boss there so it would be crushing if they found out, I couldn't live with that. 
Also, I feel bad for treating him that way and then lying to him on top of all that. 

So, what do I do now? Do I not text him back ever? Do you think he believed the whole ""my friend texted you"" situation? Just, how do I handle this? Also, What do you guys think of the whole situation before this? Do you think I read to much into it or was I right to assume he was interested in me that way? 

TL;DR: I drunk dialed a friend form work last night, asked him to come over, turns out he's straight. What do I do now?  

Thanks guys for your support! I appreciate it!

He's from South America, and, let me just say, he's absolutely brilliant. In September, he's starting law school at an Ivy League school. He's traveled the world. He speaks about 5 different languages. He's a socialite; whenever he posts something on Facebook or Instagram, it gets 50 likes almost instantly. He goes to nice bars and clubs all the time. He's just a really special person. He admittedly comes from a lot of money, but that's beside the point. He did all of this without his mother, who passed a few years ago.

I, on the other hand, don't go to an Ivy. I've been in NY my whole life; I've never been to another continent. I have about 2 close friends, and, while I love them dearly, I'd be lucky to get 10 likes on something I upload. I just finished an internship in finance, and was offered a full-time job with a $75k salary, but that's peanuts to what this guy will make.

So, now that you know about both of us, it's clear that I pale in comparison to this guy. There isn't a chance anything will become of this connection. Things he says will go over my head. Maybe he'll want to talk to his SO in Spanish or French. I can't do that. I can't entertain him, as I don't have any experiences worth his time. I also can't imagine what it's like to lose a parent; I certainly wouldn't have been able to do what he did.

At the same time, he's told me he admires me, he thinks I'm cute, etc. However, we haven't met in person, so it feels really disingenuous. I've been down this road with someone of his caliber before, and I was ultimately rejected b/c I was too stupid and too boring. Given that, his song and dance about how he doesn't think he's better than me is meaningless. He also does seem a little self-satisfied. He's told me that he considers himself cute and intelligent, and that he as an impressive list of accomplishments for someone his age. I thought that was a little arrogant, but maybe that's just me.

All that said, what do you make of my situation? Should I continue talking to this guy? He sent me a Facebook message last Thursday; I haven't responded. Am I justified in feeling inadequate?"

**Acquisition:** 

I needed a pair of work boots for the summer because I was starting an internship at the University of Michigan Botanical Gardens and Arboretum. (Shameless plug: If you’re ever in the Metro Detroit area in the summer this is a must see.) I wanted to get something stitched for relatively cheap that I could beat the living hell out of. In February and March I kept an eye out on Grailed and eBay for something slightly used/tried on/2nds and in early April I came across these 9012 Chestnut Featherstone Beckman's on eBay for $140 shipped. I really wasn't looking for something with a moc-toe, but it was a great price and the style grew on me after awhile. They had only been tried on so I bought them then and there. When I received them I was pretty sure they were 2nds and someone didn’t like the finishing on them so they decided to sell them. Whatever. They looked good enough for work boots to me.

**Fit/Break In:** 

These are a 12. I’m a solid 13 brannock, but with low volume, so I really had to tighten these up. I can't wait to wear these with some thick winter socks. I broke them in over the course of a month walking and hiking in them and it wasn’t as bad as I had heard about Red Wings. Definitely stiff at first, but once that leather sole breaks in and your ankle is used to the stiff leather they are great.

**Thoughts/Impressions:** 

I used these in just about every imaginable condition except for snow; it’s been rather hot here in the Mitten. In these I laid concrete and packed limestone driveways, weeded gardens, felled trees and groomed trails, lead prescribed burns, forded rivers, cut grass, built fences, hiked mountains, and some things I rather not mention online. I worked 5 days a week, 8am-5pm in these and I know that’s blasphemy here, but I found that if I took these off around 5 or 6 every night and kept them in front of my box fan with the tongue wide open they were dry as bone by 8am the next day. I brushed these every night after work. If I didn't there would be mud and debris everywhere in the house. In terms of scrubbing and condition, probably 2 times. Once in June and once just now.

These boots took a beating; I can’t imagine being much harder on a pair of boots than I was on these. That being said, they have held up pretty well. The upper is in great shape, the sole has moderate wear, the insole is in good condition, and even the waxed laces have proved to be pretty durable for me. The midsole has started to separate some. Whatever, that’s why they’re stitched and not glued, right? Hasn't affected the way I wear them. 

**Overall:**

For $140 shipped and as much as I have done in these, I would buy them again (not that I'll need to) and that’s what it comes down to for me.

Which sounds pretty good but I got the most average GPA possible (2.5) and wasn't able to get a single internship. Even though I applied for every single internship in my area that popped up from sophomore year to graduation.

**Current position:** Fast forward 4 months, I've had 5-10 interviews but I've never made it to a technical interview. I've applied for ~50 positions at various companies. Which is probably nothing compared to some people on this subreddit but I have very low confidence.

Anyways, I'm already getting burnt out and I haven't even started working yet. I've read posts where people did 300 interviews in a couple months and just doing 1 interview drains me for at least a few days. I'm introverted so it's physically draining for me to talk to a complete stranger for 30 minutes while under high pressure. I need multiple cups of coffee a day to get by and I hardly do anything except sit in my dad's house applying for jobs and working on side projects.

Speaking of side projects, the only ones I enjoy doing are where I use my coding skills to make games. And I'm sure not a single company gives a shit about the crappy games I've made so I don't even bother putting them on my resume. I made an app to show off on my resume but building that app wasn't as enjoyable as when I make games.

The other thing with side projects is that I know work projects are an entirely different beast compared to them. I'm not going to get the same enjoyment as I do out of my personal projects.

Back to interviews though, I can't do them. I feel like I have to lie to make myself look good and it's blatantly obvious when I lie. I always hear how it's important to smile and be pleasing but I just can't do it. I can't put that mask on. Every interview I've had the people I'm interviewing with or other people I happen to talk to in the office just seem so depressingly fake. I don't feel right in environments like that and it makes me feel sick to be honest.

**Looking to the future:** It looks awful. I've read posts about how people say they're wasting their life away working and the only responses are ""That's the real world"". I'm draining my energy trying to get something that's just going to take everything away for me in exchange for money so that I don't end up homeless. That's not a future I want.

There was a comment on another post on this subreddit regarding someone who was unhappy with their job. The comment had 50+ upvotes and said:

&gt; That's life. It sucks.

Why would I want that for my future? That doesn't encourage me to keep applying and keep working my ass off for a job that's just going to make me hate my life more.

Is there some kind of middle path that I'm just not seeing? I just keep hoping that one of my personal projects is going to end up sustaining me. I'm not looking to get rich or anything, all I want is to not be homeless. Not looking for highly competitive ""every man and woman for themselves"" environment. I just want to earn enough to afford a comfortable one bed apartment, groceries every week, and light entertainment. I'm not planning on having kids or getting married even though I have a wonderful girlfriend but she's not interested in either of those things too.

4zqq8s,379,2016-08-26,Mourning Wood,decomprosed,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4zqq8s/mourning_wood/,"My sexual awakening came in the form of the Ents from the Lord of the Rings series. 

I was thirteen; a fat, awkward, late bloomer. Sitting with my cousin in his basement, a stuffy teenage paradise piled high with video games and beanbag chairs, we’d finished an original-trilogy Star Wars marathon and had moved onto the other big name in Nerddom. Shoveling handfuls of popcorn and oreos into our piggish mouths, we reveled in the gluttonous glory of youth. 

Then, they came lumbering through across the screen.

Towering, magnificent beings with so much bark and so much bite. After so much confused fumbling, something just clicked. My sexuality was personified and laid bare right before my very eyes. Seeing those titans traipse across the screen, hearing the gravelly anciency in their guttural voices, I found myself unable to breathe. 

The pinnacle scene of the last march of the Ents is what really sealed the deal for me. Up until that point, I’d barely been able to contain myself, squirming uncomfortably in my seat and trying to ignore the raging forest fire in my pants. When they came upon the horde of orcs and used their pure brute force to demolish their ranks, I lost it. 

“Be right back,” I said, slightly panting. 

“Hurry up, fag. I hate pausing shit.” My cousin Perce was such a charmer. 

“Don’t have to pause anything, asshole.”

He threw an empty soda can at me. It missed. “Bring more chips.”

I scurried away, hands shoved deep in my pockets to cover my shame, and crept around the corner where the bathroom door stood slightly ajar. I lingered in the doorway, my pale, chubby face illuminated by the moonlight pouring in from the small window at the top of the far wall. My heart was pounding in my ears, chest, and groin; I’d never been this aroused in my life. Unfurling myself from my shorts, I saw a strand of amber-tinted goo dripping precariously from the tip of my dick. Something compelled me to catch it with my fingertip, and I brought it up to my nose to sniff. It was oddly heady and sweet. 

My tongue crept past my lips with a mind of its own, drunkenly dancing out to catch its fated partner in an erotic salsa. As soon as it touched the unknown substance, my mind lit up like an enemy battalion.. 

It tasted like maple syrup. 

My entire body shuddered uncontrollably, spasming from head to toe. The former felt light as a cloud, the latter curling and cracking hard on the stone floor. Unconscious of my body’s actions, the roaring, vicious assault of the Ents soundtracking my ascent into heaven, my hand crept downward across the rough cotton of my shirt and found its mark. I’d just barely touched myself when I felt the surging power of a millennia of sexual tension spastically rip through my body. Heaving, I lurched forward, gripped the doorframe hard, and coated it with an eruptious glaze of my sweet, sugary nethercream. 

Slumped against the doorframe with weak fingers splayed, I wheezed. My head was swimming somewhere in the hazy, fluorescent lights of the basement. Just over the crest of my orgasm, a shrill scream snapped me back to reality and I was caught, literally pants down, by Aunt Cheryl coming to turn over the laundry.

Needless to say, I was never invited back to my cousin’s place.

*****

I’d always felt strangely at home in the forest, but it wasn’t until after my explosive revelation that I fully realized my place in the world. The reservoir for my desires had, until then, gently ebbed and flowed. The dry, crusted banks of my youth were not to be wasted, dashed upon the shores of mediocre handjobs and spray-tanned porn. I refused to be an ignorant child, a walking turbine of waste, a feedbag with a crotch that drooled effortlessly into a sea of crumpled tissues and hidden socks. 

Thus, my descent into the fervor of arboreal eroticism began, and I became one with nature. The rest of my teenage years were spent in fevered daydreams at school and belabored trips to national state parks and garden centers. The scent of fresh-cut grass became a sensory overload of seething pleasure and I found myself pressing my fingers deep into the soil of potted plants on more than one occasion, sometimes to the misplaced dismay of teachers, friends’ parents, and strangers on the street. 

Despite my initial catalyst of Tolkien’s walking, talking trees, I never quite felt the need to dress up as one and fuck or be fucked. I didn’t beat off to worn out copies of *National Geographic* and *Discover Magazine*. The thought of hearing something like “oh daddy you make me so thorny” from a *seriously* understanding sexual partner *never even occurred to me* as a way to get off. No, I needed the real thing. I needed soil in-between my toes and the promise of chlorophyll on my lips. I needed nature *au naturel*. Mom was a cleanfreak, but I managed to convince her to let me keep one plant in my bedroom; a potted Dracaena Marginata. I named her Marge. She was more woman to me than any girl I could’ve ever made eyes at or sloppily swapped spit with in-between classes. She carried me effortlessly through countless sweaty nights. The odd amber ooze that’d escaped me on that fateful day never returned, but I didn’t mind. I could’ve stayed in the rapacious thrall of youthful sexual exploration for the rest of my life. 

Unfortunately, adulthood calls. 

Once I graduated from high school, I got into a decent town college. From there, I got a bachelor’s degree in business management, had a few solid internships, and by the age of twenty six, landed a huge job opportunity at a bigwig manufacturing company in New York. My parents and friends were ecstatic for me. Myself, less so. The City had glistening skylines with endless horizons. It had bustling workforces and meaty buzzwords and crisscrossing ladders with pots of gold at every top rung. But, I lamented, it didn’t have the forever forests of my youth, underbrush rich with the rolling wild. The final drive from West Virginia to the big apple was a morose one; I truly felt like the worm. As I got on I-79 with all my worldly possessions rattling around in my car and Marge strapped safely into the passenger seat, I felt like I could almost see the ghost of the forest in my rearview, shimmering trees waving farewell in the gentle Spring breeze. 

The first few months were rough. The city was harsh, cold, and unforgiving. Gone was the small town hospitality I was so used to. Instead, a grunt and a shove on the subway platform were there to greet my sore body and exhausted mind. My office was bustling, but the air was stale, recycled with the pained breath of a thousand empty promises and extended due dates and forms, forms, forms.

Four months in, Marge died. The plant and partner that I’d had for over ten years was gone. She’d been drooping for weeks and I just didn’t have enough time to tend to her; even when I did, I was so worn out from the seemingly interminable workday that I just forgot. I held her wilted leaves against my tear-stained cheek as I wept, unintentionally watering her for the first time in recent memory. As I sat there, mourning the loss of my dear lover, a growling sensation of retribution and warmth began to spread throughout my body, starting with my groin. Without thinking, I set her wasted leaf down, unbuttoned my trousers, and quickly disrobed. I sat down in the armchair flanking Marge and ran a shaking hand over her stilted body. Her bark, though still firm, was supple and receptive to my touch. 

“I’m so sorry, my love,” I whispered aloud. “How could I have let you fade? I’m a monster.” Tears began to well up and pour down my face anew, lightly pattering against my pale, splotchy flesh.

Then, she shook her head. Well, her leaves. Startled, I looked around. The window in the far corner of the room was open; just the wind. I raised my aching form from the chair and padded over to the window, closing it with a heavy sigh. I stared out at the city street below, people passing by in the dozens, unaware of anything except their destination. How had I let myself become so lost and jaded in such a short amount of time?

“Phillip?”

I spun around, almost falling over. A voice. A soft, woman’s voice. There was no one in the apartment. I quickly ran to the front door, just to be sure. Locked. Was I hearing things? Too much coffee at work, probably. The boss had really been getting on my case lately and I was on the edge of -

“Phillip, it’s me.” 

This time I did fall over, tripping over my own foot and landing hard on my bare ass. The voice was coming from Marge. I crawled forward a bit, unsticking myself from the floor, and placed a tentative hand on the small endtable. Shaking it just the bit, I watched as the remaining leaves swayed lazily from the movement. Was this really happening? Was she talking to me?

No. It’s a plant. She’s a plant. No matter how much I personified her, she’s still a fucking plant. I was honestly losing it. I picked myself up and turned around, grabbing my clothes, and started to head to my bedroom. 

“Come back. Don’t leave me.”

I whipped around, threw my clothes at the wall, and dove to the floor, ready to tear the plant up and end this nonsense. Instead, I was greeted by the strangest sight I’d ever seen in my life.

A dozen or so small green and white tubes were protruding from the soil, slowly wriggling in a synchronized formation. As soon as I acknowledged them, they began churning faster and faster. 

“What. The. Fuck.” The words squeezed themselves past my pursed lips.

The tubes, thin and stringy, instantly straightened, looking like a demented organic pincushion. 

“No curses,” trilled one in the back right corner. 

“We love you,” from the middle. 

“We need you.”

They spun a few times clockwise and straightened once more. In perfect unison, they rang out “we can’t go on without you”. The words were like a song; a sweet, dulcet soprano hung in the air. 

My knees gave out and I sat down heavily. What the hell was going on?

“What…” I began, unsure of the words even as they left my mouth. “What are you? Who are you?”

The tubes flattened against the soil save for one in the dead center, slightly bigger than the others and leaning up against the stalk. I subconsciously dubbed it Large Marge. Although it had no eyes or other distinguishable features, I could feel it staring directly at me. Into me. When it spoke, the words came from behind it, underneath it; all around it. 

“We are you. We are your love. We are your fancy. We are Marge.” As soon as it said the name, the rest of the tubes began slapping back and forth in a frenzied fit, all shouting “Marge” in the same shrill voice. 

“You planted us,” the last two words echoed back and forth throughout the rows, “planted us with your Father Seed. Your Seed made us whole and you loved us but you left us to dry.”

I rubbed my eyes and dejectedly shook my head. “I’m sorry. Work got so busy and things at home fell to the wayside and I just ran out of time. I didn’t mean to hurt you.” Yep. This was it. I was talking to a fucking dancing worm parasite that’d invade my plant. Real top of the charts here.

“We forgive,” said the left half. “We forget,” claimed the right. “But we aren’t dead yet!” cried the whole lot. They doubled over, as though giggling at their little rhyme, and then seemed to regain a more serious posture. “We thirst. Please feed, Papa Phillip, please feed.”

Numbly, I looked around, There was a glass of water sitting on the edge of the kitchen counter. I slowly rose to my feet and started towards it, but the chorus pulled me back.

“No, no, no water, no water. We need Seed. Father Seed from Papa’s Life Stem, please.” The last word swelled and broke in the air like a balloon.

I looked down at my fright-shriveled dick, remembering countless masturbation sessions ending in a cloudy white release trickling down Marge’s lush green leaves. 

Glancing back up at the tubes - Marge - I cupped my little white worm and offered it forward to the ones in the pot. “Is this what you want?”

“Yes! Yes! Please! Life Stem! Father Seed!”

A cracked smirk crept across my lips, and I stepped closer, feeling a twitch deep inside my balls. I hadn’t jerked off once in over a week. No wonder the plant had died. 

I began stroking myself, hardening beneath my grasp, and draped my body across the chair. The Marges began flailing, whispering excitedly back and forth. Large Marge stood tall, quivering, waiting. I maintained eye contact with her as my pace quickened, remembering a particularly steamy session one night during a thunderstorm. I edged closer and closer to the brink, and The Marges went wild, flailing in no particular pattern. Just as i reached orgasm, the voices rose up in an almost whitenoise wall of sound, reveling in the shower of voluminous amber discharge. 

It was back. 

I leant back into the chair, soaked with sweat but wildly satisfied, and watched with absolute rapt fascination as The Marges lapped up every drop with greedy abandon, scouring every nook and cranny of their pot for more. When they were done, an endless chant of “thank you”s filled the air. Large Marge, looking beyond full and brimming with light, slowly slid from the pot, inching closer to me. She ran up my thigh, her slimy yet coarse skin a welcome touch, and began cleaning my distended member for the rest of her prize. When she was done, the rest of The Marges settled down and she curled up my arm, over my shoulder, and nestled next to my ear. We fell into a deep sleep in the sated embrace of lovers. 

*****

The next month passed in a blur. On the subway ride to and from work, sitting at my desk all day, getting a hotdog from the cart outside of my building - all I could think of was Marge. The Marges. It almost sounded like a band. Large Marge and the Little Tubes. The Tubeway Margey. Ha! 

My mood had skyrocketed. Things were going better at work and I felt healthier and happier. Daily feedings became an absolute ritual of morning dew and nightly fertilizer. It was bliss. With each passing session, The Marges seemed to grow bigger, louder, stronger. Large Marge was my favorite, of course, but I divided my attention fairly. We talked for hours, though they didn’t seem to be capable of forming completely coherent sentences. When we were tired of talking, they would sometimes sing to me. Other times, I would read aloud from my vast collection of botanical tomes, dedicated to all walks of greenlife. We became inseparable. 

Then, I fell behind on rent. I sent a few emails around at work, put up a notice in my local coffee shops, and finally resorted to the festering cesspool of Craigslist. Within four hours, I’d received 12 spam emails, 7 sexual solicitations, and 2 hopefuls. One was a young professional in the city looking to move closer to work, and the other an aspiring “artist” trying to find a homebase so they could “make it big”. Stars in their eyes, I’m sure. I rolled mine. I called the suit and came up with smoke; they’d found somewhere cheaper and even closer. Disappointed, I reluctantly punched in the number for America’s next underground breakout. 

He could move in tomorrow. Great. The Marges sensed my frustration and soothed me with a pretty little tune. 

Loud, boisterous, and arrogant, Salide came bursting through my door. Yeah, Salide. Pronounced like “salad”. You know, the fucking edible bush. His real name was Darrell, but I only knew that because of his ID - he swore me to secrecy the second he handed it over, flourishing a stubby pinky capped with a gaudy fake gold ring. Fashion designer by day, crossdresser by night, he flounced into my life and puked glitter and sickly sweet perfume onto everything I owned. Coming from a very traditional and dirt poor black family in Georgia, he vehemently shunned his roots and chalked them up to an alien abduction or some other bullshit. I learned very quickly to ignore almost everything he said. I kept to my room, only coming into the common areas to get food, leave for work, and visit Marge when he was gone. Sadly, she had to hide when he was around. I would’ve moved her into my bedroom, but there just wasn’t enough light. It put an unhealthy strain on our relationship, and the stress quickly grew. 

After a mostly silent feeding session, the tension in the air finally broke, and The Marges spoke up.

“We love. We need. We miss.” 

I sighed. “I know, darlings, me too.”

Large Marge, more vibrant and beautiful than ever, wriggled closer to me. 

“Take me with you, Papa. I can leave, they will be fine, I can leave and come with you.”

I looked her over and smiled broadly. “I’d love nothing more. But how?”

She waved back and forth in response, and began stretching. She curved across my thighs, still moist and sticky with our lovemaking, and wrapped around first one, then the other. After a good ten seconds of stretching, I saw the soil where her body was connected begin to tug up. Another moment, and it gave way. She slipped out of the pot completely with a little popping noise, crumbs of dirt trailing behind. Continuing to wrap herself around my body, she made her way to my crotch, slid sensually across my shaft, and stopped at my urethra. With a little wiggle, she softly split the skin and entered me. It felt like a warm, dull fire coursing up through my stomach. I’d never felt a greater pleasure in my life. I could feel her spreading first through my abdomen, passing through organs and muscle alike, snaking her way through my intestine like a lovelorn parasite looking for food. She pushed gently against the wall of my stomach lining and I giggled, tapping on the taut skin. I watched, fascinated, as the very last of her emerald body disappeared into me, feeling her traipse lovingly around my lungs and then up through my neck, flicking her tail against my heart. She stopped just neighboring my brain stem, rubbing her tiny head against my fleshy walls. When she spoke, I heard her inside of my own head, as though she were a thought. 

“I love you, Papa.”

“I love you too.”

We slept soundly that night, the tiny coos of the rest of The Marges a gentle lullaby for the ages.

*****

I rose for work the next day, rejuvenated as ever. Getting dressed and grabbing a bagel from the kitchen, I shook my head at the filthy state of the apartment. Darrell - sorry, “Salide” -  was disgusting. What a wreck of a person. 

Passing him in the hallway, no doubt on the way back from one of his ill-fated auditions, he shouted something about a party later that night that he was throwing in the apartment, some celebration for his “drag mother”, whatever that means. I shrugged it off. No use getting into it with him now; I would be late.

After a long day of endless paperwork and not wanting to deal with a party full of loud, drunk queens, I took off to a local bar and proceeded to get shithouse smashed on $2 happy hour beers. The entire time, Marge whispered sweet nothings in my ear. She always knew just what to say to take the edge off. Around 1 AM, properly tanked and ready for bed, I stumbled home. I could deal with a few unwelcome stragglers if need be. To my delight, when I got inside, the apartment was dark and empty. Trashed, but empty. With a sigh of relief, I snagged an unopened but still cold beer from the counter and headed to the bedroom. I had my hand on the handle when I heard it.

“Papa,” a whisper, gentle as a dust mote. 

*Something’s wrong* said Marge.

“Papa, help.”

*Go to them.*

Unsteady on my feet, I walked over to the pot and looked down. Once my eyes focused, I gasped and fell to my knees. It was scorched earth. My tiny babies were all withered, black husks. They looked almost burnt.

An unintelligible scream sounded from somewhere deep under my skin. On the surface, a sob was lodged in my throat.

“What happened?!” I nearly shouted.

“Bad men, bad men. Rained ash, smoke ash. Yellow showers. Hurt so bad, Papa, hurt so bad.”

Even through my drunken haze, I could clearly picture Salide and his guests ashing cigarettes and pissing on my helpless love. Instantly, my blood was set to a boil and rage coursed through me like lightning. My feet were pulling me towards his room; whether it was my own doing or Marge’s, I have no idea, but it didn’t matter now. 

His door was locked, but we made short work of that. The flimsy wood splintered under my second kick and flew inward. The smell of sickly sweet perfume was like a punch in the face, but I powered through it, running up to Salide’s bed. His bloated, drunken face curdled my stomach, false eyelashes fluttering open and smudges of makeup creating a clownish horror as he sat up, looking around and blinking heavily. 

“What… what the fuck?” he said. I just stood, shrouded in darkness. Then, I realized through my rage, it wasn’t all that dark. My skin, previously covered by shadow, was now glowing with an unearthly green, luminescent light. It was almost rippling. 

“What the fuck!?” Salide repeated, fully awake now and quickly shuffling backwards. I opened my mouth to say something, but before I could get even a sound out, I felt a solid form shoot past my lips. It was Large Marge. She curved upwards and arced back down, tail slipping fully out of my mouth. She’d reshaped, her head now ending in five razor sharp points, glistening kaleidoscope eyes set deep in the center. Giant black mandibles protruded from her face, rows of similarly black teeth extending back into her open maw, and her cavern of a mouth oozed with the same amber goo that’d birthed her. 

Salide screamed, then vomited, sending a cascade of chunky effluence in a waterfall down his pudgy stomach. He choked and tried to scream again, but Marge surged forward, catching his mouth and throat in one bite. Her jaws unhinged in a horrific horizontal angle and closed with a sickening crunch. Salide flailed wildly, but Marge wrenched up and down in quick succession, severing his jugular and sending a spurt of blood across his bedsheets. Body flopping with limp effort, he succumbed to her crushing vice and drowned in the backwash of his own blood; a symphonic gurgle his last gift to the world. 

Covered in blood and steaming viscera, we retreated into the living room, but it was too late. The rest of the clan had taken their final breaths minutes before. Slumping to the floor, I leaned against the wall and cried softly. Marge coiled around my neck, her head now back to its normal smooth exterior, and licked away my tears before sliding past my lips, back down my throat, and cuddling up next to my heart. We sang, in harmony, The Marges’ favorite tune.

*****

It’s been a few months since the incident. Salide suddenly up and “left town”, but that’s alright; the arrangement wasn’t working out anyway. All of his things found a lovely little home in the dumpster out back. 

Large Marge and I held a nice eulogy at home. A quiet affair. I miss The Marges, but I know they’re resting well now. 

Good news, though - I’m expecting! I don’t know what the twins/triplets/quadruplets version of 2,238 is, but hey, my degree was in business management, not math or english. I can already feel the eggs, gently throbbing deep beneath my skin. They’re scattered in my organs, threaded in muscles and up against bone. A few are even nestled right behind my eyes. In just two months time, they’ll begin to burrow and surface, and we’ll be a family again. 

I see a bright future for Marge and I. There’s really nothing like true love to plant the seeds for a better tomorrow. "
4zqr06,136,2016-08-26,TIFU by hooking up with a girl at a strip club and nearly breaking her neck - NSFW,Criblu,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4zqr06/tifu_by_hooking_up_with_a_girl_at_a_strip_club/,"A few years ago I was at one of my best friend's birthday party. It was while I was in grad school and she had invited a bunch of people she knew from undergrad and our internship. A few months before she had told me about this girl that I might like, but who was kind of crazy. I didn't ask for her to elaborate, assuming that crazy meant party girl because they were a couple years younger than me.


So the party is a blast, everybody's having fun, and I am the DJ/MC. I played a few Backstreet Boys songs, dancing and singing along with them. 
At this point I noticed the girl talking to my friend Kylie about me. They keep looking over at me and giggling.
The girl, Amanda, then comes over to me and starts up a conversation. We get along great for the next few songs, and are really starting to hit it off.
Kylie's bf then suggests that we all go to the strip club. 
Fantastic idea! I'm already drunk, and have never been, so there has never been an idea I've loved more in my life.


We get to the strip club and I'm just completely blown away. Naked girls everywhere, dudes being creepy. Girls watching what's happening awkwardly. 
The part of me that loves to see other humans at their most vulnerable and  natural state was in heaven. The primal look in the guys eyes as they burned holes into these girls naked flesh was something I'll never forget. Even though very drunk, I can still picture their focused concentration. It was as if they diverted their eyes for a second, it would all just disappear, and they'd find themselves right back in their mom's basement.
Now while I've been observing the going ons inside of the club, one of my buddies had paid one of the dancers like $20 to dance on me solo for a few minutes.
In my distracted, surveying mode, I barely even registered what was happening to me. I don't remember what the girl looked like, what color her hair was, or whether I was sitting or standing. Apparently she noticed, and in a last ditch effort for my attention, forcefully shoved her pelvis into my face while possibly hanging from a pole (?... Not sure how it happened to this day). Completely caught off guard, my drunken self loses balance and tumbles straight into Amanda, who was watching what I was getting from an adjacent table.


After mopping up her spilled drink and apologizing profusely, I ask her how she's enjoying the strip club.
""Well, so far it's been a waste of the cover charge. But you don't seem to be too into it either.""
""Yeah, I wouldn't come here on my own, but I enjoy just watching how people who come here act.""
""You're weird.""
""Yeah... I realize that.""
She then just grabbed me and started making out with me hard core in the middle of the club. 
Like throwing me against the wall, rubbing all over me.. Doing things I've only seen in crappy pornos.
Kylie's boyfriend sees us going at it and starts cheering us on. He then gathers everyone up and said we need to get home now so everyone can do it. 
Drunk me is like ""yeah!!!"".


So we get back to Kylie's house, our other friends go home, she and her bf go to their room, her roommate goes to her room, and Amanda and I are left in the living room.
Apparently, she hasn't had enough, and starts tearing into me like a hungry lioness.
Having never encountered a girl quite as passionate before, I figure it's time for me to take the lead and give her a good time. 
She was a tiny little thing, 5'2"" and maybe 115, so once I started taking control, she didn't have much choice. 
I'm feeling like a rockstar, drunk and hooking up with a hot girl the first night I met her.
Keep in mind we are in a living room, with no lights on, no bed, and both drunk as shit. 
But I'm trying things I've only ever seen professionals attempt, and she seems to be enjoying it, so I decide to get real creative, and have her do a hand stand (facing away from me), while I'm standing on the couch. 


If you can imagine the logistics, this takes a fair amount of coordination, especially from two inebriated, albeit highly athletic individuals. 
She then tells me to put it in her butt. Normally, I'd be fairly hesitant, especially since I have no idea when the last time she had showered or emptied her bowels. 


But on this night of exploration, I was like Aladdin, seeing a whole new world. 
Again, in the middle of a living room, and without a repertoire of typical sexual staples (lube) some improvisation was needed. 
So once that was achieved, she told me to take it slow and ease into it. 


Slow and easy while sober is difficult enough when you're in an  aroused state, but intoxicated it took every ounce of determination I had to not jam it like I was trying to rupture her spleen.
Unfortunately, the concentration I was putting into keeping a slow, steady rhythm took away from the focus on my precariously placed feet.
I had slowly inched closer and closer to the edge of the sofa cushions, and seeing as I was basically supporting all of her weight, it was as if a 300 pound man placed all his weight on the outer 4 inches of the couch.


As my momentum took me forward in the thrust, the two front legs of the sofa snapped outward, causing me to tumble all of my weight, penis first into this girls ass.
Of course her scrawny arms could not take my sudden weight transfer, and she crashed face first into the ground. 
Somewhat fortunately, I was still holding her legs, so she didn't bang them against the coffee table, and I landed on my feet, no worse for the wear.
I laid her legs on the ground and was terrified I had just snapped her neck.
I roll her over and her eyes are shut. 
""Fuckkkk me... Amanda.. Amanda...""


At this point I hear our friends stirring in their room, and I'm just like holy fucking shit...
So I quickly put my underwear on, place the feet of the couch back into a position where they can at least bear stationary weight, lift her onto the couch, and cover her up with a blanket.
Kylie comes into the hallway and asks me if everything is ok, I said yeah, I just fell off the couch while sleeping..
She sleepily mumbles and heads back to her room. 
I'm still like ""oh shit, oh shit""... And crazy thoughts about leaving the country are going through my head.


I sit on the ground next to Amanda's head and am quietly saying her name. Nothing.
So I do the only thing I can think of that everyone reacts to - I tickle. 
She gives a little jerk and swats my hand away... Omg I have never been so relieved in my life.
Hoping that she's passed out for the night, I sit in the recliner and nod off to sleep.


The next morning I woke up (after about 4 hours sleep), and Amanda is coming back from the bathroom. 
She sees me awake and asks, ""did we have sex last night?""
Not sure of how to answer I reply, ""a little, but you seemed pretty tired.""
""Wow, ok... I got scared you stuck it in my butt or something, I can hardly walk right now.""
Again, unsure of what I should be saying ""huh, I'm sorry..""
""It's ok, I went too crazy last night, I've got a fucking ridiculous headache right now.""
""Damn, you want me to get you some aspirin or something?""
""I'm good, I'll just sleep a bit longer."" She laid back down.
""Ok, well I need to head home, but that was fun. We should hang out again.""
""Yeah, text me.""


I left Kylie's house in a state of disbelief.. Apparently the blow knocked the whole memory of what happened out of her.
We actually went on to date for a few months, and I didn't tell her the story until after she tried punching me in the face for laughing at something stupid. But it was like this crazy secret I couldn't help laughing at whenever it popped into my head.


So moral of the story, always have lube and a bed.

TL;DR - party leads to strip club, leads to drunken acrobatic sex, leads to amnesia and a broken couch"
4zqrsc,2,2016-08-26,Will a year gap kill my chances of getting employed?,mrprogramus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4zqrsc/will_a_year_gap_kill_my_chances_of_getting/,"So I'm graduating soon, and I plan on getting cosmetic surgery. I'm really need this cosmetic surgery ASAP since I'm getting pretty depressed about it.

Unfortunately, this can take up to a year. **Will I have a hard time finding an entry level job after I recover from the surgery? Or should I just omit my graduation date?** Do employers really care that much about a year gap?

Summary of my resume:

* CGPA 3.6

* Honors: Magna Cum Laude

* Computer Science at one of the top 3 schools in my country (I'm scared to tell which one because classmates might find out I'm planning to get cosmetic surgery)

* 1 software internship experience (school requires us to have one internship before graduating)
* Several extra-curricular activities
* Won several hackathons
* Knowledge in Java EE, Spring, Maven, SQL, Git, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Android




I also plan to do side projects while I'm recovering from the surgery. "
4zqsfm,1,2016-08-26,Hard Time finding an Engineering Job.,EliteBagger512,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4zqsfm/hard_time_finding_an_engineering_job/,"So I recently graduated in May of 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from a good University. Graduated with 3.9 GPA-Magna Com Laude. I have 2 years of internship experience. With in the 2 years I had a 1 year internship of experience working in manufacturing, 4 months in an R&amp;D internship, an 8 month Senior Design Project to design and build an automated labeling machine from scratch for a company. My CAD software includes 6 years experience using Autodesk AutoCAD, Inventor, Solidworks, MathCAD, Matlab, SAP, and PTC Windchill, Microsoft excel, project, word, ppt. My other strengths include good communication, public speaking, written/oral skills. I am also getting ready to take the FE exam to obtain an EIT license. 

For a year now I have been applying for jobs, some I have been rejected from some during my senior year since I could not start working until I graduated 8 months later, this is understandable. However, currently since graduating I have neither been accepted nor rejected by many of the jobs I have applied for. I have applied for great positions that I qualify for, however the problem I am having is that it is taking forever to hear back from the company whether it is a rejection or for an interview. 

I have had a lot of staffing agencies call me and they have led no where. They call, ask for why kind of job I am looking for, and then after following up multiple times they say they are still trying to match me with a position. Has gotten me nowhere

Since graduating I have had 1 in person interview. It was probably the worst interview experience I have every had. The interviewer, although he honest, did not do a very good job of selling me the job. He told me that currently the company has been slow for the last 1.5 years, he said that he has placed some employees on unpaid leave since their works is slow, he said the reason we are looking engineering graduates to join the team ix because the cost of their engineering services is to high so they are looking to hire young people to reduce cost of doing business (i.e-under pay me), and lastly the best line of all....he said ""if we hire you we expect you to work their for the next 15-20 years.""  During this interview I did not get to answer any questions. Based on my qualifications as mentioned before, he said that I am more than qualified for the job, it's just a matter of do you want to be there. At the end of the interview they asked me so do you want to work here yes or no? They needed to know right then and there. I said I am very interested in the job I will need a few days time to make a decision based on the notes I took during the interview. Within next couple of days after the interviewer had told me that I was the most qualified and that my resume was selected from over 300, they said they found a better fit with someone else. Basically since I was not willing to commit during the interview they were not interested. 

Based on this I was curious about following, below are some questions. 




Question 1: I would say I would make a strong candidate for a job based on the interview I had. Although it did not go as well as I wanted, I did separate my self from 300 resumes to be selected for an interview. My question is would you agree with this assessment? What is your opinion on my skills and credentials and how it would stack up to other job candidates?

Question 2: Why does it take so long for companies to give either a rejection or an interview for a position? As noted before, I am able to separate my self from 300 resumes but what is frustrating is that after 4 weeks I still have not been contacted for the positions that I have applied for. Is this a normal experience everyone else goes through? 

Question 3: What is your Opinion on my interview experience?  Do you feel that it was unprofessional for the company to ask for a job decision without the company even making a formal offer? 

Question 4: Based on my credentials, I believe I can attain a starting salary around $67K-$69K. As noted before when speaking with staffing agencies they have confirmed that this is a reasonable expectation based on my skills, GPA, experience, etc. Also based on the average in the area i am applying for an Entry level mechanical engineering salary is $65k.....DO you agree with this? What is your opinion? 

Question 5: What advice do you have for me moving forward on how to better my job search? I have applied for lots of positions and just waiting to hear back? I am applying to positions in areas away from home (i.e willing to relocate). What websites are good for applying? I have already used indeed, linked in, monster, career builder, glass door, etc and have posted my resume on their websites so recruiters can search them. 

Question 6: Is this struggle I am having normal? Any advice to help me from getting frustrated all time? 

Question 7: What is your opinion on my situation? 

Thank you for your feedback!!!

4zqttz,44,2016-08-26,$90k Kickstarter from Growth Hacking Free Traffic,hypekilla,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4zqttz/90k_kickstarter_from_growth_hacking_free_traffic/,"We did an interview with a really amazing growth hacker, and I just wanted to share the nuggets here. Hope you guys enjoy.

Tip - To easily convert your blog posts to Reddit self-post formatting, use [Reddit converter](http://vyper.io/reddit_converter?utm_source=r_entre). Great way to syndicate your content to Reddit.

Reposted from [VYPER](http://vyper.io/blog/vincent-dignan/?utm_source=r_entre).

---

The best growth hackers in the world aren't necessarily going around teaching their skills. They're usually just making tons of money for themselves. A few of them consult with other companies for thousands of dollars per month. That's what Vincent Dignan was doing for years before he recently decided to reveal his secrets in a tell-all book entitled _""[Secret Sauce](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ultimate-growth-hacking-guide-secret-sauce-marketing).""_

The reason that Vincent has decided to stay underground and not reveal his secrets for so many years is because growth hacking channels die when too many people use them. How many users are now posting inspirational quotes on Instagram to try and ""growth hack"" that platform? How many people are using Auto-DM and Auto-Follow on Twitter? These hacks still work, but they're no longer as effective since you see it all too commonly now.

That's why to this day, he still doesn't reveal his best tactics. In fact the people who do reveal their tactics end up making it harder for themselves because those tactics end up overused. The _best_ growth hackers experiment relentlessly to get ahead of the curve, and then exploit the hacks ruthlessly before they're found out.

But we got an exclusive with Vincent to talk about a few of the tactics that are still working now, and how he creatively uses Twitter and other channels to get free targeted traffic for his clients and his own projects.

**You went from being broke and on welfare 4 years ago, now you’re giving growth hacking talks, how did you gain those skills in that time?**

Yeah at the time, around 2012, I was homeless living with an ex-girlfriend. I didn't have my own place and was living off her.

My ex told me I needed to go do something. So I decided to make an online magazine since I enjoyed writing and figured I wouldn't make money blogging off Tumblr. Within 6 months the magazine had 350,000 visitors per month. Within a year it had a million. We raised about $250,000 and got into the Techstars accelerator program. Soon later after that I was giving talks.

**Wow, amazing. But it sounds like you had no knowledge of the digital world before this. So how did you get up to 350,000 visitors so fast?**

One of the things I believe is you should learn from one of the best. At the time I wanted to start an online magazine so I talked with a girl who worked for a successful magazine and got advice from her. She told me just get as much traffic as you can -- the rest will fall into place.

So the first thing I did was call every University in the country and told them we were building the coolest magazine in the world and would you like to be apart of it. So in essence it was user generated content but we had editors to make the content look good. But the idea is to generate as many articles as possible.

Then our strategy was to hit up as many people as possible -- send it through news sites, social communities like Reddit, send it to large publications, send it to people via social media. Our articles got picked up by places like the Huffington Post and other sites like that, which drove massive traffic.

We also growth hacked our way with Twitter and got tons of traffic that way (editor’s note, we’ll talk more about Twitter later on in the article).

Another thing we did was we used a widget called Zergnet that was essentially a traffic exchange. Every time we send them 1 visitor they send us 2 back. So that was extremely good.

**You eventually made the transition from PlanetIvy to a growth hacking consultancy called Magnific, why?**

We got a lot of offers from other companies to learn how we were doing what we were doing. All the stuff we learned growing our Twitter, growing our traffic, that's stuff that companies wanted. The offers were too good to pass up. It made sense at that point to turn Planet Ivy into our own agency, [Magnific](http://magnific.com/).

Another main reason for the transition -- when we started in 2012, it was easier to get advertising dollars from publishing. Even with a lot of traffic, an ad-supported website is getting harder to do, especially now with Facebook dominating online advertising. Now Facebook has such a monopoly on traffic that most publications just can't compete with that kind of targeting and reach.

At the same time I still work on side projects just to keep myself interested while I'm helping clients grow their businesses. Secret Sauce, my book has been my biggest project this year. We wanted to create something for the people that can’t afford our services, which cost thousands of dollars. I also created a Facebook group called “traffic and copy,” which now has a few thousand people.

**You have a book on Kickstarter that was recently funded successfully (to the tune of $80k+). What was your marketing process for getting sales off Kickstarter?**

We first compiled a list of several different marketing channels then we arranged them from easiest to hardest.

The list looked something like this:

- Compile a list of people we know and let them know about the book -- Linkedin contacts, Twitter, email contacts.
- Accelerators and coworking spaces that I’ve talked at, I asked them to send things out to their newsletter. These all have pretty good newsletters that are tech/startup focused.
- Hacker News - we couldn’t do this channel as well.
- Posts on Reddit did really well - self posts. (Editor's note: Use [Reddit converter](http://vyper.io/reddit_converter/) to convert your blogs into self posts formatted for Reddit).
- Posting in Facebook groups.
- Interviewed on about 8 podcasts, get them to do interviews like this one.
- Reached out to some influencers to try and get referrals, although this didn’t help as much.
- Did talks throughout America during the launch.
- Our pre-existing mailing list.
- My partner Austin wrote a Medium article that got a lot of traffic.

Then send them to a queueing system, we used [Queue At](https://queueat.com/) to do this. You got a free chapter of the book if you signed up. This queue system asked you to share the book’s landing page in exchange for moving up the queue. As you moved up the queue you could get free webinars, free consultancies, free blog posts about your company, etc. This was definitely the key to the whole thing since it gave us a lot of viral shares.

Then we launched and we made about $15,000 from the first day, and now over $80,000 from Kickstarter.

**You’ve done a lot of growth hacking around Twitter. Can you share the basics about how you use Twitter for traffic?**

First of all I signed up several different accounts. I recommend beginners to start with 4 accounts -- you could do it like @company_name, @company_help, @company_usa, @company_country -- something like that.

- Then make sure you’re tweeting a LOT. I tweet on all my accounts every 30 minutes. Twitter isn’t like Facebook. You need repetition to get your content out there.
- I have an intern Tweeting for me.
- I don’t use automation currently, but in the past I’ve used Audiense to automate the replies.
- I follow people with certain attributes. Currently this isn’t automated because my intern does it, although there are tools like Follow Liker that can do that for you.
- Find a conference going on in your niche and follow those people. They’re super active so they tend to follow back.
- Don’t follow more than 500 people a day &amp; unfollow more than 400 people a day.
- Don’t send more than 250 tweets a day.
- I post and find interesting content.

**How did you start getting a lot of speaking engagements? That’s sort of a growth hack in itself isn’t it?**

Yeah I was randomly asked to talk at an accelerator and they were going to pay me for it. From there it was just by referral. Someone there wanted me to talk at another place, and then so on and so forth.

One other thing I did to get speaking engagements was just hit up the organizer to various startup meetups in my area (through Meetups.com), give them a deck I had on growth hacking, and do a cold email asking if I could speak.

**You mention on your site that forums are where you learn real growth hacks. What forums do you go on?**

BlackHatWorld.com. It’s black hat but they have a lot of amazing tactics on there.

The thing with blackhat, of course, is that the hacks don’t really last, but they’ll be doing stuff that gets them tons of traffic for a time, until Google finds out and destroys it. So you can’t make a real business out of it, but you can get some temporary wins from Blackhat.

However, the site itself has actually tons of really good advice that’s not Blackhat, so I recommend people checking it out.

**What’s a last growth hack you want to share with our audience?**

The key really is knowing that there are tools out there for anything. A lot of stuff can be automated and a lot of knowledge and info can be scraped.

[CharlieApp](https://charlieapp.com/) -- Finds anyone’s info.

[Audiense](https://www.audiense.com/) - Automated Twitter/Instagram mentions and scrape Twitter/Instagram for certain keywords.

[Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/) - Find email addresses.

Depending on what you’re trying to achieve, there’s going to be a way for you to reach people without spending a lot of time or money."
4zqumx,1,2016-08-26,Room left a mess by roommate's subletter,Karilusarr,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4zqumx/room_left_a_mess_by_roommates_subletter/,"OMG I have to tell this story to someone

I live in a two bedroom apartment. My roommate got an internship in another city for the summer and he subletted his room. He found two subletters, one for three month and one for the last month of the summer. The first subletter shows up and he seemed decent at keeping the apartment clean, so I didn't think I needed to set rules and schedules. 

Midway through the first month, May, I went home to visit family and had no set schedule of when I would be back, therefore I didn't sublet my room. At the start of the June a friend of mine needed a place to stay while he was waiting for his paperwork to get through for him to start working in another country, so I offered my room. 

I know my friend's standard of cleanliness, as I have seen his place many times. When my friend got to my place, according to him everything seemed ok. There were some little things here and there, but generally acceptable. My friend stays there for a month and half, to the middle of July. During the course of that time he didn't mention any problems with the subtennant, so I assume all is well. When my friend left, he cleaned up the apartment from top to bottom as a thank you for me. He left my room spotless and had bought me new beddings and stuff.

At the end of July the subtennant messages me for a favor. He had initially thought he was able to leave on the 28th, so he put my roommates room on airbnb for the last three days of the month he is still paying. But there were some delays and he could not leave until the 31st, so he had double booked and asked to stay in my room for the three days. I said sure, since he seemed liked a good guy.

I got no more contact from my roommate or the first subtennant regarding the room. That is until two days ago, when I finally came to the apartment after staying with my parents all summer.

My room was a total mess. The bed wasn't made. The comforter and blanket was on the floor. My end table was moved to the middle of the room. There's random wrappers and bags everywhere. The bedding my friend bought me is opened and crumpled up in a corner. My room wasn't dirty, but stuff were moved and left everywhere. My room was not the worst part. 

The bathroom was disgusting. There's dishes piled in the sink. The sink it self has grime caked on. The stove looked like nobody knew how to use a lid with all the oil splatter on there.

All the mess in my room was made in a three day period, and the rest of the apartment just seem to fell apart during the last month and half. I am so pissed and so tired from all the cleaning. It feels like I’m moving in all over again.

I’m still trying to figure out what the hell happened. Everything from middle of July to now is based on the two subletters and an Airbnb guest of three days. I haven’t even seen the second subletter yet. He doesn’t seem like he left though, there’s suitcases in my roommate’s room. I need to talk to him and see what he saw when he came to the apartment at the beginning of August.

Will update when I get the story straight.

By nightfall, I was crouching behind a Chevy Suburban to avoid bullets,” Mak wrote:

Another intern, a white man who had arrived later on to take photos, huddled beside me. After the gunfire ceased, he emerged from behind the car to take more pictures while I stayed behind.
“Get your white ass out of here!” he soon heard. “You better not let me f***ing catch you!”

Mak wrote that he tried unsuccessfully to defuse the situation, and a group of men began to chase his colleague down the street:
Wanting to help, but not knowing how, I decided to run after them. In order to run faster, my colleague dropped the two bulky cameras hanging around his neck. When I tried to retrieve them, and yelled at him to get out of the area, some in the group of rioters started chasing after me too.

“As a former back-of-the-pack runner in middle school gym class, I wasn’t surprised when they caught me,” he added. “When they threw me to the ground, I reflexively curled up into a ball. Blows landed on my back, head and torso.”

Mak wrote that the beating stopped when someone yelled, “Stop! He’s not white! He’s Asian!”

“As my vision came back into focus, I saw a group of concerned black faces and heard someone repeating, ‘Don’t fuck with Chinese dudes,’” he wrote. “My attackers had run off. Those who had intervened escorted me to safety.”"

my main question is, is having C(low level language), embedded systems programming experience and those skills on a resume good for a software engineering/Developer career target, or should i focus on gaining experience through a software engineering internship and gain knowledge and experience with a high level language or something like that?

4zrcjg,2,2016-08-26,Negotiating a low offer?,_Hokie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4zrcjg/negotiating_a_low_offer/,"I am a recent CS grad, and I finally received my first offer today for a web dev position.  The offer was for $16/hr, or $33k/year.

To give you an idea of the position, this is a small-ish business using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript / jQuery, PHP, MySQL, and CodeIgniter.  I have a good amount of experience with everything except CodeIgniter, including an internship with a company that paid more than what this company is offering for a full-time position.  They are adding employees to help address a lot of technical debt while continuing to improve their product.  Their online presence generates the majority of their income.

For more context, I completed a programming test and an interview (side note to employers: this 2-step process was amazing).  In the interview, they said my code was the best of all of their applicants so far.  

There are a few reasons why I feel like I **need** to accept this job:

* I had a 2.0 in college.  Employers have not hired me because of that.  I want to get that behind me.

* I have been living with my parents since graduation, and I would like to move.  We have... different views on things.

* From what I've seen, I would enjoy the job and the people I'd be working with more than any other job I've found.

But compensation seems extremely low compared to the average entry-level web developer position in the area ($45k-$50k).  The area has a low COL, but I think I should be able to be productive without much training.  I thought I would be offered about $10k more.

I asked if salary is negotiable, and I was told ""Feel free to make a counter offer and reasoning for it.""  I think I am worth more, but I really don't want to lose this opportunity.

How should I go about negotiating a better offer?"
4zro2m,2,2016-08-26,I just want to be a bitch,ThisIsNotAlright,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4zro2m/i_just_want_to_be_a_bitch/,"I want to preface this by saying that I don't want to post this in /r/relationships because I'm not looking for advice, I just want to rant and get this off of my chest.

About 8 months ago, my boyfriend cheated on me in a pretty screwed up way. He had an ongoing emotional affair for months which eventually turned physical. The girl he had his affair with had just turned 18 (he's 26) and was under the assumption that he was in an open relationship and that I was cool with what was going on. He got drunk one night while I was busy with a school project and drove to her place. Long story short, they fucked without a condom, he felt bad and left. He then proceeded to ignore me for DAYS by leaving town and staying with friends (we lived together). I knew something was up, but he adamantly denied it. I found out because he has NEVER pulled that shit before and I had a sneaking suspicion that something was up, so I snooped ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

We broke up for 6 months and I got on with my life and partied, went to frat parties, slept with as many people as I wanted to (we were together for 12 years), made connections with people that would have been inappropriate while in a relationship, snagged a sick as fuck internship that payed $30/h.. you get the idea.

However, in the end I still missed him and I missed the connection we had. His reasoning for doing what he did weren't too far out there. I ignored him (because I was busy with school, not maliciously), spent most of my days in the city I go to school in, made him feel unwanted and unloved. Shit excuses for cheating, but I can buy that he was attention starved and she gave him what I couldn't. I'm a fucking engineer major in the last year of my program. Of course I'm busy and I have no time for anyone or anything other than school. I could tell he knew he fucked up and I could tell he regretted every second of what he did. I could tell how lost he was and I could tell that he felt the full weight of his actions. Some will call me an idiot, and some will say I'm just asking for this to happen again, but I believe we all make mistakes and that whole ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" mantra is crap. I forgave him and moved back in with him under the condition that  he is honest with me from here on out and he communicates issues before they become a ""thing"" and he fucks up again. Of course I have to abide by the same conditions. If I forgive him, I need to forgive him completely and I need to not let this hang over us like a dark cloud.

I cant though, I have days where it's literally all I can think about. The images of him fucking this 18 year old blond bitch flood my brain and I just want to curl in a ball or scream at him. I cant though, because those kind of actions are toxic and completely counter-productive to both our relationship and my mental state.

I know I could find someone loyal and loving. I'm a catch. I'm tall and slender, people find me incredibly attractive and I catch men staring at me a lot. I'm also very, very smart with 2 degrees, one in an incredibly difficult and demanding engineering field. I'll be alright in life if I didn't have him. I don't want to though, I want him. I want him and I want our life to be like it was pre cheating. He was perfect, and attentive and caring. I never for a second doubted he loved me or admired me. We started dating in middle school for fucks sake. We can have entire conversations with facial expressions and he's enriched my life by just existing. The last 3 months we've been back together, he's never been anything but an ideal boyfriend and I an ideal girlfriend. I just cant shake the feelings I get periodically where I want to yell and scream and destroy his entire life. I've had sick thoughts of messaging this girl to interrogate her and, to be honest, just straight up harass her. Everything I've read about forgiving a cheater says to ACTUALLY FORGIVE THEM and to not let this be the elephant in the room, but I cant deny the feelings I have and the anger inside of me. I've always been a major proponent for fairness and equality in a relationship, but I want to see him grovel.


This is not healthy, but ranting helps. I'm getting over it, but why does it have to take so long?"

This whole year has been tough for me.
My best friend died, I was planning on proposing to my girlfriend later this year and she broke up with me, I dropped out of a career I didn't like anymore and my family didn't support my decision.

I have already chosen the date and place. I've been working since I dropped off from Uni and have quite some money.
I've already bought the bus tickets, signed a contract for a flat to stay and written a lot of notes to send on the night I leave.

I am scared shitless since I have no idea what I'm going to do after I get there and that I will know no one.
I am skilled in programming and web developing, so I'm hoping I can get a passanty or internship for a few months and then collect at least a small paycheck.

I'm only a sophomore, but I have taken discrete math and have a pretty good understanding of basic probability (Bayes' thm, Expected Value + Linearity, etc., binomial distributions, etc.). I may have to brush up a little and learn how to solve some of the more advanced problems on glassdoor and such, though.

I am not that great at mental math, though, which I hear is also part of the interview. I'm pretty good at math in general but I didn't do competitions in HS or anything.

I am not expecting much, but I'm trying to prepare as best as I can so I don't completely fuck it up. 

My cramming plan so far is to learn/practice fast mental math this weekend, and then spend the next few days before the interview going over probability/stats. 

Any other tips on how to prepare? Is this stuff even possible to practice in the extremely short time I have?"

4zsa73,7,2016-08-26,I [23F] feel frustration and anger every time I interact with this one coworker [23F] for two months. How do I improve this relationship?,fitzbender,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zsa73/i_23f_feel_frustration_and_anger_every_time_i/,"I started at a new company 2 months ago and there is an intern here who has been here for nearly a year that I really don't get along with. Outside of work situations, we generally enjoy each other's company, but at work, I get very frustrated every time we interact and even angry sometimes.   


For example, I pointed out an error in one of her reports in private, and she got extremely defensive and read her internet source across the office to me, while staring at me. I understand we take pride in our work, but it was a simple error that was easy to correct that really didn't warrant this kind of reaction. She is also very intrusive when it comes to my work. Generally when we provide feedback, it is topic-oriented such as ""this data needs to be changed"", but she will tell me ""you put in wrong data"". I wonder if I'm being overly sensitive, but I often feel attacked by her comments. She will purposely say things to establish that she knows more than I do, and when I turn out to be correct, she'll never admit her fault. It all reminds me of how girls used to passive aggressively say things in high school and I really want to be past that phase in our lives.   


I kind of see where she's coming from, she's been here longer and she's trying to establish her dominance. She is a completely different person to me than more senior people in the company. Her body language and behaviour is all very demeaning, and it makes me uncomfortable, frustrated, and sometimes angry because I've shown her no disrespect to warrant this. She is also very well liked by management and will probably be hired on full time after she graduates.   


What can I do to improve this relationship? I really want to work in a more harmonious environment and be rid of all this unnecessary friction and pettiness. Any advice is appreciated!

 tl;dr: Intern at work has been there longer than I have as a new hire and is slightly hostile towards me to establish dominance/seniority. What can I do to smooth out this relationship? "

I'm not sure about programming, she has never tried it and she's not sure she can do it at all.

One of the obvious choices is graphical design, at least she's good with Photoshop so there's something to start with.

Are there any other options? She doesn't need much money, but the job should be something to be proud with. So it should be some area where she can progress and engage her intellect.

Update with clarification.

&gt;How much money does she need?

Honestly, if she makes $400 after 6 months of studying it will be awesome.

&gt;Why does she need an online job vs. an in-person job? Is there any particular reason why the job needs to be remote/online?

She wants to move to Vietnam. She doesn't speak Vietnamese, so local jobs are mostly inaccessible.

&gt;What is her educational background?

Political science bachelor.

&gt;What is her skill set? What has she done in the past, work/school-wise?

Apart from her education, she has fluent English (much better than mine), she has been volunteering on a snake observation station for a couple of months, she used to be a punk drummer (irrelevant, of course), she has basic PC user skills. She has also worked in a government organization in Thailand for a few months as an intern, mostly working with documents plus some translations from English to Thai. She can apply as a government official easily, but she doesn't want to work in Thailand.

&gt;Is she looking for something freelance, or ongoing?

It doesn't actually matter, it just has to be something to be proud of.

&gt;What computer skills does she have, and does she have some sort of portfolio that highlights them?

Basic user skills plus some Photoshop experience, nothing worth a portfolio. I'm considering buying her some graphic design courses."
4zsll4,0,2016-08-27,F4M Some scenes to choose from!,DPPAPPRP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4zsll4/f4m_some_scenes_to_choose_from/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

4zt07u,20,2016-08-27,Why am I not voting for Hillary?,average_user_421,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4zt07u/why_am_i_not_voting_for_hillary/,"All day long I hear media shills talking about her ""experience"". She's running ad's here in Georgia touting her ""steady leadership"" trying to paint Donald Trump as unstable and ineffective. 

Her experience is exactly why I would never consider voting for her. This is a woman who was kicked off the Watergate investigation for unethical and illegal behavior. She blew it, and then she popped up on the arm of Slick Willy in Arkansas where the Clinton regime is still regarded as the most corrupt time in that states history according to army buddies of mine as well as a cousin who grew up there. 

Her national platform experience began with her as first lady. She treated that unofficial title as an elected office and vastly overstepped her authority, which she had none, and several times called congress into session to push for Hillcare,  now known as Obamacare. Thankfully,  Newt was there to put her in her place. She got frustrated because she had no real power and retreated to the White House and assumed foreign policy control from Billy Boy, who was busy inserting cigars into interns pussies, and directed them from inside. This lead to prolonged genocides in Bosnia and Serbia,  where I was a buck private and placed under UN command, and in Rwanda. It also lead to ineffective and disastrous missions in Somalia, which you know of, as well as Iraq and Ethiopia, which you might not know of.

Why don't you know these things? Media collusion. I'm not sure if it's Soros, or someone more powerful, but the media has been protecting Hillary Clinton for 30 years. She is the most shielded political figure in the modern era, someone sold their soul to the devil to get this level of absurdity accomplished.  I spent most of the 90's outside the US and when I came back in 98 I was shocked at how clueless the American public was at what was going on in the world. 

The Clintons left the White House a shameful mess, stealing the furniture and art on their way out the door. She next popped up in NEW York City,  running for US Senate. A woman from PA (?) and the former First Lady of Arkansas  (?) now wanted to win an election of her very own.  And God Bless them the New York voters got fucked in that deal. Promises made, none kept, because this is what you have to understand about the Clintons : bill loves pussy and money while hillary loves pussy and power. On Top Of that   Until I see a paternity test done in an independent UK lab I will never believe Chelsea is bills kid. None of Bills other illegitimate kids look like her. 

My dates may be off, but I'm not sure Hillary served a full senate term. I could be wrong about the details or confusing her with Obama on this because this was when all my fucks were used up and I stopped giving a shit about the future of the United States. I started playing WoW the January before  Obama was elected and honestly cared more about Stormwind than Washington. (FOR THE ALLIANCE! ) Anyway, Hillary was using New York as a stepping stone to what she has always wanted, absolute power.

You know all to well the rest of this story. 

So, in Hillarys vast experience she has won one election (in a state where name recognition alone was enough to win). Every superior she ever had called her some variation of the word corrupt. She assumed powers that were not legally hers during Bills degenerate presidency.  To date no one can find a single instance of her keeping a promise made to anyone.  Her poor performance as a Senator and as Secretary of State Should Be Enough To disqualify her. I can't even figure out exactly where she was born, perhaps we need to request her birth certificate to prove she is actually a citizen. (Or at least that she was born and not created in some mad scientists lab) And for some unknown, as of yet, reason the media at large is hell bent on protecting her.

I guess I'm not voting for her because I'm racist."
4ztacb,3,2016-08-27,I hate my life,icebryanchan,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4ztacb/i_hate_my_life/,"I always feel the luck is not on my side. I always wanted to go (insert a country) because I really like the place and the culture there. I want to pursue my career there. 

But I am not rich enough to do so. And being a foreign worker is definitely not an easy way. I am graduating soon and my uni has this program that invites lots of companies from the country so that they can interview us and provide us the chance to work in their country. By chance, I mean really tiny little chance. Not to mention there are many stages of interview to pass through. (Since it's a free pass to go their country to work)

And I got this friend that is rich and wealthy. He had the chance to do his internship in the country at first, then he got a girlfriend from the country. After that, he went for the interview in the program and guess what, he got the chance to go the country now. 

It is not like I want to follow what he did because he is better than me. People always say ""don't envy others' life, live for yourself"". But that is my dream even before I know him. I feel really annoyed and upset when I know there is someone who can easily achieve my dream while I am facing lots and lots of obstacles. Somemore that is my friend. I don't know hoe to face him. 

Life is so unfair that dream remains dream and now I have to stuck at my own country seeing my Facebook full of his updates on the country. Got a good job in the country and having a girlfriend from that country too. That is the only dream of my life and I just sit there seeing people get the goal even without sweating. 

I feel like my life is somehow planned to torture me. He got the chance to know foreigners in uni while I am stuck with people I hate. He got the money to afford him to go to the country for internship while I can only work in a little local company. Now he got the luck to be selected in the job interview while I am still stuck in my own country wondering what company would accept me !!!

Guess I have to work underpaid in my own country, get an ordinary girl and get married, live an ordinary life and die an ordinary nameless useless guy.

Sorry for complaing much but I am really tired with my current life."
4zte4t,0,2016-08-27,40 M4f - Misogyny and Sadism (Extreme),jameswatson777,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/4zte4t/40_m4f_misogyny_and_sadism_extreme/,"My name is James and I am a proud misogynist and sadist. So I can get pretty dark and dirty; I'm certainly not going to be shy in abusing you.

[This is my kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/v5UKoBS.png) ; I enjoy degrading and abusing cunts, mother/daughter incest, snuff, fake tits, and being an Alpha Male. I believe that cunts have no rights.

Some scene ideas:

1. Job Interview. I am well known writer and despite my misogyny I received an option to be interviewed for a job at a Feminist magazine. You would play the managing editor, a powerful businesswoman (perhaps even a lesbian), and you are fully aware that I am a misogynist; but your magazine has seen declining sales and you honestly believe that my writing would increase sales. But you have to convince me to join, doing everything you can from increasing my salary, giving me your own office, to offering up your body and those of your very young daughters (ages to be discussed). You increasingly degrade yourself, your employees, underage interns and family until I am the editor and your magazine is no longer feminist.

2. Muscle Humiliation. You are a bodybuilder, with powerful muscles in your arms and thighs. You got large breast implants to continue to show off your feminity, but you are also proud of what you have achieved at the gym. No men ever approach you. Until I come in, an Alpha Male, and just start abusing you and calling you names, squeezing your breasts and suggesting a new gym outfit. You are thoroughly humiliated and come to agree to each of my demands happily, even when I start getting violent.

3. Girls School. You are the Principal of a girls school. The new school year is about to start but you are concerned that your school has been doing terrible in both grades and athletics. You decide that presenting a new image of the school will help, and decide that who better to determine that new image than the man who just moved into the house across the street from the school. You soon realise that this man has his own ideas of how a girls school should look and behave.

4. Fall of a Celebrity. A famous feminist, like Emma Watson or Daisy Ridley, reduced to being a fuckslut. Daisy Ridley could be using social media to promote the latest Star Wars film, gets degraded by a Star Wars nerd, and invites him to the set to prove him wrong. Instead she ends up being his cunt slave."
4ztgfp,2,2016-08-27,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4ztgfp/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want :)"
4ztv70,19,2016-08-27,The Hillary Clinton Story. PLEASE FACT-CHECK THIS,nor2030,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4ztv70/the_hillary_clinton_story_please_factcheck_this/,"Mrs. Clinton’s husband committed adultery in the Oval Office while he was President with an intern girl. He lied about it under oath and was forced to give up his law license forever. Mrs. Clinton would place him in charge of interns again, including young women in the Oval Office. Despite raping Juanita Broadrick multiple times, Mrs. Clinton’s husband has never apologized. He ordered missile strikes in Sudan to blow up an aspirin factory because he wanted to distract the American people from his scandal. Since leaving office, he has frequently and routinely received fees on the order of $500,000 over and over again for giving 20 minute speeches in front of bankers, financiers, foreign princes, and foreign governments who are interested in buying influence. Mr. Clinton continues to take in huge speaking fees at this very moment. Mrs. Clinton has never publicly criticized Mr. Clinton. 

Mrs. Clinton voted for the border wall in the Senate, and now is opposed to it. She now claims that only racists support the wall. She voted for the Iraq war, and now says she would have opposed it. Her husband, the President, chose her to be the unofficial health care policy czar. After she got nowhere, he had to fire her. The health care crisis was not fixed. Now she wants to get the government more involved in health care.

When her husband ran for President, she was in favor of protecting gun rights, along with him. Now she is for taking away Americans’ right to protect their families from crime. 

She has few consistent stances. Mrs. Clinton has always been in favor of unlimited abortions on demand paid for by the government. She has always been for unlimited immigration flowing into the country unchecked by law. She has always been in favor of big trade deals that benefit the rich and well-connected.
							
In education, Mrs. Clinton plans to continue and expand the national program of indoctrinating American kids with Islamic values. This program is funded by Islamic governments like Saudi Arabia. The Clinton Foundation has helped push this program. It is time to shine light on these facts so the American people can understand. Radical foreign Islamic powers have paid for and pushed Common Core. The main goal of Common Core is teaching American kids to accept the supremacy of Islam and Muslims. Mrs. Clinton is a proud supporter. Common Core has touched the lives of American kids from coast to coast, who are taught the glory of Islam in government schools.

When she was Secretary of State, she and her husband received hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign donations to their Clinton Foundation, and then paid that back by giving Russia control over American uranium, releasing the founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, and helping him create the terrorist ISIS that beheads gays and sexually enslaves women. Yes, they actually do that. She tried to get ISIS to fight Syria, a country whose government she decided to change. The Syrian government survived, and ISIS went on to commit a historically significant series of human rights violations. When her people in the Department of State–the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya--was attacked by Islamic radicals, she did nothing to send help because she saw the Islamic radicals as her allies. 

Syria and Iran have been allies for many years. With Hillary’s goal of regime change in Syria, she decided to help Iran become a nuclear power. When the people of Iran rose in the streets against their terrorist regime, Hillary said nothing to support them. The peaceful uprising was brutally suppressed. Hillary said nothing. All along she was secretly negotiating with terrorists. The secret negotiations with Iran were capped off by a US plane taking hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign cash to Iran. Hillary never criticized the shipment of cash. No one in the government has given any accounting of what happened to the cash, or who might have taken a stack of bills along the way. If toppling Syria was important, it didn’t work, and Hillary helped Syria’s ally, Iran grow in power. Hillary did help create ISIS, which is as evil as the Ku Klux Klan or the Nazis. 

When Hillary first became Secretary of State, she approached Russian leader Vladimir Putin and gave him a reset button. The peace offering was intended to create better relations between the US and Russia. Whatever was intended, at this point, relations between the US and Russia are the worst they have been since the Cold War.

Mrs. Clinton did not succeed in health care policy as First Lady. After her husband left office, they quickly moved to New York, where a Senate seat was opening up. She had no chance of winning a Senate seat anywhere else. She won the election only because she had a famous name, because she was married to a former President. The only thing people remember from her time as Senator was that she voted for the Iraq war. 

Hillary was made Secretary of State only because her husband was a former President. Her first decision as Secretary of State was to take all of the sensitive and classified discussions she was having and move them to an unsecure e-mail server in the basement of her home. China, Russia, and Iran were easily able to hack the server. They read all her e-mails, which were filled with top secret information. American foreign policy has been a failure ever since. Hillary believes that she did a great job as Secretary of State. 

By moving her e-mail to her private server, Hillary was able to pretend that she was making her official e-mail transparent as the law requires. Yet, in fact she was going around the law. The reason she went around the law was so that she could trade favors as Secretary of State for millions of dollars in donations to her Foundation.

There is only one reason why she was nominated to run for President. Because she is married to a former President. She claims to be a pioneer for women, but in fact she only got where is because of who she married, not anything she did."
4ztva0,1,2016-08-27,I've seen this question everywhere and still can't find an answer: where do I even begin?,EmiliciousDebugin,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4ztva0/ive_seen_this_question_everywhere_and_still_cant/,"I have zero knowledge of any coding language or programing. All I know is that I found a passion for it recently when I learned how to root phones. When I learned initially it was neat, but then I became fascinated with that hidden playground of documents full of, what looked like, random text that made the magic happen. And I knew I wanted to be a part of that.

I don't want to do android work though, that is about as specific as I can get with a chosen path right now (for some reason, and I could be/ probably am wrong, when I think of software development work for android I don't see much opportunity - I'd like to stick to PC work).

My aunt said that I need to stick my nose in a book 24/7 for a month and learn Ruby and Python and within a month I should be able to have some form of work (if I learned well enough), even if it's just intern work.

I'm looking for the fastest way to get into work of any sort that will then continue furthering my knowledge and opening up more opportunities for larger companies.

I've been told self-taught is the way to go if you're motivated enough...because during that you can start buidling a portfolio faster, and that you can be more hands on in the learning process.

Is self-taught the way to go? Is my aunts advice sound? Would some form of schooling be reccommended? I live in Portland, Oregon...if I am going to do schooling I'd rather it be in person than online (unless there's this unfathomably amazing online program that is a MUST).

I am sick of min wage jobs, I am sick of feeling like nothing is getting accomplished, and I am sick of scraping by. I want to be a part of something huge...and I love technology, always have. I am smart enough to pick up on things quick. I just really need someone with an answer that looks like ""you need to start here, work your way to this, and then find work in these areas"".

A lot of answers I see to this question is ""it's all dependant on the individual"" which is a sweet thought and all, but I do better when I am given one direction I can work off of. And then once I've got my bearings in the work I have something to work off of in exploring new paths.

So basically, if I am as dedicated as I am making myself out to be...how soon can I get a job (any job), and what do I need to do to get there?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

EDIT: So my aunts wild declirations of being able to self teach a very involved languages of coding within a month AND land a job have been proven to be, what I had originially thought, too good to be true.......still though.......there was that hope

Anyway , I suppose I am seeing why it's a far more difficult answer than ""start here, work towards this, and you should have a basic foundation to go into most areas""

Regardless of all this new headway, I am actually far more pumped to start this journey. The idea of putting more time into it is exciting. Due to personal life events, funds are going to limit me to (what feels like) resorting to self teaching at first. These bootcamps sound like they could be incredibly helpful though. 

However, I did save all the resources all of you have provided me thus far...and I really appreciate it! Thank you very much :D

EDIT: apologies if this post made any software developer, software engineer, or any other team member (who's position title I don't know yet) like their work was being belittled by this thought of being able to go from no knowledge in the field to landing a job in a month's time. Or my skewed thoughts of thinking web development may have been ""lower"" on the totem pole in terms of career options. It only further explemlified just how much I'm not realizing I'm about to embark on, and how young, unrealizing, and ignorant I made myself look. And I'm even more grateful for making this post and everyone being chill enough to gently put me in my place without cutting me down. Thank you 😁"

4zu7al,28,2016-08-27,Smade the aftermath - rated M fanfiction,littlemama95,Smaude,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smaude/comments/4zu7al/smade_the_aftermath_rated_m_fanfiction/,"A/N: I wrote this after I saw the 1 million subscribers live stream! That kiss gave me great inspiration ;)

Just note that I haven't written in over 5 years! So please be nice :)

Smaude the aftermath

""That was 1 million subscribers, thankyou guys so much for watching-""

'Oh god I kissed sam' I thought to myself, happy, sad and scared all at the same time.

'Oh god. Oh god. What have I done?!' I panicked 'What if this changes everything?!'

The kiss wasn't amazing, but how can you be when your first kiss is in front of more than 11,000 people! He did pull away from me though, which made my heart sink, like the titanic, and I stupidly went in for another kiss. He probably didn't even want to kiss me and just felt forced so we could get the 1,000,000 subscribers. I'm such a dumb ass.

""And we're offline! Great job everyone!"" The producer exclaimed at us, I could see everyone beaming with pride.

Dani came over and started handing everyone more champagne.

'Just what I need right now' I thought to myself 'more alcohol'

I downed the champagne in one gulp, as everyone started jumping up and down around Sam singing 'Sam is my friend' with Steve on his red piano guitar.

I felt stupid. I didn't want to be around him at that second, let alone be singing a song about him being just my friend... Talk about a kick in the teeth.

I couldnt take anymore and made my way toward the door to the stairs.

""Maude!"" I heard him call out to me.

But i was in no mood to get rejected, I just need to be alone and think, so I pretend I couldn't hear him and made my way through the door. As I made my way up the echoey stairs I could feel tears run down my face, burning my skin, I wiped them away on my arm, wiping off more of my lipstick that already had been ruined by Sam.

I clambered up the metal stairs of the fire escape and on to the roof. My thinking spot.

Sam's POV

""Sam is my friend, Sam is my friend-""

'I love this song' I thought happily to myself, dancing and jumping about like the drunken mess I was.

As I danced I couldn't shake that kiss out of my head. I had been wanting to do that for a very long time, I can't believe she actually suggested kissing me in the first place! But she probably thought that I didn't want to kiss her, and to be honest I was hesitant. I didn't want our first kiss to be in front of all our work colleagues and over 11,000 of our fans! But I didn't want her to think I didn't want to kiss her at all, so I agreed and for a second I lost myself in that amazing kiss and everyone in the whole world disappered; then I felt her tounge slip into my mouth which aroused me all the more; but I heard the laughter of one of the crew and someone yell ""oh wow!"" And like the awkward potato I am, I broke the kiss and laughed, which probably looked bad.

'I have to talk to her about this' I thought to myself as I searched around the room for her.

She wasn't in the group of drunk dancing people singing about me and chicken sandwiches. Where was she?

Suddenly I spotted her heading to the door to the stairs.

'She's wasn't going to leave without saying goodbye was she?' I panicked, trying to get out of the crowd so I could reach her before she left.

""Maude!"" I yelled out to her, she stopped for a second, but didn't turn around. She must of heard me.

I was nearly out of the crowd when a hand grabbed my shoulder.

""Sam! My friend! Where are you going?!"" Steve asked me loudly trying to talk to me over the loud music and taking.

""I just need some air"" I replied not talking my eyes off her so I could see if she went to or downstairs.

""I have plenty of air for you right here buddy!"" He exclaimed as he blew his burrito and coke breath in my face.

At that moment I saw her run up the stairs. I knew exactly where she was going.

Maude POV

""Gooo tooo schoool!"" i could hear everyone singing from downstairs.

I chuckled to myself as I remembered when Joe had stopped dancing halfway through the song and stared dead into the camera repeating 'go to school' sturnly and we joined in getting closer and closer to the camera. They always knew how to make me laugh, i'm so sad I have to leave them... I wish I didn't have to.

It was chilly up on the roof, the wind bit at my cheeks and made the marks where my tears were sting even more. But this is where I always came to think.

Suddenly I felt slightly warmer and something fall around my shoulders.

""I thought I'd find you up here"" a deep husky voice said.

I turned around to face the voice, it was him. He stared down at me with his beautiful hazel eyes, my heart skipped a beat.

""What are you doing up here?"" I asked him in a jokey voice trying to sound as friendly as possible

""It's cold up here, why don't we go back downstairs and talk?"" He replied completely ignoring my question whilst sweeping his brown locks back, that the wind was blowing, which made him look even more handsome, especially in that suit.

""There's nothing to talk about!"" I lied, smiling at him.

""Don't lie to me Maude"" he told me sturnly, crouching down to my level, now I had a better view of those amazing eyes. 'Dammit.

""The kiss was just for audience! So don't worry, it's not like I've fallen in love with you or anything!"" I lied to him.

""Let's just go back downstairs"" I said getting up and making my way back to the fire exit. I didn't want to be alone with him right now.

Sam's POV

""-Its not like I've fallen in love with you-""

Ouch. Why did those words hurt so much?

""Let's just go back downstairs"" she told me, getting up from where she was sat and making her way over to the door to the stairs.

I wasnt about to let this go, we needed to talk about this, I needed to show her it ment something to me.

I got up and ran after her, grabbing her hand just before she reached the door handle.

""Sam?"" She pondered, looking up at me with her gorgeous jewel coloured eyes, they made my heart skip a beat...

""I -I err..."" I stuttered, thrown off by how unbelievablely beautiful she looked that night

""You sure you're okay?"" I asked

'Dammit that's not what I wanted to say!' I cursed myself, I'm such a pussy.

""Yes Sam, I'm fine, let's just go downstairs please..."" She sighed, slipping her hand out of mine and climbing down the fire escape ladder.

Maude POV

We both went down the stairs in silence. It was so awkward, I wanted to talk to him and tell him how I felt about him, but it was so painfully obvious he just wanted to be friends that I said nothing. As long as I have his friendship, that's good enough for me...

The party lasted till 6am. Everyone was drunk, except Steve, who doesn't drink, but he might as well have been, cause he was acting like it. Most of the night I was dancing with some intern, trying to make Sam jealous, im not sure if it worked but I definitely knew he was watching me.

As I left I said goodbye to the intern first, with a kiss on the cheek for extra measure, and then went and said goodbye to everyone else, everyone else that is, except for Sam; not on purpose, I just couldn't find him. So I left.. it's not like I'm never going to see him again he promised to come on GeekBomb and read dirty fanfiction with me once I hit 5k subscribers!

Sam's POV

I wish I had said something.

Why didn't I say something?!

Now I have to watch her dancing with this intern. Well I don't have to watch, to be honest I don't want to... But I can't take my eyes off her.

I watched her say goodbye to him and kiss him on the cheek. That was it, I had to get out of there, so I went around the room as she was saying goodbye and left.

'If she's going around kissing other guys after we kissed then our kiss obviously ment nothing to her!' I raged and walked down to where the taxi was waiting for me , got in and slammed the door.

The next morning I awoke with a pounding headache, I go take some pills to stop the pain and wash my face to wake me up.

Then I checked my phone... Plasted all over social media was mine and maudes kiss with the hashtag 'Smaude' our ship name.

'well that ship sailed and sank' I thought bitterly

My phone then started vibrating in my hand, it was Maude texting me.

'Hey bunny!' it read 'Sorry I didn't get to say goodbye to you last night! I couldn't find you :('

'I just hit 50k so you know what that means!'

I had forgotten I had promised to do that... Shit.

'I have to go, I made her s promise...'

Maude POV

'I sent it' I stated to myself, heart beating a million times a minute and butterflies fluttering wildly inside my belly

'God, fuck I hope he replies...'

My head wasn't so bad this morning as I managed to drink a litre of water before bed, thank God even drunk maude has some sense.

My phone buzzed.

I stared at it. I didn't want to look.. what if he said no?

I shakily grabbed my phone and reluctantly opened the message.

'Of course, what about later today? X' it read

'He sent me a kiss...Wait, later today?!' I panicked, I wasnt prepared, I mean some fans had chosen the fanfiction and those were ready, but mentily I wasn't ready!

I had to do this, I had to do it not only for our friendship but for our fans too!

I reluctantly picked up the phone and began to text back

Sam POV

I sent her a kiss...

Why did I do that?! She'll probably think I'm weird and take it the wrong way!

My phone lit up suddenly, Maude had replied.

'Today sounds great! I have some great fan fiction for you to read Sammy ;) x'

'She sent me one back... And a winkey face...' I gluped and suddenly grew very aroused.

'I think I'll have to go on the laptop before I leave..' I thought ever aware of my growing arousal, and opened up my laptop. 'Just a quick one, to calm the nerves'

Maude POV

'See you in about an hour then x'

'An hour?! Fuck!' I thought, I had to get ready and quick.

I prepared my studio with all the correct lighting and cameras, no help today. My normal camera man was on vacation. It was just me and Sam... Which made it all the more awkward.

An hour passed and I sat nervously in front of the tv, biting my lip and shuffling my feet.

Suddenly the door bell went. Fuck.

I patted myself and and puffed up my hair.

'God I bet he looks good, and I'm standing here looking like a wind swept potato' I thought as I slowly opened the door and hesitantly peered around it.

""Hey"" his deep voice made his way to my ears and caused those butterflies to go crazy again. Damn butterflies.

""Hi bunny!""

Sam POV

""Hi bunny!"" She called back to me.

God she looked beautiful.

""Are you gonna come in or just stand there?"" She asked jokingly, beckoning me inside.

""Yes, sorry""

As I made my way through Maude's house, I noticed her many geeky things and art she had collected, from star wars to dungeons and dragons. She was such a nerd, which made her so much more attractive...

""Here we are! This is my studio!"" She announced happily displaying her long arms outwide.

""Very nice"" I complimented, trying to be as not awkward as possible.

""Here's your Fanfiction, your reading the ones highlighted in red"" she told me with an evil smile on her face

""I don't like that look, it better not be too dirty..."" I told her, I did not want to get an obvious boner in front of her.

""Would I do that to you?"" She winked, and I growled involuntarily.

""Did you just growl at me?"" She questioned, raising an eyebrow at me

""No..."" I lied

""I'm pretty sure you just did""

""No I didn't, youre hearing things, lets just get on with this!"" I exclaimed trying to hide my obvious blush

Maude POV

'Im pretty sure he growled at me' I frowned at myself, but I didn't want to press it as he looked annoyed about it, so I turned on the camera and we began to read the stories.

The first one was about a threesome between Sam, Whitney and I, which happened during D&amp;D in the gothel. That one was quite smutty, I quite enjoyed mine and Sam's parts, not so much when Whitney got involved. Not that I minded mine and Whitney's parts, that was quite fun too..

The second one was just another tame one about sam giving me a peck after work. Boring.

But the 3rd one was very detailed, someone had taken the time to write out what they think happened after the kiss... Most of it was wrong because it said we had sex in Phil's office...

But then as we kept reading and got to the cute bit at the end, I could see him looking straight at me.

""I ran to the train station, I needed to stop her from leaving"" Sam read ""I can see her! I ran as fast I could to catch up with her and before she got on the train, I pulled her into my arms""

""Sam!"" I read ""what are you doing here? Arnt you ment to be at the new premiere of the flash trailer?!""

""I couldnt go... I had to tell you something before I go!"" He read over dramatically

""What's that Sam?""

He turned and looked at me straight in the eyes, and while stepping toward me he said softly:

""I love you""

I didn't even look at the paper I just replied ""I love you too""

We stood for a moment, staring into each others eyes, not saying a word, I could hear him breathing, heavily. I wish I knew what he was thinking...

Sam POV

""I love you""

'i said it, she said it back... I don't think that was in the script... I don't know... Neither of us have looked at it'

We were still staring at each other, I quickly glanced at her body, god it was beautiful, I think she noticed because she raised her eyebrow at me.

""Fuck it"" I said aloud, grabbed her face and kissed her.

Maude POV

He took his eyes off mine for a second and glanced down at my body.

'Did he just...?' I questioned in my head, raising an eyebrow

""Fuck it""

Suddenly I was attacked by a pair of warm lips on mine.

'Now this couldnt possibly be Sam... Sam wouldn't do this' I said to myself and slightly opened one eye.

Fuck. It was him.

A murderous swarm of butterflies plagued my stomach. Shit.

This time he made the first move, he pulled me closer and explored my mouth with his tounge, kissing me slowly and passionately, nothing like our first kiss, no one to interupt us...

I felt his hands travel down my body, feeling up and down my slim waist line, then another grabbed my boob and I slightly giggled into the kiss.

""Shut up"" he breathed and kissed me harder, pulling my dress up with the hand that was stroking up and down my waist.

He moved his hand up and down my thigh teasingly.

'Two can play at this game' I thought as I removed a hand from behind his neck and began to stroke his surprisingly large erection through his jeans.

He growled in response.

""I knew you growled at me earlier Sam basher"" I teased

""You really are a know it all"" he replied breathlessly whilst kissing my neck.

Sam then lifted the hem of my panties down with his finger and teased my clit with his long fingers, I moaned in response at his touch and he moaned at mine as I slid my hand into his boxers (which were the flash, obviously) and ran a finger along his length.

He began unbuckling his trousers with his other free hand, pulling them off clumsily, I giggled involuntarily. He shot me a look after he had taken both his jeans and boxers off; I was barley able to get a look at his naked body when he attacked me with his lips again, kissing me hard, holding my head in place with his hands. As he brought his body closer I felt his erection on my thigh.

""Shit"" I whispered

He broke a way for a second and looked at me with his caramel eyes.

""We don't have to do this, if you're not ready""

""I -I am ready"" I stuttered, I was just scared I would do something wrong. I wanted this so bad.

""Okay"" he confirmed and kissed me more roughly and needy than before and pushed me over to the nearest wall.

He began slowly slide my knickers off when-

""Bark bark!"" Zelda barked up at Sam.

""Zelda! Naughty! Leave Sam alone!"" I yelled at her, trying to shoo her away with my foot

""She clearly doesn't like me"" Sam sniggered as Zelda tried to nip his ankles

""Fucking cock block"" i sneered jokingly at her, my puppy looking up at me, as if she had just saved me from some terrible fate.

Sam began putting on his clothes as I put Zelda away in a different room.

""You don't have to do that"" I told him, looking sadly at his newly clothed self.

""We will do this properly, once Ive taken you for a real date"" he smiled 
""besides the camera was still recording"" he winked walking past me nonchalantly.

""What?!""

He grinned evilly at me ""You can send me that later""

""No way""

He suddenly grabbed me by my waist and pulled me close again.

""I ment what I said earlier"" he told me, looking straight into my eyes

""So did I"" I told him looking straight back into his.

The end.

Help!",yuppiepuppie,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4zu986/got_my_first_programming_job_3_weeks_ago_now_they/,"Hello all, and thank you for all the past help you have provided. It certainly helped to land me this job (actually more of an internship).

Anyways, in short, here is the situation Im in:

* Got a job 3 weeks ago at a start-up in a language I had no idea how to use, JavaScript/TypeScript. 
* They put me in a role developing their mobile app, Angular2/Ionic2 Frameworks.
* For the past three weeks, I have been plugging away for &gt;10hrs/day getting down the basics. 
* They threw a tough problem at me first, I guess to see if I could sink or swim. They were surprised when I said that I had pretty much finished it this past week. So I asked what I could start working/thinking about next. 

The CTO told me that he wants a feature of the app to be a task manager for the company, connecting the bosses on desktops sending tasks to the employees on mobile. He wants me to design it and produce it from the ground up.

I have no idea where to even start.  
I began looking at other task managing apps and I liked some features which I want to incorporate. But other than that, should I sit down at a piece of paper and sketch this thing out? Should I just start plugging away at code? Should I start with the desktop app first or the mobile? Should I think about my DB structure first? 

How do you go about developing an architecture/layout/design? 

Even though they are not paying me even minimum wage, I still want this to be the best it can.  I cant wait to begin, I just have no idea WHERE to begin. "
4zubiy,80,2016-08-27,De-Programming Yourself Part I,bruh_my_jays,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4zubiy/deprogramming_yourself_part_i/,"**Introduction**

This post is in response to, and expanding upon, a post made earlier by /u/MrNatemare entitled ""Recognize that your beta behavior may come from a domineering mother."" If you haven't read it yet, I suggest doing it because it does some work to lay the foreground for this post.

This is the first of a series of posts, so be sure to check back tomorrow for the the next entry.

The main focus of this post is about a concept called ""de-programming"" one's self. In essence, this concept is about disregarding past experiences, and using one's sensory capabilities to interact with reality while simultaneously overriding previously programmed responses.

*****

**Neuro-Linguistic Programming**

The foundation of ""de-programming"" or ""unplugging"" as it were, is a practice called Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). NLP studies the relationship between an individual's cognition (neuro), their behavior (linguistic), and their experiences (programming). While the understanding of this relationship is far from complete, there is enough knowledge in the field available to practice NLP with a fair degree of certainty. An individual can find what ""works for them"" from NLP, and apply it to their self in order to yield a desired personal change.

To illustrate NLP and its various applications, here is a hypothetical example:

Imagine there is a eighteen year old male named Jimmy. Jimmy has just begun his first year of university and is very enthusiastic about having a stellar university career. He dreams of making a lot of sweet friends, having copious amounts of sex with beautiful young women, getting perfect grades and exclusive internships, and ultimately landing a sweet career after he graduates. Nice.

Now let's fast-forward four years to Jimmy's graduation ceremo--what? Jimmy dropped out of college?! 

Enter twenty-three year old Jimmy, working at LardBurger. He has an ugly, domineering pregnant girlfriend, a serious addiction to marijuana, no friends except his League of Legends clan and his drug dealer/manager at LardBurger named Rocco, and he lives in a shitty part of town. But worst of all, he blames everybody but himself for the position he is in...It's his girlfriend's fault for being pregnant, it's Rocco's fault he has a shitty job and a drug addiction, it's so-and-so's fault he dropped out of college.

How the fuck did this happen?

This happened because Jimmy was programmed throughout the earlier stages of his life, via experiences, to *think* and *behave* with low-self esteem and submissive tendencies. Because he never *experienced* the benefits of high self-esteem and assertiveness--and lacked the self-awareness to initiate personal change manually--he did not know how to actually pursue the life he once dreamed of. Jimmy did not properly ""de-program"" himself, and he therefore carried his negative experiences through life, which thus resonated through his cognition and his behavior.

What could Jimmy have done differently?

This is the hard part. Jimmy needed to ""de-program"" himself in order to redefine his neuro-linguistic patterns. This, in essence, means coming to terms with past experiences by self-reflecting and letting go of emotional baggage, and focusing on developing new experiences that will create positive neuro-linguistic patterns in the future. On no uncertain terms, it is a two-step operation:

**1. Disassociate current cognitive and behavioral patterns from past experiences.**

**2. Seek new experiences that will help inculcate the new, desired cognitive and behavioral patterns.**

*****

**Conclusion**

The two steps could be summarized as: stop making excuses, and get your shit together.

**This is all I have time for today, so be sure to check back tomorrow** so you can read Part II, where I'll provide an in-depth explanation of the first step, as well as some basic techniques and resources for success.

Also, look out for Bandler and Grinder's *Frogs into Princes: Neuro-Linguistic Programming* which provides a solid knowledge-base for NLP and de-programming; and Hawkins' *Letting Go: The Pathway to Surrender* which provides techniques for letting go of old emotional baggage (very helpful for de-programming!!)

Thanks for reading, and look out for Part II tomorrow!

I've never had a reason to quit other than the well known fact that it's not a good idea to smoke. Allen Carr helped me reach 3 months at the beginning of the year (I was busy with my internship and didn't have time to think about smoking, these days I'm just at home studying), but I let temptation get the better of me after seeing a pack of my relatives' cigarettes laying around during a family dinner (they were making a big deal out of not smoking near me that night too, oh well). 

These past 3 weeks were not with waste though, at least I hope so, because I've noticed how I let the addiction take over my actions. I've got a huge exam coming up in 3 months and I'd like the health benefits to give me a boost in both the studying and the exam in the coming months, so I'd really like to have my body start recovering asap. 

I'm generally a laid back guy, so there's no fire or emotions of inspiration that I can ride for the first few days. When I relapse, it's when I decide after waking up and think ""Ehhh, I'll smoke today"". This time I want to try being a little more active and involved, at least for the first 3 days, hence the post. This way I can wake up tomorrow to my stopsmoking comrades instead of a walk to the convenience store : ).

4zupdi,1,2016-08-27,Non-traditional student finishing university and considering starting loans this Spring. Also need help with retirement account rollovers,chudbrochil,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4zupdi/nontraditional_student_finishing_university_and/,"Hello all,

I am a non-traditional student (Junior at university in Computer Science at 28) and have so far been able to get through without student loans. As my studies get more and more difficult I am finding that I more than likely need to participate in this student loan nonsense. Here are some financial details about me first:

28, low COL area  
year-round technical intern at relatively high hourly rate at research lab (Only able to work 10-15hrs/week during school)  
1200$ in a ""rollover ira"", it appears that this is not setup into investments via Fidelity  
500$ in a 457b account that is getting good returns  
very high credit score: Credit Karma says 810  
no cash on hand (no savings aside from retirement accounts)  
20k revolving credit, no balances  
10k credit account has 14% APR (generous cashback, so I use this for daily purchases)  
6k car loan at 2%  


Current budget for this fall semester has me losing approximately 400$/mo at 15hrs/week working. This is okay because I will only be in the hole ~1500 by the end of the semester and should be able to recoup this deficit while working over the winter break. My problem comes in that I will be accumulating debt in the future semesters and I want to avoid paying the 14% APR on my credit card if I can instead opt for student loans.

Is it in my best interest to withdraw from my retirement accounts that I have sitting? This isn't much $, but it could possibly be enough to keep me alive for a semester while I run a deficit. Perhaps I'm better off rolling one over into the other? Additionally, if I were to take out student loans what is my best option and deal regarding this? I have excellent credit and would like to avoid being a foolish college student and taking the first bank that offers me money. Private loans? Fed loans? what % should I be able to get?

Thank you everyone for your advice and help and I'm willing to answer any additional questions about my financial situation."

4zut5p,11,2016-08-27,Managing diabetes in the hospital setting,DamnYellowKnight,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/4zut5p/managing_diabetes_in_the_hospital_setting/,"Hi guys. I'm a new intern in internal medicine, currently on my night float rotation and have been getting a lot of calls about blood sugars on the wards, and asked to make certain management decisions on it. I usually ask my senior if I'm unsure, but I'd like to work out a good way to reason through these situations so I can make these calls more confidently on my own and bug them less often.

(1) So on night float, patients are often NPO at midnight for a minor procedure in the morning such as stress tests, TEEs etc. Nurses will often call me, noticing the patient has a large QHS glargine dose and ask whether to give it, give less of it, or place the patient on D5.

I've looked online for any sort of guidelines and can't seem to find anything clear and concrete about cutting the night time glargine. Some places say you leave it alone, while others seem to say you halve it, others are saying you only reduce it to 70-80%.

Is there a concrete, evidence-based consensus I can refer to? 

At least two of my residents have badgered me about halving it the night before, but one of my co-interns was recently yelled at by her attending for doing so. She was told that one should never touch the glargine dose. I understand the reasoning for that, since glargine is the basal dosing and theoretically, if it is dosed well, you should only have to hold pre-meal aspart on the day of the procedure, and the night time glargine should be left alone. However, people seem to do different things and I'm unsure of the best call to make. Is there anything I can lean on help me make a decision and support it?

Some of the nurses are also consistently asking me to place the patient on D5 1/2 NS on night float for patients NPO for a procedure the next day. My immediate concern is that this would simply provoke hyperglycemia. Considering from midnight until procedure, the most they will miss is one meal or two during the day of the procedure, it makes most sense to me intuitively that I'd just hold the pre-meal asparts. Is it common practice to put NPO-at-midnight patients on D5?


(2) I got called one morning about a patient who was due for a pre-meal aspart, however his blood sugar was 128. The patient had not eaten yet. My initial thought is that if the patient was going to eat, with that blood sugar it should be totally fine to administer the aspart. My resident at the time advised I hold it, however. The timing of the call was also strange, since it was at 7 am, yet breakfast would probably not be for another hour or two (per the same nurse)...which makes me wonder if they're timing it right. Naturally, nurses are busy, especially in the morning, and perfect timing is not realistic, but my understanding is you should administer pre-meal aspart 0-15 minutes before meals or immediately after.
So my question is, when do you hold the pre-meal aspart in the person who is about to eat? If it is common practice to give the pre-meal aspart so way in advance of the meals, what do I tell the nurses?


(3) I get called a lot about high blood sugars in the middle of the night. The other night I got called for a blood sugar of 340. I usually just give them the equivalent dosing I'd give off the sliding scale as a stat dose at that point. However, is that the right decision? Should I be giving anything at all? What are your threshold for these calls and what do you do?

4zuur4,2,2016-08-27,"Feeling suicidal, my SO cheated on me, in a new city struggling",MargaritaSoda,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4zuur4/feeling_suicidal_my_so_cheated_on_me_in_a_new/,"I've been having a rough time these past few months and just need some support.  This is my first post on this subreddit, and it's also going to be long so I'm very sorry. But I just **need** to talk about this.

See, I've dealt with severe suicidal thoughts for a few ~~months~~ years but I've never actually gone through with it because I have an internship for an amazing company that started this month. I wanted to at least say I got to do the internship before I killed myself. Because if I liked the job, if I got out of town, maybe I would feel better?  Well, not only am I having a hard time adjusting to my new town and job, but I found out my boyfriend of 4 years cheated on me... Specifically, with a girl who has herpes.  Yikes.

What really burns me up is that I would've thought out of anyone in this world, he would've understood how much cheating hurts. When we first met, I was in a relationship with someone else. This other guy was nice, intelligent, hard working, but we weren't compatible in terms of romance. I've had a strained relationship with my family my whole life, so when they were happy with the guy I was dating I stuck with him. I also thought, ""Oh, I'll never find better, I may as well stay."" But then I meet my SO, and oh boy did I fall fast. I knew I had to break up with other guy. But my family threatened to kick me out if I broke up with him. They said that other guy was ""the best thing that ever happened"" to me and that I would be ""making a grave mistake to leave him."" I eventually even told my mother, ""I think if I don't break up with him I'm going to cheat on him with someone at my university."" Her answer? ""What happens in school *can* stay in school if you're smart."" So, being a dumb 18 year old, feeling depressed and trapped by my family, I cheated. It lasted for a while. Eventually both of them found out about it. I broke up with other guy and told SO I wanted to stay with him.  SO forgave me because he understood what a shitty situation I was in and he'd forgive me if we set up some boundaries.  Which we did.  And for the next 3 years, we had an amazing relationship. Sex was good (maybe not great but good), we got along and had fun, we had common goals, and this internship, he *knew* I would only be gone ~5 months then I would be home.  He talked about moving in and proposing after I graduated from school in about a year.  Also, my SO had someone cheat on him in the past, so I really thought that he understood how awful cheating was.

When I found out he cheated, I tried to make it work. I offered to forgive and forget, to have an open relationship, to try anything. Because I was trying to be understanding - I cheated before so I understand how difficult it is.  I also wanted to find out - was it just sex? Or is he pursuing a different romantic relationship behind my back? I still don't quite have an answer to that, but he declined and broke up with me. I know he cheated on me with me for a girl who works at the grocery store with him.  When I asked him why, he said a few reasons:

* He admitted that this was the only serious relationship he has had and he wants to see what else is out there.
 
* He said that my anxiety, depression, and issues with my family are too much to deal with.

* He said that he felt he had to suppress his emotions in our relationship.

While the first reason breaks my heart, I'm not judging for that one. But the second one - he knew **from the moment he started dating me** that I had issues with all those things.  He knew what he was signing up for. It's not like I suddenly dropped a bomb on him of, ""hey, I want to die."" That's just a constant state for me at this point.  So I don't know why he's suddenly acting like that's an issue.  And I never asked him to suppress his emotions.  He claimed he did to not upset me, but I never asked him to. Sure, there may be a time and a place to talk about certain things, but I never said ""ignore these problems for me!""


I don't know if this is some twisted karma that God is giving me, like he's cursing me for cheating on my SO in the past so he's letting me see how it really feels.  But I can't take it anymore.  I didn't really have anyone besides my SO.  My family has very ""conditional"" love - they'll only love me if I'm a registered Republican, Christian, straight, and dating specifically a white guy.  Any of those conditions broken, and I'm cut off from the family.  I have a few friends back at home, but I don't really feel like they'll miss me. I think they just stick around me because I'm sometimes funny, but not much else.  I've tried making friends at my new workplace and it's going *meh.*  I feel like I'm wasting my family's money because I'm going to school for a major they wanted me to do, I'm doing awful in, and I know I'm not going to get a job.  

When I was with my SO, I thought ""Okay, I have no idea what I'm doing with my life but neither does he. We can conquer the world together, though. We can figure out together."" In reality, I don't want money, a fancy house or car, or really anything materialistic.  I just wanted to have a family of my own.  I wanted to be able to raise my own kids and have a good relationship with them.  I wanted a loving husband or wife (I'm bisexual but fam doesn't know).  I wanted to go to school to be a teacher, but my family forced me to switch majors to please them.  So whenever my SO seriously started talking about proposing and moving in together last year, I was ecstatic - my dreams were so close to coming true! I knew I couldn't (and wouldn't) have a family for a long time because we needed money to do that.  But I would begin living my life with someone I love.  And now, that's all come to shambles.  I have literally nothing.

I've enjoyed my time at this internship. I enjoy my work. My coworkers are nice(ish).  But I regret coming here so much.  If I didn't come here, my SO and I would still be together.  If I didn't come here, I wouldn't have had to move in with my family this summer and I wouldn't have had so many conflicts with them, which would've meant not as much stress in my life.  If I didn't come here, I could be at home having a glass of wine with my best friends playing Mario Kart of Cards Against Humanities trash talking all the shitty people that live in the American South.  But now all of that is gone.  My friends still talk to me while I'm here, but they've begun to push me away - after all, we're seniors so they are moving away soon.  

I literally don't see a single reason to live, besides to stay with this company and work more, but I'm not even sure that's a good reason.  I just don't feel as if I have any control of my life any more, any direction to go in, or really anything. I feel like I have literally nothing and that dying is just better than staying here.

I know my family *may* miss me, friends will too.  But it'll be better for them. My family wouldn't spend money on a fuck up of school. My friends can meet cooler people.  Everyone will be happier with me gone."

I still have a ""pre-med"" mentality, where I'm willing to take any volunteer experience, job opportunities, and internships relative to the field. Currently I do volunteer to teach children how to code, work in CS position at my university and intern in IT, however I've been told that those positions will be completely irrelevant when applying to my first job after graduating. 

I know that if I dropped all these responsibilities, I could definitely take on more course work. I could also try to purse the BS/MS program (maybe I'm a little to eager, but I would just like to *try*). However, I am not quite sure what an MS will do other than showcase you have an MS degree and have a bit more educational experience. 

Also on a plus side, I don't have many unprofessional friends, have bonded with a lot with my professors, tend to like working alone, and don't plan to have any love affairs anytime soon.

-Loans should be paid directly to students as a monthly check instead of banks to prevent unwanted embezzlement.

-Current bank loans should have interest and payments capped to avoid fraudulent inflation of student's debts by banks to acquire additional unneeded funds and any attempt to do so will be political dealt via multimedia streamed public humiliation and community service, extreme cases will result in sentences of jail time too.

She suggested we make a trip of it, so I'm trying to be proactive and come up with a loose itinerary. A cross country trip focused on national parks and camping is a life long dream of mine, and I was wondering if those of you who are well traveled would help me.

**I've already traveled to:** Mammoth cave national park, I've spent a lot of time in Daniel Boone national forest and other heavily forrested areas in the eastern US (in the summer/fall) mostly one/two night or long weekend trips out of a backpack or a rustic cabin. Most of my other traveling has been international and I don't think it applies here

**She's already traveled to:** Damn near every major national park in the continental US. On her way to the bay area she stopped at Zion, Joshua Tree, Grand Canyon etc. Almost all out of her car and nights in a tent with a couple friends. She doesn't have much experience internationally or living out of a pack, but this isn't her first cross country rodeo like it is mine. 

**Length and timeframe** We're probably leaving SF around December 20th/21st. This isn't set in stone. We'd like to be back east (Cincinnati) by the first of the year. Not sure what's going to happen for Christmas, so any pointers here would be really helpful.

**Ideas for where to go** So I looked at some maps and the roadtrippers app and heres a beginning list of the stuff we'd both like to see:

Channel Islands NP (staying overnight? Whale watching? kayaking?)

San Diego (We both have never been and would like to see the city)

Joshua Tree NP (she loved this so much she said she had to bring me)

Death Valley NP (Camp here overnight?)

Grand Canyon NP (Have to see this. bucket list item)

Carlsbad Caverns NP

Guadalupe Mountains NP (Carlsbad and Guadalupe are like an hour apart so in theory we could see both in a long day)

Big Bend NP (out of the way, so it can be cut)

Pardre Island (Might be nice to camp on/near the beach after all that time on the road)

Austin?

Hot springs NP in Arkansas (cold weather + hot springs? might be nice)

Home 

All of these stops are pretty flexible. But any suggestions on what to do, where to camp/stay, must-see attractions would be really appreciated. 

**Interests** All things outdoors, obviously. Museums, Food, and Music, there's not a lot of things I wouldn't want to see at least once.

**Climate**
I'm concerned about this, I know we'll be in the southwest but I know it gets pretty damn cold overnight, and most of our nights will be in a tent. I really don't want her to be uncomfortable or unsafe so any suggestions would be welcome. 

**Budget** Shoestring. she's finishing school after this internship and I'm at the very beginning of my career. Most of our food will be cooked on a propane stove out of a cooler. However if it's going to be an experience I'd be willing to spend for it (Channel Islands is one thing I expect to spend some $ on) I'd like to keep it to around 1500 total. 

Is this a total pipe dream? Foolish? Any suggestions are welcome, especially for Christmas (I figure we'll have to stay in a hotel for the holiday)

4zvw2p,6,2016-08-27,TIFU by getting too drunk at my company's annual works outing,AnotherThrowaway_xyz,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4zvw2p/tifu_by_getting_too_drunk_at_my_companys_annual/,"For the last two months I've been doing an internship at an amazing company. I got along nicely with everyone and I honestly couldn't have had a better time. I had been hoping that I might even get the chance to start there after I'm done with school.

Yesterday was my last day there and the annual works outing happened to be on that day.   
At first, everything was fine. Everyone was drinking a bit, we get tipsy, I make some jokes, people laugh. Basically, everything was perfect. Sometime later that night I fucked up though. Don't ask me when it happened but at some point I had obviously had too much alcohol. I can honestly not tell you when things took a turn for the worse but basically what happened is that I sat next to a colleague of mine and probably spent like 45 minutes hugging him and telling him that we're ""bros and homeboys"" now. I probably also slurred incoherently. I tend to do that.  
That whole time two of the three CEOs were sitting next to me, both pretty much completely sober.

When the time to leave came around, I got on the bus with all the other people. At that point, I realized that I had fucked up. I started whining about how dumb it was of me to drink as much as I did, since I'm only an intern and that I probably will not be welcomed back after this. The guy who sat next to me told me that it's fine but I'm pretty sure it's not.

Don't worry, it gets worse. I don't know how or when it happened but basically, at some point I got out of the bus and threw up. Thinking back, I might have even thrown up in the bus. I can't remember.  
Imagine that: A bus full of people looking out of the window and the intern who's been working at your company for just two months now is collapsed on the floor, throwing up everything he ate 2 hours ago.

One of my colleagues was nice enough to give me a ride home afterwards but I'm sure that even though I probably left a lasting impression, I won't be their first pick when they look for interns again next year.

I'm currently trying to figure out how to deal with this situation now. I'm considering sending the CEOs an email and letting them know that I'm sorry, though I'm not sure if that would be a nice gesture or if it would make things just more awkward. I could also just send _my_ CEO a message on Facebook or something, though I'm not sure if that's enough.

I'm obviously not good at dealing with people, so I'd love to hear what you guys would do in this situation.



TL;DR: Got too drunk at company's annual works outing and made an ass of myself. Probably threw away any chances of working there again even though everything seemed to be going just perfectly before this incident."

Like binomial multiplication checking in O(kn) instead of O(n^2) and matrix multiplication checking in O(n^2) instead of O(n^3) , basically sacrificing deterministism of algorithm for performance.

Do people use them in real life application?

I would be really interested to know what kind of field does these class of algorithm gets applied."

I'm a 23 year old male located in Ohio. I graduated from a pretty good public university with a BS in engineering management with computer and electrical focus alongside a minor in electrical engineering a couple months ago. I had really hard time finding a job because I had no internships or any work experience that related to the field. 

I was able to land a good job through a recruitment agency and I just finished my first week yesterday. I make $16 an hour currently but it will bump up to $21 an hour after I become full time within 2 or 3 months. 

I'm currently living at a house that my parents own in the town I went to college. I have 2 roommates paying rent to my parents and my brother who has 1 more year of college lives here too. I spend all the nights at my fiancee's duplex so I have no housing costs until I get married in January. 

Here is where the problem comes in. Generally speaking in fairly frugal but I realize I'm only young once so I don't want to save every possible penny. I bought a 2008 BMW M3 with 50k miles in February for $26,200 from a dealer because I really wanted one and life is too short for mediocre cars. I've had my motorcycle for 2 years now and I'm planning on taking it to work couple times a week to save gas since it gets 50mpg. I also bought a queen size tempurpedic for $2,000 (fiancee's parents paid for $500) because sleep is important and I'm expecting it to last next 20 years. 

Monthly expenses.
Car insurance for car: $120

Gas (work is 30 miles away and car gets 18mpg on premium): $230

Motorcycle insurance for 2012 Ninja 300: $6

Cellphone: $35

Eating out(I pack lunches about half of the time, this also includes couple dinners): $200

Groceries: $200

Misc(movies, amazon etc): $150

Total: $1041 

Income: $2600 before taxes 

I still have a 2 week honeymoon to pay for in Hawaii, have my car be taken in for, regular maintenance, and get my motorcycle serviced as well. I recently paid $850 for a part for my car when a throttle valve actuator failed and I was unable to fix the part. I did successfully to the replacement and saved over $700 compared to a stealership part and labor. 

Anyways, am I living beyond my means? When we get married I'll be also paying got my fiancee's car insurance, phone, rent+utilities ($750-1000) but I will be making $21 an hour at that point. My fiancee's schooling is being paid by her parents. I also need to replace the summer tires in my car within a year and also buy a wheels and winter tires. Combined this would be around $2500. 

I'm currently without health insurance because the benefits won't kick in until I've been working for 2 months. Afterwards I'll have extremely good health insurance because my work is in the utility industry. My shoulder needs surgery from multiple dislocations after I get health insurance and I'm planning on finding a counselor to help treat my depression too. 

I'm really excited to be financially independent, having an actual job, and then being able to share all of this with my fiancée. Any advice and friendly comments is greatly appreciated.

4zwbf0,6,2016-08-27,Trying to overcome lifelong depression as a mother,DepressedDolly,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4zwbf0/trying_to_overcome_lifelong_depression_as_a_mother/,"I am a 30 something mother who is fighting to overcome my depression for the sake of my kids and I feel helpless in overcoming it . To give some loooooong background the history of my depression: 
        I recall feeling this way since I can remember. I remember the overwhelming anxiety even as a young toddler of realizing how dysfunctional my family was and craving emotional or physical affection just to be neglected of it , not feeling wanted. Then I was orphaned by before I was 10 years old. My  mother died of cancer and my father continuing not to take responsibility for his children so I was left to be raised by the rest of my family, a very large family. Still poor and dysfunctional but I was very excited about a new start of a family hoping it would be more traditional and calm.  I did great the first few years then the emotional &amp; verbal abuse started. I felt resented and a burden. Then about 6 months into that my best friend who was like a sister to me died and I could no longer hide my depression.
         I became a self harmer between 12-18 years ago. In my teen years I was in a couple of abusive relationships, one where I was repeatedly violently raped and told "" your own father didnt want you, you are lucky I do. "" The rapist knew I was being verbally abused at home, called a slut, whore , always accused of being pregnant even when I was a virgin so I felt I could not tell them because they would blame me and I probably deserved it in my view. Even with all that trauma , I stood out of trouble aside from being sent to a ER 3 times when strangers noticed my arms ...But as teenager I was well behaved because I was terrified of my family. 
         I tried to make my family proud of my success ( since all they care about is image) I got into a top college a year ahead, and a large resume of high end internships and jobs working with famous people in my promising career  and all by 18 years old. Lucky for me I met my husband then too. I was deep into my depression and was waiting to turn 18 to leave my family &amp; go self destruct. I oddly enough never had suicidal thoughts but I also had no will to live. My husband made me promise to stop cutting ( which I did) and I ran away with him after my 18th birthday. I tried to continue my career path but after a handful of bad experiences I gave up and lost interest all together. I tried to get into Fine Art but turns making art makes me feel worse ( strange I know) so I avoid that too. 
        So I settled down, few kids later and the career dream is dead and gone. Being motherless, it created a huge desire to have kids  thinking if I undo my childhood by raising them the way I wished I was , that it would be a huge sense of healing. Sadly, my depression got worse. Losing 3 babies in miscarriage didn't help either. I am very overprotective with my kids, lots attached parenting and unending showering of affection. I broke the cycle in a sense. However I am uncapable of feeling happiness or joy. Like the chemistry in my brain doesn't allow it. I can have a natural reflex of smiling for something for my kids but I dont feel it, I can see a smiling picture but I know I wasnt happy so not sure how I smiled. I can feel relief sometimes which will lessen my sense of anxiety but that's as good as it gets. 
         7 years ago my depression got a lot more darker and scarier, unlike anything I never experience. I become obsessed with the idea of dying. Not killing myself but the idea of being released . I dream of terminal diseases taking me , a guilt free death. Please note my biggest fear is my children repeating my trauma of being a motherless child so I know I have the will power of refusing to be  responsible for causing that pain for them, that's my biggest strength at the moment. However even if I went naturally it would cause the same pain but they wouldn't hate me for it.  But I know logically both would be bad for them but I cant help obsessively planning my final arrangements because It is the only thing that brings me any sense of comfort, that it will end eventually. My fascination with death and perfectionism actually helps me not want to be dead because it is normally pretty gruesome  most ways. 
           As an adult I have been very open about my depression and I have had a heavy price to pay for it. I lost my entire family because I talk about my depression. I grew up bottling it up and took it out on myself  with self harm but I refuse to do that as a mother. Thanks to social media my family began to attack me on my FB page and emailing me horrible insults, telling me I was bringing shame to my family. I come from a long line of ice queens, being emotional is looked as a weakness, shameful and labeled a "" drama queen"". I can honestly say I am a loving, caring, loyal, generous  person and treated even my shitty family as such hoping they would treat me differently as an adult. I am my own worst critic and if I was to blame for something to cause their hatred towards me I would have no problem owning up to it and begging for forgiveness because it would be far more easier if I could blame it on myself. I actually wish it was my fault. Yes, I have some self deprecating humor and speak of taboo subjects for awareness but I honestly never ever hurt someone in my life yet they twisted my personal feelings about MYSELF and MY life to make it as the ultimate "" disgrace"" to the family , slandered me in the worst ways to the point that they convinced all of my massive family to disown me . God knows what horrible lie they had to come up with to achieve that . The only thing they knew I couldn't handle is getting my kids involved, insulting me as a mother because that is literally my whole reason for living, it's the only thing that means anything to me.  It's been 3 years since any family has spoken to me, not even to check on my kids.  It was such a painful experience we moved across the country in hopes being further away from the base of the hurt would make us feel better. We have lived 2 years completely isolated and struggling to come to grips that we will never have family (long story short, my in laws are even crazier then my family) My  husband is depressed as well from this and my kids are struggling that they will never know what it's like to have cousins, aunts &amp; uncles again. They had long excluded my children from any family events beforehand due to other people's dislike of me. With my last convo with the family members that raised me I was told "" We just dont like you, it's a personality conflict- we never understood you and never liked you"" Something I always felt deep down and tried to tell myself it was my depression talking but it was indeed true- they flat out told me finally and it shattered me to the point I cannot figure out how to not feel like the most worthless &amp; unlovable person in the world. It's so bad that I cannot even believe my husband and kids when they tell me they love me now. If your own parents couldn't love you, how I couldn't even get 1 person out of a huge family to love me unconditionally, I cannot comprehend how it's possible . By the grace of something special, I never gotten into drugs and even with a family of full of alkys I am not even close to a drunk but sometimes it feels like a curse because I feel they would have more sympathy for me if I was a addict rather then talking about my emotions in a healthy way. 
            My life now is like a endless groundhogs day/ twilight zone. I live curled up on my couch all hours of the day, I am always with my kids but I am not very functional outside of making sure they are fed, safe and shown love . The depression physically hurts to the point where I always feel like I have the flu, that's the best  I could describe it. I do work very part time at a low end job outside the home which is a good break , in a way it makes me feel like a failure that I went from extremely successful teenager to a McJob but it's a sense of accomplishment I can do something a lil functional but it's been very physically hard too because I never feel well. I tried opening an online business  which was supposed to be a huge achievement but it was a total failure and I barely made any sales so now I feel like I hit a brick wall. I dont even hold any interests anymore to figure out what to do now. 
           Other problems I have worth mentioning- I have PCOS which has had a really bad effect on my health, I have crippling ADD all my life but it's so bad that I never learned to drive because I know I could not do it safely , my usual anxiety developed into a OCD- as a coping mechanism I refresh 50 website tabs I constantly have open almost nonstop, it's stupid and annoying but in some odd way it's me being hopeful that something good might happen and I am worried I will miss out on it.I think secretly I am waiting for someone to contact me to show they care.  I have severe insomnia, I normally don't fall asleep until 7am and sleep very little, sometimes almost up for 3 days straight if I have the slightest anxiety. I dont really have  friends IRL, I am not unfriendly ( actually I am a pretty effing awesome friend) but I never been able to make more then a couple of friends at a time at any point in my life. I have a handful of online friends, most are as depressed as me and  it's been  very one way friendships of me being there for them 24/7 but they disappear when I need them there for me.  We tried to be proactive joining church groups (even short lived conversion in hopes of belonging somewhere) I tried mother/ kids groups but it seems all the families are very well off and they cant understand why we cant do certain things  and it becomes so belittling to keep trying and failing. We just dont fit in or mesh with anyone no matter the efforts we make and it turned our isolation into a sense of feeling despairing loneliness.
            Now how I have tried to get help: When the really dark depression started 7 years, I seeked medical help from a doctor and I was put on meds for the 1st time. 3 weeks I come no longer take it,it got so much worse and I was too scared to continue taking it so I went back asking the doctor to change it and they refused so I just stopped. And no, no doctors even tried to medicate me in my self harming days so I am not experienced in medicating depression. 2 months ago I tried again asking a Dr. I lost my insurance so the only affordable option I had was some religious based clinic. They refused to give me any medication except blood pressure meds and told me I needed to find Jesus in order to be healed of my depression and handed me religious pamphlets and sent me on my way. I spent most of my teenage years talking to therapists and it really did nothing for me. And actually had a really bad experience once  being abused by one so I have trust issues with them. Also I have to  worry as a mother that it is a HUGE risk, I have had online friends gotten cps called whenever depression is reported.  I have great communication with my husband so that's therapeutic in a objective social sense. There's honestly not a need for therapy when I am as open as I am. However, this depression has to change, I know it will never end but it has to change and I cannot figure out how to make that happen. I have lost SO MUCH precious time not living in the moment with my children, getting to experience the joy of memories because I live in fog of basic survival to cope day to day.  I am there physically but because I cannot feel happiness, I am not there. They always questioning me why I dont use my talent as a living but I cannot tell them that my depression killed my dreams, my potential I once had- when they are teenagers I will be open about my struggle but they will misunderstand at this age. They will think "" why am I not enough to make you happy?"" and that will destroy me. because the truth they should be enough to overcome my depression. I am fighting for them, I want to be an example and not a "" why?""  I dont want the hole in my heart my family created that is overbearing on my self worth that I cannot let them win by me becoming a handicapped victim of depression any further rather then finding the strength to become successful to spite them.  But I cannot figure out how. It feels too late. My mind is a neverending  loop of every voice who convinced me Im weak,unlovable  and a failure "" Youre a disgrace. We never liked you. Your own parents didnt want you. You are trash. You belong in hell. You are lazy. You wasted your talent. You are a drama queen. I bet your husband doesnt even want you. You are a bad mother"" and my own voice "" I just want to die...."" But I cant, I will at some point, everyone will but I cannot wish that on my children to experience because I know what it did to me. But I am completely lost in how to get better, I dont know if it's realistically possible. I try over and over again and fail.  The only thing I can think of is maybe if I had some kind successful business or career to feel like I accomplished something and a few friends so I wont feel so isolated then maybe it will change. But it also  seems maybe I just need to come to terms with living in isolation and in poverty and learn how to get past a lifetime of self destructive thoughts. I just don't know how any of it is possible but the idea of living in this state of mind that only has worsen with time , that is what terrifies me the most . I feel helpless and hopeless that  I cant find a way out of it and that  I will have so much regret that I lost experiencing an entire lifetime to depression even if I survived it. "

Personally, I would prefer to have an apartment-mate, since I won't really know anyone in the city besides my coworkers and would love to be social/have someone to go to events with.  However, I could also do an individual location.  Also, I'm trying to find a furnished room since I don't want to have to worry about buying/selling furniture for just a semester.

Over the years I have consistently felt more and more left out and treated like the back up social interaction. I have a very demanding major/job/internship/organization/volunteer schedule, and this isn't something I can let up (which is an entire other matter, but basically, I don't have a supportive family and I am applying for a professional graduate program in my field this this year--its grad school or bust. Think OT or PT school competitive) so I primarily see my friends on the weekends. The guys in the group play video games together. The girls in the group are less close. Essentially, it is my friend Laura and her boyfriend Alan and me and my boyfriend Ian, with 2 other girls, another couple, and a few stray guys. I'm gonna list a few things... please tell me if I'm being crazy or overreacting. I am at the point where I would rather just not have these friends and feel lonely than be around them and feel so sad and left out.

1. Despite the fact that I lived with 4 of these friends this summer, they forgot my 21st birthday and made other plans. When I mentioned it, they got angry at me for ""putting them in an awkward position"" when all I said was ""oh yeah that's my birthday."" They admitted to forgetting. 

2. I try to make plans or meet with people one on one or in small groups. Doing so, they always are busy or have other plans. People only ask what my plans are unless their's fall through, and when better plans come up they cancel with me and sometimes even lie about their whereabouts. I get snapchats or things of events and how I should have been there, but I'm not invited to those things. Oftentimes people ""forget"" to inform me about stuff and seem surprised when I say I know nothing.

3. In our group chat, I am never responded to until someone else says something unrelated. This is a frequent occurrence. My snap chats are not responded to either. I sometimes feel crazy, as if I made up that these people were my  friends. 

4. My opinions and feelings aren't valued. My friend started dating a girl in the group who openly bullied me and they are still together today. She is so mean to me arbitrarily and everyone comments on it, but no one cares enough to do something about it. I have tried to speak to her on this as well as the friend but they deny any bullying. (I can elaborate on this if necessary.) Before I was 21 I was only asked to hang out when I could DD. 

5. A picture was taken of me and 3 girl friends at a party a few weekends ago. Last night, 1 girl gave the 2 other girls framed pictures from that night. But I didn't receive one. I don't know why. I felt really hurt by this and was very sad the rest of the night. I can't tell if being purposely excluded or just forgotten is better.


Yes, I want different friends. I am acquaintances with a lot of people at work, in organizations, and my major, but to be frank, all of those things are competitive situations. Even though I am friendly and known as a go-to person in all those responsibilities, no one considers me a good friend. For example, this morning I volunteered at a literacy event at an old internship for 6 hours. I overheard my old supervisor telling a new intern that I am here volunteering because I don't have a life. The intern, who I am friendly with, laughed and agreed. 

My boyfriend agrees that I am treated poorly.  He has just recently (past 6 months) become friends with my friends as he integrated into our friend group during our summer sublease together, and my friends treat him much better and talk to him more often than they do to me. He says I should ask them why I am treated like the last resort friend, but really it makes me sad that I should have to ask to be treated equally or even remembered. 


I should mention that I have a stressful home life. My mother has a myriad of health issues, lives alone 2 hours away, and is suicidal. I would have dropped out of school if it weren't my last year. I am also in a stressful financial situation. I worked 5 jobs/internships this summer to afford to attend school this semester. You wouldn't be able to tell this from just looking at me, I hide it well. My friends have a pretty good idea of my circumstances, though. I don't talk about it often, but they have heard through my boyfriend, saw me working all summer, and have met my mom.  Sometimes, given all that is going on at home combined with my struggles applying for grad school, I just want to completely remove myself from my friend group to focus on surviving this school year. The pain of being ignored and rejected hurts so badly. But also, I want to have friends. I want connection and to share experiences... I don't want to be alone, but I don't want to be treated the way I am. 


My question is, how do I make things at least a bit more manageable for my emotional health? What would I even say to my friends? Would I beg them to care about me? Would I ask them why they neglect our friendship? Would I tell them I don't deserve it?

I can't think of an effective script for communicating how I feel when they leave me out. 



Thanks.

  **tl;dr**: Friends ignore me or generally treat me pretty poorly. What should I say to them, should I confront them, or just isolate myself? "

(Long),CISCscum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4zwp8f/which_route_do_i_take_long/,"I am about to be a college graduate with a Bachelor's in Asian Studies, which I enjoy, but is not what I want to do career wise. After doing a 2-2 program with my community college, I tried to transfer into Computer Science, but didn't make the cut, and was left to find a major that would let me graduate on time. My GPA is about a 2.85.

I'm considering the following to get involved and progress to a programming career.

1. Boot-Camp: There's one locally in my area, and if I get accepted, they work with local companies for internships and FT positions. 

2. Online CS Degree: This could be from 1-4 years, but if done, I feel like I would be in much better standing than I am now. The only issue is getting loans for it; I owe about 25k federal and 6k private now.

3. Air Force: Enlist in something IT-related and go from there? I have only done some light research on this.

What should I do? What other options could I pursue? I know that I want a computer science career path."

I also talked to my siblings about it. It was nice to finally tell someone about it in real life. I wish the thoughts of death would end though. I think about it nearly everyday even though my last day at work was the Friday before last. I am hopefully going to the counseling center at my school on Monday, but at the moment I regret not calling earlier and trying to get an appointment yesterday because it honestly is really scary and painful to want to die.  

Honestly I can't even say whether I'll make it to the end of the semester. The next few months seem like they will be really lonely and scary and difficult. I don't know if I can do it. I wasn't really able to do it the last semester I was in school. (I haven't been in since spring 2015 because I took a year off. The first semester of my year off I was just at home. The second I had an internship. Then I had a second internship this summer.) I did pretty badly and felt horrible the whole semester. It was such a struggle. I'm afraid this semester will be worse. Or that some stressor will give me the reason I need to kill myself. I guess it's weird I feel like I don't have control over that, but honestly I don't seem to have control of my thoughts, so why would I have control over my actions which come from my thoughts? Yeah I don't know. That's a weird and crazy thing to say I guess."
4zxewg,9,2016-08-27,"[MN, USA] I think I have bad mold... already moved in, haven't signed lease",IDefendMyself,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4zxewg/mn_usa_i_think_i_have_bad_mold_already_moved_in/,"I moved to a very small town in northern Minnesota in mid-July, 2016. Since then my original landlord refused to pay for a broken washing machine that was in the lease. She said I had two options: for her to raise my rent by $50 a month and fix it, or to let me out of my lease. I took the second option and found an apartment. Now her son claims he's really the owner of the house and that I don't have a right to move out. The landlady said her other son told her she had ""no business"" making those offers and now she and her family might sue me.

I found this new apartment on a short notice. It's big, I love it, and it's right above a shop owned by the new landlords. My lease is due to start on September 1st and I haven't signed it yet, but I did pay for my first month's rent and deposit. She let me move in early because she ""would rather have someone here,"" so I've been at the apartment for a few days. 

The first time I came to see the place all the windows were open and while there as a little bit of an odor, it's an old place (built in the 20's) and I didn't think much of it. Since I've moved in, however, the smell in the bedroom and kitchen has become overwhelming. Especially when the windows are closed, it's so strong I nearly can't stand it. I started putting my things away today and going in and out of the kitchen and bedroom. Now, I really, really want to like this place, but when I went into the kitchen a few minutes ago I started gagging and almost threw up.

I'm afraid if I say anything to the new landlords they won't want to pay to fix it, and given the trouble I may now be in leaving my first lease I may be in trouble with two places. I haven't signed the lease here but I'm due to sign it soon. 

What should I do before next Wednesday when I have to sign the new lease here? I am really afraid the new landlords will tell me it's a whim or I'm making up how badly it's bothering me, but I'm not acting at all - the smell is truly awful. I looked up some tenant laws in MN and read that landlords aren't required to let someone out of the lease due to mold. I am truly getting nauseous going into the kitchen/bedroom. I could threaten to move back into my old place and keep that lease, but I really do not want to go back there as that family is awful and the son called me names on the phone when I told him his mom offered to let me out of the lease. I am new in this town, I don't know anybody, and my internship is really intense. I need to spend time working and studying not dealing with legal problems, but I'm really don't think I can live with this apartment smelling like this. 

The apartment also has an opening from the upstairs kitchen into a roof that the landlord told me already is not up to code or regulations. I don't know if I could use that to my advantage in any way but I'm just putting it out there in case it's relevant. The Minnesota Department of Health does not provide direct services, such as inspections or testing, for mold problems. [http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mold/renters.html] but they might come for something like the roof are that's not in compliance, however, I want the mold taken care of not the area outside the kitchen.  

Here is a picture of the floor next to the fridge in the kitchen http://imgur.com/a/QuzhQ - it may be where the smell comes from. But it's really strong in the bedroom too and the floor is okay there, so I don't know. I have never been in a place where there was bad mold before so I didn't know what the smell was or what could be causing it. It's starting to irritate my throat too; I am using a wax warmer to cover the smell but it's not really doing it. It will get cold soon too and I will need to close the windows. I don't know what to do, whether to sign the new lease, or how to get them to fix it if I do.

4zxroh,0,2016-08-27,Considering a career move - at least generating a counter offer from my current company. Thoughts?,CareerMove,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4zxroh/considering_a_career_move_at_least_generating_a/,"Looking for advice on a potential career ""maneuver"" I've been considering. Lengthy post ahead!

I'm a Mechanical Engineer with 7.5 years experience with a very large US defense contractor. Started right after graduation, and it has been the only place I've worked (outside of earlier internships).

I currently make $88k, but the market average for my job level is $101k. In addition, I am on the cusp of ""earning"" my next promotion - based on my current performance and the level of responsibility that I've been taking on for the past year. (The next promotion level has a market average of $125k).

My company has a very cut and dry list of qualifications for each promotion level, and promotions can only be given out in either Oct or April. In speaking with my manager, he agrees that I meet all the qualifications, except one. They have a ""recommended minimum years experience"" of 9 with a B.S (or 7 with a M.S). I'm at 7.5 with a B.S, but currently 25% through my masters, which I am taking on nights/weekends and will complete in ~2 years.

In speaking with my manager, I had mentioned that I would like to be put in for a promotion in April 2017 (the promotion cycle for Oct 2016 was already started last month, and I was not put in for it). Considering that my manager has told me that I've already been operating at the next promotion level, I felt that April 2017 was more than fair.

The downside to such a large company is that HR has a lot of ""rules"" that managers/directors have to follow when it comes to giving their employees merit increases. And one of those rules is the amount of employees a manager is able to promote in any given cycle.

At my last meeting with my manager where I mentioned the April 2017 promotion, he said that he was going to be transparent with me and that there are a few others that have been at my current level 1-2 years longer than me that they need to promote first. He reiterated that he felt I had earned the next promotion, but that he can only put so many people in at a time, and there are others who earned it as well that have more years than me.

**So this is my predicament:**

I actually enjoy the work I'm doing right now. I'm finally at a point where I'm leading an engineering team, and I'm on a really good project right now, that should last at least another year or two. I'm chugging through my masters (which to be fair, my company is paying for), and I also have a long-term incentive cash bonus that I earned last year of $10,000. But I only see that money if I stay at the company until Feb 2019. And if I voluntarily leave my company (or get fired with cause) either during or right after earning my masters, I have to pay back the previous two years worth of classes (which could be up to $23k). If everything else was the same, but I made $100k, I'd be very content with my company.

On the other side, I have some friends that recently have gotten new jobs in my area and are getting offers ranging from $100k-110k for the level of work that I'm currently doing. I've begun updating my resume, and have been considering applying elsewhere. Although, if I was to actually take a job elsewhere, I'd be ""losing"" $33k from my current company - unless I could get the new company to alleviate some of that through a sign-on bonus.

**So this was my thought:**

Is it risky/crazy to get an offer with another company just so I can get my current company to try and match it? In reading, it seems like a lot of people say that a counter offer is just a way for companies to buy time until they replace you. While I wouldn't be heart broken if they did end up counter offering and then letting me go a few months later, it would just add a lot of stress to start job hunting when not currently employed.

What is everyone's thoughts?"

I know that Goldman Sachs hires a lot of engineers, but I don't know how hard it is to get a job there. Also, I know there a lot of banks in NYC (Duh) but I don't know how the work environment is or if they are a good fit for someone who wants to work as programmer with the goal of eventually becoming a manager.

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."

Now for the good stuff, I want to play [Ariel Winter](http://imgur.com/a/XOuWv) in a fairly long-term roleplay scenario. 

Ariel Winter is an actress most famously known for playing the character Alex Dunphy on the TV show Modern Family. Please have at least some idea of who she is or at least the TV show.

--------------------------------------------------

Ariel stood in front of the mirror in her trailer, staring at her herself as she nervously bit her lip.

Suddenly she was yanked out of her thoughts when a production intern yelled loudly from outside her trailer door.

""Miss Winter!""

Ariel turned and looked at her agent sitting on the couch. She wasn't sure what she should do. She was already half an hour late for her scene, but in truth, she just wasn't ready for it yet and was hoping he would buy her some more time.

""She'll be out in a damn minute!"" Gary yelled back to the intern standing outside.

""Just relax honey..."" He said in a softer voice as he put down the script he was reading and stood up from the sofa.

""I'm trying"" She replied softly in an almost whine. Ariel knew that she had become known for her curves, but she never could see what everyone else did. When she looked in the mirror, she was still just a chubby little nerdy girl and hardly the young, vixen the rest of America saw.

""You look great and they're paying us a lot of money for you to shoot this scene."" He continued to reassure her about the upcoming [censored] scene she was about to shoot less than a month and a half after her 18th birthday.

Of course, they weren't paying *them* they were paying *her*, but as her agent, he often used the word *us* to emphasize that her career was not her own.

Her mother had hired him thinking he was just sleazy enough to let her take control of Ariel's career through him, but the first thing he did was take her away from her family, and negotiate for Ariel to star in this movie.

""You're not little Alex Dunphy anymore, honey. We've got to show the world that you're really an *adult* now."""

It’s an internal tool.

I barely wrote a line of C Sharp before this project.

Writing the tool was easy - but apparently there are TONS of conventions that C Sharp developers are supposed to follow. 

I suppose there was a miscommunication. The developer correcting my code always told me not to rush, not to hurry, etc. And now my boss has come down on me like an anvil, after he tested an unstable build of my code and it didn’t work as promised (inaccurate data was being passed through).

This was supposed to take me two weeks and now it has taken five. Replacing different functions in C Sharp with other ones that do the exact same thing but are considered good style. (I guess LINQ is supposed to be used instead of foreach?) 

There were problems getting the team's codebase and integrating my code into it. It was a sink-or-swim environment and I think I did really well considering my inexperience with these sorts of things and the lack of guidance.

I never actually had this problem before, that I wasn’t working quickly enough, because at my last job, not such a great company, I dramatically exceeded all of the time expectations. 

The thing is - what can I say to my boss to let him know that this was just a hiccup and that I really want to succeed at my other assignments? "
4zy3ea,1,2016-08-28,I am sick to death of college party culture.,tankinturtle,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4zy3ea/i_am_sick_to_death_of_college_party_culture/,"I seriously fucking hate party culture. Specifically, college party culture. 

I honestly just don't understand why college kids need to fucking obsess over such a barbaric and extremely overhyped weekend routine. I'm not trying to make myself sound like a stick in the mud or anything, but I have NEVER enjoyed being at an extremely loud, cramped, and sweaty college party with a bunch of obnoxious drunks. And yes, I've been to a few college parties. The only one I enjoyed was a smaller one held by the Electronic Media majors (had maybe 30 people max there). I knew half the people and the booze wasn't cheap garbage. 

But literally, my college town has nothing to do but host obnoxiously large and loud college parties every fucking weekend. Maybe I'm a bit biased; I'm a senior in Computer Science with two jobs and six classes this semester, and have been in a commited relationship for over 4 years. I like having a good time with friends, but in my honest opinion, I think going to (or hosting) giant college house parties with extremely loud music, lots of sweaty obnoxious drunks, and crappy booze is the most idiotic thing to partake in while in college. 

This year I seem to be on the shit end of this fucking deal. The roommates I got this year were FINALLY reasonable people, but of course the people above us just HAD to be the typical party central every weekend. And its fucking annoying, because they were really cool about it at first, telling me to ""just text them if the music is too loud"" and trying to sympathize with me. But their idea of ""turning the music down"" is hitting the volume down button once, if I'm lucky. Half of the time I really doubt they even turn it down if I ask. Hell, tonight the music just got fucking louder and louder. 

Maybe its just the senioritis, but I just can't fucking wait to leave this garbage college town. Stupid bimbo chicks and smelly, drunk, and horny dudes rule this town at night during the weekends. I've never liked party culture and it's done nothing but keep me up countless nights and make me feel like shit the next morning without drinking a single drop of alcohol. 

I would love to just sleep through the noise, but unfortunately severe anxiety and an extremely irritable anger problem prevent this. I get agitated and pissed off, storm off in a huge fucking fit late at night, and then my anxiety kicks in realizing that I'm going to sleep like shit tonight when I simply don't have the time to. 

I wish I could've just moved off of fucking campus. I want to move back home. But I wanted to live up here for two reasons: I wanted to continue to teach myself financial responsibility and teach myself how to live on my own, and my internship is 10 minutes away from my current apartment. From back home, its 45. And i have to be there at 7 AM on certain days. And it already takes me a VERY long time to get myself up that early in the morning.

Fuck party culture. Fuck the drunken morons roaming the college streets. Fuck the assholes who feel the need to host a goddamn party above me every weekend and not just fucking go to one instead. Fuck all of this. I want to go home."

My plan (or rather dream) is to complete my bachelor's overseas and maybe my master's and find some job as a software engineer out of college. 

I have about $10,000 saved up for my education and the rest I suppose I will have to loan out/work for. The only work experience I have is as an intern at a traffic engineering company. And I can speak English and conversational Japanese. Obviously that's not useful but I'm gonna work hard to learn the language of wherever I choose to move. 

So how can an undergraduate student with barely any qualifications and not a lot of money survive and get an education in Europe? Is it feasible? Is it advisable? If so which country gives the best chance for international undergrads? Any other advice/criticism would be appreciated. "

I apologize for the great length of time since my last review, but full-time work (which thoroughly agrees with me) and Dragon Age Origins has occupied much of my attention. Still, the occasion has come where I must complete my review of Ancient Black Ops, Episode 6: The Varangian Guard, suggested by the bountiful u/Claidheamh_Righ:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUCxmAO4CJU

My bottle of imaginary Brännvin is with me, so let us continue!

19.05: Man killed with obviously blunt re-enactment spear. DRINK!

19.23: The academic says that the reign of Basil II was seen as a golden age, in no small part thanks to the guard. I disagree with that. The Varangians certainly helped Basil II keep his throne (and his part-time ophthalmologist business), but it was a combination of Basil's own abilities and the organizational structure of the Empire itself (along with a codified military tradition) which allowed for such a period of expansion and stability. DRINK!

19.42: Narrator provides incorrect location for a US state. The area was also ravaged not by Basil II, but by internationally reviled war criminal, instrument of Northern imperialism and future combustible tank William Tecumseh Sherman. DRINK!

20.01: The academic states the Varangians held the empire together. Absolutely not. It was the strong administrative structure and the Byzantine army itself WHICH HELD THE DAMN EMPIRE TOGETHER! DRINK!

20.02: Okay, this one is the rare quadruple-mistakes. A warrior is doing a Hollywood dual-wield, one of the swords is blatantly blunt, he jumps in the air like as though he thinks he is in a Chinese wire-fu movie and HE DOESN'T EVEN HIT HIS OPPONENT. DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! *BRIEF LAPSE INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS* DRINK!

21.45: Obviously blunt sword. DRINK!

22.27: The episode keeps asserting that the Varangians were coming from Scandinavia. Certainly many men originated from Scandinavia, but there were also very large numbers of Rus (who are distinctly not Scandinavian) and, after the Norman Conquest of England, Anglo-Saxon warriors. DRINK!

22.54: Narrator states Harald Hadrada took the Varangian Guard to a whole new level. How? Did he introduce power-metal? The Varangian Guard was part of an *integrated* military establishment with a *centuries old* martial tradition. Harald was a country bumpkin who could contribute nothing, tactically speaking. DRINK!

23.02: This posing makes me wonder if Viking glamour shots were used in applications to the Byzantine army.

23.13: Another reference to Harald being the proto-typical Viking 200 years after Vikings actually started raiding. DRINK!

23.30: This medieval manuscript shows us how Olaf was disarmed.

23.56: The narrator states the Rus were Vikings. No, Vikings were raiders from Scandinavia. The Rus were, curiously enough, just Rus. DRINK!

24.04: ALL HAIL THE GRAND PRINCE OF SWAGGER!

25.28: I'm not sure cars, passenger ferries, telephone poles and Islamic minarets were present in Constantinople in the 11th century AD. DRINK!

26.04: The academic says, in the one sentence, Harald was reliable, and yet created alliances and truces and then broke them. Did they not have at least *one* intern to double-check the script?

26.06: This hero-worship of Harald is seriously annoying. Yes, he earned high rank and accomplished much in the Varangian Guard, but he was hardly the protagonist of a Pathfinder RPG session. He was just *one* distinguished actor amongst many in the Empire. DRINK!

27.56: More Harald-worship. The episode is making out as though Harald is the lead figure in the invasion of Sicily. In actuality the expedition was commaned by George Maniakes and Harald, though apparently a senior figure, was hardly the key individual responsible for the conquest. DRINK!

28.05: GAH! The narrator says the Arabs of Sicily decided to remain in their fortress because of the Varangian Guard. The Varangians were only a small component of the expedition, and the military tactic the Arabs practiced was a standard one when confronting a larger army: remove all possible supplies from the country and let disease and hunger reduce the enemy force. DRINK!

28.30: ""Castles, fortified towns actually were rarely taken"". Except for all the times they were. DRINK!

29.23: More Harald-worship. The narrator states that, to capture a fortress, Harald has to devise something new. Again, the Byzantines had a full siege capability already. Stone-throwers, towers, mining, counter-fortifications. The Byzantines had it all, and Harald could teach them *nothing*. DRINK!

30.02: GAH! The episode states it was Harald's idea to dig a tunnel under the walls of the city. GAH! THIS WAS STANDARD MILITARY PRACTICE IN THE REGION! DRINK! BREAK STUFF!

31.29: ""All I said was that Firefly was overrated and there was a good reason it got cancelled!""

33.08: The trick of being wanting to be buried in the church of the city makes for an interesting story, but I doubt the Arabs, with their own history of military subterfuge, were idiots. The account of this event can be read here:

http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Hardrada.html

The problem is, such a reference does not appear in Byzantine sources. Michael Psellos failed to mention it, or Harald, at all:

http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/psellus-chrono06.asp

I take issue with the episode taking what is essentially a Michael Bay equivalent of medieval entertainment at face value. DRINK!

34.09: At this point I cannot take a drink as I am too busy vommiting in disgust.

35.00: F#ck it. I'm sick of Harald and stopping the review here.

So, that was absolutely torturous. See you for the next review!

4zygam,1,2016-08-28,"Financial implications of walking away from a lease where the signer is out of country, and is way behind",rentORrunThrowaway,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4zygam/financial_implications_of_walking_away_from_a/,"While the story of how I got into this position is convoluted, I'll try to summarize as succinctly as possible..

I am currently in my last semester at law school, and for the whole 3 years of it I've been living in a standard apartment with a roommate I met through school. Living wise there is nothing of note to say , we get along and both take care of our own shit.

This all changed this semester however, because my roommate didn't come back from Spain. He worked an internship for some non-profit over the summer and they made him an offer he chose not to refuse. Where that leaves his J.D. or bar passage plans I have no idea.

So far the only contact I've been able to get with him was a brief voicemail where he told me he wouldn't be coming back, and an email with his login to the resident portal for our apartment.

Upon investigating said portal, I find out we are 3 months behind on our rent - to be 4 months in a few days. I've been sending my roommate the money each month by wire like we always have, and not receiving any notice from the landlord...I just assumed it was getting paid. 

Thankfully I'm not actually on the lease or any utilities, and my gut tells me to seriously consider just leaving the space. Getting back to current would be almost $5000...plus they've likely already started eviction preceding, I've just not been served because I'm not on the lease.

So my question to you all is what would be the potential short and long term financial implications of walking out of my situation? While there are no serious criminal charges that I could find, if anyone knows of something I might not have thought of in that realm let me know too. After the bar exam I'll have to go before the character/ethics committee so I dont want to complicate that.

TLDR: Roommate left country(work), wont be back. Living in apartment where the lease/bills/etc are all in his name. Just found out we're 4 months (~$5000) behind.. Should I walk away or try to get back to even...from a short/long term financial perspective.

My Physics professor recommended me this major after my research experience with him. I'm not sure where I should start as right now since I'm not in a University yet and I have no extensive knowledge of what this job entails. I am a sophomore in community college and hope to transfer to UCI where there is now a Data Science program. Here is a list of questions I wish to ask:

- What books should I read to better myself in a Data Science mindset 
- What internships or job opportunities should I search for as a sophomore in CC with a 3.5 GPA. (If any)
- Are there any programming languages anyone highly recommends for the job field?
- Any good books for math review of important formulas (for calc 2 series and stats)
- What can I do to set myself apart from other people of the same major?

I want to note I have only taken two programming courses so far in my life (So one year in total of programming). This is only a basic python course and java course. I will be taking data structures this year. I know this is a lot to answer so answering any of the questions listed above is more than amazing!

I'm a UK-based CS student, just entering my third year. I've got decent internship experience, but no significant personal projects at all. What I do have is a number of smaller projects, almost all in Python.

Things like a small utility that adds C-style DEFINE macros into Python, a program that plays the Wikipedia game with a few different search patterns, and an extremely basic supervised learning learning tool.

None of it is very complicated, it's just vaguely cool-looking stuff. Is it worth chucking it up into the big wide world?"
4zzdy3,1,2016-08-28,I [23/m] feel like I'm not getting enough support from my SO [23/f]. Am I wrong?,repeatuntil,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/4zzdy3/i_23m_feel_like_im_not_getting_enough_support/,"First, some context for you guys: approx. a year ago, being in a 3-year long relationship with my girlfriend, I moved for my graduate studies to a school abroad. The school was a very good opportunity for me, one of the best in the field etc., however the finances were really tight since I didn't get financial aid. My family didn't have enough money, my dad (single parent, I have a sister as well) wanted to work longer hours to make it possible somehow, however there was no chance I was gonna let him do it. However, some people I knew from undergrad studies (are living in the same country where the grad school is) then offered to lend me money (a big part of the sum) and after some convincing from them and my dad I decided to go through with it and accept the offer from the school. My dad at home is still trying to help me as much as he can and save some money aside from working.

Me and my gf decided to try long distance. We are planning our future together after my education and we thought it will be tough being away from each other but we'll make it work. My gf felt depressed when we were separated, so I tried my best to talk to her daily and to make her absolutely sure that I love her and want to make this work. Fast forward one year: I was so busy with trying to do well in school I didn't dedicate myself to social life around here, so haven't made any close friends. I went to like 4 parties in total throughout the year and even though I started to connect with my flatmates at the beginning we kinda disconnected as the exams approached and school started getting harder. I started not spending enough time talking with friends I had back home, which weren't really the type of people who talked about feelings to begin with, so our relationship deteriorated. However I maintained constant communication with my gf. I didn't do any travelling, clothes shopping was a fantasy and the food I ate reflected my budget. Besides all this, I started getting this vibe that my two friends who lent me the money, might have thought I would find a job/internship soon after coming here and  maybe thought I wouldn't borrow much money from them after the first few months. However there was no way I could do an even part time job throughout the school year, exams are in the summer so a job then is also really hard to do, but anyway I found a paid internship for 2 months in the summer, I am trying to make it work in parallel with studying for exams and the financial situation is slightly better (for the current 2 months at least).

All this eventually made me seriously depressed, I left everything back at home, my girlfriend, friends, the parties I could go to, the clothes I could buy from time to time, and now my life literally flipped upside down. My dad and sister were already worried about the lack of money I had around here and they have enough on their plate as it is, so I didnt want to worry them more by talking to them about all the other stuff making me depressed. Then, two months ago, my gf moved to US for a 3 month internship (we are originally from Europe, my new school is in Europe as well). She is a really sociable person so she goes out a lot, meets new people, and finds the whole experience in the US amazing but also new and confusing. She has never lived abroad before so she needed help at the beginning, I researched a lot about life in her current city: simple stuff like public transportation, museums to visit, parties to go to in order to help her adjust and to have fun, as much as I can from here and she appreciated it a lot. In the meantime, my depression started to make me wanting her to dedicate time and effort to talk to me and show her support, to comfort me, reassure me about our common future so I have something I would cling on to.. and then things started to get worse.

She started telling me I am torturing her by telling her about my problems, and she wants me to find other people to talk to. Her solution to me feeling negative about all the problems happening was to cheer up and be positive. She told me that her opinion of me has gotten worse, that I am too negative about life. I really love her, and I hoped her seeing me as emotionally and psychologically at a bad place would make her want to spend more time talking to me because seriously the only thing I need is talking to someone close to me, and at least some reassuring about the future. However, the complete opposite happened, she wanted me to seem positive in our conversations and just tell her that all is ok and will be ok. And when I am feeling fine, things are ok between us, but as soon as I start feeling down in conversations with her, she changes her mood, starts accusing me of pressuring her and not giving her enough support while staying in the US. Most recently, she just told me she feels bad about this relationship and wants to break up.

I don't know if I want the breakup to happen. I seriously don't want to cause anybody to feel bad because of me, especially her with whom I spent 4 years together. So, if she will feel better not being with me I would reluctantly agree to it. However I just feel I should be getting more support from her, but I might be very well be wrong and I really want to know if I that is the case. Maybe I am offloading too much of my concerns to her, and I shouldn't let the pressure I feel about everything get to her? I really need somebody to be there for me right now, but maybe I truly am just letting my negativity pass on to her too much, and because I don't have anyone else close to talk to she is feeling a big part of the weight I feel right now? Should I talk to a therapist or try hard to find a friend who I can talk to about this and not to her this much? 

Thank you guys in advance.

p.s. mayhe this subreddit isn't the right place for this, if so do tell me and I will get out of here. :)"

Is there anything I should do to prepare beforehand? It's a mid-sized start up (around 200 people) working on a SaaS product.

I did a three month internship at a quite different company last summer, but this will be my first long-term role after university. I'd like to really start on the right foot and make a good impression, especially since there's a probationary period.

I'll be working with Rails, which they're aware that I haven't worked with extensively in the past; so I've been refreshing on Ruby and following some Rails tutorials to prepare. Is there anything else I should be doing or thinking about before my first week? And does anyone have any tips or suggestions for working at this sort of company? And what can I expect?"
4zzq2w,136,2016-08-28,3 Months Progress with Recommended Routine-ish + Video of current workout,ShayWhoPlaysAllDay,bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4zzq2w/3_months_progress_with_recommended_routineish/,"Hey reddit!  This summer I went home for an internship and due to the lack of my school gym and weights, I decided I was going to take bodyweight fitness seriously for the next few months. So I went on Amazon, got a pullup bar, dug out the parallettes I made last summer and got to work.  In June, I decided that no matter what, I was going to post a progress (or regress!) post at the end of the summer.  Three months later, this is that post.  

I'll start out with my **video** and my **before and afters**:

[Three Month Progression](https://youtu.be/ENc1LC99XiY)

Beginning of June: http://imgur.com/a/kJ4Wg

End of August: http://imgur.com/a/jVLra

I KNOW MY MIRROR IS DIRTY OK

######My stats:

 | Start | End
---|---|----
Height | 5'8"" | Still 5'8"" :(
Weight | ~155 lbs | 149 lbs
Age | 21 | 21
Sex | Not enough | Still not enough :(

I'm male, haha.  Previous athletic experience is being a Parkour athlete for just under 7 years now and rock climbing on and off for around 4 (maybe 3/4 months out of the year cumulative).

I worked out every other day (Mon Wed Fri) then skipped two days to rest (Sat Sun).  I did the same workout every day.  I never skipped a day.  Here are my workouts at the start and finish:

______________________________________________________________

######Beginning of June:

**3x6 Pullups** *(90 second rest between sets)*

**3x15 Pushups** *(90 second rest between sets)*

*(As much rest as I need to get to 100%)*

**3x10 Rows** *(90 second rest between sets)*

**3x10 Pseudo Planche Pushups** *(90 second rest between sets)*

######End of August:

**3x8 L-sit Pullups** *(90 second rest between sets)*

**3x8 L-sit Tuck Planche Pushups** *(90 second rest between sets)*

*(As much rest as I need to get to 100%)*

**3x10s Advanced Tuck Lever** *(90 second rest between sets)*

**3x8 Feet Elevated Pike Pushups (thanks phatphoeater!)** *(90 second rest between sets)*

______________________________________________________________

So essentially, I structured it by alternating exercises.  So for the End of August section, I would do a set of L-sit pullups, then rest 90 seconds, then do a set of L-sit tuck planche pushups, then rest 90 seconds, then a set of L-sit pullups and repeat until I did 3 sets of each.  Then I rested until I felt good again, then did the same with the second pair of exercises.  I did this to give my exercise-specific muscles extra time to rest so I could operate closer to 100% on each set. 

Feel free to ask for my in-between workouts and progressions and I can go a little more in depth.

######Thoughts:

#####Goals:
My overarching goal this summer was to become stronger while also reducing body fat and becoming easier on the eyes.  Personally, due to being an athlete and also just personal preference, looking better is useless to me if I'm weak and I physically can't do the things I want to do.  Vice versa, I would be a little bummed if I made huge strength gains but didn't look as if I had (I'm trying to get laid just like the rest of us haha!). I'm sure everyone here can relate - I find that on /r/fitness, there's a large population of people who exercise just for the aesthetics (check any ""why do you work out"" post) but no one would do bodyweight fitness if they didn't enjoy it - lifting probably gives faster improvement and is better for legs but I feel like most people do BWF because you can do cool ass shit as you get better and it's just fun haha.

Anyway, I digress. I'm...decently satisfied by my progress.  If my progress was a sandwich and I had to give it a rating it would be like a 7/10 sandwich.  It tastes amazing and the substance is there, but the visual appeal isn't quite where I want it to be.  

#####Strength:
I think I gained strength RAPIDLY over these few months.  When I look at my before workouts, they seem ridiculously easy compared to what I'm doing now.  I do wish I actually made a video for my starting workout because I'm fairly sure it was difficult for me at the time as well.

I didn't have rings and due to living at home, my folks didn't really want me to put too much stress on the doorframe, so I decided to go without and get a little more creative with my exercise choices.  I decided to specifically target planche and front lever work, so the exercises that would have been rings on the Recommended Routine, I switched out for that.

For my rep numbers, I always started with 5 whenever I progressed to the next level.  I progressed when I could do 3x5 of the new progression and it was hard, but I wasn't dying by the end of the 3rd set.  I did sets of 15 and 10 at the start because I didn't really think there was any point to doing any less pushups, but as I got stronger and did harder exercises I made the transition.  As you can see however, as I moved on I tried to set a maximum of 8 reps per set to maximize strength/volume gains.  I'm glad the summer was as short as it was, because I wasn't really sure where to go after this set of exercises.  I wanted to do weighted pullups and dips but didn't want to fuck up the doorframe/parallettes so decided to wait until I got back to school.

I didn't do legs at all.  I squat and deadlift pretty regularly up at school but it all goes to shit during the summer.

#####Aesthetic:
I'll be honest, I'm not too happy with my progress aesthetically.  It's good, but it could definitely have been better.  I know I look better and I feel a ton stronger and better, but my diet really killed me this summer.  With the strength progress I made, I think my gains would have been much more visible had I actually faithfully stuck to eating minimally and healthy.  However, what I am happy about are my...ratios?  I think everything is developing nicely and as my muscles grow more defined, I like the way everything is set up and I think I'm doing a nice job of ensuring that I don't have any imbalances.  Feel free to disagree - I appreciate the advice!  As someone who has only ever worked out for strength gains, I'm open to the aesthetics advice.  Also, it's difficult to formulate an unbiased opinion on myself and I do have a tendency to never be satisfied...so let me know if y'all think I'm being too hard on myself haha.

#####Diet:
Like I said, this is what killed me.  I mostly just ate what my mom cooked and since I'm putting myself through school I didn't have the luxury of spending all my money on my own separate meals.  We also had a family friend stay with us for a good portion of the summer and so ended up eating out and making desserts at home a fair amount.  I could've gotten healthy foods and all while we were out at restaurants, but honestly I just wanted to enjoy it as I don't eat that nicely too often.  Unfortunately that means I don't get to enjoy dem gainz haha.  

While I am a little bummed though, I did enjoy making all the food we made and ate and I don't really regret it.  Those memories were what really matters and I think it's easier to fix a couple months of bad eating than remake good times!

Moving forward however, I'm at school now so I have better control on what I'm eating.  Grilled chicken and veggies all day erry day.

#####Flexibility:
Yeah nothing to write home about here.  Still have dick for flexibility as you can see from my pitiful L-sit stuff and have made no effort to stretch due to hating every second of it and not even knowing where to start.  I'll regret it down the line when I get an injury.  I really need to get my ass in gear and start working on this or join a yoga class or something.  I wish there was a Starting Flexibility or some sort of guide to a stretch routine.  Any and all help is appreciated.


#####Next Steps:
Like I said, I'm at school now and have access to weights, so I'll definitely start doing legs again.  My squat and deadlift were at about 3 plates each in December and I studied abroad last semester so after resting a little cliff jumping heel injury it's time to go see how much those numbers have dropped since then :(

I'm going to make myself a little routine based on mixing bodyweight and lifting stuff for legs which I haven't really figured out yet, but it's going to involved weighted pullups and dips for sure, and I realized the other day I can do about 5 muscleups so I'm going to start working on those more as well.  I also really want to get into Oly lifting this semester so we'll see where that goes.  Of course, I'll also keep training my main bitch parkour and maybe join the rock climbing team as well if things go well.
___________________________________________________________________

Also this didn't really fit in anywhere else, but finally I want to stress how little time it makes to make progress.  This entire workout took probably about 30 minutes from start to finish and I was really happy with my strength progress and still pretty happy with my aesthetic progress, and I know if I actually stuck to my diet it would've been better!  I was out of the house for my internship from 6AM - 6:30PM every single weekday and slept at 8:30PM every night to make sure I got enough sleep, and still found time to work out in my 3 hours of free time while also pursuing other hobbies and spending time with family and friends.  So you guys can do it.

Well.  That's that everyone.  I know I wrote a novel but hopefully it wasn't dreadful to read.  I hope you guys enjoyed my progress and I appreciate any and all criticism and commentary.  It would mean a ton.  Also if anyone read this and felt inspired to get started that would be so sick to me - I pretty much was athletically inactive until I found Parkour in the 10th grade, so when I started living healthy it literally changed my life.  I really hope I can help someone else do the same and that's why I felt like making this post!  Cheers everyone.  Looking forward to the next progress post.

I don't want to help him because he has made mean, inappropriate comments at me. Am I being an idiot or should I stand my ground.",MekaniskQ,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zzwel/my_25f_teacher_is_threatening_to_do_a_bad_social/,"I'm a girl from Scandinavia.
I'm studying to become, well, I don't know what is it called in English but it is something along the lines of an mechanical engineer. The school I go to is small, but pretty prestigious. I'm the only girl in a classroom of about 60 people.

Ever since day one, there's this other student I've had a problem with, or well, he has a problem with me. I'll refer to him as ""Ken"".
Ken has made some pretty inappropriate comments at me and has been quite mean to me.
He seems to think girls shouldn't be doing this kind of jobs. He has never outright said so, it is just the feeling I get from him.

At some point in the beginning of the first semester, our class was in the school workshop doing small projects. Ken and I had been put in a group together. I was drilling some holes into a sheet of wood, while doing this Ken pulled the drill out of my hands and told me he was going to do it instead.
I was pretty mad because, as anyone with half a brain would guess, what he did was dangerous, I could have gotten hurt. 
He kept telling me I was doing it wrong, I wasn't, like it somehow justified his action. Once I moved from my spot to do something else, he muttered ""go back to where you belong"". I don't think I was supposed to hear that.
In the following days Ken spread lies about how I was doing everything wrong in the project and the group constantly had to help me. 

I had episodes like that with him for the most of the first semester. I talked to our classcoach about it, but since none of the episodes was really ever specific enough to really pinpoint as bullying I was told to simply ignore him and avoid him. Which I did.
The following semesters, I didn't really have any problems with him.  We didn't interact much and was never put in any groups together.

Fast forward to this semester, I suddenly get an email from Ken asking me to help him with some of last semesters subjects. Everyone knows Ken did horrible last semester, a lot of people did.
I email him back a simple ""no"". I found out he had been emailing all of the people I was grouped up with last semester, and everyone told him to ask me for help because they felt I was the only one who actually know what I was doing (it is my strongest subject).

Then he starts bothering me at school, continually asking me to help him out. I keep telling him no. He asks me ""do we have a problem or something?"", like he has no idea why I don't want to help.
I ask him ""Are you serious?"" and then starts recounting a few of our previous episodes. He tells me he is sorry.
I tell him I don't know whatever he is honest or nor, but I don't really care. He knew at the time I didn't like how I was treating me and he never apologized. Actions has consequences and now he has to live with those consequences.

The following day my classcoach asks me to talk. He tells me Ken had told him about the situation and that I should accept his apology and help him out. 
I pretty much repeated what I said to ken, that I don't think it is about an apologize, it is about Ken's behavior being unacceptable and my behavior being a subsequent consequence.  
My classcoach said people should be allowed a second chance and once I finished school I would have to learn to work with people I didn't always like.
I said Ken had had plenty of ""second chances"" and that I don't think a student asking me to mentor him was anything like a work relation.
Then my classcoach said, unless I started acting like an adult, I would get a bad social report. A social report is pretty much a small report from your school which is used once you have to find an internship, a poor social report means your chances of getting an internship is poor too.

Now tell me, am I being a complete idiot? Am I being wrong when I don't feel like helping a guy whose behavior has been unacceptable because he suddenly turns around and tells me he is sorry?

Tl;DR - I either have to mentor a guy I hate a school, or loose my chances of getting a good internship."

Despite the historical significance of the investigation against Nixon, Clinton was able to as a lowly intern make Senators and senior investigators bend to her will and argue that Nixon shouldn't have an attorney during his hearings.

Then, through some plot so devious even her harshest critics are unable to imagine what exactly it was she pulled off, Clinton rigged the cattle futures market to make a fortune.

Hillary was the true decision maker behind her husband's presidency, getting multiple people to go to prison to protect her criminal actions in land deal (because, you know, losing money in real estate is obviously criminal unless you're Trump.) She also, through unnamed connections to expert level assassins, murdered all her enemies. She was so ruthless she even murdered her best friend, yet so professional she did it in a way that six separate investigations found it to be suicide.

Next on her agenda was, naturally, incarcerating as many Democratic voters as possible. She then tricked much of the Democratic Party, including a number of members of the Black Caucus, to vote for her devious plan. Only 25 years later did it become clear that her attempts to imprison ""super-predators"" was not a term referring to the worst of the worst, but to all black people.

Next, she became a Senator and caused the Iraq War to happen while simultaneously making everyone except future voters who were ages 4-10 at the time think it was entirely Bush's idea.

As Secretary of State she stepped up her game. First, she disguised the Clinton Foundation to make people think it was giving AIDs relief to 11 million people when in fact it just gave huge salaries to her friends. Then she used government, even parts she had no say in whatsoever like Uranium mining bids, to go to donors of the charity, err, I mean her personal wallet disguised as a charity.

Meahwhile, she joined forces with the President to found ISIS and to engage in illegal arms deals.

One day, for no other reason than pure bloodlust, she thought ""wouldn't it be great if my ambassador to Libya was murdered?"" and she made it happen. But she did it so skillfully 97 (rough estimate) different investigations failed to find any dirt on her.

She also found a way to take a common email practice, make a small change, and turn it into the most evil practice in government of all time. Her mesmerizing power was so vast that all the people who sent or received emails with her .org email address didn't realize she wasn't using a .gov server for years and years later. All of Washington had been brainwashed.

On the side, she also figured out a way to be just as destructive as Iraq with Libya, but without using ground troops and only doing it in a few short weeks.

After she left office, she worked out these deals where banks paid her more money than she possibly deserved for speeches where she promised to devote government to Wall Street and destroy the lives of college students. The rooms were so impressed that not a single person has come out publicly and spilled the beans. And God knows what kind of evil promises she made the University of Buffalo or the American Camping Association.

Next she rigged the primary elections in her favor. She did this partly by getting the DNC to rig the elections for her (keeping 100% of the rigging off of their internal emails in case one day they were hacked by civil-minded individuals who totally aren't Russian). One example of how skillfully she pulled this off was in Arizona, where she (despite no polls showing this) realized this was the one state where Latino voters preferred Sanders, and somehow got the Republicans running things at the local level to deny them the proper number of polling locations.

In short, in office, out of office, Republican, Democrat, it doesn't matter...Clinton controlled it all. She is responsible for everything the military has done, she is responsible for everything ISIS has done, she runs everything. She murders her close friends domestically and her top ambassadors on the other side of the globe and tens of millions of dollars of investigations can never get a single bit of dirt on her.

In short, I am voting for Hillary Clinton because without a doubt she is the biggest badass in American history, bar none. Arguably the biggest badass of all time. I mean, even Julius Caesar wasn't able to secretly control Marc Antony.

Oh yeah, also she's extremely careless."

So I've been applying for jobs, with some renewed confidenxe in myself. But then I go LinkedIn just to scout some previous hires of some companies I've been applying to. Then I get this overwhelming feeling of failure, mediocrity and just want to stop. Some guys have had countless internships etc... And experiences which I simply don't have. So I get hugely demoralised again and just don't apply for certain companies... Then bang im slowly falling back into those days of just feeling shit about myself and in unworthy and these no point in trying.

This next course I'm finishing college. I will only have one class, plus my final degree dissertation and an internship. I should be pleased with this, since I have spent four years complaining about how much college work I had.

But instead I am filled with dread. I fear that having too much free time I'll start ruminating on my life. Every summer, when the classes finish and I stop having to meet people everyday, I get somewhat gloomy and depressed, even though I go out with my friends. I fear that next year it's going to be just that but much worse and for much longer, since I'm going to have very little social interaction during the weekdays.

I'm going to try to counteract this feelings by joining some language classes. I want to get some certifications on English, German and Italian, so that should keep me busy, but I'm afraid that this won't be enough, and that at some point I'll get depressed, I'll give up on all those goals and feel miserable. 

Do you have any advice on how to go though this?

501kiy,42,2016-08-28,Exhibitionist Challenge,J80_1027,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/501kiy/exhibitionist_challenge/,"Two years ago, I was in the middle of a relationship with a really cute guy who had quite a big dick, and he was hot in bed to match.

He told me stories about how he got fucked in the gardens on campus one time, and also how he fucked a guy in the backseat of a car on top of a parking deck in the rain after the club.

Being so young I had never had an experience like that, and it made me a little envious because I definitely have an exhibitionist side. I wanted things to get a little bit more fun, even though him breeding me on the regular was all I really needed. I asked him if we could send each other dirty pictures with each one getting riskier and riskier.

He wasn't keen on the idea at first, but I sent him two dick pics in the following days (one while driving, and another while at the urinal of a public restroom). He responded with how hot they were, and out of the blue that Saturday sent one with his hard dick out while driving.

Over the next year or so we kept it up and we produced a lot of hot material. He sent me a photo of him on all fours with ass spread in front of the doorway, with the front door open. I sent him a photo with my dick out of the fly of my work pants while sitting at my desk at my internship. He responded with a similar one from his manager's desk.

I started wearing jockstraps to work and would drop my pants and would take pictures of my framed ass at the urinals and in front of the mirrors of the office bathroom. Not to mention I worked on one of the busiest floors and more often than not every stall would be occupied.

He took the work bathroom idea and took it to the next level. He stripped completely and took full body photographs of him fully erect with the stall door wide open. Then he walked over to the mirror while still completely hard and nude and snapped a photo and sent it to me - no clothes in sight.

I went for a run in the park, grabbed my fleshjack and stuffed it into a drawstring bag. On a trail, I whipped out my hard dick and snapped a few pictures in my jock, then stuck my dick in the fleshjack and snapped a few pictures. This eventually led to my hiking fleshjack photos that I recently posted.

He took a similar idea and ran with it, literally. He went running one early evening through a few neighborhoods near him. He found a house in a subdivision that was currently under construction. He walked in and stripped to nothing but his shoes and snapped a picture. When I saw it I nearly came on the spot.

Later on he sent me a video of him crouching in the brush of neighboring subdivision, in nothing but his running shoes, tugging a quick one while the sun was going down. He shot everywhere. I was as impressed as I was aroused.

I was taking summer classes to finish college early, and decided to get back on campus to do some studying and also try to one-up his recent escapades. I brought my new dildo along in my backpack (Fort Troff Sticky Bomb 6.5 (6.5"" insertable, 5.5"" girth)). Taking a break from studying, I went to the men's restroom to pee. I noticed it was empty, so I walked into the last stall, stripped to my jockstrap and just a shirt. I pulled out my dildo, stuck it to the stall divider, put a condom on it (easier clean up), and lubed it up. I recorded myself fucking my ass with it, in an open multi-stall bathroom at 11:00am. (I've unfortunately lost the video, but it racked up quite a couple thousand likes and reblogs on tumblr. I only have a screenshot from it.) When I showed him the video in person, he told me to pull out the dildo and fuck him with it. 

Our relationship has since ended, but I honestly think about our sex and the challenge quite often. We did flip-fuck in the botanical gardens, and we also jacked off in the back of an empty classroom where he shot his load on my dick.

I'm starting to do this again and would love a new challenge partner, or would love to hear about anyone else's exhibitionist experiences. If you do decide to do something similar, be safe, mindful, and always aware of your surroundings!"

I use canes to get around and have minor Ballance issues. These generally haven't held me back in school or lab environments; however, in a past internship I was pidgeon holed into  sitting only jobs in a lab environment.

 When all the other newbie interns were being trained on lab equipment I was given an ""important"" coding project that lasted the length of everyone else's training rotations. When that project ran out I was getting busywork while everyone else was doing lab work. When I asked to do anything lab related I was thrown a project with no instruction or training, which all the other interns had before working on real projects, and the project i given was a ""don't fuck this up"" type project. When I took too long and asked for help I was told no one had time to train me, and I was sent back to BS work with everyone feeling justified in their assumptions of my uselessness. 

Obviously I fucked up by not heading this off earlier, but how should I deal with this when I start a real job? I am worried anything I say like ""if you think I might have trouble doing something ask me first please"" might make hr afraid of lawsuits, or come off as accusatory. Help?"
5023l6,1,2016-08-28,"Having Second Thoughts About My Job - New Boss, Possibly Better Opportunities?",concernedfullstack,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5023l6/having_second_thoughts_about_my_job_new_boss/,"A little bit about me. I do post on here on occasion and lurk, but I need to use a throwaway for this one to avoid being identified. I graduated from a state school in December with a degree in IT, focused on web development, minoring in CS and Business. Since May of 2015, I had been interning at a marketing agency in my city, getting paid a reasonable wage and working on a major project for their top client. I was offered a job with said agency straight out of college, and after some negotiation, took it. I make $55K as a Full Stack Developer, working on a team of 3 developers including a lead. I also work closely with creative and business development, and in a way also take orders from their managers.

For the most part, I don't have an issue with the place I work. My co-workers are nice for the most part, despite a lot of cliques and silos existing in the workplace. The CEO absolutely loves what I do and praises me often, although he tends to run his mind very fast and act on ideas without much thought, which causes the other managers of the organization at times to come into conflict in attempts to calm him down.

The main point that is making me rethink my decision to stay with the company is my direct supervisor. When I began as an intern last summer, she was very nice, included me with every decision, every activity, always giving fist bumps and pats on the back to myself and my co-workers, and taking us out for food/social events/etc. She then stepped down from her position due to her feeling too much stress, and our division director took over managing our team. This guy is awesome, calm, cool, experience with our organization, and friendly - almost father-like to our team. Things are going incredibly well with him until late June when he left to become a director at an oil company.

With his departure, my old department supervisor takes over our team again, but this time with less actual day-to-day work responsibility and a focus on management instead full-time. Since she took over again, I noticed her attitude, especially towards me, has changed. She is personal friends with the other developer on our team and they are working on massive R&amp;D projects together, and they seem close both in and outside of work. Her attitude towards me has become less personable, more rigid, and she is nitpicky about ideas that I propose. She argues that we ""need to be our own worst critics"", but I feel that the feedback is not being delivered with tactfulness. When I or the other developer have given feedback to her, she has often responded seeming personally offended and defensive.

I have also noticed what seems to be not-so-good circumstances internally. For example, our HR director (who I've met with regarding some of my concerns) drunkenly admitted to me during a conversation at a social event a while back that our company only has 12-18 months of capital left - we are expanding, but our revenue stream at the moment is not to account for it. In addition, there is somewhat of a tone of desperation amongst management for all of us to try and create things to attract new clientele. We are currently dependent on one client's retainer and the rest of our clients do not utilize us as much, only on an hourly as-needed basis.

At the same time, two recent opportunities came my way to become a software developer at other companies. One recruiter recently contacted me about a position they have at an area non-profit organization that is stable, has better benefits, and helps a cause I believe in. The starting pay would be much higher than I make right now. Also, an agency recently contacted me about putting my resume out for me to potentially relocate and work on contract for organizations that fit my skill set. I eventually want to start a company of my own, and am working on some things on the side, but we all need money to survive - I still live with my mom, but I have student loan debt and other debt to pay down before going out on my own.

I am feeling conflicted in my mind as to what to do. I am planning on polishing up my resume and sending it to the recruiters for the heck of it. I just feel like I deserve a better employment experience and that I am capable of getting better. Any thoughts from more experienced professionals would definitely be appreciated. Thank you."

And that's about it, at least for now. I know that I don't have much going for myself except for the GPA, which isn't that great in the first place. Anyways, I'm going into my third year into my bachelor's and this semester I want to start looking into internships. So my question is, given my educational background, what companies do yall think I should look into for internship positions here in texas. Other than the location, my preferences are either programming or web development, and that's about it."

Or it's a Google image search photo of RDJ from back in the day. And most of the ""memes"" are low quality, iFunny and 9gag jokes with potato quality resolution.

And all the posts have comments that actually think it's really him, and they say ""I love you!"" ""Greatest actor"" etc. It's really sad to be giving them false hope like that. And I'm pretty sure RDJ has never replied to any post on his social medias except maybe once in a blue moon, and even then, it's to a random marvel actor or official company twitter.

Some people may say, ""Oh, he's a busy guy, he doesn't have time for that."" or ""Why should he care about a little facebook page?""

Well, celebrities with upwards of over 50-100 million followers run their own pages and reply to comments, and RDJ only has about 25 million or so. Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, etc, run their own pages, they interact, *they care*.

If he's not gonna run the pages, if he's not gonna care about the quality of the posts, then why should he have them? It gives people false hope and makes him look bad.

His page's should all be renamed ""*The Official Robert Downey Jr. Fan Page*.

After 3 months on the hunt, I finally received my first job offer on Thursday from a global design, engineering and management consulting company in the midwest 1.5hr from where I live now. Great news!! BUT here's my issue: I'm in the process of interviewing and hearing back from two other opportunities, both in government. If I don't give my response in 3 business days (tomorrow), this offer will be rescinded. I tried to negotiate this, but they were firm on it. I reached out two the two other job positions to see if I could expedite hearing their choice for a candidate, but because its government that process is very hard to speed up and they said the best they can do is by the end of next week. 

My internships were both with one of the government agencies I'm waiting on. I have no experience with consulting, therefore don't know if I'll be good at it or like it at all. I'm really outgoing and love working in teams and being out in the field. Though I consider myself an ""engineer"" I'm not the most technical... new concepts don't always click immediately for me. I had to try really fucking hard in college and really worked for the grades I received (3.3gpa). Not sure if this is useful information for determining what career is best for me. I really enjoyed the people who interviewed me, the type of projects I'd be working on, and am intrigued by the company that made the offer. I think it would be a great opportunity to network and learn a ton. But, I can't help to feel anxious about the possibility of getting offers from the other options. One of them is an amazing opportunity with the US Forest Service in California. The other is with the same agency I interned with in Washington. Deep down I know I want to get out of the midwest and move out west (PNW or Cali), but moving across the country would be super stressful right now because I'm broke and still need to buy a car. I honestly feel like I have a chance at getting an offer from one of them, but I feel like it would be ignorant not to accept the offer I have now because there is a chance I won't get an offer from either. I think the most intelligent choice economically is to accept the offer I have, but I'm still so anxious and unsure. ooooh the paradox of choice... Any advice would be appreciated. As of this moment I'm going to accept the offer. Am I making the right choice? Any suggestions on a compromise? Thanks so much"

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

503bhs,5,2016-08-29,How do I find enjoyment/passion for Comp Sci?,ungespieltT,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/503bhs/how_do_i_find_enjoymentpassion_for_comp_sci/,"Okay so quick background: Had intentions to do computer science in college, so I took it asap. Took comp sci 1 in winter quarter, took 2 in spring quarter. It was basically just java programming using ""building java programs"". Here's my issue: I still don't know much about what it's like to be a software dev, (I've learned what a day is like, but not about how I will use what I learn will contribute to what I would build. Most of that seems confidential, obviously) and I guess I only know the basics. Anyways, my college STEM group announced in the spring that there will be a brief internship that I can do to experience computer science and will be a project that is related to gaming and another one about some topic that isn't decided. Anyone could come and we would learn how to contribute as a team and succeed. Well, the internship was CANCELLED. I don't see how they think we'll find out if this is for us if we can't ever experience any kind of non-class-related stuff. That seems to be what internships are looking for now, because the summer internships I applied to didn't even respond for one fucking interview. I never really enjoyed comp sci class, it never really came easily to me, but it seems like such a desirable career these days and from my experience talking to microsoft devs they are really happy with their jobs. So my question is: What am I missing? Comp sci class was basically just practice problems, no real understanding of how this all works. No learning of how to work in a team, blah blah blah, other stuff. So I'm lost because I'm starting my second year of college, have tried C# and more java, and simply don't know how to find if this is for me. And even though I didn't earn the internship promised to me, I was going to let this determine whether or not this is all for me. And I was fucking excited to do this. Now I'm just sitting here confused. Trying to learn C# has been confusing/boring, and now I'm just out of answers. I want to proceed in computer science, but I'm just so confused. I'm going in circles, and can't really point my finger to the question I'm asking. I just hope this story is something someone can give advice to. "

So I've just recently completed my internship as social media manager where I was given $25 a day for Business Manager on FB. Over the period, the boss wanted me to 'create adverts' which we did. Struggling with the 20% rule, we finally created a few decent adverts and we launched them. These adverts were a CTA to check out our latest offer. 

Meanwhile, I was curious and spent $5 a day on boosting. I would use the same advert design except use text because 20% rule wasn't applicable and have a link beneath to our offer page.

After a few weeks, Adverts had the highest reach and highest amount of CTR. However, the CTR on my boosted posts were very slightly less.  (About 1.2x more on adverts yet we spent 4x more). 

Also judging from Google Analytics, the traffic that came from boosted posts had a bounce rate of 38% and average duration of about 1:33 min. Meanwhile, the advert with the same audience, the traffic had a bounce rate of 88% and average duration of about 0.08 seconds.

I'm honestly confused with this data. I looked around about this what type of advertising works best on FB and judging from what I see people stating, 'boosting' seems to work better.

What are your thoughts? I'm planning on launching my own product soon and I'm just curious how to maximise my performance."

504kc0,0,2016-08-29,[Relationships] Am I [M21] being unreasonable wanting more from my long distance girlfriend [F21]?,nighttimereddit,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/504kc0/relationships_am_i_m21_being_unreasonable_wanting/,"Sorry in advance for this long and rambling post. My girlfriend and I have been dating since we were 15/16. I'm at uni, she's graduated now, and I have 2 years left. We broke up in second year because I was struggling with suicidal impulses and at the time I didn't really know how I felt about her. Shortly after (maybe a month if that) we got back together because I came to my senses and realised how much I missed her. 


We broke up again at the beginning of winter (for the southern hemisphere, we're from NZ) because I got my dream internship in the US (OK). Initially, she was going to come and live with me, but when my grandfather began to die, I realised that I would have to live with my grandmother to help her, and I didn't feel it was fair to ask my gf to join me  and she made it clear she'd be unwilling to do so. 


We parted on good terms, both still very in love with the other. Aaaaand then I broke the golden rule and I contacted her. We both still had feelings for each other agreed to give long distance a try on a number of conditions:


- I would be more open with my feelings 

- I would be more affectionate (I didn't used to put kisses at the end of texts or say ""I love you"" 

- she would send me more explicit photos. I made this a condition of us getting back together because we did LDR before, and I struggled with the lack of intimacy, and I see this as the closest I can get. I suppose on some level it's also important for my self image, as knowing she wants me is important to me, and in my mind, her sending me photos is a pretty clear message for that. 


She agreed to all of these. To begin with, everything was great. Regular texts, pictures of what she was doing, food she was eating, and some explicit ones mixed in. I was on cloud nine, and I feel I kept my end of the bargain; 90% of my messages had kisses and I always signed off by telling her I loved her. I've kept this going; I do really love her so it's not really an issue. I don't know why I had such issues before. 



It very quickly began sliding. Now, 3 months in she barely messages me on the day to day. I feel like I'm harassing her just to be part of her life. She constantly tells me she's sorry but she's too busy with work (this is her first full time job, and there's a not insignificant time difference, meaning that we often miss out on me phoning her) but she seems to forget that I'm also working a full time job, with more hours than her, and I go out of my way to message her,  even if it's something stupid I saw online that I think she'd like. I still feel like she loves me, and I'm still very much in love with her, but I feel like she's not making the time for me. I message her normally once in the morning, once at night, and if I have the chance, during my day as well. 


She's also mentioned she feels self conscious about her body, and told me not to ask for photos, and just be happy with the ones I get, which I would be fine with... If she sent *any*. 


I've tried talking to her a number of times about how I want more messages from her and how I need her to send more pictures. When we got back together I really emphasised how important this is to me. I've tried even asking for just normal photos of what she's doing in her day to day life, nothing sexual. She always says yes, and then doesn't send any. She doesn't seem to understand how important this is to me. I  feel so detached from her life, and I'm struggling. I do love her, and I see a future with her. 


I've been working  up to giving her the ultimatum of more messages and photos (seriously, even just PG ones),  or I end it, because honestly, I feel like I'm a platonic friend. I hear more about what my other friends are up to via Facebook or whatever. The only pictures I've received in the past 3 weeks have been the ones she put on her snapchat story. In contrast, I send her and only her photos of things in enjoying or things I think she'd like. 


What I was to ask you guys is this: am I being unreasonable? How often do you all express wanting your SO? How often do you guys get/send nudes? Am I the douche? If you're in an LDR, how often do you talk? 


**tl;dr: LDR, want more communications and nudes from my gf. I might be being unreasonable.**"

I found an internship and a part time job and my own apartment in Baltimore, and things were great. We were working through the issues in our relationship, we were getting along, everything seemed so perfect. He practically moved into my apartment, he rarely left. 

I considered moving home to PA because my mom was sick, but I was so happy with him there. On the 4th of July, I went home to visit my mom, and things exploded. She took my car, my phone, and kicked me out of her house. Moving home was no longer an option.

At the same exact time, my landlord told me they sold their place and I could no longer rent there. I was supposed to have it until the end of August, but on July 8th I was forced to move out (landlord literally changed the locks). 

I moved into my boyfriends parents house. The two of us were cramped into his tiny bedroom for two months. Things did not go well. I couldn't find a job for an entire month (lost my previous one when all the shit around the 4th of july went down.). I didn't have a car to get to a job even if I found one. I was very depressed and upset. My boyfriend did a great job comforting and supporting me.

Then things drastically changed. On August 3rd, my birthday, I could tell things were off. He didn't get me a birthday present or wish me happy birthday at all, and that's when I noticed a personality change in him. I had a job now, and got my car back from my mom as well as my old phone. I thought I was getting it together but my relationship was falling apart without me noticing. 

There were several instances where he wouldn't come home when he said he would, once I cried while he played on his phone uninterested in me, and he stopped cuddling with me at night. I started to think about ending things but I didn't want to move home and was stuck.

The final straw happened last Thursday. He dropped acid and drove home, telling me it was ""no big deal"", he ""did his research"" and that I needed to stop being so anxious, worry about my own business not others, and that my anxiety, sadness and insecurity brought him down. I packed my car and left. He refused to speak to me about the issue, instead telling me he wasn't going to argue with me.

Now I'm back in my moms house. This is not a healthy place for me to be. I hate my hometown. I never felt like I fit in here, I had trouble making friends in high school and as an adult. My hometown is a farming town, and I just don't have much in common with these people it seems. I found better, longer lasting friends in my three months living in the city with my boyfriend than I did in 21 years living at home. 

I'm considering finding a place in Baltimore and moving there. My job has been so nice and is holding my spot for me but I only have another day or so to decide. I want to move back to Baltimore because I feel it is where I belong, but I don't want to upset my family. My family wanted me to move back home all summer. I love being close to family, but this is not where I belong. 

I do not have any interest in rekindling my relationship with my ex. I just love the city, and want to be on my own down there.

What do I do?

I tried searching this sub for people in my position, but it seems like a majority of the people asking for advice have either already graduated or are about to. I think I still have a little more time, which is why I wanted some guidance while I'm still early in my undergraduate. I have currently started my sophomore year in college, and I am majoring in Computer Science. My freshman performance was painfully average: I got a GPA of 3.3 overall, 3.4 major. Of course, I will try moving this up to at least a 3.7 by the time of graduation.

But besides this, is there anything else I should be working on? I've read some posts here saying I should get involved with research, and I have contacted some of my professors about this. Is one or two semesters of research good enough? And is it better to work on research your junior or senior year, when you work on more advanced topics?

I have had two internships so far (both coding), one for a start up and one for a mid-tier Fortune 500 company. I have performed alright, I think my boss in the bigger company would give me a letter of recommendation. I will of course try getting more internships, and will probably work for two or so years after college before applying to grad school. Also, whose letters of recommendations are preferred? Professors, employers? If I had to get an employer's letter of recommendation, does it have to be someone very recent (my last job or two) or is an employer from 5 or 6 years ago still a good idea?

I am currently looking into an MS, but I have still not completely removed the possibility of pursuing an MBA. I love business as much as science. Will technical jobs and research still help in getting admission into a good MBA program? Or would you have to get experience from more business-oriented jobs?

Finally, where were you guys at this stage in college? I know so far my GPA is very average, but I think I have good work experience for someone only entering his second year. How about you?

Thanks for all the help, guys!

EDIT: Also, as asked in a comment below, when should I start preparing for my GRE/GMAT? If I want to pursue an MBA, I will need 2 or 3 years of work experience, so I could study during that time. Though this isn't the case for MS. "

505dul,47,2016-08-29,"Only you guys get this huge part of me! I rebelled so hard, glad Church didn't break me.",BeeSmirk,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/505dul/only_you_guys_get_this_huge_part_of_me_i_rebelled/,"I'm a 27F. Finding this sub is really trying to get me to understand my own experience and bit unsettling...reading everyone's stories...MAN my eyes have been opened. I'm finding out that things weren't just in my head for being a bad believer. 

 My mom married my stepdad when I was 5 and we began going to his Northeast USA Baptist church every Sunday. I'd also go every Friday for youth group. Church was fun until I hit puberty, and then shit hit the fan and would be bored to tears. I began to realize that the people I had been friends with weren't that interesting, and isolated myself from them because we had nothing in common. I began to get called ""Devil Worshipper"" and was accused of being on drugs several times (I wasn't).

Church camp trips continued and I really liked a summer I spent at the Word of Life camp in upstate New York....but only because of all the great activities and trying to find a boy to make out with.

(**If anyone went to this or Snow Camp, I'd LOVE to talk more about your experience.**)

At 16 I told my Youth Pastor I didn't like him and thought he was an idiot.  The look on his face was PRICELESS as I bent back over my 2005 iPod and continued to play solitaire. Church leaders stopped trying to engage me. My peers kept calling me a Satanist, and no one tried to get me to take a True Love Waits vow. Which in hindsight, is kinda insulting. They just assumed I was headed down a dark path. 

Mornings before leaving for church were super stressful and I rebelled right up until moving out. They were filled with aggression and yelling from my Stepdad (who would also say awful things to me on a regular basis), and would continue in the car ride to church. Once we got there, the switch was flipped and he was Mr. Smiley Nice Guy to everyone. This routine continued until I went away to school and moved out at 22. 

I once tried to get one of my few church friends to be my roommate in college and she was all about it...until a church lady told her I was a bad influence, on drugs, and that living with me would be a TERRIBLE choice. My friend then got weird around me and we had a falling out. I was a homebody honor roll student with high profile internships and a promising career. 

Since then my mom often tells me to find a church, telling me about to find a bible study, or do SOMETHING with God. I still pray occasionally and consider myself spiritual, but church doesn't feel right. I can't tell her about my problems or talk to her because her favorite response is to ""pray about it"". 

Christianity has a strange role in my life. I'm REALLY into reading the memoirs of people who have escaped religions or cults. While my experience wasn't that extreme, I can relate to someone trying to control you.

Her latest tactic is to try to get me to go to these new churches that are supposed to be hip, with young people and other trying too hard elements. The BEST one so far is one that has food trucks in the parking lot after service. Mom really thinks she can convince me with that. 

Later learned my biggest tormentor is gay. She was a huge bible thumping, take pics with African kids, mission trip enthusiast that loved asking everyone for money.

**TL;DR: New Stepdad brought my mom and I to his Baptist Church. Hit puberty and rebelled, only to be continually degraded and forced to go. Told a church leader he was an idiot and finally got left alone. Mom thinks free form churches with food trucks will lure me back in.**"

505u7h,3,2016-08-29,[19M] My depression &amp; insecurities are ruining my relationship [19F]. Need an action plan,throwaway32361,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/505u7h/19m_my_depression_insecurities_are_ruining_my/,"Throwaway for the usual reasons

So we have a long distance relationship (10 months) and see each other approximately once every 3 weeks during uni term time. When she's back we try to make it around once/twice a week.

Unfortunately we hit a bump about 2 months ago where her messages would be less frequent and with less...dunno how to put it...energy? We dated before this and she broke up with me by slowly messaging less and less i.e. a slow death. So it was understandable that I felt worried. After not seeing her for 6 weeks we met and I slept over at hers. I asked if she wanted to have sex but she said she wanted to go to sleep as she was tired. Considering it had been 6 weeks this baffled me. So I asked her what was up and she said a lot of stuff. Basically she said that it wasn't someone else but said she wanted some ""space"" to think things through but still wanted to stay together. 

I was devastated, but I made sure to minimise the pain by deleting her off all social media so I never had triggers that reminded me of her. She was going back to uni for a week to party and stuff as her course was too intensive for her to have time for that during term time. She found out I'd deleted her and got extremely worried. Tried calling me a few times but I didn't have my phone on me at the time. Left a voicemail asking me if she's ruined everything. I messaged her telling her that it was just a safety measure for myself and that everything was fine.

I felt so lonely for the first week but after that I felt kind of ok with being ""single"". I assumed we were breaking up which surprisingly helped a lot.

After ~2 weeks of space we met and she was still undecided. Apparently I'm her best friend and we have too much in common for her to lose me. She said she's not good with romantic gestures and felt bad since I'm quite romantic to her. She also said she likes having space to chill and be lazy and not have to worry about replying to messages and stuff. She also said she ""can't give me the attention I deserve"" and that she's selfish. She felt guilty about how much she was hurting me and said she's hesitant to keep going incase this happens again and it doesn't work out and she hurts me even more. I told her I'd rather hurt for a bit than regret for a while so we stayed together.

Then she started making an effort to meet up more and stuff but I was leaving for London on a 6 week internship so timing was bad. She came to visit on the 4th week and we had a lovely weekend. Things, looking objectively, are definitely better and we've learned to communicate a little better. 

However now there's a feeling of distance that wasn't there before the bump. At the start of the relationship she was so affectionate and loving, and reciprocated my feelings exactly. Now it feels like I have to contain my feelings so they match hers. She doesn't seem as excited to see me and I'm the one that brings up every skype/call/date and extremely rarely her. I understand that for her the honeymoon period is over, and even I don't feel as strongly as I did at the start, which is to be expected. However I'm deeply hurt that her feelings dropped so hard that she wanted space. It makes me feel like trash.

I can clearly see that she's making an effort and that means she cares at least a little but I still feel terrible. It's making me desperate. As a result I've settled into a mindstate of ""I can't be happy in this relationship until I win her affection back"" which I know is wrong. I realise that she expresses love differently and I need to find these signs but I can't get out of my initial mindstate. Being this insecure is extremely unhealthy for the relationship. I feel so guilty because she's trying and here I am being exhausting with my insecurities.

I'm going through a depression that has peaked this past year but has lasted for over 6 years. It's still getting worse and I'm started to lose hope that I'll get better. So far exericse, diet, regular social activity, weed, meditation, counselling and more has not helped. I don't want my girlfriend to have to deal with this anymore but I also don't want to have this relationship stess anymore. Yet I can't bring myself to break up with her as she's not only my girlfriend but also my closest friend. I don't want to lose her; this is my most selfish trait.

What are my options? I don't want to float through each day thinking about this constantly

Thank you so much
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Me and GF had bump 2 months ago where she wanted space. Recovered but I feel disconnected from her now and depression/insecurity is making me desperate to ""win her affection back"" even though things are ok now. What should I do now?"

First time poster here and I am looking for some opinions from people more experienced than I. I'm going to be graduating next spring with a BS CS with a good GPA and my end goal is to get into network security/penetration testing/crypto. I'm looking to start off as a Network/Systems Administrator since it is next to impossible to start in security. A few questions I have about this path:

1. I like coding, do any of these jobs keep at least some coding in play? The network admin where I'm an intern at does no coding that I see.
2. Which certifications and when? I've seen so many letter combinations, it's making my head spin and I don't know which ones are really important to have and at what point.
3. How many years of experience are needed before trying to jump to the security side of the industry?
4. Master's? Is it terribly difficult to get an employer to pay for it in this field?

And any other general advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
505ydd,3,2016-08-29,2 Master's Aerospace Engineer searching for job (for years),meemstah,AerospaceEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/505ydd/2_masters_aerospace_engineer_searching_for_job/,"Hi everyone, 
I saw some posts on here (some quite helpful) and was wondering if some of you may give advice about a current situation. 

Like the title says, my fiancee has two Master's in Aerospace Engineering, one from the U.S, another from France. He received his degrees around 2013-2014, and has been on the search for a job since then. 

He was able to snag a couple short internship at different Aero. companies in France, and one great one for about a year (2014) at SAFRAN, but they have not been able to grant him a job due to it merging with another company (something may come up in a few years). 

However, there's the issue, 'a few years'. He has tried everything, contacting friends, professors, HR managers, and cold applying for so long now. He is working as a recruiting manager (not in Aero.) at the moment but is still trying hard to find a job in Aero. 

Many, many people have reviewed his resume, and we all think it's really impressive. I've heard him in an interview, and he does really well. He's incredibly flexible with location, speaks French and English fluently, and speaks German very well, has a ton of computer skills and usually qualifies for whatever job he applies for (except for the years of experience part). He has joined Facebook groups, he has a LinkedIn account, and uses whatever resource he can find. Now he is taking online courses to brush up and add to his resume.

I know it's hard for anyone to find a job nowadays, but goodness, the amount of work and years he has taken for this is incredible. Is it really THIS hard to get into an Aerospace job? As a dual citizen, there were some complications with security clearance (U.S-France), but I've heard of plenty of engineers working in the U.S or Europe with more than one nationality (probably not in defense, but still). Is there some advice that you could pass his way? Maybe there's that one crucial thing he hasn't been doing but after this long, I'm pretty sure he has tried it all. He's incredibly motivated and will not give up, so he will try anything that will help. 

Thanks everyone, any advice, contacts, companies will be so helpful.

(I'm posting on his behalf because I want to help him out as much as I can. I want to see him working for what he is incredibly passionate about.)"

Professionally Run &amp; Broadcasted Amateur Leagues For EUW And NA!,Mindmesser,CompeteLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/comments/50635t/xpost_from_rleagueoflegends_want_to_play_in_your/,"Hi, I’m Liam, the director of [CompeteLeague](https://lol.competeleague.com/). We’ve been around the League of Legends scene for a number of years now, providing and completing several amateur scene tournaments and doing our best to improve and give a professional experience to a wide variety of players. 

**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted LoL league, we’re hosting 3 month leagues for Bronze &amp; Silver, Gold &amp; Platinum, Diamond &amp; Up that are open to all. We're operating in NA and EUW, more info below. **Our broadcasted leagues for EUW needs teams** - EUW teams who join this week are guaranteed to be in broadcasted balanced leagues as we look to improve Europe's scene to match our NA community from the previous season. While our NA Premier Leagues are full of teams who qualified from Season 1, teams interested can still register for our Open Leagues, which are also run weekly and can be joined at any time! Check out our [Website](https://lol.competeleague.com/) and our subreddit [r/CompeteLeague](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/). 

Our Leagues are *starting on the 5th of September* (one week away!) so if you'd like to play with your team that can be the case as early as next Monday!

**About CompeteLeague** 

CompeteLeague launched 3 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition with the goal of bringing a competitive scene to gamers of every level. Starting small in size back then with only 1 league featuring 8 teams, we have grown and developed our community and website as a passion project since then to the point where we in recent months we finished our most successful Season ever, running 6 leagues that all culminated with our 3 day finals event [broadcasted from a professional studio in Denver](https://youtu.be/VKC6a9YXqBc?t=1646). We're extremely pleased with the progress we've made in our North American scene, and now we want to continue that while bringing our EUW scene up to par! 

**What We Need**

We need you! As a player, as a viewer, as a eSport enthusiast, as a volunteer, we're back and looking to grow our community coming into our 2nd season. Our site is ready for signups and teams registering for competition, and our qualifiers will be in the next few weeks to set up our first season with our new format. Our stream will be beginning with it and we'll want anyone interested to come watch and cheer for our teams. We're also always looking for interested community members who would like to get involved in an eSports setting, we have several roles that are open (casters, organisers, writers etc.), and plenty to offer for our volunteers (more information below). We've spent about a year on creating this website – however we're not a big organisation and haven't had the manpower or time to do comprehensive testing. As such please report any bugs that you find on our site to the thread in our subreddit

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for LoL will be as follows:

Bronze &amp; Silver | Gold &amp; Platinum | Diamond &amp; Up
-------------|----------------|----------
Mondays | Tuesdays | Wednesdays
5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST
6-11 PM GMT+1 | 6-11 PM GMT+1 | 6-11 PM GMT+1

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for eight weeks, and will be streamed and casted on our [twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/CompeteLeague). Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | B | R | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 | Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 | No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6|  No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 | No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 | No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 | Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 | No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8 | Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| No (1)

Our Open Leagues also run for 8 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in 0 points. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners &amp; next seasons teams over the space of 5 weeks. If you want more information on our leagues/format, we have an excellent set of (clickable!) infographics on our [leagues page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/leagues/format) on our site.

**Pricing**

Totally free &amp; always will be: we've no interest in charging you money to play. Our primary revenue stream is going to be sponsorship, if you're curious about that there's more information about it on our site. For particularly generous benefactors we do have a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) from which the money we make is turned directly back into prizing (and occasionally giveaways).

**Smurfing policy**

We have years of experience with similarly formatted leagues and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion. If you want the full details on what we do to deal with smurfing it's available on our site's [FAQ Page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq).

**Prizes**

We don't announce the prizing in our tournaments at the beginning of our seasons - but we do prize all our leagues! Last seasons prizing was $20 RP for the winning team, $10 RP for second place, &amp; a mystery skin for third - these are lower than we'd like as Riot doesn't provide prizing for online tournaments any more and we have to fund it ourselves, but we'll be equalling or bettering the prizing for this season. We don't charge players to play but as mentioned previously if members want to contribute to that the money we receive on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) goes entirely towards it.

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be looking to do audience giveaways intermittently, whether they be for skins/steam games/RP/anything else. We stream over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/competeleague) which is our main hub, but for those who would like quality settings due to low bandwidth internet we also simultaneously stream to our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CompeteLeague).

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run our seasons. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be for heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being [Dominic ‘Dom’ Roemer](https://twitter.com/DomRoemer) who now casts for Riot) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. Similarly to our need for teams, we're also on the lookout for EUW volunteers our current European staff numbering around 20, however NA applications are also welcome. The different positions we have for volunteers are:

-- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

-- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails usually casting 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so bear in mind we may spend some time giving you practice &amp; training prior to putting you live to cast in our leagues.

**What Makes us Different?**

*Experience.* We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We were one of the very first amateur leagues on the scene and having watched a lot of tournament organizers (HP5v5, Vespyr, iEsports) end their LoL operations in recent months I believe we're one of the last - and we're not going anywhere! We look to run/perform everything we do as professionally as possible and if that sounds like something you can get behind then we hope to see you join our community!

**FAQ**

Well first of all there's a FAQ available on our [site](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq) which you can check out, but here's some common ones.

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). In the Open League, any number of teams can join at any point in the system and be playing within a week, and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. The Open League is a slightly lesser experience, but one of the most requested features by viewers of our past leagues, where we only had premier leagues and teams that found us at the wrong times couldn’t sign up or play.

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

The website has requesting reschedules as a feature when you’re a team in our leagues. You will be able to request a reschedule via your account page, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team must accept the reschedule request. While we know emergencies happen, your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time. To help with unexpected situations/problems we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. When a request is scheduled the teams involved must organise an appropriate time to play, relay information to staff, and play the match within the coming week.

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There’s a feature for free agents on the site. When you sign up solo you’re placed on a public free agents list, where teams and other players will be able to see you and add you on LoL from the site and send invites to their team. Players looking for teams currently get bumped to the top by hitting a 'Actively looking for team' button on their account pages, so you can know what players have been looking for a squad in the past week! All users have a profile page where they can list their preferred means of contact (email/skype/summoner name etc.) We also have a thread over at r/competeleague for players looking to find teams! 

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in with the team you are on, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new ELO.

*How do I set the site to my region?*

You can change the region to your preferred one by clicking it on the nav bar on the site. At the current time we only offer leagues in EUW &amp; NA! Sorry!

*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in different teams for multiple games with CompeteLeague, such as if you wanted to participate in both a LoL tournament, and a Sm4sh tournament (currently operating in North California) then you can!

- *My rune page check failed, help?*

Few things to double check - first make sure that you actually save the rune page name, and that when you copy the number over you don't have a space in the name you save. If that doesn't work, try logging out going to the homepage and hitting Shift + F5, then logging in and registering again. If you continue to have issues our support email is admins@competeleague.com, we'll get you sorted out!

- *I have a different bug (error message/position list is wrong/other)* 

*any further issues you can email us about at admins@competeleague.com and we'll get back to you in the next few days.

*I have a not frequently asked question.*

Ask away, I and any other members of our staff around will be hopping around the comment section to answer anything that we can. That being said, this is our alpha season with this new LoL format, while we have a lot of information, we might not be decided on something. We’ll let you know if we’re still undecided about a question you have. "
5063l7,1,2016-08-29,X-Post From R/Leagueoflegends: Want To Play In Your Own LCS? You Can! Announcing CompeteLeague Season 2! (Vespyr post edition!),Mindmesser,Vespyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vespyr/comments/5063l7/xpost_from_rleagueoflegends_want_to_play_in_your/,"Hi, I’m Liam, the director of [CompeteLeague](https://lol.competeleague.com/). We’ve been around the League of Legends scene for a number of years now, providing and completing several amateur scene tournaments and doing our best to improve and give a professional experience to a wide variety of players. 

For you Vespyr folk reading this, we sorely want EUW teams! You're all more than welcome to come participate, and I hope that despite not finding the experience you were looking for here that you'll consider trying again with us!

**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted LoL league, we’re hosting 3 month leagues for Bronze &amp; Silver, Gold &amp; Platinum, Diamond &amp; Up that are open to all. We're operating in NA and EUW, more info below. **Our broadcasted leagues for EUW needs teams** - EUW teams who join this week are guaranteed to be in broadcasted balanced leagues as we look to improve Europe's scene to match our NA community from the previous season. While our NA Premier Leagues are full of teams who qualified from Season 1, teams interested can still register for our Open Leagues, which are also run weekly and can be joined at any time! Check out our [Website](https://lol.competeleague.com/) and our subreddit [r/CompeteLeague](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/). 

Our Leagues are *starting on the 5th of September* (one week away!) so if you'd like to play with your team that can be the case as early as next Monday!

**About CompeteLeague** 

CompeteLeague launched 3 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition with the goal of bringing a competitive scene to gamers of every level. Starting small in size back then with only 1 league featuring 8 teams, we have grown and developed our community and website as a passion project since then to the point where we in recent months we finished our most successful Season ever, running 6 leagues that all culminated with our 3 day finals event [broadcasted from a professional studio in Denver](https://youtu.be/VKC6a9YXqBc?t=1646). We're extremely pleased with the progress we've made in our North American scene, and now we want to continue that while bringing our EUW scene up to par! 

**What We Need**

We need you! As a player, as a viewer, as a eSport enthusiast, as a volunteer, we're back and looking to grow our community coming into our 2nd season. Our site is ready for signups and teams registering for competition, and our qualifiers will be in the next few weeks to set up our first season with our new format. Our stream will be beginning with it and we'll want anyone interested to come watch and cheer for our teams. We're also always looking for interested community members who would like to get involved in an eSports setting, we have several roles that are open (casters, organisers, writers etc.), and plenty to offer for our volunteers (more information below). We've spent about a year on creating this website – however we're not a big organisation and haven't had the manpower or time to do comprehensive testing. As such please report any bugs that you find on our site to the thread in our subreddit

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for LoL will be as follows:

Bronze &amp; Silver | Gold &amp; Platinum | Diamond &amp; Up
-------------|----------------|----------
Mondays | Tuesdays | Wednesdays
5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST
6-11 PM GMT+1 | 6-11 PM GMT+1 | 6-11 PM GMT+1

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for eight weeks, and will be streamed and casted on our [twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/CompeteLeague). Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | B | R | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 | Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 | No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6|  No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 | No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 | No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 | Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 | No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8 | Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| No (1)

Our Open Leagues also run for 8 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in 0 points. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners &amp; next seasons teams over the space of 5 weeks. If you want more information on our leagues/format, we have an excellent set of (clickable!) infographics on our [leagues page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/leagues/format) on our site.

**Pricing**

Totally free &amp; always will be: we've no interest in charging you money to play. Our primary revenue stream is going to be sponsorship, if you're curious about that there's more information about it on our site. For particularly generous benefactors we do have a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) from which the money we make is turned directly back into prizing (and occasionally giveaways).

**Smurfing policy**

We have years of experience with similarly formatted leagues and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion. If you want the full details on what we do to deal with smurfing it's available on our site's [FAQ Page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq).

**Prizes**

We don't announce the prizing in our tournaments at the beginning of our seasons - but we do prize all our leagues! Last seasons prizing was $20 RP for the winning team, $10 RP for second place, &amp; a mystery skin for third - these are lower than we'd like as Riot doesn't provide prizing for online tournaments any more and we have to fund it ourselves, but we'll be equalling or bettering the prizing for this season. We don't charge players to play but as mentioned previously if members want to contribute to that the money we receive on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) goes entirely towards it.

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be looking to do audience giveaways intermittently, whether they be for skins/steam games/RP/anything else. We stream over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/competeleague) which is our main hub, but for those who would like quality settings due to low bandwidth internet we also simultaneously stream to our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CompeteLeague).

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run our seasons. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be for heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being [Dominic ‘Dom’ Roemer](https://twitter.com/DomRoemer) who now casts for Riot) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. Similarly to our need for teams, we're also on the lookout for EUW volunteers our current European staff numbering around 20, however NA applications are also welcome. The different positions we have for volunteers are:

-- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games.

-- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails usually casting 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters.

It’s a fairly sought after position, so bear in mind we may spend some time giving you practice &amp; training prior to putting you live to cast in our leagues. 

-- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

-- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred.

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

-- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase.

* **What?** Run Under the Stars (Knoxville, TN)
* **When?** August 28/29, 2016
* **How Long?** 10 Hours  
* **Website?** http://www.durbinracemanagement.com/run-under-the-stars-series

### Background
I started running in middle school and from the beginning I've been relatively slow but I seemed to handle distance better than most. I ran XC from 7th-12th grade and really enjoyed it but I only did track a few times and really didn't enjoy that. I also ran 5ish halves between middle school and high school and really loved those. By the time I graduated HS I was burnt out and way to slow to run where I was going to college (emailed asking about walk-on requirements last year and they said 14:15). Didn't run for a little near the beginning of college then decided to do a marathon. I did ok but I figured if I ran even further I would be even better. Found an 50 miler, trained all summer getting up to 30/10 weekend then ran another half for fun. I led most of the way and just got passed with 50m to go. All of the sudden I liked running shorter distances again. A few weekends later I set out for a 35 mi run, made it half way and decided with only a month and a half left there was no way I could get in shape for a 50 miler and I was really happy with my half time so I wanted to work on that instead. So I walked home (looping course, did not walk 17.5 mi) and found a marathon to BQ at. 

Fast forward to this year I'm running halves and enjoying them and doing well. Then I find AR right about the time people were doing BMM and I read the [race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/4lv2vu/black_mountain_monster_24hour_race_report_where_i/) by /u/brwalkernc and start thinking ultras again. For a while I was able to block it out but eventually I got on runningintheusa.com looking for a *1 mile* race and see Run Under the Stars 10 hr race, which was an overnight race on an old high school track. I couldn't find a 1 miler so I decided to do that instead. At the beginning, I was just going to use it to try out ultras/ redeem myself from last years failure/ encourage myself to get a lot of mileage in over the summer for this falls A races. 

### Training
When I decided I wanted to do the race I was probably around 40ish mpw. I started base building and eventually got to the point where I would run 4 AM &amp; 5 PM MWF, 7 PM TTH a standard long run Saturday and an ultra simulation long run on Sunday. The Sunday run was always longer than Saturdays; I would run 5 mi then walk .25 while I refueled. The longest weekend set was 18/21. About a month ago, I switched from base building/ ultra training to pure marathon training and just hoped that the ultra fitness would still be there on race day. I had 2 weeks over 80 miles and a bunch in the mid to upper 70s range. Two weeks out from the ultra I was switching from internship mode to school mode and ended up with a relatively low mileage week and then I stopped marathon training on Tuesday of race week. I had only planned on tapering 4 days but the lack of structure between work and school made it closer to 10 days. 

### Goals
1. Just keep Rolling - I'm really bad with mental toughness and running. Pushing through pain is not something I'm good at. I also tend to give up on races if they aren't going well. I figured a 10 hour race would be a great opportunity to work on this and in future races looking back on the ultra should encourage me that I can handle a lot.

2. 62.5 miles/100k/250 laps - The real goal was 100k but as the race was going it became the 62.5 because I was paranoid that something would go wrong and I would be off a lap.

3. 52.25 miles/ double marathon - I had originally thought 50 mi but then I realized a double marathon was just a little further so that seemed neato too.

4. Hate it - I was kind of hoping I didn't enjoy it too much. I didn't want to become an ultra person. I really really really don't like back to back long runs. At all. I wanted to get the ultra out of the way, hopefully going over 100k and then never fell like I need to do an ultra again.

### Pre-Race
I didn't get much sleep Friday night, I stayed up lateish hoping that I would sleep in but it didn't really work. The blinds in my apartment might as well be see-through. So I was going into an overnight race with about 5 hours of sleep. Got up, packed ate a normal breakfast and lunch and stressed a lot. Eventually my dad arrived and we started the 3ish hour drive to Knoxville. Right as we got to Knoxville it started to rain which was amazing because the high that day was 95 but after the rain, the temp settled in the high 70s. We ate at Chic-Fil-A then headed over to the track and unpacked stuff. It was really weird, I'm not used to night races or Ultras or eating Chic-Fil-A before races or setting up a table with food and stuff or not warming up. Everything was very strange. Eventually we were called to the line. 

### The First Marathon
The race clock was set to countdown so we all watched until it read 10:00:00 and then took off. I settled into 2nd place and worked hard to not work hard. After about 600m I took the lead and around the second lap I started lapping people. At this point I felt great, my legs were happy to be running, the temp was 77 which was 10 degrees lower than I expected. I was doing mid to low 7s which was a little faster than I had planned but I hadn't run over 3.25 hours this year and never over 5 so front-loading was definitely the plan. I went through mile 5 feeling great so I decided to hold off my first walk break until after 10 miles. The worst part of the race, especially early on was almost constant zig-zagging. I spent a lot of time outside lane 1. Besides that everything was great, I drank some water and SWORD (Tailwind) had an Almond Joy life was good. 

Around 2 hours in, my pace had settled although I never really had any idea what it is because my watch is useless on tracks. Then all of the sudden some guy flew by me. I said good job and he responded ""well I just started"" I knew I had like 14 miles on him but he was going fast enough to make me nervous, which helped me keep moving along. At 2.5 hours the course switched and we went the other direction, this was perfect timing as my outside leg had started hurting a couple laps before and within a mile of turning the pain was gone. A little later I was through 20 miles and my legs were achy, especially my feet. Here's the part where the fact that I'm an idiot becomes apparent, I had started the race with a very new pair of Nike Zoom Streak 6s, with the recent heat we've been having I've had a tendency to soak through shoes with sweat. With that in mind, I figured I would start with the Streaks then switch over to NB 1400s (slightly better choice) once they were sloshy. Well the shoes weren't getting sloshy so 20 miles in I still had the Streaks on and they weren't making my feet and legs happy. I figured I would leave them on a little longer and just kept going. Mile 21 marked the furthest I had run all year. Eventually, I went through 26.25 in about 3:31:30 on pace for about 75 miles. I knew there was no way that was happening but it was nice knowing I had a 12 mile cushion.

### The Second Marathon
This is where the slogging really started, 7:30 pace was now a myth, not something that people really do. 8:00 pace wasn't happening either. I managed to stay below 9:00 for a while but then I started bouncing around quite a bit. I felt like I was always thirst but I was also drinking a lot. I was never hungry but I kept eating. I really didn't like eating, I thought it would be enjoyable and a nice little break but it was just a pain. Crossed 50K for the first time in my life in about 4:17. Definitely on pace but definitely slowing down. I knew from the start it would be about how much I could bank early on and how hard I would crash. With a 43 minute buffer I felt good but I was still nervous, I was scared for what the next 5 hours would hold. I was in completely uncharted territory. I don't really remember much from this section of the race. There were just a lot of laps, drinking, food, zigging, zagging. I had hoped that at some point I would settle in with someone but no ones pace was really close to mine and I wasn't willing to slow down because I would miss my goal. The one guy kept flying by but I eventually realized that he wouldn't be able to catch up. Eventually I crossed the 50 mile mark in about 7:27 I don't remember this at all. My goal for the 50 mi race last year was 8 hours. A little later I crossed the line to complete my goal of a double marathon in about 7:53:30 about a 4:22 split for the second marathon. I had to make it about 10 miles in 2 hours, I still felt confident but I was also still scared. I was so far beyond what I had ever done I had no idea what to expect. 

### The End
Everything hurt, I noticed that it wasn't really getting worse though. It just kept hurting at about the same level. My feet were the worst, I knew there was something seriously wrong with the big toe on my right foot but I had no idea what it was. Sitting down seemed like a bad idea and I wasn't sure the best way to change shoes so I just didn't do it (also wasn't sure how I would split it on Strava haha). I remembered reading people on here discussing if it's wise to use Streaks for a marathon and then thinking I was an idiot because I was 53 miles in with them. Around this point I was really accomplishing Goal 4. I was trying to stay positive but there were a lot of thoughts like ""just get to 100k so you never have any reason to do this again."" My pace was slow at this point but I hadn't crashed like I expected to, I thought that at some point I would completely fall apart or hit ""the wall"". I never really did though. As the miles counted down I started feeling better and better about reaching my goal. I was even planning on walking an extra .5 at the end because 63 is a whole number. I hit 60 miles with about 45 minutes left, by this point I really knew I was going to make it. At 61 everything really really hurt. It was awful. I decided I would run 2 more laps and then walk from 61.5 to 62.5. Whole numbers aren't that cool anyway. I crossed for 61.5 and started the ugliest slowest walk that has ever been. A few laps later I [finally crossed the line](http://imgur.com/DYkqvuq) with a little over 100k and about 6 minutes to spare.

### After
I watched as some people ran/ walked there final laps and talked to a few people that came up to me at the finish. I really didn't have much interest in being social so I probably seemed like a jerk. The fast guy eventually finished with 52 miles and still looked fresh. I talked to him for a few minutes and he said that he had already run 10 miles on Saturday and that he was walking home. Somebody said that he mentioned trying to make the US National 24hr team or something like that. I'm glad he started late. I hobbled to the car and sat there in pain while my dad packed up the table and food. I'm so glad he went with me, there's no way I would have got the 100k with out him. He made sure I had full bottles of water and SWORD and helped me figure out where I was when there was an issue with the tracking system. There's also no way I could have driven home. He also made [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sCL-_7bYW0jLz-vF632yQn_JkAX8CT1Ba8DmA0t8jOg/edit#gid=28370071) awesome spreadsheet with most of my splits and some other info.

My big toe has the worst blister I've ever seen. It's gross but [here's](http://imgur.com/hWW8LI4) a pic.

### Final Thoughts
1. I'm amazed I made it that far, I almost tripled the distance that I went in practice (Should have made it to 63).

2. I don't like Ultras

3. I am glad I did the Ultra

4. Streaks are awesome, you probably shouldn't ultra in them but you can. 

5. Thanks to everyone on here that gave me advice and wished me luck and stuff.

506bkm,507,2016-08-29,TIFU by gaming at work,bruthatrucka77,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/506bkm/tifu_by_gaming_at_work/,"So a little bit of background: I'm 18 and I work at a software company as an intern for the summer in the IT department. My internship started out fairly well, with me doing pretty much anything that was assigned to me. However, about halfway through, I started getting less tasks assigned to me. So I started gaming while I was bored. I got caught a few times, and was approached by my manager. I wrote him an apology, and never did it again since. It didn't really phase me because the department in general is pretty laid back. However, we recently had a dinner where we were pointing out some of our accomplishments, and one of the other employees pointed out that my gaming was all that he would remember me for. Now I realize that I probably won't be invited to come back next year. So yeah, don't be an idiot like me.

TL;DR: Don't game during work, no matter how laid back your job is. You never know who might be judging you."
506d0z,3,2016-08-29,I (M/26) need help getting over the fact that my girlfriend (F/25) only seems to make good friends with guys.,throwawayadvice0812,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/506d0z/i_m26_need_help_getting_over_the_fact_that_my/,"My gf and I have been dating for almost 3 years. The only point of contention we've ever had has been my jealousy and insecurity with her guy friends. I'm trying so hard to be better about it but things just seem to get worse for me. I try to be understanding but sometimes I just can't help it and she's initially very understanding but obviously gets annoyed/frustrated with my lack of trust.

It started with her best friend from medical school, who she had known before me and had actually crushed on for a while, even kissing him once. Back when that happened, he rejected her, and they eventually became good friends instead. She has always stressed to me that she only sees him as a best friend and would never see him like that (love interest) again, that she only gives people one chance at that kind of thing. To her credit, nothing she ever did, and none of their interactions I observed ever came close to contradicting that. They'd see each other often in med school class, but eventually in rotations would only talk a few times a week via text and occasionally (once a month or so) would hang out one on one for several hours either at dinner or at his place at night watching tv or something. They'd hang in groups too. But she never hid anything about their friendship from me. Long story short, she told him how I felt and he even talked to me to reassure me that he would never come between us. That he liked me as a friend and would never want to come between us. In other words, she and him did everything right to assuage my insecurities and my fears were generally overblown.

Skip to now, she's starting medical internship and quickly has made tons of new friends. Majority are guys, a few are girls. The ones who have instantly become closest to her tho are guys. And a group of 4 guys she hangs out with in a group setting, and sometimes one on one, is becoming her closest group. I've met all the guys and I'm ok with most of them, except one still makes me uncomfortable. Maybe it's just because he's bro-y and I don't know him well enough. Last night, she wanted to go hang with him at a bar at 10PM. She told me about it first, and as expected I felt weird about it, but I let it go. They each had one drink, then walked back to his place to hang for like 30 min. His roommate was home too. I ended up getting nervous and texted her asking her to come home, she obliged but was understandably annoyed. She's texted him things in the past that I bring up that she says is petty, like when looking for his address she texted him ""oh nvm I found it...it's cause I stalk you lol"" and he texts back ""I bet your computer background is the street view of my place."" 

I've been totally ok with her hanging one on one with some of her other guy friends, rock climbing with one and studying at another's place. It seems like only certain guys or triggers set me off. But truthfully she's amazingly understanding and open and has never displayed anything that would justify my fears.

When I try to set what I feel are reasonable boundaries, like promising to work on my insecurities but until then she can't go over to certain guys' places alone at night, she huffs and agrees but is very annoyed at my restrictions.

I guess I just find it weird that she only seems to care about receiving validation from guy friends. Is that weird I find that weird? I really do trust her but sometimes just can't get over my uncomfortableness and that she sometimes would rather hang with her guy friends over me. This legit keeps me up at night and I don't know what to do other than pushing my feelings further down and trying to let it go. I acknowledge I'm not in the right here, and I'm working on it, but am I abnormal for feeling weird that she always seems to seek so much validation from guys only?

Thanks so much in advance.

506i06,3,2016-08-29,I have to get this off my chest,Rockstar1995,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/506i06/i_have_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,"I have to start somewhere, so the roots seem fine. 

Ever since we got drugs education at high school I figured I could abuse them to get rid of the pain that haunted me every day (I'm diagnosed with PTSD, due to domestic violence. And grew up in foster care). And I did, back then it was pretty innocent compared to last year. I only smoked weed and drank booze, I got some Crack instead of weed my first time, and it felt like the best thing ever (not trying to 'sweet talk' drug abuse). By the time it went way too far school put a social worker one who helped me sober up and get back on track, and with some relapses now and then I actually cleaned myself up. 

I had a slight relapse with alcohol in 2014, just a week binge, and a friend dug me out of the gutter. But that same year I was troubled by the people that were supposed to take care of me (I was 17 and they were supposed to teach me how to keep a household). My roommate never did anything, and I got blamed every time. When I fought back and tried to use legal force they kicked me out. And I used a relative's address to keep my welfare check. And moved in for a while. 

Now, I've always suffered insomnia to some degree since 2009. And when I finally went to college after sitting on my ass for a year It really bothered me to see the hours tic by. And I basically just gave up by 3 am, I supposedly woke up at 6 am every day. I've tried numerous things. I've used speed on and off for 3 months until I started to crave it, and decided to back off, so I wouldn't be hooked. And decided to drink myself to sleep instead of staying up. Needless to say that wasn't a success either, going to school with a hangover and all. 

And at some point I came into contact with a guy who knew a good coke dealer. In the beginning it wasn't much of a problem, I just liked it a little too much. And it all went downhill fast from that point. I was going from door to door to as many people that would take me in for shelter, because I couldn't live with my mother anymore, and I've always paid a compensation for my stay. But, with all the stress I kept on using, more and more. People started telling me I might have a problem, but I denied it. Up until I started selling stuff that wasn't mine, just for another hit. 

I became a monster, and it was obvious. At my internship the stress got a hold of me, and I used my fix in the bathroom there as well just to keep up with the impossible workload. Until some kid came to me with a computer problem (my internship was in IT, and it was a help desk. The most stressful occupation if you ask me), and I just smashed his laptop. Walked away, and got a heart attack. When I came back 3 days later there was a guy from school and my intern guide waiting for me, and I got expelled until I got a hold of myself again, and would be able to handle the work again. 

Instead I choose to go into a downward spiral of everything the Bible would forbid. I mean, I didn't have that much fun, but I just couldn't stop anymore. I had rage attacks more and more often, and spent some nights on the streets, either sleeping in a bus stop or not at all. 

Precisely a year ago I got a full blown psychosis (I had one whether I used or not, the imbalance..) and asked help from a friend of mine, and she sent a friend of mine over who owns a car. As a substitute for an ambulance (I had the idea that my mother and step dad drugged me, and were out to kill me, so I didn't dare to leave my room until he arrived, and used up the remaining coke I could find to stay alert enough to make it to the ER. And my friend brought me to the ER and took me In for 3 weeks, until I relapsed. I used prescription Xanax for my psychosis, and to help me quit doing blow. I told him about my relapse and didn't bring any narcotics to his home. I just retrieved my bags. When I was sleeping on his couch I got my own apartment anyway. 

(little side Story: my mom got money from my dad's pension, since he passed away. And financed at least 2 lethal OD's from it. One of which she sat in front of me as I collapsed, and happily told me I had a cardiogenic shock, followed by a 6 hour seizure) 

At this point all my friends slowly started to abandon me, because I was a lost cause. And trust me, my tombstone was already written. And that's what made me push through to go to rehab. I mean, I didn't care if I lived or died, but losing everybody I loved to something as stupid as cocaine was just not worth it. And they accepted it, and still hung out until I got checked into detox. 

I went to NA/AA after I got out, but that only triggered me to relapse, because in my opinion (so if you think otherwise, you're allowed to. This is just my opinion) they blame people too much if they make a mistake, or lapse In judgment. The only reason I went was because I was going through Xanax withdrawal (3 months of use, and it took half a year to recover) and lacked the ability to think for myself. Until I got to the point where I started to think for myself, only to realize that 12 step programs aren't for me. 

Anyway, fortunately I sit here to tell the story. I just had to put it out there. I've had a few relapses this year, I'm not going to deny that, but I start to think a whole other way about narcotics now. 

Tl;Dr: I got addicted to a drug that totally ruined me, but overcame my addiction. And maybe in a year I would be completely sober (still have a slip/relapse every once in a while) 

I hope my story might inspire someone who struggles with addiction to seek help before it's too late. "
506ivo,52,2016-08-29,"My best one night stand, somehow enabled by my dodgy car - M/F, long",low_key_lothario,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/506ivo/my_best_one_night_stand_somehow_enabled_by_my/,"I’ve been getting off on this sub for a while now and have been toying with the idea of giving it a go myself for a while so here’s my first attempt. I’ve warmed myself up for a decent number of dates or eased myself off to sleep with enough of the stories here that I’d like to do a good job – any feedback would be appreciated.

&amp;nbsp;

The guys in my close group of mates don’t really talk about sexual exploits much, at least not till everyone’s a bit too drunk to remember any details. We are however competitive as fuck so if we did talk about sex more often this is the story I’d try win any unspoken competition with. It was one of the best nights of my life and was such ridiculous fantasy fulfilment that if there weren’t marks all over me for a couple of days afterwards I’d have suspected it was a dream. Call fake if you want but if I’m doing this I’m starting with my A game.

&amp;nbsp;

For a bit of background, up until my early 20s I was pretty useless with women. I spent my teenage years as a big dorky guy, overweight with acne, braces and only a sense of humour and decent grades to stop me feeling totally worthless. With the exception of a drunk blow job at 18 I didn’t get a woman into bed till I was almost 21 and was not exactly happy with myself on that front. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since then though things have improved out of sight. I got myself into decent shape to the point where I’ve been told I’m pretty good looking, worked out how to dress and how to talk to people easily and generally got my shit together. Being 6’4 with a well-paid and interesting job doesn’t hurt either. To round out the image I’ve got dark hair, green eyes, a bit of chest hair and a short beard. This story took place when I was about 25, single and felt like king of the world – I’m thirty now and am even more of a golden bastard, I just wasn’t as cocky back then. Regarding the title, knowing nothing about cars I got talked into buying a sleek but painfully expensive to fix Saab not long before this took place. It broke all the damn time but was worth it for this night alone.

&amp;nbsp;

My old firm was big on Friday night drinks to the point where we’d generally have a junior walking around with trays of wine and beer within an hour or two of people getting back from lunch. By 4.30 all the younger staff would be up on the roof garden in the sun with the booze flowing and no food in sight. There was a decent amount of intra office romance (and even more surreptitious fucking in bathrooms and empty offices, romance be damned) but this isn’t one of those nights. This was a night when most of the women seemed to vanish somewhere between the third and fifth drink leaving a few of us to try our luck in some of the more reliable after work bars. 

&amp;nbsp;

When we arrived at what turned out to be my only stop of the night I ended up chatting to a guy a few years older than me called Oliver. Oliver was, is and likely always will be a cunt. There’s no real way around that. He was about 30 then, married and always hitting on the secretaries, interns, junior lawyers and basically any other woman who hadn’t already walked away. That said, he was somehow always able to surround himself in attractive women and probably didn’t go more than two months without cheating on his wife in the three or four years they lasted together. But for the purposes of this story he’s a dick and no one really wanted to get stuck with him for too long. I’m not someone who prides themselves on being a nice guy but I wasn’t raised to treat a woman like a piece of meat you lie to until she lets you fuck her. I’m a proud feminist which, in addition to being basic requirement of being a decent human being, has gotten me laid as much as anything else I can point to.

&amp;nbsp;

Just when I was about to make an excuse to leave him alone Oli got it in his head that he was going to chat up a gorgeous looking blonde waiting for a drink at the bar. He of course managed to say this both loudly enough for her and her friend to hear, but also in such a way that seemed to appeal to them rather than driving them off. Still not sure how he gets away with being himself – facebook says he’s now dating a woman a decade younger who looks like a pornstar. I suppose being a cunt can work out for people in the long run too.

&amp;nbsp;

So the gorgeous blonde and her friend come over. Blonde’s name is Angelica. I was smitten. Enchanted. Beguiled. Enamoured. Ensorcelled. Bewitched. You get the picture, the English language has a lot of words for how I felt that night but, at its rawest, I wanted her like nothing I’d ever seen. Lust at first sight and a stirring in my pants that wasn’t going away anytime soon. She’s about 5’10, slim in a tight black dress with a high neckline but a hem barely an inch below the curve of a tight round ass. That ass was a revelation, the sort of ass that comes from thousands of squats, running up mountains and more than a fair share of luck in the genetic lottery. Casting my gaze down further I saw a pair of legs that seemed to go on forever ending in precariously high black stiletto heels that she moved in more gracefully than any dancer I’ve ever seen. She was wearing her hair in a braid down to her lower back that played into a hundred different fantasies rolling around my mind while I was vainly trying to remember how I was supposed to move my face to make words. Luckily Oli took point and somehow managed to not come across as a total piece of shit for long enough for me to get my act together. 

&amp;nbsp;

We all started to talk and I realised that Angelica was not only built like the archangel of fucking but she was also a very cool person. She was a year or two younger than me, an early graduate who was taking time off to travel before settling into grad school to become a psychologist (I think, conversation details are hazy so I’m patching them with all the rose fuck-tinted hindsight I’ve got). We got talking about travel and ended up trading stories about backpacking through Vietnam and things started to click. It wasn’t hard to move from the standard patter of ‘where have you been, where are you going next’ into ‘what’s the most exciting thing you’ve done on a trip’ then ‘what’ve you gotten away with overseas you’d never tell your friends back home about.’ Boom, suddenly we’re flirting, trading embarrassing stories and things are going great. We’re leaning into each other, there’s that electric feeling of that first touch and the thrill of the other person pressing just that tiny bit closer instead of pulling away. I was hooked, she probably could have asked me to play in traffic for her at that point and I would’ve been staring down a bus within a minute.

&amp;nbsp;

Throughout this Angelica’s friend was there too, I’ll call her Sandra but I’m pretty sure I forgot her real name the moment I heard it. Sandra was an attractive woman, a bit shorter, a bit less confident but very cute if not properly sexy and, after a few minutes, she was chatting and laughing as much as anyone. Sandra was the sort of woman I’d normally hit on without conscious thought even entering into the equation. Or at least I would if she’s been in almost any other company. She was like a match next to a bonfire. But any sort of denigration seems incredibly ungrateful because Sandra did me one of the biggest favours I’ve ever been given. Over the next hour or so she put herself right in front of Oli, laughed at his jokes, demanded his attention and kept him away no matter how many times he tried to include the rest of us in whatever story he was trying to tell. Over the next hour or so I had Angelica all to myself. The best came part sometime after the lights went low and the music got louder. I looked around for the others and saw Sandra leading Oli to the bar and grinning at us over her shoulder.

&amp;nbsp;

The moment they were out of earshot Angelica grabbed my arm and pressed herself against it. My brain turned off for a second or two but when all the sounds floating around me coalesced back into words I heard “come on I’ve been waiting to dance all night.” We pushed our way into the crowd on the dance floor and I got to see how this woman moved. It was mesmerising. Luckily I’d been blown away enough times in such a short period of time it was starting to have diminishing returns and I was able to find some rhythm and made a decent show at keeping up. We’d had a few drinks and inhibitions were a bit low so it wasn’t long before we had our hands all over each other and were leaning right in to try and talk over the music. We’d been going for a few songs before I mustered up some courage and put my hands on her waist, turning her around and pulling her into me. She looked over her shoulder and grinned in fashion I was fortunate enough to see quite often over the rest of the night as she pushed her ass into my crotch, grinding into me. I’ll say one thing for suit pants, they do not provide much in the way of insulation. I was sure she could feel my cock go from hard to solid steel even before she slid a hand down and stroked it. I turned her back around and before I knew what was happening her arms were around my neck and her tongue was pressing into my mouth while I pulled her into me. 

&amp;nbsp;

Minutes later we were outside on the footpath catching our breath and grinning at each other like kids who’d just gotten away with robbing a candy store. She wasn’t sure about leaving Sandra behind so we sat on a bench nearby waiting to see if she answered any text messages and kept talking to each other while running our hands over each other’s bodies as much as we dared on a public street. Then it happened. She told me she was enjoying herself but just wasn’t sure about going home with a total stranger. Shit, that’s what you get for assuming you’ve won before you’re over the line. We kept talking while I was desperately trying to think of something to get her past those last lingering reservations. Sandra responded – she’d ditched Oli and found some friends. “Have fun you slut, tell me all about it tomorrow.” (I really need to track her down and buy her a drink.) 

&amp;nbsp;

Angelica mentioned how the city felt so strange to her and that she missed the feeling of being home some nights. I realised I didn’t actually know where she was from so asked, saying I couldn’t quite place her accent. Sweden – I know, tall, blonde, blue eyes, gorgeous – such a stereotype. She asked me if I’d met any Swedish women before and without really thinking about it I asked her if my Saab counted. I don’t quite understand how this worked in retrospect, it wasn’t much of a line. She flat our refused to believe I had a Swedish car and thought I was messing with her. We had a little mock argument that ended with me saying that if she didn’t believe me I’d have to take her home to prove it. 

&amp;nbsp;

There was a pause. She looked up at me, grinned a little and the next thing I knew we were in a taxi. She slid across the back seat until she was pressed against me and started whispering in my ear about how she never normally does this so I’ll have to make it worth her while. It was like she’d been holding back while deciding whether she was coming home. After she’d crossed her own personal Rubicon she was suddenly this incredibly confident sex goddess. Her hand was on my cock and in seconds it was hard enough that I could feel the stitches in my boxers straining. I slid a hand up her thigh and heard the faintest little moan as I ran a finger up the silky edge her panties. Without a thought for the involuntary voyeur of a taxi driver I pulled her onto my lap and she started grinding onto me while I pulled her braid back and kissed my way down her neck. My other hand was clutching a handful of her ass as I pressed my fingers under the back of what I realised was a slick little thong and felt the hot wetness leaking from her pussy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before I knew it we were at my place. I threw some cash in the driver’s general direction, heard him mutter something sarcastic about enjoying the show and had her up against my front door with that gorgeous ass pressed hard into my cock. As I fumbled for the keys while kissing her neck she started to moan more loudly then spun around and grabbed my neck in one hand and my cock with the other. “I want you to take me inside and fuck me, fuck me however you want but do it hard. I want you to use me, hold me down and take me and show me how much you fucking want me.” 

&amp;nbsp;

I’d been with a couple of girls who liked being dominated before but hearing this so directly and confidently from a stunning woman I’d met a few hours ago flipped a switch in my head I didn’t even know existed. I became a fucking animal and it felt like a better high than any chemical I’ve tried. I grabbed her throat, shoved her through the door and pushed her into the wall. I took her wrists, held them above her head and kissed her as deeply and forcefully as I’d ever kissed anyone in my life. She was grinding herself against me, moaning into my mouth and biting me whenever she wasn’t forcing her tongue down my throat.

&amp;nbsp;

The moment I pulled back for breath she smiled up at me “I need your cock now. Stop fucking around and put it inside me.” I shoved her to her knees before she even finished speaking and had my pants open and around my knees before she got her balance. I grabbed the base of my cock and her mouth opened in front of it. I swear I can still see the head of it disappearing into her mouth, her eyes wide and staring up at me. The smeared lipstick and the strands of hair around her face that’d escaped her braid made her look just a little bit wild while emphasising how fucking perfect she was. 

&amp;nbsp;

I thrust into her face and felt my entire length slide into her, the head pushing into her throat as she wrapped a hand around my balls, grabbing my ass with the other and sinking her nails into me. She looked up at me, somehow smiling around my shaft and moaned something that sounded like a challenge. I felt the vibrations travel up my cock into my balls and, if it hadn’t been for the last few drinks, probably would have choked her on cum right then. I slid my cock back and she squeezed my balls past the point of pain. “More.” I’ve got no idea how long I fucked her face for. It was the first time doing that that I’d gone all out and held nothing back. Every few thrusts I’d hear a thump from the back of her head hitting the wall, quickly followed by an excited little moan. The hand that had been on my ass was between her legs moving like a jackhammer and she looked about as excited as I was. 

&amp;nbsp;

Worrying that I was going to blow too soon I dragged her to her feet and stuck my tongue back in her mouth. I swept her legs out from under her and carried her into the living room while we savaged each other’s faces. After lying her down on the couch I immediately sat her back up and tried to get her dress off. After what felt like an eternity of fumbling at it she dragged my hand over to the suddenly very obvious zip and it was quickly on the floor. While I struggled out of my shoes and pants she seemed to soften a fraction, pressing herself against me and kissing me much more sweetly while undoing the buttons on my shirt. I reached around to undo her bra and she stopped me – “I changed my mind, my turn now.”

&amp;nbsp;

I thought about taking her anyway but I’ve never been able to resist eating pussy. I love the scent, the taste, the feel of it but the real high comes from the way I can make a woman react – that feeling of power that comes from making someone else lose control over their own body. I dropped down to my knees and started kissing her inner thighs, running my hands up them and teasing the edges of her panties before slowly sliding them down. I pressed her legs together over one shoulder and slid that wet little silky black thong past my face while licking the back of her pussy, throwing the thong to the floor. I pushed between her legs again and started to lick the very edge of her lips till I felt her hands grab my hair and press me against her. She ground her pussy into my face a split second before my tongue was out then I was lapping at her like a madman at a desert oasis. She tasted amazing and was wet enough that I could feel my beard getting slick immediately. 

&amp;nbsp;

I reached up and pressed a finger into her, curling it back and rubbing her while my tongue was massaging her hood and pressing it back. Her pussy was like a velvet vice, as she started to shake I felt like I was in danger of losing the finger. Part of me knew I was supposed to dominating her, holding her down and fucking her, but right then, in my mind, making her cum for me was dominance. At that moment I owned her and was making her body do what I wanted. She was clinging on for dear life with no control whatsoever. It didn’t take long to come to a head, she’d been worked up for a while and I wasn’t holding anything back. She started to really scream then I felt her start to cum. Her whole body shook and her upper body thrashed back against the sofa while her tight little pussy clenched down on my hand like it was the only thing keeping her alive. Her thighs squeezed my head so hard I saw stars and I wanted it to go on for ever.

&amp;nbsp;

The moment I realised she was coming down from the peak I realised how worked up I was, how much I had to be inside her. Merciless fucking beast mode. I dragged her onto the floor so hard she bounced, spun her onto her knees and put her arms on the seat of the sofa while she was still shaking and whimpering. I popped her bra off, taking a second to appreciate some fucking amazing tits. Actually, an aside in awe of that rack. Each one a bit bigger than I could fit in my (pretty large) hands but high and firm enough I’d have thought they were fake if I wasn’t kneading them like pizza dough that owed me money. I didn’t see them clearly at the time but she had small, pale areola with pink, firm nipples that got hard almost as soon as I touched her. Snapping back to raging beast mode me, on my knees behind her and pinching one of those hard little nipples – I pressed the head of my cock against the wet mess I’d made of her pussy and felt every shred of me wanting to thrust into her. She looked over her shoulder at me and panted “Do it, I‘m on the pill, don’t cum in me.” Red flag to a fucking bull. 

&amp;nbsp;

There’s something magical about the first time you stick your cock into a woman you’ve not been with before. I’ve never asked but I’ve always wondered if it’s the same sort of feeling being penetrated with a new dick for the first time. The thrill of conquest sounds a bit ridiculous but it’s not entirely off the mark. There was enough light coming in from the street that I could see the head of my cock squeeze between her lips and I let it sit there for a second, savouring the moment and promising myself I wasn’t going to cum too fast. Remembering that image enough to write about it has me hard and dripping precum all over myself. I pulled my hands down to her little waist and thrust the rest of the way inside her. There was no gradual build up. Balls deep on the first thrust and a moan from her that was equal parts aggression and pleasure. I reached out and wrapped her braid around my forearm, gripping the base of it tight in my fist. My cock was still rammed all the way up inside her as I pulled her head back and ran my other hand from her throat to her breast to her hip. Before she could get an idea of what was happening I slapped her ass as hard as I could, getting an electrifying yelp and feeling her body shudder around my cock as she pressed onto me. I didn’t have a great angle which was probably what stopped me leaving any serious bruises but she went fucking wild. Hearing her call my name as I thrust into her, spanking her and grabbing at her perfect tits was what I imagine it felt like to be Genghis Khan on a good day. And the sound. The smack of my thighs against her ass. The wet sucking noise of my cock pulling most of the way back out before plunging back into her. Fuck I’m hard. 

&amp;nbsp;

This couldn’t last. Her hand was between her legs, alternating between rubbing her clit and grabbing for my balls to hold me inside of her. I felt myself cross that line that meant there was no holding back, a short fuse and a hell of an explosion building. I called out, telling her how close I was and she rolled herself sideways, forcing me to let go of her hair and ending up flat on her back in front of me. I tried to aim but shot a rope across the couch. We both burst out laughing as I managed to direct the rest onto her, painting lines from her hips to her tits. I collapsed next to her and she immediately rolled onto me, rubbing my cum and our sweat all over us as she kissed me while I held onto her ass like a drowning man who just can’t kick anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m not sure how long we lay there like that. All the rage seemed to have leaked out (some of it was drying into my flatmates couch – I moved out a few months later before anyone thought to flip the cushion). She pushed herself up onto her hands, her face hanging a few inches over mine. As we stared at each other we started to laugh again and she collapsed onto me as we tickled each other, rolled around and probably looked like stoned idiots. 

&amp;nbsp;

We ran out of energy pretty fast and I carried her to the kitchen where we grabbed some coke and cookies and chatted like we’d been friends for years. After a few minutes I stopped and realised that I’d just had the best fuck of my life. Sure, when you love someone, connect with them emotionally and need each other in every way you can make love that seems to make the world stop turning. But that’s sex, not fucking. I fucked this woman and she fucked me and it was amazing. She laughed at me when I told her a much less grandiose version of that – “You weren’t bad but don’t you fucking dare believe we won’t do better, it’s not even 11 yet and I’ve got nowhere to be tomorrow morning.” I scooped her up in my arms again and she threw hers around my neck triumphantly as I marched her towards the bathroom for a long and intensive shower. 

&amp;nbsp;

That’s about a ten times more than I intended to write. I’ve gotten horny as fuck trying to remember all the detail and can’t keep going. Now that I’ve started this I want to write out the rest of that night, we fucked three more times before parting ways so if people like this I’ll post that too. Let me know what you think if you got this far.

Unfortunately I go to a small college with plans to transfer to a university after that, so I have already taken all of our CS classes. It basically took us through Java all the way up to the more advanced data structure, how to implement them, and some basic big O notation and determining the run time for simple things. I am pretty nervous because it has been a long time since I finished the classes (almost a year now). I have an internship right now that I primarily use JS in and since I use it everyday I think it would be easier to look for internships in it as I remember the minutia of it much better than Java that I haven't used hands on in almost a year. But I've never looked at these things in JS, where do I start? And how do I continue to a level I can confidently pass technical interview questions? Thanks!"

How feasible is this plan?

A few months later, he goes to update Java again, and attempts to do it himself.

&gt;$SA: ""Hey $Me, I'm trying to update Java again, and closed all instances of IE, but my desktop disappeared, can you come take a look?""

Go over to look and sure enough, all desktop icons and the taskbar disappeared.

I open Task Manager again and see that explorer.exe is not on the processes list.

I interned at a big 4 (Google, Microsoft, Apple, FB) tech company this past summer and got a return (summer '17 internship) offer from them with a deadline that expires in a week from now. While this company was fantastic to work at, I think I want to explore the other 3 big-four companies, hedge funds and smaller startup-like companies (Pinterest etc.) but find it tough to risk the return offer in hand (a bird in hand is worth two in the bush?). I have a few questions about this:

1) If I do accept the return offer for next summer, how hard is it to switch out to a big-4 company or something like Snapchat for full-time next fall, given that I would never have interned for them? I've been told I'll be facing a really similar deadline next year again. For new grad jobs, do companies accept people who haven't interned with them and if they do, can they start the process in the summer? I'm talking about companies like Google, FB, MS, Apple, Two Sigma, Snapchat, Pinterest etc.

2) What happens if I sign the return offer and then renege on it for a better one? I've seen various conflicting views on this, but wanted to know what Reddit has to say about this particular situation. (Some further context: some of the recruiters at these other companies know about my existing offer deadline and they've been asking if I can get an extension. I did try really hard to get an extension but I could get it only for a week. So these recruiters would sort of know if I do renege on my offer.)"

I'm 22 and supposedly have my whole life ahead of me, but I want to pull the plug before I get too involved.",cambrow,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/507ez4/i_joined_reddit_just_to_ask_for_a_reason_to_live/,"I understand that there is no way for a bunch of people on the internet to give me a tailored reason for existence, but it seemed like, unlike those white trash teenagers on Yahoo! Answers or the semi-disabled, well-meaning (but annoyingly preachy) old people on 7 Cups, someone on Reddit might actually understand what I'm posting and the deep sadness I have, considering this is a sub-reddit and all.

This is my first time even using the site so I don't get how it works, as a disclaimer.

I graduated college with a 4.0 GPA, moved away from an abusive family (physical and mental, ranging from getting hit in the face so hard I'm a little deaf to being told to kill myself and that everyone hates me, then two seconds later being told ""you imagined that""), and am now looking for a job. It has been a year since I moved here and I still have no job. All my friends have jobs. I had a killer internship and a few good temp jobs at major studios, but nobody fucking cares and I am getting really fed up with the ""if you play your cards right, work hard in school, have great work ethic, don't do drugs, be nice, you will succeed"" shit. I have this sudden and uncontrollable urge to blow my fucking brains out. I was the one who was doing everything right, who prayed at night when she was 8 years old and her father was slamming her face into the corner of the kitchen wall, that one day I would be successful. 

I feel like it is so taboo to even MENTION that you've had a hard life-- you are expected to be fucking happy all the time in my industry. I am depressed because of my unescapable past, not because I'm some monster. But I feel like they see me as some damaged shelter dog. I am told by every counselor, temp agency, friend of a friend, mentor, etc. that I am doing everything RIGHT. So why is nothing working? Why do HR people tell me I killed it in the interview and then I NEVER get hired? I feel like every piece of the universe wants me to kill myself. My life has been Murphy's Law.

Thing is, my life took a turn for the worst when I got this abusive roommate. She treats me like shit and breaks my stuff. She never showers and rubs cigarette butts into my clothes. My other roommate is horrified, she doesn't understand either. On top of that, this triggered my OCD, which is now consuming every minute of my day because I am afraid she is giving me thirdhand smoke and cancer. My feet turn black from walking on her side of the room, and I haven't slept in weeks for more than 2 hours because I wake up sweating and crying. I mention this because the living situation I have (lasts for 3 more months and I can't escape the lease, I've tried) is making my depression worse.

I also have an awful eating disorder and the shame of it is killing me. I was anorexic a year or so ago and then I developed binge eating disorder, going from 72 lbs to 160 lbs (at 5'2) and everyone at college making fun of me for it behind my back. All my acquaintances left me when I got fat. I got kicked out of clubs (all clubs at my college were student run) all for being a fat fuck. It was a vein and political school. We had no administration to mediate this. They saw how much I was eating and people texted me mean shit about it. I think about this every day, even after I have been out of school for a whole year. So I lost down to 116 lbs and now I am creeping up to 118 lbs again cause I binged all week while plotting my own suicide. I feel myself getting fatter and fatter and I want to blow my brains out because I have no control. It is just like college all over again. I have tried medication so don't propose that. I was a transfer student into this college (abusive life in high school prevented me from getting in because I had low SAT scores) but I stayed determined, and left school in the literal top 1% of the class. 

OK SO WHERE IS MY FUCKING JOB? If you do all the work, if you have been working for a year cleaning up puke and snot and bathrooms, why can't anything work? I can't go back to my abusive dad! He is the only other place I can go or I am homeless, and rent is high. 

All my friends are getting super cool jobs and I can't take it anymore. They don't deserve it. They are not as smart or as good at the job as I am. As someone with low self-esteem and who has tried the slow release of starving herself to death before, it takes A LOT for me to say I am smarter or better at something than someone, and with that said, I mean it. 

If the world works like this: ""You can be the hardest worker of all time, rise up out of an abusive household, escape cardiac arrest from anorexia, going deaf from child abuse, and moving all the way to the other side of the country alone-- YET you still won't get hired over someone with a well-connected uncle"" then guess what? I don't WANT to be alive. I have been plotting my suicide for quite some time now and yesterday the cops came to my house because I told my sister I wanted her to have all my belongings and she got scared. I don't CARE about my sister being sad after I die. She will get the fuck over it like everyone else will. Everyone moves on, it's just how life works. And I'm so fucking done."

So as the title says I came across this sub about a week ago and looked into some of the materials and realized this is something I need in my life immediately.

A little background, I first discovered porn when I was 12 and am now 23.  While I didn't PMO with this much frequency when I first found it, I would say that over the last 7 or so years I have looked at porn and masturbated 2-4 times a day, everyday.

In high school I was incredibly smart, motivated, and driven.  I graduated in the top 10 of my class out of 500 people and went to a top 20 university in the US.  Throughout college I went through some personal stuff and leaned more and more on PMO until it controlled my life.

I graduated with ~3.0 in engineering, which was fine, but I know I was capable of at least a 3.6 had I not spent so many nights blowing off homework, studying, and projects to look at porn and masturbate for hours on end.  I had internships and now a full time job where my performance has suffered because I go to the bathroom during the work day to get my fix and thankfully I haven't been caught.  However, my addiction has made me lazy and skirted around doing the bare minimum to getting the job done and not being a good teammate to other people on my team, which is something I need and want to change.

The biggest reason why I need this though, is that I have been dating an incredible girl for 4 years who is everything I want.  She is beautiful, kind, smart, and makes me want to the best I can be for her.  And my PMO addiction is hurting my relationship in 2 main ways.  1) She deserves better than me looking at random woman on the internet and pleasuring myself to them. 2) Our sex life should be amazing, but I don't enjoy it as much because of all the PMO I do without her.

So with all that being said, I planned on starting Standard Mode on Saturday 8/20.  We actually hadn't had sex since before that date currently, because she was sick and then I caught what she had, so I had been 8 days PMO free, when the original plan was just PM free.  The O coming from when we have sex.

However, things were going really well until about an hour ago when I saw a picture of a racy girl on social media which immediately got me to full attention.

While I refrained from looking at any porn or even the picture.  I put my phone away and began fantasizing about sex with her and masturbated until I reached my O.

While I am disappointed in myself for relapsing, I am happy I at least refrained from looking at porn and was fantasizing about my girlfriend.  But alas, I figured making an account on here would make me be more accountable.  Oddly enough, for a 23 year old in engineering, I have surfed reddit for years, but never posted anything so here I am with this account.

Here's to being a better significant other, better employee, and overall better person in general!"

Just want to say a massive thanks to everyone who contributes to this reddit - I discovered it this weekend and it's been really useful.

I was hoping you could give me some advice.

I'm 24 years old. I recently got an entry level graduate job in my dream career, publishing. This was after a lot of volunteer and intern work! 

I'm currently earning £23k. The job is in central London, I'm still living with my parents as their house is very commutable. I want to use this time to save as much as possible, as I know renting in London will zap away all my bank balance. I'm currently saving £600 a month. I have an everyday saver account with Santander (putting in £400 a month, currently have £2600 saved here), alongside a Help To Buy ISA (putting in the max £200 a month, currently £2200 saved here).

Has anyone got any tips which bank account would be best to put my savings that are not in H2B ISA? I'm planning on living with my parents for another year, so hopefully should be able to save another £7,200 in that time.

Any advice is really appreciated. Thanks!

5083k5,5,2016-08-29,Should I Graduate Early to Accept a Job Offer or Stay in School on a Full-Ride Scholarship For a Final Year?,-fullrider-,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5083k5/should_i_graduate_early_to_accept_a_job_offer_or/,"**TL;DR**

I have the opportunity to graduate college a year early and accept a job offer that has a start date shortly thereafter. The salary offer is alright for what it is, but the job isn't the most intellectually stimulating. I am on a full ride scholarship to my university, so my family thinks I’d be squandering my best and most free years by graduating early. Does it make sense to stay in college for another year for the fun/life experience, or to jump head first into the working world for the job experience?

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

I am pleased to be the recipient of a full ride scholarship to a reputable state university, where I am majoring in Economics and dabbling in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics courses. I am unsure of the exact career path that I want to take, but I hope to make use of my skills in Excel and/or scripting languages to solve problems for an organization and/or discover statistical trends in data sets. Thanks to my high school’s extensive offering of Advanced Placement (AP) classes, I will have the requisite credits to graduate from my bachelor's degree program as soon as this spring, a full year ahead of the typical 4-year schedule.

&amp;nbsp;

This past summer, I worked as an intern at an insurance firm. My work consisted of formatting/cleaning up Excel workbooks and using the demographic data therein to price insurance premiums. The work was tolerable in that at no point did I hate what I was doing, which is honestly all I could ever ask for out of a job. However, work was also sparse—it was rare for me to have more than 2 hours of work to complete in an 8 hour day. The team I worked with was friendly and helpful. I have nothing but good things to say about the management there, either. The office environment was a pleasant contrast to my previous jobs in retail.

&amp;nbsp;

Upon my completion of the internship, the company extended an offer to me to return full-time after this upcoming school year. The salary is on par for this type of position in the industry and the geographic location of the company—in fact, it’s exactly the median starting salary for an Economics major, according to my university’s career center. It’s not stellar, but it’s not terrible, either. The amount of PTO and other benefits seems slightly better than average for an American company.

&amp;nbsp;

I am now faced with the dilemma of choosing to graduate a year early in order to accept this job offer, or to risk the job offer by taking full advantage of my full ride scholarship.

&amp;nbsp;

Two of my greatest fears are: 1) to be un- or under-employed out of college and 2) to hate what I do for a living, so my gut feeling is to accept the job offer. It’s possible that frequenting Reddit has tainted my outlook on the job market. All the doom-and-gloom stories of people not finding jobs out of college and of those that do have jobs hating what they do and working for a fraction of what I’m being offered push me towards accepting what I’ve been offered.

&amp;nbsp;

My peers and relatives have hounded me for thinking in such a way. They like to bring up the fact that I’ll never have time to travel once I start working, or that I’d miss out on one of my best years. I have yet to do such things as travel abroad or find romance, both experiences that I’ll be less likely to pursue if I choose to graduate early.

&amp;nbsp;

Another factor to take into consideration is that apartments near this employer are quite expensive, even for sketchy ones. To keep rent at a modest proportion of the salary I’m being offered, I would need to live with a roommate. I have a friend that is definitely going to graduate this spring. (S)He possesses qualities that I would vastly prefer in a roommate and that are rare to find in random strangers (e.g., (s)he is firmly against drug use). If I do not graduate early, I lose this person as an option to live with when I do graduate. Of course, most of my other peers are taking 4 years to complete college and will be looking to get places, but I would vastly prefer to live with a non-drug-user.

&amp;nbsp;

So, now comes the part where I get to weigh some different options, and where the Reddit community can hopefully weigh in, too.

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 1: Graduate Early &amp; Accept Job Offer**

Pros | Cons
:-- | :-- 
- Don’t have to go through the job searching process again | - Doesn’t allow me to utilize the full potential of my scholarships

508enq,2,2016-08-29,[M4F] An Entirely Too Deeply Thought Out Hucow Prompt,MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/508enq/m4f_an_entirely_too_deeply_thought_out_hucow/,"Prepare for the wall of text necessary to introduce Preggoridge Farms! The fun part about this setup is it lets you create your character without breaking play, and has all the options you could ever want. So, first comes my original prompt, which also contains the original promotional material.

---------------

[The original prompt. Do give it a read through, because this takes a very long time to type](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/4ykdxq/m4f_an_udder_disaster/).

-------------

Sitting behind my wide mahogany desk, my corporate email for the Farm's directorship pings a notification that a profile had just come in from our latest recruitment effort. Preggoridge Farms recently got in contact with fertility clinics and private practice doctors to offer our services to an expanded clientele base. Considering our cows can only be impregnated once every twelve months or so, much of our insemination equipment was sitting idle. We decided to offer the equipment to those seeking sperm donors, allowing them to pay for our services and keep the child. We also started a Bring Your Own Sperm program for couples having difficulty conceiving or just looking for a way to liven up their babymaking.

Clicking open the application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Your prospects as a broodmare are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success at the State Fair as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting cows strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a headband with adorable cow ears matching a collar with a little bell, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Farm that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

----------

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box. Inside are forms for entering the information you just so painstakingly wrote down, but you figure. The contents are odd, but they are all within reason for a company attempting to isolate strings of beneficial human DNA. Even if they do get awfully personal with fertility, hey, people have to reproduce, right?

Reading the form, it is as follows:

*Dear Applicant,*

*Thank you for your inquiry about services with our Collegiate Office! We are very excited to hear about your interest in continuing your degree, and the Farm would love to support your ambitions for self-improvement! All we need is some basic information to finish your application, and we can get you on your way!*

(Or insert some other office to which you are replying. Hell, maybe you got this by accident and are contacting Customer Services, which totally isn't what you think it is. Get it? Services? HAHAHAHAHA... ah, fuck me...)

DEPARTMENT APPLIED TO: (enter the project to which you applied. Feel free to make something up if it's extra sexy to you! Hell, we could make a Reproductive Pleasure department, if that's what you want.)

PROJECT APPLIED TO: (Get *very, very* creative with this. The more thought you put into this, the better the roleplay.)

REASON APPLIED: (Get creative! The more you write, the more I can incorporate down the road!)

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE:

NAME:

AGE:

SEXUALITY:

EYE/HAIR COLOR:

HEIGHT/WEIGHT:

MEASUREMENTS:

UNIQUE PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES: (Feel free to add interesting physical quirks that might make yourself more attractive to a genetics project!)

PREGNANCY STATUS: *If ""Yes,"" please fill out attached Father Verification Form. If ""No,"" please have fertility status verified by a certified doctor or with the included approved instrument.*

FERTILITY STATUS: *Percentage displayed on the instrument will be most accurate during or immediately following an orgasm. The instrument can accommodate this necessity.*

CURRENT MEDICATION: *Please include any and all medication, including birth control.*

RECENT SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS: (Get creative!)

JOB EXPERIENCE: (Again, creativity will be rewarded!)

CURRENT AREA OF STUDY: *Please include any majors, minors, concentrations, and advanced degrees.*

INTERESTS: *Let the Farm know about who you are as a person! We would really like to get to know you, and anything you want to tell us will help make your experience with us more comfortable and enjoyable!*

OTHER INFORMATION: *If there's anything else you think the Farm should know, please use the provided space.*

HAPPY COWS PHOTO CONTEST: *As a special promotional offer, the Farm is running a photo contest! This contest is open to the general public, regardless of application intent or status, so get your friends involved! Put on the headband and collar, get creative with the temporary tattoos, and snap a pic while testing your fertility! Please make sure the display of the instrument is visible in the picture.*

*Prizes will be distributed for Sexiest Pic, Most Fertile, Best Preggo, Most Creative, Best ""In Progress"" Pic, and Freshest New Mother. These prizes consist of $1000 dollars cash and a guided tour of the Preggoridge Farms facilities.*

*A Grand Prize will be given out for Best In Show, an honor reserved for the sexiest, most fertile, most creative, and above all most breedable future cow that sends in a picture! This Grand Prize consists of $10,000 dollars cash, complete college tuition, a private jet and limousine to and from the Farm, a private behind-the-scenes tour of the Farm facilities, and a private interview with the Director himself! Grand Prize Winners will also be invited to stay the night in one of our luxury suites!*

*Prizes must be accepted in full; individual components may not be turned down at the discretion of the contestant winner. Participation in the tour is not required for the cash prize. Every prize is available to the general public; application not required*. (I'm not asking for a real picture. Just tell me about how you made the picture, if you are interested. I'm just trying to get a grip on what you like. Feel free to add a real picture of some sexy little future cow, but *tell me how you made it*! That's how I judge whether or not we'll click!)

---------------

Okay, if you haven't noticed, I write *a lot.* I love detail. Simile, metaphor, hyperbole, chiasmata... These things are all my friends. I *do not* expect you to be able to fully match the way I write. Humble brag, but I hold awards for my SFW writing. If you can match or exceed me... *I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!!* If you want me to help you improve your writing while having some sexy fun... *I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!!* Just please, *please* make the effort!

So, in regards to how I want you to start, fill out the form and send it in. I will judge our compatibility based on the scene you write about flipping through the promotional materials and reacting to their contents.

Maybe you really like the technical documents displaying women becoming mothers from the machines whirring between their legs. Maybe the pictures from Live Audition with new, young cows caught the moment they feel their first child squirting into their wombs. Maybe you really like the diagrams of the combination breeding/milking racks, showing warm white fluid entering a woman between her legs and leaving from her chest. I don't know, so you gotta tell me. Dig through that recruitment package and find the things that make you excited! There's a reason we send out these packages!

For example, maybe you were watching ""Sixteen and Pregnant"" when the recruitment package arrived. Firing up the probe, you affix a ""For Hire"" sticker over your lower stomach and a ""Wide Loads Welcome"" to your inner thigh. Bending your back over your couch, you arch your breasts into the air, displaying the flat stomach you were applying, no begging, to have ruined. The bright stickers flash as the probe burrows into your folds. You writhe, imagining the warm metal spewing the thick, life-giving fluid into you that you could never convince a man to give up. It feels almost as good as you imagine it will when you win the Grand Prize, placed on a pedestal upon which motherhood will be pumped into you. Your walls clamp down hard as an orgasm rocks your body. The probe lights up, displaying a disturbingly high percentage, your womb sucking eagerly at the tip of the probe. That's when the camera *clicks*, catching your body in its full, hungry glory. Looks like we got ourselves a winner... (This was an example. Write your own!)

I wrote that part in because it's so much easier to bring someone in as the Grand Prize winner, and also a lot more fun. It lets me be excited to meet you, and not just ""Oh, boy... Another womb..."" So, give it a shot? The form is meant to be an exposition of what you want from the roleplay, and that part was good, but you gotta give me more to work with if you want the really good stuff.

My mom and father have been in the process of getting a divorce for the last year. Currently they are in a process called collaboration in MASS. It has not been going well at all. It seems as though each time they make an agreement my father then changes his mind and asks for something different or wants something more. This process has been going on for a year and they have made NO changes. 

The basics of the divorce is two credit cards in my dads name, one joint credit card, a trailer loan, and a paid off truck, and then there is my moms retirement and then my fathers military. 

Because they were married for more then 30 years my mom automatically gets half of my dads military. 

They continue to go back and forth and at this point in time my dad has stopped paying all the bills (this really only effects my moms in relation to the trailer and the joint card) He has also stopped giving my mom her half of the military retirement. 

In the last few weeks my father decided that he will be claiming a chapter 7 bankruptcy in regards to his credit card bills and then will be filing against my mom for the trailer loan and the joint card. 

NOW here is where things get interesting...

my dad is asking for the truck which is paid off as well as half of my mothers retirement. in return he will take the two credit cards that are in just his name and my mom must assume responsibility for the joint and the trailer. 

My dad currently lives with his girlfriend, if this happens he will essentially not have to pay anything and will get enough money to pay off all the bills from my mom plus his military retirement. Which intern leaves my mom with a shit ton of debt but yes he will have a chapter 7 bankruptcy on his file. 

My mom now has to deal with a new lawyer because she has to fight the bankruptcy claim  against in Rhode Island while the divorce is taking place in Mass. She feels like her lawyer isnt helping her any more and has no idea what to do. 

Any thoughts, suggestions or ANYTHING would be appreciated.

Classes, while we didn't do much, did not seem too harsh. Each syllabus seems pretty manageable; however, I still haven't had my longest course which I will have tomorrow, Intermediate Programming in Java. 

My day started at 8am with calculus. I was scared but also excited. The professor walked in the room. Honestly, I thought he was a student. He gave many formal definitions, like the kind I read in my books. I was immediately captivated. 

After calc, I went back to my dorm to brush up on some algebra and read over my notes. Then, Rachel text me and asked if I would help her find her room in the Cathedral. I said sure mainly because my next class was also there. I still had an hour before my next class, so I sat at a table in Cathy and did more math &lt;3. Finally, I walked up to Seminar in Composition.

As I walked up to the class, I noticed that a ton of people were just sitting outside. I looked in, noticed that no one was inside, and proceeded to walk in the class. Everyone waiting outside followed me in as well. Composition has always been a struggle for me, and after reading the syllabus I was scared I wouldn't be able to handle the class. A kid sat next to me. He was a bigger guy, looked like he just rolled out of bed, and he smelled pretty bad, but eventually the professor walked in and we got in a circle. I decided to move away from that kid. In class, we had a huge discussion about poetry. It was extremely open, everyone talked and argued, and I even joined in the conversation. After class, I felt like I belonged in it. I was not scared about it anymore; in fact, I already completed the first assignment for it. 

My last class of the day was discrete math. It was tough walking to this class not because it was far, it was because I was crying. Just before leaving my phone lit up. It was an email from a HUGE scholarship for which I applied. It was a congrats email. I had trouble paying attention in my Discrete Math class, but it was okay because all he did was make jokes and talk about class expectations. My professor was hilarious. Imagine Mr. Peluso, seriously. 

Finally, I went to the first Computer Science Club meeting. It was a board game night to get to know new and current members. Honestly, the club was a lot more fun than I thought. Everyone was really chill and open about everything. They helped me feel more relaxed about the major. Additionally, they have really important meetings coming up such as internships, google and yelp recruiters, and an innovation center field trip.  

Like I said, Best. Day. Ever. 

How was your first day of classes?

TL;DR I had the best day of my life. "

It's my greatest secret and one of my biggest fears is being outed. I was a college student in the city at the time of my story.

A while back, my oldest and best friend visited me at college with out mutual friend. I'll call them Alex and Brandon respectively. It was syllabus week and we wanted to party before my workload got too heavy. I hadn't known Brandon for long but we got along well. The three of us started drinking in my apartment for a while and a good time was had by all. Eventually Brandon convinces us to go to a bar. We head out, arguing about which bar would be best to go to while we shamble down the city streets.

I was wasted at this point, so I don't remember why Brandon got separated from us, but he wound up leaving us for a while.  Alex asks me to follow him onto a small park that was currently deserted. Once we're alone Alex starts asking me how I feel about the concept of taking shrooms sometime soon. I told him I've never done it but might be open to it after I do some research. It's not a secret that I believe that many drugs are actually harmless and are only illegal for monetary reasons. He then explained that he was hesitant to give me shrooms because I was autistic and psychedelics ""can fuck up the brain of someone on the spectrum"". This shocked me because I didn't think he knew about my past. He explained that my parents essentially used him as a ""guinea pig"", a playmate for me to learn proper behavior. Furthermore, his mom explained to him my diagnosis to explain why I acted odd back then. 

Right after than, he told me that he let Brandon and another guy I haven't met in on my secret. I was furious, and it took all the willpower I had to refrain from physically attacking him right then. 

As we're talking, Alex walks us towards a busy intersection, probably so that there would be witnesses so I couldn't attack him. Once I realized other people were nearby, I dropped the conversation completely and changed the subject. We talk civilly for a while there, until he attempts to bring up my secret. I interrupted him before he could, I was pissed and still pretty drunk, and I told him that if he says another word, I would beat him, witnesses or consequences be damned. A guy roughly my age asked us if everything was alright, and Alex tells him that we're fine, it was his fault for provoking me, and leaves to my apartment to preserve the peace. 

I needed to clear my head after this, so I sat down on the curb for a minute. A girl gets my attention and asks me if I could call 911, there's a guy there who drank too much and she should know, she interns for a hospital or was a pre-med student. I forget the exact details. Anyway, he was shivering and was unresponsive, he didn't look good. 

If I was in my right mind, I would've called for help without question. But I... didn't. I was drunk, and scared that the cops would come and arrest me for threatening Alex if I called 
911. I realize that makes no sense whatsoever in hindsight, they would send an ambulance. Another passerby told me that he's probably faking it, and not to involve the cops because they can't be trusted. Which scared me more, so I told her that my phone was dead, even though it was on 78% battery life. I left, went to my apartment, took all of the water bottles I had, and walked back. I must've known he was in actual danger and felt like I had to at least give him water. When I got back, the drunk man and the girl were both gone.

I wish I called 911. I realize that not calling for them was inexcusable, fear doesn't justify anything. I hope another person there called for an ambulance and he wound up being ok. If he's dead, it's my fault.

tldr: I was betrayed by my best friend on a night out, which resulted in me threatening him in public. Due to fearing being arrested for it, I didn't call 911 when a person was wasted and needed medical help."
508zey,39,2016-08-29,[Story] The two things that matter after graduation.,halloysa28,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/508zey/story_the_two_things_that_matter_after_graduation/,"*This was my speech to the graduating class of 2016 at the University of California, San Diego, Revelle College. I just wanted to be real with them, and thought a lot about what I would’ve wanted to hear 10 years prior when I was sitting in their position. I’m so grateful for the honor and the opportunity to speak on this special occasion.*

**1. The first thing that everyone talks about is their job.** 

I think a lot of students think they graduate and must find this one singular job or track that you will love and stay with forever. Truth is, you’re going to have multiple jobs. You’re going to try something for a few years and possibly hate it, and then adjust. You will be constantly questioning, shifting, and building your career.

Now this is where most speeches would go down the route of telling you all to go after your dreams! Pursue your passion! YOU might be the next Steve Jobs! But let me be real with you… while I don’t disagree with these inspirational messages, I also know that there are A LOT of people who go through life and just don’t know what their true passion is. For some it’s still too early. Some were never encouraged to think that way. So I don’t wanna stand up here and make people feel bad or scared like.. HOLY CRAP I’m not actually that passionate about electrical engineering or sociology. What am I going to do with this degree and life?!?

Look, if you already know your passion, then absolutely go for it, don’t be afraid of failure, nothing goes according to plan, persevere, etc etc… you guys live online, you’ve probably seen that Buzzfeed video compilation of famous grad speeches… and it’s 100% true, I know from experience. Listen to those guys because they’re far more experienced and accomplished than me. 
But for those who draw a blank or a shrug when someone says “chase your dreams”, it’s ok. It’s ok to not be sure yet. Honestly, I didn’t know my passion was storytelling and directing even when I was sitting where you were. I knew I enjoyed it, I knew I was somewhat good at it. But passion is such a heavy word. And as a 21 year old, how could I really be sure?

But here’s the thing… I didn’t chase my passion, but I became passionate about what I chased. And you should do the same whether it’s your job or a hobby. Because what’s more important than just having a dream, is having the ambition to reach them. Be ambitious and enthusiastic in whatever you do. Always strive for more in and outside of your career. You’ll be surprised at where that might lead you. Even strong enthusiasm toward something is a challenge for some, but can transform you life. It did mine, and brought me here.

Whether it be real estate, or comics, dentistry, or fitness.. explore with vigor, and zeal, and I assure you that when you reach the end of your 20s your life will be better because you did so. Don’t be too afraid, or in many cases, too cool to “try”. The worst thing you could do is live these next few years passively. So if you already know what your purpose is and what you love, understand that knowing is a gift! Don’t waste anytime being timid, and get to work towards it. And if you don’t know yet, consider it your duty, a high priority, to actively figure out what it is at some point in the years ahead.


**2. The 2nd thing is love and relationships.**

Now, I know this is very unconventional to talk about in a commencement speech, but honestly, I think people are actually more concerned with finding love than “chasing dreams”, kinda funny huh? How much love dictates our lives. Look, it’s uncomfortable, it’s cheesy, but seriously, no matter how accomplished you become, or how many friends envy your life, if you aren’t happy in your heart, nothing else matters. So bear with me, I just wanna share 3 quick thoughts about love..

**First, Love Yourself.**

Your journey to find love is going to be challenging. And many of you will experience extreme pain when a relationship is taken away, or when you regret a massive mistake, or when you’re just really really lonely. It’s gonna suck, but please, never ever feel like it’s the end of the world. Never ever feel like another person was what defined you or made you whole. YOU need to make sure you love yourself. Work on yourself, believe in yourself, and yes, treat yourself. Discover your own worth and make sure the person you’re with will push you and challenge you to be even greater.

**Next, Love honestly.**

I think we grow up thinking “love” is something that happens to us, like magic. But it’s not. Attraction is, but making a relationship work takes choice. Constant choice. And you must be honest with yourself when it comes to the person you choose to be in a relationship with. This means understanding your emotions. Feelings are what give our lives texture, even sad feelings, so embrace the entire spectrum of emotions and learn from each experience. Learn what you qualities are important to you, and what angers you, and how to communicate better. Learn the difference between a relationship needing work and a relationship that won’t work. And most importantly, learn to forgive… others and yourself. This will be the most challenging lesson, but the one you might need the most. Hurting people and getting hurt is part of the journey, so be thankful for those who don’t harbor grudges or guilt, I definitely am.

**Finally, Love your family.**

The 20s is when you will begin to really humanize your parents. It’s in this time that many of them met, or even had you (there’s a fun image for graduation). You’re gonna reach that same age and finally realize what your parents have gone through. They weren’t always just “Grown up”. They were young, lost, and scared just like you, they were human! and you can start to empathize with them, because being human also means they won’t always be around. So spend time with them, try not to be annoyed, tell them thank you, I love you, ask them questions about their lives past and present. They have so much to share.

I hope this brought your idea of the next few years into a better perspective. It’ll be natural to feel self conscious for awhile. Worried if you made the right choices in your major, job, life. Embarrassed that compared to your friends you don’t seem as successful or know what you’re doing. But guess what? No one here really knows what they’re doing. I promise you. Even those who have a sweet internship or grad school lined up. Even I don’t!! When I graduated, I would often doubt myself for pursuing something as “silly” and unstable as the arts. I thought all my friends were doing the right thing in their lives and jobs.  But what kept me going, was good friends. We were lost, but at least we were lost together. So surround yourself with positive people. People that will push and support you as you discover your sense of passion, and people that will be there for you when your love life sucks.

**Take your time, but don’t waste your time. There’s a difference. And finding that balance will make your experience these next 10 years really awesome.**

Thank you!"

So this past March I went on spring break with my a bunch of my friends down to Florida. One of my best friends was dating a girl from his hometown at the time (have since broken up) and they had a 3 hr time difference between their universities, and my buddy would drive and visit her about every other weekend. In Florida, she was staying in the hotel next to ours with all of her friends from her school and our two groups were with each other constantly. One of her friends was really cool and we talked for a bit, and that was it. Lets call her Jane.

Fast forward one month later and my friend's gf visited our university with Jane and one other friend. This is where I really started talking with her. We were with each other for a good bit of the weekend at parties and such and I took down her number. Through this I found out that her hometown was 6-7 hours away.

After she left we immediately started texting. Constantly. I'm talking from April-July everyday for several hours. She visited the city that I'm from at this point with her family but I could only see her for a very brief period of time, unfortunately. At this point, we both knew we wanted something more but were afraid of what would happen.

Fast forward one month later to two nights ago when I dropped the ""I really really fucking like you. Like a lot,"" while I was at a party. She felt the same. I don't regret what I said at all but it did bring up a conversation that we have been avoiding for a while.

Tonight she called me and said that we need to talk. She said that she wants to take the relationship to the next level, but she is unsure about the distance. Now I typically think pretty rationally about things and my brain starts turning over on what to do. The closest distance we will ever be from each other is 3 hours away. At the max it will be around 7 hours unless I get an internship this coming summer, then it will be immensely further away.

I am completely torn on what to do. She was extremely understanding with what I'm concerned about but made it very clear what she wanted. To add to that we are both very scared of what the distance will do, but she isn't considering it as much as I am. She pulled the ""we can still be friends"" card, but we both kinda know that wouldn't work out well. I told her I want some time to think.

I really don't know what to do at all. One side of me wants to work it out while the logical side of me thinks it won't be able to last. Can anyone give me some advice or any similar experiences with a situation like this?

----

Tl;dr: Really really really like this girl, she wants to date. Both go to college and hers is 3 hours away from mine, and our hometowns are about 7 hours apart. One side of me wants to work it out while the logical side of me thinks it won't be able to last. Advice?"
5095a7,7,2016-08-29,Some Small Victories I wanted To Celebrate....,jaq_the_ripper,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5095a7/some_small_victories_i_wanted_to_celebrate/,"First off, I wanted to thank you all for fundamentally changing my mindset. I used to spend money in a very absentminded manner. Eating out was a form of therapy for me, and I had zero budgeting to speak of. 

I am a student who graduates next Spring with a degree in Business (Marketing). I currently cook at a restaurant part-time. 

I am celebrating some recent small victories that I will capitalize on and build into bigger ones:

1.) I got my grocery/food bill down to ~$100 this month (between eating free meals at work and cooking at home). And that's while still eating relatively healthy! I eat out once or twice a month and get coffees at a really good coffee shop by my house on occasion as a treat. I also use the Ibotta app for cash back on grocery store purchases.

2.) Refinanced my credit card debt to a lower rate and have a payoff time horizon of ~2 years. 

3.) I could realistically cover all of my monthly bills, (which includes paying off the aforementioned credit cards) with working less than 40 hours a week at my current restaurant job. That is a pretty amazing feeling of independence for me, and looking at my monthly expenses, I could even trim them back further if I wanted!

4.) Sucked it up and asked for financial help from family members when I needed it. Swallowing your pride can actually have a pleasant taste.

5.) Had some interviews for paid internships go really well. They are in tech marketing which is what I have a passion for. Once I graduate and go full-time the salaries/benefits will be even better, allowing me more breathing room and a higher savings rate.

For those of you on here who are worried because you: ""only have $500k in savings at 27""... DON'T BE! You are ridiculously ahead of me and the game in general. Don't let up and/or get complacent, but know that you are in the top percentile of retirement savers. If you are on this sub to begin with, you are in the right place.

Good luck with your financial goals, everyone! "

Web development, full stack development, mobile development, software security, etc.

I'm enjoying the work, but I really want to leverege my current skillset towards local freelancing jobs.

So I have 2 questions. 
1. How lucrative is freelancing, in particular if you're a new graduate?
2. How does one get started with freelancing? How do you find clients? Who are the easiest clients to start with?

I would also love to hear your experiences in freelancing. Your insight is greatly appreciated."

509ar1,0,2016-08-30,My father keeps trying to convince me to find a boyfriend and I'm about ready to cut contact,wemadethemachine,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/509ar1/my_father_keeps_trying_to_convince_me_to_find_a/,"My parents are not bad people, necessarily, but they are sometimes mean, definitely clueless, and have created a lot of difficulties for me in terms of maintaining relationships.  I seriously resent that after a lifetime of their terrible approach toward my friends and partners, they -- particularly my dad -- think that it is any of their business to comment on my dating life in any way.

My parents seemed to think that they could spend my entire young life setting up very narrow expectations for who my friends and acquaintances should be, and then suddenly as an adult I would do a total 180 and become oriented to relationships in a completely normal way and live like none of that ever happened.  My dad especially was more likely to criticize or to make my friends uncomfortable when they were in his presence, but both of my parents had restrictive ethno-religious expectations about the kind of people they wanted me to associate with (for clarity, they are divorced now).  They never explicitly forbade me from having certain kinds of friends, but they didn't have to -- after all the difficulty, I withdrew on my own.  

Lately, my dad has been lecturing me to get a boyfriend.  He's kinda always reminded me that I need to ""meet more people,"" but it has gotten bad in the past ~3 years.  I'm 27 now.  About 6-8 months ago he said to me (by text -- I hardly answer any of my family's calls and I have filtered out my dad's emails) that I needed to start dating because ""before you know it, you'll be 30.""  What the fuck?  Does he think that I don't understand how time works?  Does he think that I don't know how old I am, or that I don't know how to count?

Does he think that I have spent a lifetime receiving pleasant messages about how my male peers think of me, and he needs to remind me that in fact they don't think so well of me so I better get on it while I'm still good?  In fact it is the opposite.  At 14 I was abruptly presented with stark and consistent evidence that my male peers saw me as a sex object, and I've kinda never stopped thinking about it since then.  I have had over a decade of lessons in the fact that few will want me after a certain age.  Does an old man (mid-late 50s) really think that it is his place to teach me about that?  He says it is because he doesn't want me to be lonely, that if I don't find a partner I will spend my life alone and he thinks I would feel bad about that.  His comment about my age was in reference to the fact that he thinks that if I don't find a partner soon, all the good ones will be taken.  Yeah, you know what, I would feel bad if I spent my life alone.  Both my desire for a relationship, and the process of dating, weigh heavily on me.  His lecturing is doing exactly zero to help that, and is only serving to make me feel worse about something that I already feel really bad about, and maybe if he cared about it so much, he and my mom could have made a point to be less awful about my relationships growing up.

A few years ago, when I still lived near my family, my dad began to try to convince me to go out with a guy he knew through family friends.  His selling points were that the guy was my age, single, had a good job, and that he was of the correct ethnicity.  I wasn't interested in dating this guy and felt that just because he was employed and ""a nice guy!"" that that wasn't actually a reason to go out with him.  My dad liked to say that I ""have nothing to lose"" which is actually not true, I have my emotional energy to lose by entertaining someone I am not interested in.  (I have nothing to lose except the chance at everything I care about in a relationship, none of which this guy had.  After all of the things I have done in my life to demonstrate thoughtfulness -- graduating cum laude, two internships, living in a non-English speaking country for over a year -- and all the comments from my family about how smart I am, in the end they assign zero value to my thoughts and feelings.  I have done so many things -- why would my own family want to waste me on someone dull?)  My dad also likes to say ""You never know!"" which I find incredibly insulting and typing it out literally makes me feel my stomach turn -- like my interest in potential partners is a gamble based on nothing.  Anyway, after a few times of bringing this up, I finally said yes to going out with the guy just so that my dad would leave me alone and so that I would have an answer to ""you never know!!"" so that I could say I DID know, and I knew that I was not interested.  How much of an idiot do you think this guy would feel like if he knew I only met up with him to get my parent to leave me alone?  Well, after all the talk about how I don't know if I like him if I haven't met him yet, my dad never even asked me how the date went.  But that doesn't mean he dropped the subject -- he said to me afterward that I have to reach out to the guy again and keep up communication because ""it's hard for guys.""  Yeah, it's hard for me, too.  I moved away soon after this, otherwise I would probably still be hearing about it.

For the first time ever, I don't have to take this anymore.  After years of being underemployed, I finally got a permanent job a few months ago.  I don't have to answer to anyone.  I moved out at 22, but this is the first time that I have truly been able to cut contact because I no longer have to worry that I might need to move home or have them bail me out in case it happens like last summer that I go more than two months without work.  No longer.  My parents used to like to say to me, ""I can do whatever I want.""  Now, I can do whatever I want, too.  I have a great therapist, I take medication.  My life is set.  There is a lot of advice out there for people who have cut contact with their families because of abuse, but I was wondering if anyone has ever cut contact for an issue like mine -- not abusive or violent, but very erasing and sad.  Did you regret it?  I have to go home one last time to retrieve my belongings, and after that, I never have to deal with this again, but I don't know whether I should.  It's just so devastating to be reminded that after all of the vibrancy I have cultivated in my life, my own family wants to pawn me off onto some dude they hardly know, just because he has a job."
509c2y,2,2016-08-30,~12 hours to decide between three degree paths. Comp Sci Engineering vs Data Analytics?,hellowyaar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/509c2y/12_hours_to_decide_between_three_degree_paths/,"So I'm kind of in a predicament. I'm already in my 4th year of school and I need to decide my major in the next 24 hours. I can either:

1. Major in Comp Sci Engineering and graduate only 1 year late (but I'll have to take summers, so no internship experience)

2. Major in Comp Sci Enginering and graduate two years late (opportunity for internships during summers).

3. Major in Data Analytics (basically like CSE but more stats and a few less Comp sci classes) and graduate two years late (opportunity for internships during summers).

A few questions:
I've heard that finishing early with no internship experience puts you in a worse position than taking your time with internships. Does the same apply to my situation (graduating late)? 

Also, will I be at the same disadvantage if I finished a option 1 then a masters and still lacked internship experience?

Do you think a traditional CSE degree is a better idea than the more specialized Data Analytics even if I want to get into machine learning?"

I'm 20, F and I've graduated from college in May this year. Due to my horrible almost traumatic internship experience and increasing (almost complete) lack of interest in my field, I couldn't find myself wanting to find a job and basically felt like I've wasted my 3 years in college.

I also feel that I'm losing all my college friends and it's hard to meet my high school friends too because everyone's working and busy with their lives now and I'm just here finding reasons to get out of bed. it's completely lonely and difficult.

I believe I have anxiety too and it's something I deal with since I was 14. I think I need a job and I need new friends but they all seemed so far fetched in my current mental state that I'm in. I want to get out of it.

Seeking medical help is way too expensive in my area and for my family. The worst thing is when I feel like getting some part time retail job to get by for now, I almost feel embarassed? I excelled in school and it almost feels like I'm ashamed of myself to end up in some retail job upon graduation and I don't want anyone to know about it. It's disgusting to even feel this way and I constantly try to hide my actual reality from people. 

I've been in bed Everyday since my money is running out and there's no one to go out with and I'm just exhausted every day I wake up, I feel like I don't even want to open my eyes anymore. 

I've been out of a relationship last year and went to dates on tinder but nothing really happened, everyone just leaves and they leave like I'm not anything worth which just makes things harder.

I feel so alone and so useless, I disappointed myself and my family. I just need someone to know. I had hopes and dreams when I was in school but after everything that happened I feel so crushed, lost and depressed."

Advice?,g1663368,medschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medschool/comments/509jz0/i_might_not_love_my_nonmed_student_girlfriend_of/,"Hey guys (and girls), I'd like some advice from anyone who is willing to give it. Please bear with the length of this.

My girlfriend, Erica, and I got together the autumn before my MS1 (literally three days before I got my acceptance). So (obviously) I'm a med student, but she is not. So really our entire relationship is built around me being quite a few hours away at school for more than half of the year and her waiting around for me. We got through my MS1 shockingly well, with very few fights or stressful situations ensuing over that year. I'm now in MS2 and the reality of how hectic my life is going to be is really starting to sink in. I'm already way more busy than I was a year ago, and I know MS3 is only going to get worse in that aspect. Not to mention the fact that she herself is still trying to find her career, so when I match into residency she may very likely again be nowhere near where I'm living due to possible school, internships, etc. It's making it all seem quite bleak for us for at least the next 3 years (and very possibly even more). I'm 24 and I don't want to be spending my youth physically alone, stressing over education without the solace of having my significant other with me; or worse yet, leaving a long-term relationship in my late 20's just in time to be heading out of my prime.

I feel guilty over having these thoughts and feelings, because they precipitated pretty recently over something that doesn't seem too significant that Erica did, but she claims was inadvertent. Let me explain, because that sentence was horrific. For the past couple of weeks she seemed quite distant. Our conversation became more stagnant than usual and she would give me vague ""maybe"" answers whenever I would ask to Skype; she would usually wind up just not wanting to or falling asleep browsing social media. This in particular concerned me because during MS1 we were Skyping every single day, regardless of how busy we were and/or how long we could talk for. She also didn't even so much as text ""I love you"" to me for a couple days in a row, which again is unheard of for us. This all started after she visited for the weekend and we had a fight the day before she left. I was starting to think that maybe she was going to break up with me. After two weeks of this behavior I confronted her (on Skype finally) and she quietly sulked and said she understood that she had made me upset, and that she was sorry, and that she missed me (somehow?). She didn't mention any ideas of leaving me.

The point of the previous paragraph is twofold:
1. Even now, a few days after we talked and she apologized, I feel kinda apathetic towards her. I think the combination of her not putting effort in for those two weeks, plus the knowledge of what is to come further down my career path made me think about our relationship differently. That and...
2. During those two weeks, I started crushing on a girl hard. I have done nothing to pursue this, and have only spoken to my good friends about it. Obviously I notice when a girl is attractive, but the extent to which I was (and still kinda am) crushing on this girl had been unprecedented for me in this relationship.

This had led me to consider breaking things off. I'm very uncertain of it though for a few reasons:
1. She's a pretty good person, and she's loved me despite quite a few shortcomings I've had over the past two years. It's hard to throw that away, and also I don't want to hurt her.
2. I'm afraid of making too quick of a decision on this; I'm not really sure when I'd know with enough confidence that my decision is the best one.
3. I'm afraid of being single again and just kinda drifting alone.
4. I'm afraid that I won't find someone better. She has her flaws, but we get along pretty well, the sex is pretty good, and I can tell that she means well most of the time; she's genuine with her affection for me.

But at the same time I don't want to continue on with this apathetic view of her. Right now I'm tied down to a girl I currently don't feel so great about, and whom I haven't seen in person in about a month; even worse is the fact that our timetable is incredibly up in the air, and I have no idea if I'll even be able to see her again before winter break. And then after that it's Step 1 all day e'rry day through the summer, then immediately back to MS3 and I feel like my head is going to explode.

Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this? I'm really in desperate need of advice here.

TL;DR - Been with my girlfriend for two years, but the busyness of MS2 and her lack of putting effort into our relationship for the past two weeks had made me start feeling differently about things; I'm not sure if I love her anymore. I don't really know what the best way to proceed is."

Hi there, I was wondering what I could expect to make in the industry as an entry-level guy with a four year degree and an A+? I've got internship experience and I've been repairing computers for years on my own..

The reason why I am asking is that I am debating heavily over moving to another state for a good job opportunity. $40k salary with benefits to start. Plus it's a good learning opportunity. 

I am very scared that I will wind up in a lame job in Manhattan or on Long Island. ""Lame job"" being one with lower pay (around 30k) and little work expectations. I don't want to get stuck in a job that doesn't challenge me. That kind of job seems to be the norm for entry-level IT folks because I hear about it all the time on here.

But anyway guys, I guess I have a few questions. What can I expect to make here in NY and what can I expect to be doing? Should I look into start-ups for more exciting prospects? I have some connections to start-ups that I could look in to. Are there better entry-level opportunities out here?

&amp;nbsp;

Lately I have been thinking a lot about a move to a data science career. Before I move on I should tell a little bit about my background. I have a bachelor within Geography (well technically a combination between Earth Sciences &amp; Economics), which included some classes in data analysis. Note that I am speaking about the period 2007-2010, so it is quite a while back.

&amp;nbsp;

Afterwards I moved to Denmark (being Dutch myself) and got a Master degree within Nature Management. This covered a variety of courses, including some in GIS (which I loved), and I ended up doing a hedonic pricing study as my master thesis, concerning the influence of public amenities on house prices (proximity to lakes, parks etc), and actually used GIS and R for this. After being done in 2012 I tried finding a job in Denmark, but even do I had pretty good grades I had trouble finding a job mostly due to a language barrier (most jobs I applied were within municipalities or ministries, requiring fluent Danish).

&amp;nbsp;

Since I always had an interest in programming and needed a job, in the period between 2012-2014 (in between internships related to my studies) I learned myself programming. I landed a job in 2012 as iOS developer and currently at my second job in another company doing the same. Even though I am fairly happy as developer, I do feel that I am not as passionate about architecture etc as others. I am starting to feel that I do miss doing something related to my studies. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then lately I have been reading a lot about data science/data analysis and actually have a great friend with a big interest in the field. I suddenly realized that I have had quite a few classes that were more or less directly related to this field, as well as me writing a thesis with help of GIS and R, and my lifelong love of maps, graphs and stats.
I suppose my 2 years of working as a developer could even be a great investment for a move towards data science. So I suddenly realize that perhaps data science is a way to combine my studies, with my experience within programming..

&amp;nbsp;

As I have taught myself programming, I am actually not so intimidated to pivot my career again. I would probably start with reading up on statstics, as well as start playing around in Python and R, as well as some D3 (always have liked to!). Then I guess I will write a blog about my experiences learning, and create a portfolio to show my skills. Perhaps this could be enough to get a job within the field in a year or so?

&amp;nbsp;

What I basically would appreciate is some opinions on my thoughts and on the feasibility of this plan :)"
509tkb,7,2016-08-30,After how many internships can I stop doing side projects for the sake of employment? How many until I can stop constantly being worried that I'm not doing enough?,cscscscscscscsdfsldk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/509tkb/after_how_many_internships_can_i_stop_doing_side/,"Hey, /r/cscareerquestions,

I'm a student who is in his third year and have three internships (including one with a somewhat large company in SV). I should have another two (not at the same company) before I graduate.

This subreddit has me slightly stressed out as I always feel like I'm not doing enough to get a top job. Mostly because my side projects are garbage (trivial websites or school projects) and I have no network. Not because I lack ability (I think), but because I like doing things other than programming after work/school. 

At the same time I notice that many of the people commenting mostly have only one previous internship. So my question basically boils down to if that eight extra months of experience (and excellent reviews from my employer) can cover for a lack of side projects? 

P.S. if you are willing to help me with my resume I am would like to PM it to you because my friends read this site and could identify me even if anonymized "
50a240,2,2016-08-30,"23 year old recently recovered from depression, two courses short of my Math degree at University but have zero work experience and a bad GPA.",NatesFayt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/50a240/23_year_old_recently_recovered_from_depression/,"I honestly don't know what to do.  I'm going to be going to school to  retake a class I failed in the Fall and another class I need to take in the winter, after which I will finally obtain my degree in Applied Math.  The only problems are I have no work experience, never had an internship/project, and a GPA of 2.3, my major GPA isn't much better.  I know no programming languages because when I tried to get into Computer Science classes the wait lists were ordered by GPA so I had no chance of getting into those classes :(.

I have recently started filling out applications for jobs at places like Target and Home Depot and other retail stores but it's going no where.  My parent, whom I live with, are very well off self employed in real estate and suggested I could get my real estate license and work part time for them.  They also suggested that my cousin who is an engineer might be able to get an internship for me once I get my degree.  


Here's also some additional details about me I should mention:

-I was the Risk Reduction chair at my fraternity for a few months and The chair of our leadership and ethics program which was the highest rank outside of the execute board

-I have a minor in Statistics that I completed in my second year of college

-I had a major falling out with my fraternity my senior year and lost many connections as a result :(

-I have been arrested five times during my college years, mostly for drunk in public but once for felony vandalism.  Long story short none of those arrests led to convictions except for a disturbing the peace infraction.  This is something I am not proud of at all and I am very lucky that things always went my way during these scenarios.

-I have ADHD and anxiety as far as mental health issues go

-Not sure if this matter at all but I am a very fit person that loves to exercise and lift weights and eat healthy

My main questions are: 

1.)How can I land a job while I'm finishing my degree with no work experience?

2.)Even if I do get my real estate license and that internship, how much does it help in landing a job that relates to my major even with a poor GPA?

3.)Where can I teach myself some programming languages or how to use some statistical software programs?

4.)Finally is there anything else I can do to pad my resume for gaining an entry level job related to my major while I am finishing my degree?

50a9sk,28,2016-08-30,15 things they might not teach you about design when you’re a student,3stripe,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/50a9sk/15_things_they_might_not_teach_you_about_design/,"It might be easier to tap into design trends and best practices these days because of the internet, but I think students have got it even harder when it comes to finding work.

So I wanted to compile some of my thoughts here — as a reminder that gearing up for the realities of the design profession is as much the student’s responsibility as the teacher’s.

And some of this list also serves a reminder to myself, of things I was taught as a student but somehow forgot in the years since... like the importance of side projects that you do only for fun :)

--------

**No-one’s going to hand you a job on a silver platter when you graduate.**
I remember thinking that once I had my degree show up on the wall, I was done. I hadn’t counted on spending weeks trying to find a job, and only being offered unpaid or barely-paid internships. I expected too much from other people, and did too little myself. Be sure to start networking before you graduate. Hopefully your design course will include some kind of internship or placement, which is another great way to make connections in the industry. (Keep reading for internship tips from MultiAdaptor's creative director Ben Brookbanks).

**You won’t graduate with all the skills you need**
But… it’s not a problem, because you’ll learn them on the job. In fact you might feel like you learn more in your first 4 weeks of working than on the 4 years of your course. Admitting that you have a lot to learn is the first step to enjoying the rush :)

**Sometimes the brief is just plain wrong.**
It’s your job to interrogate what a client wants, to read between the lines, and if necessary, assemble a new brief from the pieces.

**If you can’t describe it in words, it’s not an idea yet.**
So don’t just start a new project by collecting visual “reference” and then assembling it into mood boards. (I’m shocked by how often this happens in some design studios). Start by working out what the big idea is, and make sure you can summarise it succinctly in writing before you begin your visual explorations.

**Don’t just learn to design, learn to communicate**
Practice the art of writing — you’ll need to be as much a wordsmith as a Photoshop-smith to create a compelling presentation. Learn how to write clear, concise emails that end with a menu of action(s) for the recipient to take next. Design isn’t just about creating new concepts, but selling them to your clients. Recommended reading: How to be a Graphic Designer, Without Losing Your Soul.

**Pinterest is for storing your inspirations, not finding them**
Your design language can become a dangerously predictable if you’re visiting the same watering holes as everyone else. Looking for inspiration out in the real world, beyond design blogs and Pinterest, will always be rewarding if you look carefully enough. Recommended reading: Ways of Seeing by John Berger

**Your printer is your best friend.**
Nurture a friendly relationship with your printer(s) so that when things go wrong or you need something in a rush, you know the person on the other end of the phone from you.

**Keep an archive of all your finished projects.**
If they’re physical items, photograph them, and put a few copies somewhere safe. If it’s something digital, take lots of large sreenshots, or better still, clone the website to your own hosting setup somewhere. Nothing lasts for ever.

**Don’t stay too long at your first job.**
I spent five years at mine. I probably should have moved on a bit sooner. A new job is also a chance to grow and to build your network. (As well as the time you’re most likely to get a sizeable pay rise…)

**Practice negotiating your salary.**
Question: what’s an easy way to make £5,000 in 5 minutes? Answer: negotiate your salary confidently. Know what you’re worth, what the industry is paying people with your experience in your area, and stand firm. Granted, at the start of your career you won’t have much leeway here, but with each new job you have another chance to improve your pay. Also remember this: if you don’t ask, you won’t get. You don’t always have to wait for your review — I once asked my boss for a raise because I wanted to buy a house (indicating my commitment to stick around), and got it.

**Don’t forget about side projects.**
Working as a designer can get pretty full on. And sometimes it feels like you’ve lost control of the process. Maybe the client is doing things you don’t agree with… maybe even your creative director too. Either way, having your own project to tinker with at home will help your sanity. Having control over something of your own will make you feel good.

**Always be learning.**
Technology is moving fast, especially on the digital side of things. If you’re a digital designer, you need to have a solid grasp on how websites are made. That might not mean building a website from scratch, but it’s your job to lift up the hood and point out the various bits of the engine. (I’ll put that metaphor to bed right now). Whatever you do, don’t be afraid to ask questions — and lots of them.

**Get into the habit of putting some money aside**
Yes, I know you’ll have loans and other nasty debts to pay off. I did too. But once you’ve had a few paychecks, try to move a small amount into a separate savings account as soon as you get paid. That way you won’t really notice it’s gone. I know so many people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, and are locked into a job as a result. If you can save up a couple of months of living expenses, you at least have a short runway if you suddenly want to escape to something or somewhere else.

**Watch out for the signs of creative burnout**
Real life design is different from student projects. Things usually move faster. You have clients to deal with, budgets to meet, timelines to contend with, and multiple plates to spin. If you’re don’t allow yourself to recharge, it’s easy to burn out. Be sure to book holidays in, so that you have something to look forward to, and a chance to rest up your tired old brain.

**Pass on the knowledge (and the love)**
Believe it or not, you’re already in a hugely knowledgeable position compared to people who are just starting out as design students. Don’t be shy. Help people if you can — and you’ll be helping yourself too, because teaching also helps YOU to understand what you already know better.

PS. Just added some great tips for getting the most out of placements/internships

50at1m,3,2016-08-30,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50at1m/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up (would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades)

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want :)

50b4cl,4,2016-08-30,I'm fresh graduate w/ CCNA should I accept technical support for experience?,Shockmark,ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/50b4cl/im_fresh_graduate_w_ccna_should_i_accept/,"Hello guys! just want to get some opinions in this sub. So I pass my CCNA last July and I'm graduating this coming October. The company which I'm finishing my internship offered to absorb me. Not yet confirmed technical support but the whole internship I was doing troubleshooting stuff, installing necessary softwares, configuring MS Outlook, attending user's concerns, installing printers/scanners, deploying computer hardware/peripherals etc. The only related to networking is turning on network jack from the server, pinging, sharing folders and assigning ip address to PC which is basic. So for sure it will be technical support as my suspicion is they lack people who is willing to do the job. Worst is I was assigned at a sister company which I (alone) handle all the troubleshooting. I'm afraid I will not grow if I stay there but getting experience is hard. What do you think guys?  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

edit: Thanks for the response guys it means a lot. I've decided to take the job observe for 3 months what task that'll be given to me if it does not change or not even relating to like configuring devices I'll start looking for another job.

I definitely want to get a solid software engineering job after I graduate for several years so I can actually afford to go to a decent university and pay off my current loans. Is it too late for me to go to a decent grad school (top 50, I don't expect I'll ever have a shot in the top 10-20)? I really want to get a Ph.D specializing in ML, but I feel like not only will it be too late for me in 5 years, but also too late for me now. My university doesn't offer any AI/ML research so I don't even know how I would go about applying to any prestigious graduate program. Not to mention I don't have a 4.0 and a B- in one of my upper CS elective course. Should I just stick with software engineering at this point?"
50b8hq,1,2016-08-30,Company Hasn't Paid Me Remaining Paycheck Since Internship Ended,MikeCmu17,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/50b8hq/company_hasnt_paid_me_remaining_paycheck_since/,"Alright so bare with me on this one, it was a strange internship. 

I met a guy, call him John, through a high school friend that informed me John was looking for people to hire for his IT company. It's a small company that does data backup, endpoint management, Antivirus protection and general computer maintenance to all their clients. Clients ranged from regular home users, to small businesses. John does not have any formal technical training background in the IT field whatsoever and because of it, his fundamental practices are a bit off. If he runs into an issue he is unaware of, he will simply replace to hardware for his clients to make it ""better"" while charging these people more money. John is also notorious for making small bandaid patch fixes to his clients issues so they will have to call him again, usually no more than a week or two later. He doesn't have any contractual or service level agreements with his clients so he's essentially just some guy tinkering on people's computers. I quickly regretted accepting this joke of an internship. 

My issue:
John paid me under the table because I worked only about 10 hours per week and he (of course) didn't want to have to deal with the taxes behind paying an employee. Getting him to pay me was a pain, and now a month after the internship ended he still owes me money for work I did. It's less than $300 and I know he can afford to send me the money, but he hasn't responded to any emails or texts or calls I have sent him. 

Should I start to be concerned about this guy really not paying me? What practical steps forward can I take? Some suggested court, but that seems like a lot. My consideration was to warn his clients about the flaws in their ""tech guy's"" practices and let them decide if they want to continue this poor business. 

Hope this made sense, would love to hear other people's thoughts on this situation. "

Was it some other plane? Was Fimbilvr’s cell phone going to be here? What horrors were in other dimensions? Was the fact that other planes existed something I should have been worried about considering how much that would fuck with physics? Jasmine snapped her fingers.

We were in the basement.

“Oh,” I said, “why here?”

“Needed to get us home,” Jasmine said before starting toward the stairs. I needed to learn the snapping fingers trick for the lights. Either that or I was going to need a clapper.

“Why the basement.”

“It’s where Margaret has the recall set up,” Jasmine said, “makes teleporting way easier and-” she stopped, “look it’s basically like taking the front door instead of-”

“Taking the front door?” 

“Pretty much,” Jasmine said, “but really what the hell are we going to do about Melissa?” she asked, “it’s not like we’re ready to fight her.”

“Aren’t we?” I asked, “I’ve been practicing.”

“Like hours a day.”

“When?” she asked, “I’m with you pretty often and-”

“Well, it’s not like you’re around for everything. I do shit when you’re not around.”

“I’ve barely seen you practice since that first night.”

“Because you sigh and tell me it’s boring,” I said as she opened the basement door and stepped out into the hallway, the door squeaked. “Then you leave and go text or something.”

“Well-” she cut herself off. She didn’t have a leg to stand on. That being said, I wasn’t going to blame her for it, who wanted to watch someone memorize the correct way to pronounce a counter charm? I still hadn’t quite gotten a handle on those.

“So do you think you can fight her?” she asked.

“Well I mean I think the three of us can. Margaret is better than both of us, and you killed Camilla.”

Jasmine turned into the kitchen and opened the fridge for literally no reason. It wasn’t like we had brought the groceries with us. There was just a cart sitting in the middle of the aisle for when Fimbilvr got back. “Well-” she let the well drag on for way too long, “I mean I killed her, but that isn’t saying much.”

“She was a giant spider; that’s objectively awesome.”

“Yeah but she was just a spider, that wasn’t even magic. She didn’t do spells because she was a giant spider. Giant spiders don’t need spells to take out the trash.”

“That wasn’t what you were saying two nights ago.”

“Yeah but I was trying to get booze from you,” she said. Jasmine looked to my liquor cabinet, and I shook my head. She sighed. “Anyway, the point more is that we are going to need to work hard to beat her. She’s actually pretty hot shit.”

“What does that even mean? She’s sick?”

“The word is dope,” she said, “at least I think it is, maybe that’s just my hipster friends.” I let my eyes hang on her glasses for a minute when she said that. The silence let me notice that we weren’t alone in the house. There were two voices, which meant that Margaret had a friend over. Something was up.

“Second,” I said before leaning out of the kitchen to look into the living room. Margaret was sitting on the couch beside Penny. I blinked twice to make sure I saw things right. That had to be a glamor of some sort. I readied lighting in my hand with a whisper, and it immediately fizzled out. The wards on the house demanded continuity.

“That you, Honey?” Margaret asked. She sounded chipper, which was not how she was around Penny.

“Mer?” Penny asked while spinning around on the couch. She went a little too far, and I swear my spine shivered, “when did you get in?” she asked. Then she looked at the front door, “and how did you get in?”

“Kitchen window,” I said without realizing that we didn’t actually have a window in the kitchen. Penny nodded, it wasn’t like she knew the place that well. “Felt like slipping in.”

“That’s weird,” Margaret said.

“Hey Margaret, can you come in here for a second, I gotta talk to you about something,” I said. Penny gave me a betrayed look like I’d broken some sort of sacred bond. Everything was wrong right now; those two shouldn’t have been enjoying each other. Margaret hopped off the couch and came over to the kitchen. Jasmine had already gone back into her room.

“Okay so what’s up,” Margaret asked, “why are you teleporting in?”

“Well, I was-” I stopped, “Wait a second I was going to ask you. What the hell is going on with you?” I asked.

“What?”

“You’re just hanging out with Penny; that doesn’t happen.”

“Penny’s fine.”

“Who are you and what have you done with Margaret?” I asked. Margaret’s face was going from pleasant to sour. “Also hello and how was your day?”

“Hey and fine,” she said and got her smile back. Why the hell was she smiling? “And so what if Penny’s over.”

“Is there some rule about fairy magic that you need to tell me if you’re not Margaret.”

“You’re being a dick.”

I put a hand on her shoulder. “Are you Margaret?” I asked.

“Yes,” she said, “and there isn’t a rule about that, so there isn’t a point in asking that.”

“Okay, but what’s up with the Penny thing?”

“Penny wanted to come over, and you weren’t here yet, so I figured I could try and be nice. You’ve been having a hard couple of days so-” 

“Awwww,” I said to cut her off.

“Your damn right it’s Aww,” she said, “now what did you need to talk to me about?” she asked.

“Well that,” I said. She went to walk out of the kitchen, but I used my grip on her shoulder to keep her in place. “Oh and we found Melissa.”

“Like at the office?” she asked.

“What?”

“Melissa is an intern at your office,” she said, “at least A Melissa is, Penny mentioned her and I was super confused.”

“Oh, right yeah, she’s nice.”

“You didn’t know her name?” Margaret started getting herself a glass of water. “Penny, do you want anything to drink?” she yelled.

“All good! Just on the couch here,” Penny called back, “take your time.”

“She’s an intern,” I said, “I know that she can get me coffee, and I can pawn off work on her okay,” I grabbed her, “but like the Melissa. The one that is trying to kill me. The witch one.”

“Which one?” Margaret asked.

“Are you kidding me I ju-” I sighed, “you’re a bitch. Anyway, we found her in the grocery store. That gay dude is her dad.”

“Okay his name is Reggie, and you’re her Dad.”

“No he adopted her an-” I cut myself off, “fuck I’m not supposed to say that, right. You knew who he was, though, like right away.”

“Nobody else who’s gay wants to hang around you sweetie,” Margaret pointed out. 

“Okay well, his daughter is trying to kill me, so I need some tips or something.”

“Is she here?” Margaret asked.\

“Well no she’s back at the grocery store,” I explained, “Jasmine had us walk through the floor after we ran into Fimbilvr and he and Jasmine got into a fig-”

“Fucking what!?” Jasmine said way too loud for something private.

“Yeah! He has a daughter!” Penny said.

“I know,” Margaret called back. There was a short lull in the conversation before Margaret leaned out of the kitchen to get a good look at Penny, “but how the hell did you know?”

“Um,” I said. 

“Why does she know?” Margaret asked?

“Was it supposed to be a secret?” Penny asked. She was wearing a shit-eating grin. Now Margaret was fine with Penny, and I hated her, how the tables had turned. “Sorry, I didn’t think that-”

“Why did you tell her anything?” Margaret asked.

“Well,” I said, “she saw my phone and-”

“Why were you on your phone at work?” Margaret asked. Penny kneeled on the couch so she could get a better look at us. 

“For the same reason I always am, I text you when I’m bored.”

Margaret didn’t have an argument for that part. “So now Penny knows everything?” she asked.

“Oh nowhere close, but she knows that Jasmine exists.”

“FUCK!” Jasmine screamed right on time with the script. She then fucked herself down the hallway, and not in any illegal way. Once she was done swearing a thousand times, she ended up in the kitchen. “Hey Penny,” she said before giving me the look I gave my parents when I introduced Margaret. “I fucked up,” she said.

“What’d you do this time?” Margaret asked.

“Nothing I just-” Jasmine cut herself off, “what do you mean, this time?” It was bickering hour and Jasmine wasn’t about to be left out. If we could get Penny in on this action, we’d have a bone-fide cat fight ft. Me.

“Well you don’t have the best track record around me,” Margaret said.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“You aren’t here for everything,” Jasmine misquoted at me, “sometimes you miss things. The world still happens around you.”

“Okay so Jasmine, you fuck up sometimes, what did you do this time?” 

“Well, uh,” Jasmine looked over her glasses and Margaret’s shoulder at Penny. “Does she know that we’re-” she mouthed ‘witches’ like Penny was a dog that couldn’t read lips.

“Yup,” Penny said.

“Wait what?” Margaret glared at me.

“Why are you looking at me?” I let go of Margaret and walked over to Penny. “What do you mean you know?”

“Yeah, Margaret is a witch, what else is new?”

“Oh right, black cats and-” Margaret started.

“Not like Azel Motres and spells like that, carry on,” Penny waved me back over to the rest of the group. I did a double take before focusing on her.

“This is REALLY important, and we’re going to come back to this, Okay?” I asked.

“Sure, Y'all discuss,” Penny said. I walked back to the kitchen.

“So how’d you fuck up Jasmine?” I asked.

“Well I might have used a round trip,” Jasmine said.

“A wha-”

“You didn’t,” Margaret said.

“T?” I finished.

“Yeah I was panicking, and I grabbed the wrong card and-” she started speaking faster than she could keep up with. I could see her hands shaking. Should I have been scared? Was I too calm about this? I didn’t have enough context to freak out.

“Was it at least warded?” Margaret said. She spoke to Jasmine the same way she usually talked to Leaky. We were fucked. It was time to panic.

“Yeah yeah, of course, but she could still grab the card and put it-” Jasmine lost focus again, “Oh fuck, we are so screwed.”

“Only a little,” Margaret said, “as long as it was warded she can’t put you over a pit of spikes or anything, how long was the one you grabbed?”

“I don’t know; I had a couple of each in my pocket, and I wasn’t focusing and- fuck fuck fuck-” 

“Look, Margaret,” Penny said, “can you keep track of them once they go back?” 

“Uh yeah but-”

“We can meet up with them; I’ll drive. She won’t have gone too far, at least I don’t think so. At least in the city right?”

“Yeah um,” Margaret started, she was just as weirded out by the Penny thing as I was, and I was really thrown off by it. Margaret turned to me. “Honey I need you to play it safe, okay? Just don’t do anything crazy, we’re working on control and-”

“Breathe yeah-” I started.

“Breathe and make sure to check behind you whenever you have the chance. If you ever doubt what’s going on just try the counter I’m sure you can pull it off and-” she hissed something under her breath, “that’s all I can put on you without stopping you from casting so um-” she looked around the kitchen. “Here take this knife and,” she shoved my pocket knife into my pocket and then just went into a hug with me. She was warm; she was thinking too fast. She stopped speaking. I felt a tingle in my hand. Then there was a flash, and there wasn’t a Margaret anymore.

“Hey Dad,” Melissa said, “glad you could make it.”

50b9ue,6,2016-08-30,How is the life/work balance in the ad industry?,Kayters,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/50b9ue/how_is_the_lifework_balance_in_the_ad_industry/,"While I'm looking for my real first gig (I've only done internships so far), I'm also wondering how is the life/work balance in this industry.

I don't want to become a person who lives in an office. I've a girlfriend that I love and if I'd decide to start a family in the near future, I don't want to be a father who's never at home.

I'm asking this just out of curiosity. In the agency I used to work you'd go in at 9AM and you'll be out of the office at 5PM (plus an hour lunch break). So it was not that bad.

I don't know how this works in other agencies. How well are you able to balance life and work?

Also, are there things I should know if I want to avoid something like this? I'd rather work less hours or freelancing, then stay countless hours in an office.

I love what I do, but there are other things in my life that for me comes first.

I'm based in London, but I'd definitely take in consideration to work somewhere else (or just freelancing after I've earned experience).

Thank you!"

A few days ago I went to a panel where the Microsoft recruiter for my school talked about how it's really important to work on personal projects to show that you have potential and enjoy CS. The problem is, I'm just starting to learn Python and apparently people will be submitting internship applications as early as this Nov/Dec. 

What sort of projects (preferably in Python) can I do as a complete beginner that can be completed by Jan/Feb in order to have a decent resume and apply before companies fill up all of their intern slots by spring? I'm just a bit worried that I'm going to lower my chances of getting an internship if I apply in March or later."
50bdxs,0,2016-08-30,F4M Some fun scenes!,DPPAPPRP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50bdxs/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."

So after waiting what seemed like eternity for the GPU to arrive, I powered it on and was over the moon when it booted first time. GTA V was played immediately after windows and various drivers were installed, and I couldn't believe how much better it was than the peasant Xbox 360 life I was leading beforehand.

However... two weeks later, I was on my second to last day at an internship. The boss pulls me in for a great chat about all sorts, and then tells me he has a present for me for my time there. I was confused and didn't know at all what to expect. Thought maybe some gift vouchers which would have been a really sweet gesture.

Boss: ""I believe you were looking for one of these?""

...

I couldn't believe what I was looking at... A Zotac 1080?!?!? Jeeeeeeeeeeeeez. I lost my breathe, completely stumped as to what to say. I mustered as many thank you's as I could. Genuinely the best leaving present I could have hoped for.

But then it hit me; the build I have isn't going to do this card justice! Especially given my lust for the smallest mini-itx case I could get my hands on. Now currently I don't have the money to change any of the other parts, but tell me reddit, as time goes by where do you see the obvious bottle neck in this system which I should look to upgrade first?

Obviously I had to re-take the gathered components photo: http://imgur.com/a/t4rxA

Thank you all for the help you've given me in choosing components, and for the countless issues you saved me from. Bless up Buildapc. Bless up PCMR.

Just for that lie, I might make a video montage of your japanese sexual assault instructional video, that video encouraging guys to stalk women to their houses, the video of you encouraging guys to physically restrain cockblocks, saying racist shit to an asian girl and telling a girl she's too fat, mouth raping one girl after you picked her up physically restrained her and she cried out 'noo noo noo noooo', and kissing a 17 year old.

I have it all on my hard drive. I'll link the montage to the youtube accounts of everyone you ever did a collaboration with, using multiple video accounts including bideo, liveleak, and youku, so it'll take forever for you to take them out. They'll see the real Julien Blanc.

50cqks,1,2016-08-30,How should I ask for a larger salary on my first offer?,hydroto,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/50cqks/how_should_i_ask_for_a_larger_salary_on_my_first/,"Hello, r/jobs! 

I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Mathematical Sciences. I am currently in my last semester and starting my job search. I have had three internships - two at the small company in question (Summer 2014/15), and one at a large company (Summer 2016). I was offered a position at both jobs, but I know I want to go to the smaller company. 

This small company is about 40 employees and I really enjoyed my time there, but their offer isn't what I was hoping for. The offer currently on the table is at $55,000 with average benefits (I don't know a whole lot about benefits yet). This isn't much more than I was making as an intern ($20/hr + $400/month housing stipend) and I know another intern who was hired who, if I remember correctly, started at $64,000. As I go to a fairly good university for CS, have had 3 internships, been extremely involved on campus (RA, President of CS Honor Society, a few others), and run a freelance web development business, I am hoping for a bit higher. 

The company I worked for last summer offered me a $2,500 signing bonus, $60,000, a ~12% ($7200) bonus around Dec/Jan every year, and very good insurance/benefits. I want to leverage this in some way to hopefully get a better offer from the smaller company. My goal is $65,000 from the smaller company, but I am unsure of how to ask.

Here is what I have so far:

&gt;Hello, _____!

&gt;I have gained quite a bit of experience from interning for two summers and the opportunity to work for ____ is something to look forward to. The offer presented is great, but I'm looking for a greater salary. I was recently offered a job in _____ for about $70,000.

&gt;I have learned a lot over the past year in school and my internship at a large company, and I know I will be a quality asset to the company.

&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

&gt;Thank you,


I understand that this is not much, but I am at a roadblock. I want to add more to the email and make it sound nicer, but I'm not sure how.

Any help is appreciated!

Advice needed.,KingOfNiche,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50cw75/im_a_36_professional_online_poker_player_looking/,"The online poker industry is getting bad and looking worse everyday.  I started out making 100k, peaked at 180k and now I struggle to make 50k.  It's time for a change.  Luckily my wife's 6 figure salary and my savings can support our family of 4 in central Connecticut, but I need to move on from poker.

I have a BS in Comp Sci from RIT and 1 year worth of paid internships and then 12 years as a professional online poker player.  Over the years I've done many small, mostly poker related programming projects that have kept me somewhat sharp, but I certainly plan to brush up on the basics and look forward to engrossing myself in new projects before I start applying for work.  My biggest concern is how marketable I am and what can I do to improve upon that.  Thoughts?"

I graduated with my major in Creative Writing ( I know, I know) with a great GPA and was able to score two editorial internships that lasted through the summer and was excited about the prospect of getting my foot in the door in my industry. But now, over two years later and almost a dozen interviews I'm still in my same old office assistant position I got after my internships ended. Its not in my field I and at my company, there really is no room for growth for me (despite taking on two other coworker's responsibilities after they left, with no pay or title increase).

Overall, life just feels very stagnant and that every day that I wake up for my office job, I'm stepping in the wrong direction. I struggle with whether or no I want to attend grad school or if I should just move to a completely new city. It is just extraordinarily tough to be scoring interviews but then hear nothing back after them, which after the 8 or so I have been on in the last two years tells me it is me that they don't like, or at the very least, how I present myself in my interviews. Just very frustrated.

I know I should feel thankful for having a job, but at the same time it sucks feeling so burnt out by it that I get home and don't work on the things I enjoy anymore. I just sit down and veg out in front of the TV or play video games. I feel like I need to make a change, but sometimes just get too scared or think ""What's the point?"" I wake up feeling defeated and just sit in the shower for like half an hour not wanting to get out. "

50d592,1,2016-08-30,I'm 25 years old and I just switched my major to engineering. I have a few questions.,kookofalltrades,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/50d592/im_25_years_old_and_i_just_switched_my_major_to/,"Im 25, married, have a toddler, work full time as a medical lab technician, and have an AA degree. I live in SoCal. Just yesterday secured funding for 2 years worth of school (tuition and room and board) from a reliable family member. My employer provides 100% reimbursement for any community college classes that I take.

I am choosing engineering because it would be a perfect match for my skillset and personality. I am creative, logical, and a numbers guy. I love to solve problems, take things apart, and improvise. If I am not constantly challenged mentally, I get bored. 

Also, after being in the workforce for 5 years, I believe I have an edge over the younger kids. When I was 19 I failed out of community college because I was a lazy brat. Since then I got a real job, worked my way up the ranks while going back to school full time, got married, had a kid. Also, I've endured some hard times at work, meaning long hours and short staffing. I'm no stranger to hard work, but I've also learned to deal with failure.

The most math intensive classes that I've taken are Precalc and General Chem I, both of which I excelled at. High A's in both. Not trying to brag here, just trying to give you guys an indicator of where I'm at. In fact, I'm a little embarrassed, because my brother took Precalc in 11th grade.

So here's the plan. I will spend the next 3 years completing all of the lower division courses at my community college while working full time (school part time, 8-10 units per semester). This will be on my employer's dime. When I transfer to a university I will quit my job and go to school full time. Like I said, two years of this will be funded by a family member. I may wait and do some lower division coursework after I transfer so I can extend my time at the university to 3 years (I would get a loan to pay for the extra year). This will give me an extra summer to do an internship and more time to seek out special projects and clubs on campus. Then I will graduate and hopefully get a job.

A few questions:

At what stage are most prospective engineers weeded out? If I get A's and B's on my prereqs (calc I-III, DE, LA, physics I-III, circuits, statics, materials, graphics) is it a pretty good indicator of how I'll do in the upper division coursework?

Will my work experience be an advantage on my resume? I am a medical lab technician (albeit unlicensed) and worked my way up from secretary over the course of 5 years. I do plan to quit once I transfer to a university.

Is there a disadvantage to transferring to the lower-profile Cal States? I'm worried that if I go anywhere other than the Cal Polys or San Jose State my opportunities for internships will be significantly fewer. Would going somewhere like Chico dampen my prospects?

Any tips? I know I am taking an unconventional path, with a family and all, so I'm trying to set myself up as best I can. Does anyone have a similar story that they would like to share?"

Not sure how to proceed.",confusedaboutwork222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50dlv5/i_21m_started_a_new_job_last_week_and_one_of_the/,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a pickle at a new job I started. I am a college student who was supposed to have an internship this fall but that fell through. I went to a part time work fair the first week and was hired on the spot for a customer service position at an entertainment small business (think movie theater, mini golf, laser tag etc.) type place. I really needed the money after the internship fell through, so I was extremely lucky. 

I’ve enjoyed it well enough, but last night I was at work partnering with an 18 year old girl at the front counter. There’s also a kitchen and in the evenings one manager on duty out of the seven or so who work there. He was up there relaying a story to myself and the 18 year old girl, a funny thing he said to a kitchen staff person whose girlfriend also works in the back. He told us “I told Jeremy (the kitchen staff male) that I had to call the cops on him again tonight and he asked me why. I told him it was because he brought his dog to work without a leash again” 

He looked at us expecting laughter and the 18 year old started laughing, and I just kind of stared at him, shocked a manager would be saying that. I hoped to myself that he was talking about something else, but later when he was locking up, he called the woman (Jeremy’s girlfriend) back to the front (she was going out a side door) and told her to “try not to bite any mailmen tomorrow” and she laughed and shook her head. 

What do I do? It wasn’t directed at me, but I was extremely bothered by it. It looks as though that “Jeremy’s” girlfriend isn’t bothered by it (at least she doesn’t show it) but that doesn’t mean every woman at this place isn’t bothered by it. Also, if a customer ever heard, that would be a massive public relations shitstorm. I’m uncomfortable by this and refuse to encourage someone by going along and laughing, so I need some advice. Unfortunately, this is a small enough business there isn’t a real HR department, just these managers and the owner. Thanks Reddit.

**TLDR: Manager says really sexist things that don't bother the person they're directed at, but they make me uncomfortable, and other people would not be okay with this**"
50dnrm,0,2016-08-30,Preparing for summer internships... should I even consider applying?,cheeekyslug,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50dnrm/preparing_for_summer_internships_should_i_even/,"I am preparing my applications / resume / CV so that I can apply for the following summer. Fortunately, I go to school right by Silicon Valley and only a 1.5 hours away from San Francisco and there's a lot opportunities. 

I switched to computer engineering this summer, but I have more in the field of biology / chemistry / statistics. I like the idea of data science, and I feel like it would be perfect for me to get into data analysis / big data, however my work experience makes me a perfect candidate for HR due to extensive clerical experience and customer service. I've been referred to HR before by tech women, and while I would only like it because I know how to handle the job, but it's not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I want to get into software, but I'm definitely not the most experienced. I've just been lurking around Github to get some ideas, but in reality, I don't think I'll finish any personal projects before applying. 

A lot of the current software internships are pretty standard - pursuing a CS related field and know a couple languages. What I'm more concerned about is the pre-tests. I remember I had tried out for an internship and failed it soon right after; I was embarrassed. Ever since then I haven't been practicing as much as I'd like to. I just practice day by day with HackerRank but I don't think it's enough. I hope when I get back into school mode that I will be able to practice a bit more. 

I've been offered advice on here and have found it very helpful. Now reflecting on that, I do think that there's more for me to learn. 

Now onto my questions.. do you think it's a bit suspicious to apply for an HR position then try to pursue the company later on for an engineering position? I also haven't declared my major yet. I'm technically proposed in Molecular, Cell, &amp; Developmental Biology but my academic advisors have listed Cognitive Science and Information Management as my secondary proposals, which both I have already qualified for. 

Would it be okay for me to say that I'm in the latter to apply for these  HR positions since it's too early for me to declare anyways? Lastly, will applying for internships with Facebook, Google, Cisco and the like at my very novice stage of my computer engineering degree be looked down upon? I know I'm already going to fail any test they give me and I don't have projects at the moment. Whenever I read the intern descriptions, it says you'll learn more about the field and work on projects with other leads and managers. I feel like it would be a great way to learn about the field a bit more to refine where I want to go with my degree. Some even allow freshmen to apply  and I'm only a sophomore, so I can't tell how if I should approach these internships lightly or seriously.

Current experience related to CE degree: teaching girls how to code through new start up (with questionable cash flow), IT intern for pharmaceutical company (only because I was pursuing pre-med at the time)

Any advice is really appreciate! "

I've been programming for about seven years now (I'm 25), having just finished a M.Sc. in Computer Graphics. As I initially planned on being a full-time academic, I don't have any work experience aside from a couple internships on UI, QA and mobile development. However, due to some unforeseen circumstances and disappointments with the academic life I was pursuing, I decided to make a career change and take on software development, specifically on graphics and/or games.  

I'm, however, facing a problem: I can't get any job interviews due to my lack of experience. To compensate for that, I'm making a technical blog and portfolio, but I'm unsure of how many projects I should have in it. Currently it has my bachelor's and master's theses, which are a cloth and a fluid simulator in Java, respectively, as well as a 2D game I made with Unity. Right now I'm finishing a second game, this time a 3D one.  

Is it ""safe"" to start applying to job openings with those four projects on my portfolio? I'll be applying to companies around the globe and wouldn't mind working with other types of software. I just need to get started so I can build a career from there. It's worth to notice that, due to the aforementioned unforeseen circumstances, I'm in a slight hurry and want to find a job ASAP, but also don't want to send a CV with a poor portfolio that could backfire and end up closing some doors for me in the future.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated :)"

I asked a question here the other day regarding going to grad school.

I'm a Financial Economics major with a Computer Science minor and have taken quite a few Statistics elective courses. 

I pretty much made up my mind after the advice you guys gave that I needed to focus on getting a few key math courses in order to be prepared for a PhD program.

I think due to some other advice I might pursue industry first and then pursue a MS or PhD down the line. 

I think that would mean that I need to shelf my Computer Science minor in favor of the extra math credits. 

I have taken quite a few CS courses already and also have had 2 internships that required me to use a lot of R and Python. So I do have some programming experience to maybe solidify my knowledge of CS. 

Does a minor mean anything to employers or grad programs or can they just see my relevant coursework on my resume or transcript?

Say I was applying to an analyst position at Goldman Sachs.

50erzd,8,2016-08-30,Chatrealmer's Ridiculously Unofficial Movie Draft Update Memo (CRUMDUM) - Summer '16 - Week 23,MovieLeagueMike,DiamondClub,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondClub/comments/50erzd/chatrealmers_ridiculously_unofficial_movie_draft/,"**2016 NIGHT ATTACK SUMMER MOVIE LEAGUE - WEEK 23**

&amp;nbsp;

Welcome to the evolving CRUMDUM. We'll be adding small updates to the end of this post on Wednesday and Thursday as the season screams to its dramatic close, before a season (and series)-ending edition to wrap up the most competitive duel in Movie Draft history.

&amp;nbsp;

**1st Place - Night Attack - $958.5M ($7.5M last week) - $96 - 9.984 Multiplier**

**2nd Place - DTNS - $952.0M ($25M) - $94 - 10.128**

**3rd Place - Amtrekker - $702M ($1M) - $77 - 9.1**

**4th Place - Chainsawsuit - $649M ($0M) - $86 - 7.6**

**5th Place - Cordkillers - $510M ($0M) - $91 - 5.6**

**6th Place - We Have Concerns - $354M ($9M) - $100 - 3.5**

&amp;nbsp;

We have a friend who set a goal this year to watch every episode of the ten best TV shows since 2000. He's gotten through almost everything now--The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Arrested Development, etc.--leaving him only what many people call the best show ever, a gritty Baltimore-based crime drama. So now we call him Summer Movie Draft, because he's down to *The Wire.*^1

Anyhoooooow... in percentage terms, this is already the closest Movie Draft ever. In the 2012 Winter Draft, Brian Brushwood edged Scott Johnson $490.878M - $486.000M, a difference of 1%. One single percentage point. But that was Winter (pre-Star Wars Winter, an era when studios reserved the cold weather months for their least desirable fare, films barely more entertaining than the *History of Agriculture* filmstrips you had to watch in third grade--in fact, records are sketchy, but film historians insist that *History of Agriculture* was on Justin's slate that season, though the studio did add color and a Morgan Freeman narration) and with the winning score under $500M, things pretty much *had* to be closer.

In the modern day competition we are now witnessing, where every movie has three if not four dimensions *and sound(!),* Night Attack leads DTNS--as of the weekend--$958.5M - $952.0M--a difference of 0.7%. And it's only going to get closer each of the final four days.

It will soon also be the closest in absolute terms, moving inside the $4.9M difference of Winter 2012 when Tuesday's numbers are tallied. Then the question is who, on Friday, leads whom by the smallest margin ever?

&amp;nbsp;

Entering the season's final week and a half last Monday, Night Attack was clinging to the last remaining $24M of their once $260M lead over DTNS. Time, however, was their ally, with only eleven days for DTNS's *Suicide Squad* and *Star Trek* to make up the difference (okay, and *Jungle Book* and *Now You See Me 2* kicking in some pocket change).

Tom and Jennie needed to average $2.2M more per day than Justin and Brian over that stretch to reel them in. Monday through Thursday of last week saw DTNS pick up $7.1M--an average of just under $1.8M per day. Hope was ebbing for the chasers as, yes, they had cut the lead to $16.7M, but the average daily gain required--with now only a week remaining--had climbed to $2.6M.

But then came the weekend.

Three days, $10.3M gained! An average of $3.433! *Suicide Squad* avoided the *Batman v Superman*-like 62% fourth weekend drop and fell only 41%! With four days left, the lead is down to $6.4M--a daily average of only $1.6M! And DTNS had gained $1.8M per day last Monday through Thursday!

*(For those of you new to the CRUMDUM, two things: 1) unfortunate timing, since the CRUMDUM's series finale is this week^2, and 2) if you look around at your fellow CRUMDUM readers,^3 you'll notice them all smirking and nodding their head knowingly, anticipating the crushing blow that always follows a team's really encouraging news.)*

Of course, this means DTNS's hopes ride on maintaining 89% of the gains they made last Monday - Thursday. Which is... not the absolute likeliest thing to happen. The history of week-to-week drops (closer to 50%) is not in their favor, but that's not to say it *couldn't* happen--Jennie has been known to buy out large sections of theaters by herself when sufficiently inspired.

&amp;nbsp;

**UPDATE - MONDAY NUMBERS:**

DTNS earns $1.3M to Night Attack's $0.4M. Brian and Justin are nearly standing still, but Jennie and Tom can gain only $0.9M and the Night Attack lead is now $5.63M (time to move to hundredths; tenths results in rounding errors now). Tuesday tends to be the best of the weekdays, but how much better will it be? Enough to keep DTNS's hopes alive? WHEN WILL THIS MADDENING TENSION STOP?!

&amp;nbsp;

**CHATREALM LEAGUE**

**1st Place - Dannil - $1.634B ($7M last week) - $100 Spent - 16.3 Multiplier**

**2nd Place - thislittlepiggie - $1.622B ($7M) - $100 - 16.2**

**3rd Place - Chaoslord - $1.615B ($7M) - $100 - 16.2**

**4th Place - (18 teams tied) - $1.581B ($1M) - $99 - 15.8**

The final race here is grizzlyfoz's attempt to crack the Chatrealm Top 50 and finish on the Movie Draft spreadsheet (http://draft.diamondclub.tv/) front page. They find themselves in a very DTNSish position, trailing 50th place Zunk Funk by $6.2M with three days left and owning *Suicide Squad, Jungle Book,* and *Captain America* to Zunk Funk's *Finding Dory* and *Ghostbusters.*

&amp;nbsp;

**Patron Production Companies**

**82nd Place - MissKate - $1.397B ($3M) - $99 - Down 4 Spots (Ghostbusters, um, playing?)**

**179th Place - Mrrix32 - $1.291B ($21M) - $99 - Up 16 spots (Suicide Squad playing)**

**244th Place - perfface4radio - $1.172B ($25M) - $99 - Up 11 spots (Star Trek, Suicide Squad playing)**

**248th Place - Godzilak - $1.165B ($12M) - $100 - Down 18 spots (Pets, Star Trek playing)**

&amp;nbsp;

**Patrons** of the fifty cent and up variety. Thanks everyone. I've really appreciated the support.

&amp;nbsp;

^1 Think we pulled something reaching for that one.

^2 Depending on your outlook, ""unfortunate"" can also be read as ""perfect.""

^3 We've always imagined that's how it works--readers gathering together on a Tuesday night in a local, independent coffee shop to share the CRUMDUM experience. And maybe some scones.

&amp;nbsp;

**WEDNESDAY UPDATE**

The Tuesday numbers are in, and it's official--this is now the closest finish to a movie draft by any measure you choose to employ. Okay, not geographically. Tom *is* in Japan. But with DTNS gaining $1.30M on Tuesday, their deficit is just $4.33M (the official spreadsheet shows it as $4.51M, so one of us didn't get some movie's number reported, I guess--my money is on the miss being mine), drawing within the previous record of $4.9M.

And while *not* official, this does all but hand Justin and Brian the Summer Movie Draft trophy (figuratively--how is it that there is no actual trophy?). For whatever reason, Tuesdays are the strength of the weekdays, so if a $1.3M gain is the best DTNS can expect for Wednesday and Thursday, that would leave them still a little less than $2M behind at season's end. And a $1.3M *combined* gain is more likely.

But it's not a guarantee. Who knows when the Jared Leto Fan Club is going to decide it's Suicide Squad Re-Watch Day and flood the multiplexes? If I could really predict what movies are going to do I wouldn't be in 148th place in the Chatrealm League. But I wouldn't blame Tom for learning how to say ""sonuvabitch"" in Japanese or Jennie for firing an intern (how disappointment is handled in LA).

&amp;nbsp;

**THURSDAY UPDATE**

Wednesday was not kind to DTNS. Yeah, they gained some more on Night Attack--$0.76M. That's *less than one million dollars* for the decimally-impaired. And they needed to gain $2.15M each of the final two days. They are now within $3.5M of the lead, but only one day remains. A month ago, with *Suicide Squad* anticipating a $130M opening weekend, $3.5M was an unnoticed grain of sand to be stepped over. But now, with the Squad struggling mightily to crack a million per day, that $3.5M looks like a mountain. Stacked on another mountain. Where Shaquille O'Neal is standing with Tim Duncan on his shoulders.

Perhaps Tom and Jennie can retain some hope by remembering the wise words of the immortal Yogi Berra: ""It ain't over till it's a three-and-a-half million dollar deficit with one day to play.""

Actually, that's not hopeful at all.

I mean ANY job, I've applied to all walks of life, from fast food to full time accounting jobs, (i have 1 year of accounting school and an internship in my belt).  I've received probably 5-6 interviews, but never receive a call back.  It's absolutely infuriating.  I dress VERY professional, almost too professional for some of the jobs, but I like to believe it's still good to wear a dress shirt and tie and nice clothes to a fast food interview.  I comb my hair extremely nice and have a very positive personality.  Where I previously lived, I got jobs no problem because of this.  Now I'm on the West Coast and it's been a shit fest for me.  Should I even bother listing any experience for some of these lower qualifying jobs, because I've heard they may believe I'm over qualified, etc.  Or what's the freaking deal?!  It's almost absurd.  Sometimes they ask what my plan is, and I tell them when I've worked for a few years and have money saved up I might go back to school, but what's with this?"

I've made a few small documentaries (3) and one ESPN 30 for 30. I've also just finished my first feature film staring a couple of big name actors. I never went to school for film. I'm completely self taught.

I'm a jack of all trades. I was also the DP, and vfx guy for the ESPN doc. And for the feature they brought me back to work on certain vfx shots and also to DP some additional footage.

I'm also going to do vfx work for another film with big name actors. 

I can use all of the big three editorial suites (fcpx, fcp7, avid, premiere).

I can't for the life of me though figure out how to get another job. I don't know people in the industry who can get me jobs. Nor do I have burning lined up.

I don't have the credits to have people calling on me to do their films and I'm too ""senior"" as I've been told to be an intern or assistant.

What the hell do I do?"

I have been bottling a lot inside lately and I don't really know what to do. 

My ex recently of 1 year and I ended on a bad note, lots of drama and her potentially lying to me and trying to deliberately hurt me. Genuinely loved the girl but it was a toxic relationship and she couldn't communicate well and I got frustrated a lot and reflected that to her. I know she's not a good girl to date, and I am much better off without her as she's bad news and everyone has told me that and yet I still miss the idea of her. I miss having her around as my best friend and being able hang with her and spend time with her...when it did work it was a solid companionship and she made me feel safe. After the toxic ending, she suddenly went from wanting to fix things with me to asking me to leave her alone because I gave her ""really bad anxiety"". Blocked her and it hasn't been a week but all I do is suffer from anxiety wondering if shes doing shit with other guys or what and I just want to let go. She's intelligent, has a 4.0 and will probably go to a great law school yet I struggle academically in my major and graduate this may and am extremely terrified of being unemployed following graduation meanwhile this person so ready to seemingly dump and hurt me intentionally is doing so well. Just makes me feel extremely shitty and I'm lost in this place where I don't know what to do, I am in a  way jealous but I don't want to be....I just feel like crap, it makes me feel self conscious. I'm a CompSci major with only one internship under my belt and a 3.3 GPA. I'm freaking out cause these other internships im applying to as well as job asks for so much in terms of programming languages and other stuff and I don't feel prepared, I am trying to take steps to build my portfoli with a few personal projects for my github acc. I have a year still but sometimes I regret not majoring in history or english, but regardless I'm extremely anxious that I wont be successful and just be poor and miserable. I don't really feel i have any friends, more so acquaintances but I don't really enjoy going out...I find bars and clubs really boring, random hook ups suck, my friends suck. Nothing is really fun and IDK why, it's like I see past bunch of the bullshit of life sometimes. I feel a majority of shit is empty and fake, people don't really care. being with my ex girlfriend gave me some sense of purpose which I feel is unhealthy but it's true, I felt a deeper connection that felt real at the time, someone to care and share my life with and I loved that....it wasnt random hooking up it was with someone i vibed with and connected with and now that shit is gone and I'm not gonna find that in some one night stand nor do I really want one. I wanna wake up happy but i feel i could not wake up and the only people who would care are my family, everyone else wouldnt give a shit. feel like life is very unforgiving and requires some mold for us to all fit in and fight each other for rather then enjoy the beauty of being alive. 

I don't really discuss my depression, I feel like a whiny little spoiled child complaining over conditions that people wish they could have but I find myself crying in my room and feeling desperately alone. I feel my future is fucked and my life is fucked up and ill be doing something I dont even enjoy doing. "

So I'm going to be a junior in college next year, and I've never purchased a suit (have some old ones from my high school years my parents got but they aren't cutting it anymore). I've been working this summer so I'm budgeting ~$500 before tailoring to spend on this, so I'm excited.

I just need some advice first. I normally don't like advice in this subreddit for normal everyday clothing (just doesn't fit my style I guess), I do massively respect advice here for formal-wear.

Some notes on use: 

* I'm going to be having interviews this fall for internships for the next summer, so this suit will have to be appropriate for a situation like that. 
* Another major use out of suits is for my fraternity's formal and semi-formal events, about 4-6 times a year. While most people wear black and white for formal events at the house, not everyone does so as long as this suit can ""dress up"" to formal events that would be perfect (perhaps with a bow tie, etc.)

I've heard that young men typically should get a dark charcoal colored suit, and that seems to fall in line with my needs (looks professional and can blend in with formal-wear.

Right now I have my eye on the [Brooks Brothers Suit Sale](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/%24499-Suit-Sale/men-suit-sale,default,sc.html), as there seem to be some great options for a lot cheaper than normal. 

Are there any other brands doing great sales, or lines that are known for great quality in the $400-500 price range? Thanks for the help guys, I really do appreciate it!"

I'm 21. I worked mall fashion retail for four months. I wrote MATLAB software for six months at a university RND lab. I've got a handle on C++ and C, and I've got exposure to Python, Java, SQL, shell scripting, Git, and a few IDEs. 

I've spent four very difficult years working on a Computer Engineering major and an Economics minor, and I’ve still got an estimated graduation date of summer 2019. As my school's academic calendar regulates, I'm currently looking for a six-month full-time internship. This internship will probably be paid, and would start mid-late September and end sometime March.

I'm not sure if I should come back to school in March. I’m afraid school may be a waste of energy, time, and money for someone like me. I’m omitting a lot to save space; I can elaborate if asked.

I want to stay in my current city, not relocate or go live at home with my parents, but I don't think the Philadelphia job market is as friendly to programmer-wannabe college-dropouts as some places are.

**My options:**

Work at a paid internship for six months according to the plan (I should not bet on the employer immediately offering me a full-time job). After this, leave school. Probably get a part-time. Self-study for an indefinite amount of time, maybe six months. Are CS/SE Associate's worth anything? I could maybe get one of those. And work on personal projects:

* get involved in some open-source projects
* try modding PC games
* make that calendar/planner/to-do list I've always dreamt of using
* might as well learn CSS and make myself a website

When I’ve got a nicer resume and I’m feeling confident, I’ll try my damn best to get a full-time programming job. I understand that to keep myself busy and end up with a good salary, over time I’ll job-hop, etc.

Or I could keep trying to do what I've tried to do for the past four years, for *three* more years. Get an internship, and then go back to class and tell myself I'll work harder. Try new doctor/drug combinations for my diagnosed depression, anxiety, and ADHD. See what happens.
	Come out with a “nicer” resume and find a 9-5, like usual, etc.

**I'd appreciate reactions and advice. I expect the wise users here to tell me to stay in school, and I do invite such advice. Additionally, I'd love advice from those in the biz that have also faced psychological/neurological problems.**"

Please, I need your help!",Mmoraes17,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/50gp7m/changing_my_careerand_country_please_i_need_your/,"So, I'm a 20 year old brazilian who really wanna change careers and move to Canada, a country that I'm really passionate about. The main obstacles involving this plan are: 1) My university loan 2) Money. Although I already have a plan, I really need some advice of you guys, because Im a little worried about the possibilities of moving.
- I'm currently on the 3rd year of university, taking an international relations course. I will have finished it by 2017 with 21 years.  I've made a loan of R$80k (CAD$ 32.3k) to be able to study, and I will start paying it only on July 2019. It will be a monthly payment of R$900. The problem is that it would take more than 10 years to pay it and I really don't wanna have this debt for that long. 
- On the other hand, I'm on an internship program, on a great multinational bank, making R$2.1k/month. I've been there for 9 months and it seems that they will want me for the next year as well. So, by the end of 2017, (considering that I will need part of  this money to live) I will have something around R$40-45k (CAD$18.4k). I don't know what will happen in 2018, even less on 2019. 
- I want to change my career because I think the market for my degree isnt that good after all. I know the field of computer science/IT is really growing and have plenty of opportunities, and its something I like. I plan to move to Canada to do a not-so-expensive College course of 2 years on computer science/programming. The problem is that even the cheaper ones wil be at least CAD$30k/year (R$74k)  , including food and a place to live. that will be CAD$60k (R$148k) for the entire degree. 

Here's where I need advice:
- I wanna save all I can from now until July 2019, when the loan debt starts. Until there, I can live with my parents without a problem (here in Brazil its common that we move along from our parents house really late compared to other countries like the US), not having to deal with house bills;
- If I make R$100k (CAD$ 40K) until July 2019 and put this money on a fixed income that gives about 0,88%/month, I wouldnt need to sacrifice R$900 of my salary but pay the loan with the interest of this application. However, I wouldnt be able to use it to move, delaying the plan of both moving and changing careers for years; 
- I could try making those R$100k before july 2019 and apply for a university there, since my parents may afford paying the first months of the student debt, and I could try to find  a part time job in Canada to pay for the rest (~CAD$ 50k). The problem is that I don't know if a foreigner can make a student loan in Canada, specially when already having a loan here in Brazil. 

What you guys think?"

I was born and raised in Texas and moved all the way across the country for these people. And it was Hell from the first day onward. 

Long story short, I got close to a co-worker of mine (located in TX) and he helped me through a lot of the ins-and-outs of my job when I first started because my training was subpar at best. I was 6+ hours away from my bosses and any peers, so it was a hectic situation for 22-year-old me. 

Said co-worker gets promoted to be my supervisor and we were such good friends, we had trouble dealing with the new roles we were given. I didn't like how managed me, he didn't like how I was trying to be managed. So the whole thing kinda fell apart until I knew I needed to get out before my GM (who I didn't report to) got me fired. Found a new job after only a few months of looking by going to a Quality professionals meeting and left.

Since I left, I've been missing that first company. Not because I don't like my job (I totally love it), but I had a lot of friends, lots of people my age, and my commute was 15 minutes compared to the 45-minute drive I have now.

My job had an opening in our warehouse and I reached out to a buddy of mine to see if he'd be interested, since he'd been wanting to leave since before I started. He said he'd think about it and less than 24 hours later, he texts me and says they made the announcement: the facility is shutting down at the end of October.

I laughed the most mean-spirited laugh at my desk. They had been doing sketchy and stupid things for years and the GM was a total ass without a good bone in his body. It's too bad he isn't out of a job (he runs two facilities), but it feels good to have gotten out before all this.

TL;DR: Quit my last job, but missed it sometimes. They sucked enough that they're closing the facility in October. Much rejoicing."

So I'm an MS4 applying to a comp residency without a backup. I will likely do an intern year even if I don't match. My question is what are my options after that? I know many of these are looked down upon but I am looking for realistic ways to get to my choice without having to go jobless for &gt;1 year. Scenarios I have imagined (besides taking a year to do research, which I will explain this thought process at the end):

I can reapply for the same specialty (radonc) through ERAS during intern year, but if I don't match... can I also apply to a different residency (imed or rads) and then try to transfer after first year?

Alternatively, can I complete one residency (IMED) then apply for radonc? One thing I've heard that would suck is that once you complete one categorical residency, ACGME no longer will subsidize another spot for you. Is this true? 

Can I just keep an eye out for unexpected openings and try to fill them outside of the match? How does this work if I am applying to match at the same time?

Anyways, the reason I ask is bc I need to have backups if a meaningful research experience does not happen. I've heard not matching once is a red flag and taking a year off and not publishing heavily will only hurt you. I will likely apply to NIH fellowships, etc to avoid this (and doing one would be my first choice of all of these options) but I would like to understand all of the roads to get to where I want to be."

Now for the good stuff, I want to play [Ariel Winter](http://imgur.com/a/XOuWv) in a fairly long-term roleplay scenario. 

Ariel Winter is an actress most famously known for playing the character Alex Dunphy on the TV show Modern Family. Please have at least some idea of who she is or at least the TV show.

--------------------------------------------------

Ariel stood in front of the mirror in her trailer, staring at her herself as she nervously bit her lip.

Suddenly she was yanked out of her thoughts when a production intern yelled loudly from outside her trailer door.

""Miss Winter!""

Ariel turned and looked at her agent sitting on the couch. She wasn't sure what she should do. She was already half an hour late for her scene, but in truth, she just wasn't ready for it yet and was hoping he would buy her some more time.

""She'll be out in a damn minute!"" Gary yelled back to the intern standing outside.

""Just relax honey..."" He said in a softer voice as he put down the script he was reading and stood up from the sofa.

""I'm trying"" She replied softly in an almost whine. Ariel knew that she had become known for her curves, but she never could see what everyone else did. When she looked in the mirror, she was still just a chubby little nerdy girl and hardly the young, vixen the rest of America saw.

""You look great and they're paying us a lot of money for you to shoot this scene."" He continued to reassure her about the upcoming [censored] scene she was about to shoot less than a month and a half after her 18th birthday.

Of course, they weren't paying *them* they were paying *her*, but as her agent, he often used the word *us* to emphasize that her career was not her own.

Her mother had hired him thinking he was just sleazy enough to let her take control of Ariel's career through him, but the first thing he did was take her away from her family, and negotiate for Ariel to star in this movie.

""You're not little Alex Dunphy anymore, honey. We've got to show the world that you're really an *adult* now."""

I am just about the start my fourth and final year of a CS undergraduate degree and have just completed a four month internship. 

The internship was kind of an eye-opener for me as I realized that I am currently not a skilled programmer.. I know almost nothing about best practices, am unfamiliar with most technologies/terms/concepts (even common ones), and anything related to data structures and algorithms flies over my head.

I have coasted through my education so far based on it being quite an easy degree at my school as well as the fact that I do enjoy the creativity/problem solving aspect of programming. Being tasked with solving difficult problems is fun for me, but that can only take me so far. I am willing to learn whatever I need to learn to do my job, but the issue I am facing is that I just don't care to advance my skill or learn new things on my own time. So going into any interviews, I inevitably look technically unimpressive. I have read lots of sample interview questions and know that I have A LOT of work to do to get myself to a place where I could confidently answer them. 

Am I setting myself up to fail in this industry right from the start? Have any of you felt something similar regarding your place in the industry? If so, what happened and where are you now?"

A little back story I am a 22 year old college graduate that has been working in the consulting engineering field for approximately the last eight months.  While I do love my job unfortunately it is in Missouri and Missouri, well its Missouri not much more than that, however a few summers ago I spent all of summer break out in Colorado and completely fell in love with the state for a multitude of reasons.  Thus, I would love to find employment in a state in which I want to live for a vast majority of my life.  I have been applying to job boards like Indeed and other websites like that religiously for the past couple of weeks but haven’t heard anything back yet. So here are my questions:
1.	Can anyone shed some light on the current market for hiring out of state engineers and having them relocate to Colorado?  Basically I’m just curious if any cities in the state or the state as a whole are struggling to find engineers or are the markets so statured with engineers that it’s next to impossible to find a job.
2.	Are there any suggestions in order to make myself look more valuable to engineering companies that they would take a chance hiring an individual from outside the state?  I like to think I have a good resume, 3.13 GPA, worked 30 hours per week in college, vice president of a racing team, registered Engineering Intern in the state of Missouri, trying to get into a distance grad school and currently employed.  But by all means if there anything that somebody would recommend that would be great.
3.	I guess the third and last question builds off number 1 but if anyone has been in successful acquiring a job within the state how long did it take you? 2 months, 3? A year?
Again if anyone has an advice/feedback for my current situation that would be great!"

I decided to ask about my major.

I am a student in Applied Mathematics, I will graduate in 3 years, 2 if I take double credits and spend more time on my last year.

Some people say I should focus on web design but I don't really like it. I sometimes make algorithms of concepts we learn in classes, code them in C#, which is the only language I can safely say that I know it.

**My first question is related to my major and what classes should I choose:**

In the next 3 years, I can choose classes like the following, each choice is divided with a ' / ' so I can only choose one of them.

1. Finite Elements Method / Integral Equations / Tensor Calculus (I am not sure if this class has a high chance to be attended, so little students choose it) / Difference Equations

2. Analytical Mechanics / Special Functions / Data Management And File Structures II / Integral Transformations

2. Introduction to Insurance Mathematics / Operating Systems / Computer Design / Fuzzy Logic

3. Numerical Analysis 2 (Numerical Analysis 1 is one of the classes I made algorithms for) / History of Mathematics / Differential Geometry / Perturbation And Asymptotic Methods / Computer Aided Symbolic Calculus

4. Calculus of Variations / Software Engineering / Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations / Introduction to Error Correcting Codes

5. Matrix Analysis / Simulation Techniques / Mechanics II / Time Series Analysis / Internet Programming With ASP.NET

6. Object Oriented Programming / System Analysis and Design / Dynamics / Project Planning and Management / Biomechanics for Mathematical Engineering

7. Mathematical Modelling of The Engineering Problems / Introduction to Game Theory / Theory of Elasticity / Complex Analysis 2 / Programming with C#

9. Inequalities / Mathematical Structure of Communication Theory / Introduction to Data Mining / Computer Vision

10. Introduction to Functional Analysis / Introduction to Cryptography / Visual Programing / Image Processing / Occupational Terminology

11. Web Programming / Fluid Mechanics for Mathematical Engineering / Philosophy of Mathematics / Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations / Computer Ethics

12. Artificial Intelligence / Computer Based Learning Systems / Data communication and Network / Computer Graphics and Multimedia / MS SQL Database

What are the best classes to choose from and which are more important than other choices?

**Second question is:**

During my free time, what should I learn? I want to improve my programming skills but don't know where to start and what to focus on.

I have a personal project right now, making a C# program that solves a linear equation system.

I will also try to find an internship next year with help of professors.

So what are you suggestions for what classes to choose and what personal skills to focus on?"

I see nothing wrong with that, but she also divulges that very early in potential relationships. As in, she lays the timeline out on the first date. She's also extremely political and a flaming liberal who is passionate and occasionally inflammatory about social issues. When I tell her that things like abortion laws and wedding plans aren't usually considered appropriate conversation topics on a first date she tells me she refuses to ""censor herself"" and she doesn't want somebody who can't ""handle her"" anyway. And if that's how she feels, more power to her, but she meets these guys on Tinder or other apps, so most of them aren't looking for anything serious anyway, then she sends them running for the hills, and every time a guy doesn't call her back she cries to me and messages him repeatedly until he blocks her, followed by more crying. She won't even entertain the idea of changing this strategy, when I bring it up she turns on me and says I'm a shit friend for not consoling her.


I thought we'd be doing this forever, but last year Jenny met ""Tom,"" an engineering student from a few towns over. She wasn't even interested in him in the beginning, but he pursued her and I think that's what ended up winning her over. Tom was better than anyone else Jenny had dated. He was smart and driven, on a good career path, he was loving and respectful toward Jenny and pushed her to better herself. I was impressed, we all were. It finally seemed like Jenny had found someone who could not only handle her, but enjoyed doing so...and then in May, he broke it off. His reasons were valid, he was starting an internship in addition to his degree program and didn't think he would be able to handle all that and his somewhat-long-distance relationship, and he didn't want Jenny to feel neglected.


Well, Jenny called him and cried and screamed and took a bus to his house two hours away and at the end of it all, they stayed together. But the relationship was never the same, Tom had a lot less patience for Jenny after that and Jenny would gripe to me about how everything about him annoyed her. His clothes, his music taste, things that hadn't changed since the relationship began, she suddenly hated. Then Tom paid for a $1,700 surgery for her cat in July and that's where the resentment really started. Every time Jenny would raise an issue, Tom would remind her that kitty wouldn't be alive if not for him. They agreed to ""take a break"" for five days, Jenny lasted two before calling him crying and convincing him to cut the break short.



Finally, last weekend, Jenny texted me that Tom had dumped her once and for all. My first instinct was relief, honestly, until I picked Jenny up for dinner and saw how beside herself she was. She was talking crazy, saying she was going to go to his house and never leave because she knew he still loved her, on and on. I talked her out of that and got her to turn her phone off for the night, I told her she needed to respect his space and his decision and she seemed to agree...and then the next day she told me she had called him and gotten him to agree to a month of no-contact and then they'd revisit things. Her mood was so improved from the night before so I held my tongue, but I was pissed at her for once again bullying this guy into compromising with her.


We spent the day together and she didn't even look at her phone, I started to look on the bright side and thought maybe she could just use this month to become herself again and by the end of it she'd be over Tom (I think this is what Tom was hoping for too) but then that evening we went to see my fiance's band at a bar and everything fell apart. She was crying so the bartender wouldn't serve her, so she started badgering me to leave with her before my fiance's band even started, when I refused she pouted and just stared at Facebook the whole night, including during the band's set. So I was pissed already, and then while I was driving her home she started talking about how she was going to give it a week and then call Tom because she didn't want him to find anybody else and she thought a month was long enough for him to replace her. I tried to be kind as I told her I thought that would be a really terrible idea, that she pushed him away by not respecting his needs and to do that would surely ruin any chance of them reconciling. She started hysterically crying and saying ""It wasn't time, it wasn't time, I know he still loves me"" over and over again, it was a little scary to be honest.


I was at the end of my rope so I dropped her off and begged her not to contact Tom, and I haven't talked to her in a few days. I know I'm a shit friend for not wanting to check up on her, but she's acting so crazy and selfish and she won't see reason, and it's frustrating as hell. She got dumped, it sucks, but it happens. It's understandable for her to be sad and upset but I'm afraid she's going to get in trouble for harassment or even stalking. What am I supposed to do here? I want to wash my hands of it entirely but she's my best friend and I feel like I have to do something so she doesn't ruin her life over this. Help?

Tl;Dr Best friend got dumped, is acting crazy, I'm worried about legal trouble. What do."

A little back story I am a 22 year old college graduate that has been working in the consulting engineering field for approximately the last eight months.  While I do love my job unfortunately it is in Missouri and Missouri, well its Missouri not much more than that, however a few summers ago I spent all of summer break out in Colorado and completely fell in love with the state for a multitude of reasons.  Thus, I would love to find employment in a state in which I want to live for a vast majority of my life.  I have been applying to job boards like Indeed and other websites like that religiously for the past couple of weeks but haven’t heard anything back yet. So here are my questions:

1.	Can anyone shed some light on the current market for hiring out of state engineers and having them relocate to Colorado?  Basically I’m just curious if any cities in the state or the state as a whole are struggling to find engineers or are the markets so statured with engineers that it’s next to impossible to find a job.

2.	Are there any suggestions in order to make myself look more valuable to engineering companies that they would take a chance hiring an individual from outside the state?  I like to think I have a good resume, 3.13 GPA, worked 30 hours per week in college, vice president of a racing team, registered Engineering Intern in the state of Missouri, trying to get into a distance grad school and currently employed.  But by all means if there anything that somebody would recommend that would be great.
3.	I guess the third and last question builds off number 1 but if anyone has been in successful acquiring a job within the state how long did it take you? 2 months, 3? A year?

Again if anyone has an advice/feedback for my current situation that would be great!

It is a lot of hard work, and by all means ""make or break"". Programming can be very intellectually demanding and take years of practice to become even somewhat good at.

I've always had great grades in the past but now I'm worried I'll fail and be doomed to spend the rest of my life doing some terrible idiotic dead-end useless unskilled job or be unemployed and poor. I have friends who have lived in unemployment and poverty and who have worked shit unskilled jobs like cardboard box assembly lines with pressure, so I've heard about it. I also see lots of poor people almost everyday in the city where I live.

I've worked two serious programming jobs (which were summer internships) for big software companies, it's a lot of challenging problem solving, but the people are great and it is implicitly rewarding to improve software. I've worked on fuel economy as well as network security, which are pretty serious/legit areas.

The world at large has a lot of problems like pollution / global warming, overpopulation, poverty and homelessness (as per the above), the whole mess of carbon fuels, the 2008 economical fiasco, civil wars, etc etc etc. It's hard to do anything much about that as an individual, of course."

Dear Lead Developer, 

I'm getting in touch to express my interest in internship and junior positions.

I'm a full stack Developer living in Chicago. After 1 year of teaching myself programming fundamentals I enrolled in a prestigious full stack node.js web development bootcamp, Founders and Coders, in the fall of 2015. The emphasis on the course was strong core skills and learning by making. After graduating I worked on paid freelance projects (example work: Unitie) for small businesses for a few months before gaining some contract work for the Apple website. 

I think what sets me apart is that as someone who has made a career change from Education to the Tech field, you’ll find I’m a self starter with real world experience and maturity that isn’t always common in fresh graduates. 

Please find my resume attached, I'm currently looking for opportunities in Chicago and available immediately. I'm looking forward to hearing from you in due course.

Sincerely,

My name"

A lance of brilliant white light pierces my sensitive eyes and causes me to groan groggily.

""Subject is awake. The tests can now begin.""

I recognize that voice. The voice of an obnoxious intern. An obnoxious intern that accidentally cut my head off with an experimental laser, reducing me to a living severed head.

""KEITH!"" I bellow. ""What the *fuck*, Keith?!""

The young man turns and glowers.

""Shut up, subject!""

""That's Doctor Subject to you!"" I shout back. ""Where the fuck am I?""

Keith picks me up and deposits me into a cage. Through the bars, I see my headless body strapped down to a table like a sacrifice to a dark god. The dark god of science. We never should have meddled with lasers like that.

""You're in the Council's secret laboratory in Nevada."" Keith says. ""And I'm the lucky scientist who gets to study and dissect you.""

""Scientist?"" I sneer. ""Don't make me laugh. I don't care about whatever shitty clandestine organization you're part of, you'll never be more than a snivelling intern that can't remember what I like on my pizza.""

Keith seems to hold himself back from arguing with me. Most sane people would avoid arguing with a severed head, so at least I know he's sane. I'd rather be the prisoner of a sane shitty intern than a deranged shitty intern. Yet despite that small comfort, my heart sinks in the chest that I am no longer connected to when I see Keith reach for a small laser projector. I recognize it as one of the experimental lasers we had used as a base for the project Keith and I worked together on. Very hot and dangerous, and not too precise.

""I'll teach you a lesson for insulting me."" He says, voice dripping with hate as he positions the laser projector over my body's hand. ""Chicken and bacon is a disgusting combination on pizza anyway!""

""You sick fuck..."" I hiss, clenching my eyes shut and waiting to feel the sear of the laser on my flesh. Despite being severed from my body, I feel everything that happens to it. Great for my sex life with my girlfriend Emily, not so great now.

A moment passes. The moment becomes a minute. I open my eyes and see the laser cascading down against my hand, yet it fails to bore through the flesh. I don't even see a single wisp of smoke, nor do I catch the scent of charred flesh. Keith looks confused and he frowns.

""My god..."" He says. ""Your body is *absorbing* the laser!""

""Absorbing?"" I remark, my scientific curiosity once again getting the better of me. ""How can it be-""

My words become a groan as my eyes suddenly begin to burn. Every muscle in my neck and face clench as I scream, and suddenly I hear metal creaking and melting and scientific equipment shattering. The cage is melted open and a long black scorch mark extends from where I sit to the end of the room.

""Your... Your *eyes*!"" Keith gasps in a mixture of awe and horror.

""Oh, *fuck yeah*."" I say when I realize what he means. I've got...

Fucking...

*Laser vision!*

I fixate Keith with a glare and he blanches. The smell of burning flesh fills the room as I slice off his arm with a laser blast. He screams and collapses, shuffling over to a button labeled ""alarm"". He doesn't make it there, I slice off his other arm and he passes out from the pain. Then I turn my gaze on my body, blasting the restraints off it. I laugh madly and fire a few more lasers, obliterating the scientific equipment laying about the room. My laughing ceases when I realize I'm still sitting on a table.

""Fuck."" I say. I whip my head forward like one of those crazed teenagers at a rock concert and I fall off the table, grunting as I hit the floor. I use my chin to drag myself forward, inching towards the table my body is strapped onto. A few quick laser blasts cuts the legs of the table off and causes it to crash down onto the floor. My body falls in a warm fleshy heap on top of me and I find that my dick is pressed against my lips.

""Well, if you insist."" I grumble, tongue darting out to circle along the tip...

*****

""You can't post that! That's fucking stupid!""

I turn away from the screen and stare hard at the whiner.

""And why not?""

""That's totally deus ex machina! You just gave him a superpower? Out of nowhere?""

""Shut the fuck up, it's a story about a fucking severed head and it's deus ex machina day anyway.""

That shuts the whiner the fuck up, and I return to writing my shitty DPP prompt.

The fun part about this setup is it lets you create your character without breaking play, and has all the options you could ever want. So, first comes my original prompt, which also contains the original promotional material.

Short Note: Read from the top down. The lower sections contain information you'll only be interested in if you like the previous stuff. If you would like to make suggestions or ask question before diving all the way in, please do! I understand that you would want to get a handle on this before committing!

Ideally, I would prefer it to be a little slap-happy and comedic if not downright goofy, but that depends entirely on your humor. The Farm can take the form of a lifestyle club, a medical facility, or pretty much anything imaginable. It can be a place for just fun fetish sex, or the Farm can offer treatment to make you into the perfect breeder. It's really your choice.
I don't mind first or third person, but I do prefer to write in paragraph or longer segments. Sorry, but text speak will not be tolerated. Grammatical or spelling errors will be cheerfully tolerated, because no one is a good editor when excited. I am looking for a writing partner, so be prepared to write a paragraph of at least five to seven complex, detailed sentences. Describe what you feel, what you do, and what you think as well as what is going on around you. The more you give me, the more I can give back.
One or two sentence replies a la ""I fucked it."" will not be tolerated. If you're looking for a quick, superficial exchange, then I am not your man. No offense, but I prefer a really good, involved story, preferably with some stupid humor mixed in.

Kinks: Breeding (no shit...), dubious and full consent, bondage, humor, bodywriting, cumplay, and a whole slew of other things made apparent later

Maybes: Futa (it would be interesting to have a subject that can both impregnate and be impregnated), military (maybe we can explore a top-secret genetics project), bestiality (combine the conventional farm with the unconventional, add some science, and I might be convinced to see where it goes.) 

Limits: Non-con (okay, I could be convinced to do a really good non-con plot, but it's gotta be good), bimbo (we want good genetics), violence, blood, toilet play

Hello and Welcome to Preggoridge Farms!

Here at the Farm, we pride ourselves on the quality of the milk and calves our many happy cows produce daily. Our recent efforts at improving the quality of our product earned us a AAAAA rating with the USDA, and won the Wisconsin State Fair blue ribbon for both Quality of Milk and Best In Show in the Hucow competition!

Situated on a few hundred acres of rolling green pastures speckled with idyllic Midwest farmland, Preggoridge Farms is the perfect place to raise hucows. As we like to say, ""The Best Milk Comes From Happy Cows!"" All our cows are kept in comfortable conditions with plenty of leisure time in the field, state of the art milking racks to empty their full teats, and a nice big stud to always keep their wombs full with the next adorable little calf.

If you're wondering if the hucow life is right for you, then sign up a free consultation! Maybe you've been dreaming of the wonders of pregnancy, and just need help pulling the trigger. At the Farm, we'll happily take that decision out of your hands, gently insert it between your legs, and squirt it deep into your belly! You'll get a clean, quality insemination, a night in the stables, and a turn on the milking racks, absolutely free! Then you have the next nine months to make your decision. Just remember, the calf you take home in your belly is not a souvenir, and must be returned to the Farm.

If you've already got a calf on the way, then come on in! You can have a free consultation as well, but you'll be missing out on our high-quality insemination services. However, that means you get an extra turn on the milking racks!

For any industrial inquiries, know that Preggoridge Farms offers many services to our friends in the business. We offer high-quality bulls for insemination, catering services for special milk needs, and rent out our cows for those wishing to experience a night of our wonderful pastoral life! We also offer the wombs of our hucows for contract pregnancies; please call our Reproduction Office for pricing and availability on any deals longer than eighteen months or involving ten or more wombs.
So come on down to the Farm!

*Now accepting serious applicants of any and all credit status. Please halt the use of contraception at least a week before interview. Interview will include insemination for purposes of determining fertility unless already pregnant, and any resulting calves are property of Preggoridge Farms regardless of any contract that applicant may or may not sign after interview.*

-----------

Sitting behind my wide mahogany desk, my corporate email for the Farm's directorship pings a notification that a profile had just come in from our latest recruitment effort. Preggoridge Farms recently got in contact with fertility clinics and private practice doctors to offer our services to an expanded clientele base. Considering our cows can only be impregnated once every twelve months or so, much of our insemination equipment was sitting idle. We decided to offer the equipment to those seeking sperm donors, allowing them to pay for our services and keep the child. We also started a Bring Your Own Sperm program for couples having difficulty conceiving or just looking for a way to liven up their babymaking.

Clicking open the application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Your prospects as a broodmare are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success at the State Fair as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting cows strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a headband with adorable cow ears matching a collar with a little bell, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Farm that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Farm staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box. Inside are forms for entering the information you just so painstakingly wrote down, but you figure you should do this the right way. The contents are odd, but they are all within reason for a company attempting to isolate strings of beneficial human DNA. Even if they do get awfully personal with fertility, hey, people have to reproduce, right?

Reading the form, it is as follows:

*Dear Applicant,*

*Thank you for your inquiry about services with our Collegiate Office! We are very excited to hear about your interest in continuing your degree, and the Farm would love to support your ambitions for self-improvement! All we need is some basic information to finish your application, and we can get you on your way!*

(Or insert some other office to which you are replying. Hell, maybe you got this by accident and are contacting Customer Services, which totally isn't what you think it is. Get it? Services? HAHAHAHAHA... ah, fuck me...)

DEPARTMENT APPLIED TO: (enter the project to which you applied. Feel free to make something up if it's extra sexy to you! Hell, we could make a Reproductive Pleasure department, if that's what you want.)

PROJECT APPLIED TO: (Get very, very creative with this. The more thought you put into this, the better the roleplay.)

REASON APPLIED: (Get creative! The more you write, the more I can incorporate down the road!)

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE:

NAME:

AGE:

SEXUALITY:

EYE/HAIR COLOR:

HEIGHT/WEIGHT:

MEASUREMENTS:

UNIQUE PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES: (Feel free to add interesting physical quirks that might make yourself more attractive to a genetics project!)

PREGNANCY STATUS: *If ""Yes,"" please fill out attached Father Verification Form. If ""No,"" please have fertility status verified by a certified doctor or with the included approved instrument.*
FERTILITY STATUS: *Percentage displayed on the instrument will be most accurate during or immediately following an orgasm. The instrument can accommodate this necessity.*

CURRENT MEDICATION: *Please include any and all medication, including birth control.*

RECENT SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS: (Get creative!)

JOB EXPERIENCE: (Again, creativity will be rewarded!)

CURRENT AREA OF STUDY: *Please include any majors, minors, concentrations, and advanced degrees.*

INTERESTS: *Let the Farm know about who you are as a person! We would really like to get to know you, and anything you want to tell us will help make your experience with us more comfortable and enjoyable!*

OTHER INFORMATION: *If there's anything else you think the Farm should know, please use the provided space.*

HAPPY COWS PHOTO CONTEST: *As a special promotional offer, the Farm is running a photo contest! This contest is open to the general public, regardless of application intent or status, so get your friends involved! Put on the headband and collar, get creative with the temporary tattoos, and snap a pic while testing your fertility! Please make sure the display of the instrument is visible in the picture.*

*Prizes will be distributed for Sexiest Pic, Most Fertile, Best Preggo, Most Creative, Best ""In Progress"" Pic, and Freshest New Mother. These prizes consist of $1000 dollars cash and a guided tour of the Preggoridge Farms facilities.*

*A Grand Prize will be given out for Best In Show, an honor reserved for the sexiest, most fertile, most creative, and above all most breedable future cow that sends in a picture! This Grand Prize consists of $10,000 dollars cash, complete college tuition, a private jet and limousine to and from the Farm, a private behind-the-scenes tour of the Farm facilities, and a private interview with the Director himself! Grand Prize Winners will also be invited to stay the night in one of our luxury suites!*

*Prizes must be accepted in full; individual components may not be turned down at the discretion of the contestant winner. Participation in the tour is not required for the cash prize. Every prize is available to the general public; application not required.* (I'm not asking for a real picture. Just tell me about how you made the picture, if you are interested. I'm just trying to get a grip on what you like. Feel free to add a real picture of some sexy little future cow, but tell me how you made it! That's how I judge whether or not we'll click!)

Okay, if you haven't noticed, I write a lot. I love detail. Simile, metaphor, hyperbole, chiasmata... These things are all my friends. I do not expect you to be able to fully match the way I write. Humble brag, but I hold awards for my SFW writing. If you can match or exceed me... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! If you want me to help you improve your writing while having some sexy fun... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! Just please, please make the effort!

So, in regards to how I want you to start, fill out the form and send it in. I will judge our compatibility based on the scene you write about flipping through the promotional materials and reacting to their contents.

Maybe you really like the technical documents displaying women becoming mothers from the machines whirring between their legs. Maybe the pictures from Live Audition with new, young cows caught the moment they feel their first child squirting into their wombs. Maybe you really like the diagrams of the combination breeding/milking racks, showing warm white fluid entering a woman between her legs and leaving from her chest. I don't know, so you gotta tell me. Dig through that recruitment package and find the things that make you excited! There's a reason we send out these packages!

For example, maybe you were watching ""Sixteen and Pregnant"" when the recruitment package arrived. Firing up the probe, you affix a ""For Hire"" sticker over your lower stomach and a ""Wide Loads Welcome"" to your inner thigh. Bending your back over your couch, you arch your breasts into the air, displaying the flat stomach you were applying, no begging, to have ruined. The bright stickers flash as the probe burrows into your folds. You writhe, imagining the warm metal spewing the thick, life-giving fluid into you that you could never convince a man to give up. It feels almost as good as you imagine it will when you win the Grand Prize, placed on a pedestal upon which motherhood will be pumped into you. Your walls clamp down hard as an orgasm rocks your body. The probe lights up, displaying a disturbingly high percentage, your womb sucking eagerly at the tip of the probe. That's when the camera clicks, catching your body in its full, hungry glory. Looks like we got ourselves a winner... (This was an example. Write your own!)

I wrote that part in because it's so much easier to bring someone in as the Grand Prize winner, and also a lot more fun. It lets me be excited to meet you, and not just ""Oh, boy... Another womb..."" So, give it a shot? The form is meant to be an exposition of what you want from the roleplay, and that part was good, but you gotta give me more to work with if you want the really good stuff.

50iwv5,0,2016-08-31,26F and recently eloped--why does everyone have to be so critical?,spherical_symmetrics,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/50iwv5/26f_and_recently_elopedwhy_does_everyone_have_to/,"I met him when I moved to the East Coast from the Midwest for a summer internship.  Before I moved out to the East Coast, figuring that I would probably be one of the youngest employees at my place of work, I decided to start meeting people online.  So I moved out here and had been asked out after talking to a guy for a month or so online, but he stood me up because he “needed to pack” to go to a neighboring state.  I had talked with my husband a few times online, but not much.  However, right after I got stood up, my husband messaged me a simple, “Do you like boating?”  To which I replied, “Yes.”  We met up the next day for him to show me around a town a little bit.  I had already friend zoned him before I even met him.
On our “first date” we walked around town for a bit, then got some light supper at a little whole in the wall place.  The waiter/owner made a comment about my hubby hoping to marry me.  He turned bright red; I quickly changed the subject.  Then my guy paid for dinner, but I thought he was just trying to be nice since I hadn’t had a paycheck in so long.
He took me back to my place and I gave him a hug and went inside to bed.  I was confused that night when I found myself fantasizing about him, but didn’t think too much about it since I was starting my internship the next day.
Well, within in a week we found ourselves falling for each other.  He started spending the night with me, no sex at first—and we haven’t spent a night apart since.  After three weeks, we moved in together.  After 11 weeks, we eloped in a small ceremony.
We’ve both dated before, but never lived with someone or been married before.  He’s 25, and I’m 26.  We have fought a few times—it hasn’t all been happy.  But, I knew I wanted to marry him. And he knew he wanted to marry me.  So, we didn’t wait.  We started talking about it like 3 weeks in, and at less than three months it was time.  Our ceremony was beautiful and everything we wanted.  And, he completely surprised me with a beautiful ring that I’m just so proud of.
All my life I’ve heard that you “just know” when he’s the one.  And that’s what happened with us.  We just knew.  We have a strong healthy relationship that is encouraging to both of us.
We haven’t told very many people yet, for a few reasons.  One is that we do someday, when we are both done with school, have a formal ceremony and honeymoon.  We don’t want people to not take that ceremony seriously because we are already married.  Another reason is that not everyone we have told so far has reacted happily to it.  We’ve gotten lectures and criticism that we got married so soon.  Everyone thinks I’m pregnant (I knew I wasn’t, but further proof is I started my period today).
So far, in my family, my aunt and uncle and my grandma know.  They were all thrilled.  I haven’t been able to tell my dad since he’s barely talking to me about being so pissed at me that I’m permanently moving to the East Coast.
While we have no regrets, I’ve definitely broken down a couple of times.  I understand that people don’t understand or don’t agree with us getting married so soon, but please just keep those words to yourself and just be happy for us.  It’s our special event.  So, I’ve started not really telling people.  At work I only mention it if someone figures it out, by my name change or my ring or whatever.

Anyway, just wanted to talk about this.  I love my new husband, and I have no doubts in our future.  He’s my soulmate, as I am his.

I'm one of the early employees in a C-Level business role at a college startup (I'm a sophomore). We're seed funded 85k, we sell software, and our end game is to be bought out. Based on my equity level, if we get bought it's not going to be a situation where I can just chill in the Bahamas; I will have to find another job.

Our founder has a lot of great connections in our space who he's introduced me to, I've met our investors, I've met other companies in our space, we've been featured in some decent press, and I think it would be cool to be one of the initial employees for a startup that gets bought out by somebody.

However I don't really know much about job opportunities post college. I was thinking Finance/Consulting (I'm a Business + CS major but I'm more Business oriented), but aren't those kids usually heavily involved in finding Finance/Consulting internships while in undergrad? I'm planning on staying with the startup up through my junior year (maybe find a new internship/job for post junior year summer), but I'm thinking if I do that I'll be behind all the kids who have already been doing Finance/Consulting internships.

How about VC Associate or Product Manager?

Any suggestions on opportunities to take advantage of while working for this startup, or any other jobs for me to check out?

Sorry if my questions are kind of vague but I would appreciate any kind of advice. I like working for the startup but at the same time I see some of my peers interning at JP Morgan in the summer and I'm just hoping this startup pans out (which I think it will) so that I can eventually get a 'real' high paying job after college.

Thanks everyone."

  For the last three months I have had a data science internship where most of my work was programming related. Towards the end of the internship I was starting to get miserable due  the work load seeming too difficult (I was a business student, so self teaching on the go). However, I was offered a full time position, but I am back at the same place where I started with things seem a bit too over my head...mainly the programming. I'm not a good coder, and I also don't really have an interest in coding...however the field( analyzing data) does genuinely drive my curiosity, so was wondering if data analytics may be a more appropriate first step where I would start to understand the processes of data analyzation  and focus less on coding. Any advice? Thanks!"

For the past year, I've been applying for job opportunities throughout Canada but haven't had much luck.

I have done internships in marketing analytics positions during my undergraduate studies so I don't have much practical accounting experience other than through extra-curricular activities, which I try to highlight in my interviews. This was due to my prior interest in marketing before switching over to study accounting full-time, however, recruiters tend to dwell on this experience all the time.

I know there are quite a few posts similar to mine and I've been applying those advice to my job search. I have gone through recruiting agencies, applied directly to companies, and even cold-emailing several small accounting firms. I'm not sure what else I can do to aid my job search.

I know that pitying myself is the worst thing I can do at the moment so I'm really trying to keep my head up and do my best. I am wondering if there is any tips or advice any of you can give to me.

Thank you very much!"

I will tell you. The filth of the alien and the witch must be exterminated to preserve the purity of the Human race, lest we degenerate into abomination.
-Witch Hunter Tyrus at the Conclave of Vera

You have all long since been initiated into the Warband of your Inquisitor, of your master. But you've been brought along as newbies and interns. Up till now, your work has mostly subsided of grunt work. But that's all about to change. As you venture into your ship, you're told by your master that you'll be leading the expeditions and investigations to come. With the ship's engines coming online, you brace yourself as you head off to the very edge of galaxy to confront the enemy without number.

This'll be your first chance to really take charge of an expedition, and not even your master seems to know much. You ride along with a Rogue Trader, who's visiting these parts and has a small fleet suitable to both his needs and that of your masters. This is the chance you've waited for, this is why you joined the Ordo Xenos after all.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a small disclaimer. While I'm a fan of the Warhammer 40k universe. I'm no master of the fluff, or even the crunch of Dark Heresy 2e (I'm more a fan of Black Crusade personally). So, I'm not going to hold anyone to any super high standard. I will however ask that everyone have a basic understanding of the lore and the world, and the game. I will also admit, that I do disagree with the fluff sometimes, and might/will ignore it and override it with my own, if those bits do come up. Don't ask me to make your character sheet for you, that's your job. You can ask for help, but pull your weight. 

That aside... hmmm... Yes. This is a Dark Heresy 2e game, set to the backdrop of the Ordo Xenos. Fairly standard stuff. I like my combat, I like my rolling, but I also like a bit of investigation. Though I will admit being a bit new to the last bit. There might be a decent bit of RP. But I am running a tabletop game, not an RP game. So dice rolling is to be expected. I also like a bit of humor, though I am going to try and go for a bit of a horror flavor to this. That and the usual bits that are expected with it. Even if I'm no master at 40k lore, I do appreciate what this game is going for.

Hmmm. The game itself might evolve later on to something grander. I would like for the game to later evolve into more of a... Rogue Traderesque game. Where the players have a ship, and can do whatever. They could still be Ordo Xenos, but there'd be more freedom. Heck. There might even be some ship combat, if I could transplant and burrow the ship combat rules from Rogue Trader. But, that's in the air and that's for later. For now? This.

50jvc1,3,2016-08-31,Looking for some advice: Life to non-life entry (UK),chee98,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/50jvc1/looking_for_some_advice_life_to_nonlife_entry_uk/,"Hi guys, I'm just looking for some advice on my current situation.

Last week I completed an internship with a life insurance firm. Shortly after the internship I was offered a 6-month contracting role basically doing the same thing (pricing insurance products and some capital modelling). Originally, I wanted to go onto their graduate scheme as there is study support etc but there were no places left so they offered me this role which pays a lot better as it's a contracting role, and well keeps me employed with the firm. 

I really enjoy the work that I've done with the firm but I'm worrying about a few things:

- I eventually would like to go into non-life type work. I just think it looks a lot more interesting and is more technical

- I'm from London and I would like to move back there in the long run. This particular firm has no office in London

Now I'm in a dilemma because this firm I truly believe would like ot put me on their graduate scheme. I'm not sure if/when they offer me it if I should take it and how this will limit my chances in working in non-life type roles. Now, I have a few questions:

1) If I were to accept the graduate scheme if/when offered, and worked there for a year or so - how would the transfer to non-life be?

2) I am considering working for these 6 months and using the money for a masters I've always wanted to do. It is still an academic masters (Comp Sci at Cambridge/Oxford/Imperial/UCL) but I am not sure if it is more beneficial to take more work experience rather than a masters. Any advice on this plan? I would apply for non-life grad roles during this masters

3) Do you think I should apply for graduate programmes whilst doing this 6month contract also? I just think it would be hard to go down for interviews as the location of this place is around a 4 hour train ride to London - Does anyone have experience with this at all? Ideally if I land a non-life grad scheme I would probably accept that over most but I don't know how I would be able to make the interview work whilst working 4 hours from London. I do have a place ot stay in London which makes it easier, but again I have no experience.

If anyone has any advice to shed on this situation, or if anyone could answer any of my questions. Thanks and I appreciate any advice.

50k7mu,11,2016-08-31,Think I screwed up by accepting a job offer. Any advice appreciated.,greenleaf99,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/50k7mu/think_i_screwed_up_by_accepting_a_job_offer_any/,"I did an internship with a mid-sized regional firm in my city and got a full-time job offer. I accepted it. 

However, I have wanted to go Big 4 very early on. I just couldn't get an internship. This year, I want to try applying for full-time positions at Big 4 to see if I have better luck. The ones I am applying for will be out of state. 

But I don't want the regional firm to find out because I fear they might take back the full-time offer and I will be left with nothing. 

I think I have a better chance at Big 4 this year because my GPA is 3.70. Whereas last year, I just started the MACC program and was taking pre-requisite classes (I am not an accounting undergrad) with a 3.5 GPA.

My school told me not to rescind offers because if we do, we will be barred from using the school's career website. Also they highly discouraged us from accepting more interviews through their career website after we accept.

I understand what I want to do is not the greatest but, last year, I chose an audit internship without taking any tax or audit classes. Well, I took a tax class and found it incredibly interesting. I also love learning about law (business law is one of my favorite classes). While, I am still not 100% certain that tax is my calling. I find that because of my introverted personality, tax might be a better fit. I get very nervous when having to interact with clients.

If I apply through a Big 4 website, will my school find out? I am asking because you are asked to select your school at the very beginning of the application. Will the recruiter contact my school and will the interview be on campus?

Also, should I just not apply and keep the offer I originally got? I honestly feel like I made a mistake by accepting the offer.

I'd appreciate any advice or opinion on this matter.
